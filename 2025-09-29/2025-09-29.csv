            Before a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular disease hit, there are almost always warning signs, according to a new study.
    


            Those warning signs are well-known cardiovascular disease risk factors, but more can still be done to reduce cases of heart disease, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
    


            For this study, researchers analyzed data from two groups: more than 600,000 cases of cardiovascular disease in South Korea and another 1,000 cases in the United States.

            Researchers analyzed what percentage of those cases were preceded by traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including blood pressure levels, blood sugar, cholesterol and smoking.
    


            In more than 99% of cases of cardiovascular disease, heart failure or stroke, the patient had at least one of the risk factors before the incident occurred, according to the data.
    


            “Even ‘mild' elevations of these 4 factors should be addressed with lifestyle treatments or medications,” said Dr. Philip Greenland, one of the study's lead authors, in an email. He is also a professor of preventive medicine and the Harry W. Dingman Professor of Cardiology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
    


            The new study is particularly important because it reinforces that doctors and patients can manage the risk factors for almost all cases of heart disease, said Dr. Susan Cheng, professor and vice chair of research affairs in the department of cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was not involved in the research.
    


            Some research has suggested that a growing number of cardiovascular disease cases have no traditional indicators of risk beforehand. That could imply that although the health care profession has addressed the factors you can control, other elements researchers don't yet understand could be a factor, and so they don't have good prevention strategies to offer, Cheng added.
    


            What differentiates this research, she said, is that scientists did not rely solely on a diagnosis of diabetes or high blood pressure to determine if the risk factors were present –– they looked at the patients' medical data.
    


Making these lifestyle changes reduces chronic disease, even if you have a genetic risk



            Sometimes, just because someone isn't labeled as having high blood pressure or high blood sugar doesn't mean their levels don't indicate risk factors. And by looking at the broader scope of medical data, these researchers found that almost all the cases did have traditional, modifiable risks in their chart before developing cardiovascular disease, Cheng said.
    


            So, if clinicians and patients want to mitigate heart disease risk, the best course of action is likely to continue encouraging management of risk factors like blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, she said.
    


            The medical field has learned a lot about heart disease in the past century, and the common knowledge on how to prevent it has been consistent for many years, said Dr. Karen Joynt Maddox, professor of medicine in cardiology at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, Missouri. She was not involved in the research.
    


            But still, implementing those changes continues to prove difficult. Part of the problem is often the abstract nature of heart disease risk, Joynt Maddox said.
    


Some added sugar sources are worse than others for disease risk, study suggests



            When a patient has a disease, it is easier to motivate making changes and implementing treatments to address what they are dealing with, she said. But it is harder to effectively communicate the importance of taking steps to address the very real risks a person faces for a disease down the line.
    


            Another roadblock is that adding medications or other protocols to address heart disease risk can be associated with the aging process, which can feel scary and unappealing to some patients, said Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was not involved in the research.
    


            Instead, he thinks of it as steps toward longevity. Managing blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol doesn't mean you are losing things — it means you are taking steps to preserve your lifespan and health span, creating more years for yourself to feel young and do the things that have meaning for you, he said.
    


            While the risk factors for cardiovascular disease have remained consistent, the technology for managing them has evolved.
    


            Managing high blood pressure is often a good place to start, and just getting a blood pressure cuff means you can get a sense of your levels at home, Joynt Maddox said. Then, work with your doctor to keep an eye on your risk factors and make a plan for management.
    


            In addition to the clinical risk factors studied in the research, it is also important to improve your lifestyle risk factors, Tawakol said.
    


            Maintaining good sleep, exercise, nutrition, a healthy weight and low levels of stress are key to lowering cardiovascular disease risk, he said.
    


            “For example, stress and depression turn out to be as potent risk factors as smoking and diabetes,” Tawakol said.
    


            “I'm hoping that the more we double down and show the efficacy of treating all these things together, that more people will combine these approaches and actually enjoy much longer health spans.”

Live Updates


            • Netanyahu meeting: President Donald Trump is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While at the White House, Netanyahu apologized to Qatar over the Doha strike, according to an Israeli source.
    


            • Possible peace plan: Trump has been optimistic about reaching a resolution in the Middle East as he works to secure a Gaza peace plan. But Netanyahu is expected to present reservations and push for changes to the plan, three Israeli officials said.
    


            • Shutdown deadline looms: Meanwhile, the federal government is less than 48 hours away from shutting down. Congress has until midnight tomorrow to approve a federal spending bill. Would a federal government shutdown affect you? Tell us about it.



            The September jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, could be delayed if the federal government shuts down.
    


            The Bureau of Labor Statistics' operations will largely go dark if funding is interrupted, according to contingency plans the Department of Labor outlined on Monday.
    


                    “BLS will suspend all operations. Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released. All active data collection activities for BLS surveys will cease,” according to the Labor Department.
                





            The Labor Department's plans indicate that only one BLS employee — interim commissioner William Wiatrowski — of the 2,055 will be working full-time during the lapse.
    


            If the jobs report is delayed, it could leave many businesses, economists, investors and policymakers flying blind at a critical moment in the US economy.
    


            Recent labor market data has shown that the jobs market is weaker than expected. The September report was expected to provide crucial context as to the stability of the foundation that underlies the US economy.
    


            However, jobless benefits would continue to be paid as long as state unemployment agencies have enough administrative funding to operate, the Labor Department's plan said.
    


            Overall, the agency expects to only retain about 3,150 employees out of its roughly 13,000 staffers. It would continue dealing with imminent threats to human life, child labor investigations and disaster Dislocated Worker grant applications, as well as investigations into mines and high-hazard industries.
    


            Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would not say if a Republican commitment to negotiate on an extension for enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies before the end of the year would be enough for him to vote for the House-passed stopgap funding bill.
    


            Schumer responded to multiple questions with: “We're ready to get to work, it's about time.”
    


            Asked what he said to Senate Republican Leader John Thune to get this afternoon's meeting with President Donald Trump on the books, Schumer replied, “I said just that: got to get to work. You can't, can't get anything done without a bipartisan negotiation, and we've been pushing and pushing and they finally felt the heat and agreed.”
    


            House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN's Manu Raju earlier today that a promise of talks would not be enough because party leaders don't trust Republicans to keep their word.
    


            “Enough with the games that Republicans have been playing connected to the health care of the American people,” Jeffries said, adding, “No one can trust their word on health care. Are you kidding me?”
    


For context: Enough Senate Democrats would need to be satisfied with a commitment to negotiations to give Republicans the needed support to pass the stopgap funding bill Tuesday and avert a shutdown. Last March, Schumer faced an enormous amount of political heat from the Democratic base for agreeing to a House-passed bill, despite Jeffries' opposition. Jeffries has said this time he trusts Schumer to stick with him.
    


            More than half of State Department direct-hire employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to a guidance document from the agency obtained by CNN.
    


            Out of nearly 27,000 total direct hire employees, roughly 10,000 employees occupy “excepted” positions, the document said.
    


            “'Excepted' or ‘non-excepted' status depends exclusively on the duties of the position,” the document said, and even if an office has available money to continue its work, “only excepted employees will continue working.”
    


            It is unclear if any of the roughly 17,000 people expected to be furloughed will then be laid off. The White House budget office instructed agencies to make plans for mass firings in the event of a government shutdown. The State Department undertook a sweeping reorganization, with more than 1,300 people fired, earlier this year.
    


            “Excepted” activities “include those necessary to respond to emergencies involving ‘the safety of human life or the protection of property,' and those necessary for activities essential to national security, including the conduct of foreign affairs essential to national security,” the document said. Other activities must be approved by senior officials.
    


            “Consular operations domestically and abroad will remain operational” in order to issue passports and visas and assist US citizens abroad, the guidance document said.
    


            Public speeches will generally be canceled, and public messaging will be limited, though there will be some exceptions, according to the guidance. The State Department estimates it will take half a day to complete shutdown activities.
    


            Asked about their shutdown plans, a State Department spokesperson said, “In case Congressional Democrats decide to shut down the government, the State Department is undergoing all necessary planning efforts to sustain critical missions.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Qatar over the Doha strike while at the White House, according to an Israeli source.
    


            Separately, a person familiar also confirmed Netanyahu apologized to the Qatari prime minister in a phone call from the White House.
    


            Netanyahu did not say he was sorry for targeting Hamas, the Israeli source said, but he did apologize to the prime minister for violating Qatar's sovereignty in carrying out the strike. In an interview on Sunday, Netanyahu said, “Our goal was Hamas. Not anything beyond it. I think we can work out an understanding on this.”
    


            The Israeli source said the apology was part of a deal so that Qatar would put pressure on Hamas to accept the Trump administration's 21-point proposal to end the war.
    


            The phone call was first reported by Axios.
    


            Netanyahu also apologized for harming a civilian. The strike killed a Qatari security guard who was in the building that was targeted.
    


            The leaders of Israel and Qatar have never been publicly reported to have formally met or spoken directly until Monday. However, secret and indirect contacts and diplomatic interactions have occurred for years.
    


            The phone call happened while Netanyahu was at the White House for a meeting with US President Donald Trump over the US-backed 21-point plan. Qatar is a critical mediator in ceasefire talks, able to communicate with Hamas, Israel and the US.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson implored his Republican members on a private call this morning to stay unified in their position as the government barrels towards a shutdown and said he does not plan to bring the House back this week, two sources on the call told CNN.
    


            Johnson called on Republican lawmakers not to hold political events this week even though many will remain in their districts with the House not in session, the sources added. The speaker suggested he would bring the House back next week.
    


            The marching orders from Johnson to the House GOP conference comes just hours before the top four congressional leaders will meet with President Donald Trump at the White House to see if there is an eleventh-hour off ramp before the government runs out of funding Tuesday night.
    


            Providing a window into how GOP leaders are attempting to shape the party's talking points ahead of a possible shutdown, the sources said House GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain walked members through internal polling to help them frame their arguments and stay on a unified message.
    


            McClain advised members to focus on the economic impacts of a shutdown — arguing that messaging around the uncertainty and stress it could cause to markets is where Republicans have the upper hand and a winning message — over discussing health care, which has been a red line for Democrats, the sources added.
    


            Johnson also indicated that congressional GOP leaders are planning to hold a joint news conference Wednesday, which would mark the first day of a shutdown, the sources told CNN.
    


This post has been updated with additional reporting.



            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democrats aren't willing to trust that Republicans will be willing to negotiate on enhanced Affordable Care Act tax subsidies, digging in on the red line ahead of a meeting with President Donald Trump as the country barrels toward a government shutdown.
    


            Asked if Democrats would back a seven-week funding bill if Republicans say they will negotiate an extension of the ACA subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of the year, Jeffries pointed to a Democratic-led government funding proposal that included a permanent extension of them.
    


            The Senate failed to pass that package, as well as the House-passed GOP funding bill, on Friday, leaving lawmakers at a stalemate ahead of a September 30 deadline.
    


            “Enough with the games that Republicans have been playing connected to the health care of the American people,” Jeffries said, adding, “No one can trust their word on health care. Are you kidding me?”
    


            The top House Democrat brought up previous GOP efforts to repeal the ACA, telling reporters, “On behalf of the American people, were supposed to simply take their word that they're willing to negotiate. The American people know that would be an unreasonable thing for us.”
    


            Responding to Trump's assertion that it's up to Democrats whether the government shuts down, Jeffries said, “We've said from the beginning that we're willing to find a bipartisan path forward.”
    


            Jeffries accused Republicans of trying to “misrepresent” the Democratic position, and he emphasized it's already illegal for undocumented immigrants to receive federal health care benefits – as the GOP has suggested Democrats want.
    


            “Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law. The question for the president is whether he's interested in protecting the health care of the American people,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump spoke  with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, earlier today, ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House.
    


            A Qatari adviser also visited the White House ahead of a crucial meeting between  Trump and  Netanyahu, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Qatar has been playing a critical role in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza, though those efforts were dealt a blow after Israel carried out an attack targeting Hamas leadership in Qatar.
    


            The White House's hosting of the Qatari adviser could be an important step in trying to push forward the Trump administration's 21-point plan to end the war in Gaza as it nears the two-year mark. It may serve as an attempt to ensure that the administration maintains pressure on Netanyahu to agree to a deal to end the war.
    


            The White House has signaled optimism, though, that a deal can be reached.
    


            President Donald Trump, greeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, said he's “very confident” peace could be achieved in Gaza quickly.
    


            Trump made the remark after shaking Netanyahu's hand at the West Wing portico. The two men are set to meet in the Oval Office this morning before convening a joint press conference.
    


            Both flashed a thumbs up before entering the White House.
    


            As Trump voiced confidence in striking an agreement that would end the war in Gaza and secure the release of remaining hostages, Netanyahu stood by smiling.
    


            He didn't respond when asked if he was on board.
    


             Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived at the White House and was greeted by President Donald Trump.
    


            This marks Netanyahu's fourth visit to the White House since the beginning of Trump's second term.
    


            The two leaders are expected to discuss as Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.
    


            As we await Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's arrival at the White House for his meeting with President Donald Trump, let's take a look at what's coming up today.
    


            Trump and Netanyahu are expected to hold a bilateral meeting to discuss a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, as we've reported.



            After that, Trump and Netanyahu will have a bilateral lunch at noon ET before they hold a joint-press conference, due for 1:15 p.m. ET.
    


            Then, at 3:00 p.m. ET, Trump will host a closed-door  bipartisan bicameral leadership meeting inside the Oval Office as a federal government shutdown looms.
    


            At 5:30 p.m. ET the president will host a Gold Star Families Reception.
    


            Stay with us here for full coverage and the latest updates.
    


            We've been reporting on some departments' plans if the federal government was to shut down on Wednesday.
    


            The US Department of Health and Human Services said its capacity to protect public safety would be greatly affected, even though it could continue some activities that ensure public health, according to its updated contingency plan.
    


The US Food and Drug Administration's ability to provide public health oversight would be harmed. “In the event of a lapse in appropriations, FDA's ability to protect and promote public health and safety would be significantly impacted, with many activities delayed or paused,” the plan said.
    


            It would not be able to accept new drug applications or support staff that monitor the quality of compounded drugs unless an imminent safety threat is posed, for instance. The agency would be limited in the inspections it could conduct. Longer-term food safety initiatives would be halted, and regulatory testing of medical products would be limited.
    


            However, the FDA would maintain core functions to respond to emergencies.
    


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue monitoring for disease outbreaks, but the agency's communications to the public about health-related information would be “hampered,” the plan said.
    


            In addition, HHS would retain staff to support Medicare, Medicaid and other mandatory health program payments. However, it would only be able to focus on investigating the most serious incidents of patient harm at health care facilities.
    


            The agency would also halt other non-essential activities, including oversight of certain research contracts and grants, processing public inquiries and collecting and analyzing data.
    


            Overall, the agency would retain roughly 47,250 staffers, while furloughing about 32,450 employees. During shutdowns, federal departments designate essential employees to continue working, though they may not be paid until the impasse ends.
    


            The updated contingency plan also shows how deeply HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cut into the agency's staffing as part of the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal government.
    


            Some departments have posted updated plans explaining how they'll function if the government shuts down on Wednesday.
    


Defense Department: Nearly 224,000 of the more than 741,000 civilian employees will be retained to protect life and property, along with nearly 2.1 million military personnel, according to the contingency plan.
    


            The plan notes that travel and participation in conferences supporting military operations against al-Qaeda and countering the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other terrorist groups can continue. But planned visits by foreign dignitaries should be canceled unless they support essential national security operations or the president's conduct of foreign relations.
    


Homeland Security: Only 14,000 employees out of the nearly 272,000 workers at the agency will be furloughed if funding lapses.
    


            Most employees in Customs and Border Patrol will be retained, as well those who work for Immigration and Customers Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service, Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    


            DHS said it will continue immigration and drug-related enforcement, passenger processing and cargo inspection at ports of entry, the US Secret Service, counter-terrorism watches, the Disaster Relief Fund and fee-funded programs.
    


Education Department: Only a few employees would continue working if the federal government shuts down, according to the agency's contingency plan.
    


            Nearly 1,500 of the department's 1,700 workers would be furloughed, along with nearly 650 of its 750 staffers in the Office of Federal Student Aid, according to the plan. Most of the workers deemed essential would be retained to perform duties deemed necessary by law.
    


            The agency would continue to dole out Pell Grants and federal student loans and would keep making Title I and IDEA grant funding available. States, schools and others could still access the billions of dollars in awards the department made over the summer.
    


            Employees working on activities related to provisions in the Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act would remain on the job.
    


            We reported earlier on what Israeli officials say are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reservations about the White House's 21-point Gaza ceasefire and post-war governance plan.
    


            A key member of the Israeli government has today also put forward strict conditions for a deal to end the war ahead of the White House meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump.
    


            Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared he adamantly opposes any involvement of the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza as well as any mention of future statehood for the Palestinians in a deal to end the war.
    


            Smotrich laid out a series of “non-negotiable” demands for the post-war Gaza plan in a lengthy post on X.
    


                    “There will be no involvement of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Gaza, neither today nor in the future, neither explicitly nor implicitly,” Smotrich wrote. “There will be no mention, even implicitly, of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel's existence. The idea of a Palestinian state must be taken off the table permanently.”
                





            Smotrich also outlined his party's “red lines,” which include strong opposition to some of the reported components of the Trump administration's post Gaza war plan.
    


            Among other demands, Smotrich called for a complete expulsion of Hamas' leadership from Gaza and its full demilitarization. He also insisted on maintaining permanent Israeli military control over the territory's perimeter and opposes withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor, an Israeli buffer zone on the Gaza-Egypt border.
    


            Beyond his objection to the PA's involvement, Smotrich also demanded there be “no involvement of Qatar in Gaza.” He also said Gaza residents who wish to leave the strip would be allowed to do so through Egypt. Egypt has warned that no displacement of Palestinians should take place, particularly through its territory.
    


            When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Donald Trump at the White House today, they will discuss a Middle East that has undergone radical change.
    


            The US president says a deal to end the war in Gaza is likely. But what's on offer is politically problematic for Netanyahu – and much as the region has transformed, so has Netanyahu. His drastic change in approach makes it all the more difficult to predict what comes next.
    


            For years, Netanyahu's approach to warfare was characterized by brief and contained conflicts, especially in Gaza. Operation Pillar of Defense, in 2012, for example, lasted just eight days. The current Gaza war will mark two years next month, the longest in Israel's history.
    


            When he returned to power in 2009, Netanyahu declared that one of his goals would be eliminating Hamas. In practice, despite his rhetoric, Israel's longest serving prime minister's security policy was widely seen as cautious and relatively restrained, even derided as cowardly by political rivals, who also mocked his inability to make decisive moves. His years of big talk turned into small decisions.
    


            Then came October 7.
    


            Two days after the Hamas-led attack left more than 1,200 Israelis dead, Netanyahu promised Israelis “we are going to change the Middle East.” This time, he meant it.
    


            For two years, Israeli jets and special forces have undertaken daring missions, striking targets once thought untouchable, with regional capitals from Doha to Tehran and Damascus bearing the scars of Netanyahu's pledge to reshape the Middle East after the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel.
    


Read the full analysis of Netanyahu's shifting leadership.



            We've been hearing from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt this morning on the prospect of a hostage and ceasefire deal being reached between Israel and Hamas.
    


            President Donald Trump is preparing to meet today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            The two leaders are set to hold a joint press conference after they meet, the strongest signal that they hope to be able to announce something substantial.
    


                    “The president knows and believes that this is as good of a plan as these sides are going to see, and that's why it's 21 points. It's very detailed. It's comprehensive. The president has been working tirelessly on this,” Leavitt told CNN.
                





            “The president knows when you get to a good deal, both sides are going to leave a little bit unhappy, but we need this conflict to end. The president's made that very clear,” she added.
    


            Asked if there is an expectation that Netanyahu will sign a hostage, ceasefire deal today, Leavitt stopped short of confirming, saying in part that the president “wants this to be the plan.”
    


            “The president believes strongly in this plan, and he wants this to be the plan, and he wants this war to come to an end,” Leavitt said.
    


            Even if Trump and Netanyahu were to announce a ceasefire deal Monday, Hamas would still need to sign on — and there is no indication that they have done so.
    


            President Donald Trump is offering Democrats “one last chance” to negotiate the terms of government funding as a potential shutdown looms, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ahead of his meeting with top congressional leaders.
    


            “The president is giving Democrats one last chance to be reasonable today,” Leavitt told reporters outside the White House. “Look, there is nothing to negotiate when you have a clean CR.”
    


            Trump is expected to meet later today with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Leavitt also emphasized that the president wants to meet Tuesday's funding deadline to avoid a government shutdown.
    


            “There are, of course, important policy discussions that can be had, but we are nearing a government shutdown, and we are nearing a funding deadline, and the president wants to make this deadline,” Leavitt said.
    


            When asked if there would be further government firings, Leavitt briefly said there will not be, “if Democrats vote to keep the government open.”
    


            US President Donald Trump has promised “something special” is coming on Gaza as Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reservations at about the White House's 21-point ceasefire and post-war governance plan.
    


            The two leaders will meet on Monday for a high-stakes discussion that Trump has boasted could end the war in Gaza. Trump projected optimism on Sunday as his administration works to close a comprehensive plan that would include the release of all hostages held by Hamas.
    


            “We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” Trump wrote on social media. “ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!! President DJT.”
    


            But in an interview with Fox News on yesterday afternoon, Netanyahu did not say he had accepted the plan. “We're working on it,” he said. “It's not been finalized yet.”
    


            Hamas said on Sunday that it had not received any new proposals for a ceasefire. In a statement, it reiterated “readiness to examine any proposals it receives from its mediator brothers in a positive and responsible manner, while upholding the national rights of our people.”
    


            Netanyahu is expected to present reservations and push for changes to the ceasefire plan, three Israeli officials said Sunday, underscoring the difficulty of closing a deal, even if many of the details have been worked out in advance.
    


            Read here for more on the background to the plan.
    


            The Trump administration has proposed a 21-point Gaza peace plan that calls for all hostages held by Hamas to be released within 48 hours of an agreement and sets out a roadmap for Gaza once the war ends, according to a source familiar with the proposal.
    


            Meanwhile, Israel's assault in the enclave continues, with the military escalating its offensive in recent days and forcing many to flee Gaza City as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) pushes deeper into the urban area.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, however, vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed.
    


            The plan could be problematic for Netanyahu, given it recognizes aspirations for a Palestinian state - something firmly opposed by key members of his government.
    


See below for a summary, and you can read here for the background to the plan:



            • The release of the hostages – about 20 of whom are thought to be still alive – would be in exchange for a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, according to the source.
    


            • The plan would deny Hamas any future role in the governance of Gaza, the source said. Instead, it calls for two levels of interim governance in the territory – an overarching international body and a Palestinian committee.
    


            • There is no timeline in the proposal for the international body to pass leadership of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises nominal self-rule in parts of the occupied West Bank, and faces heavy restrictions by Israel.
    


            • The plan does not indicate that the US would support the creation of a Palestinian state, but recognizes it as an aspiration of the Palestinians.
    


            The federal government is just days away from shutting down unless Congress approves a federal spending bill before Wednesday.

            Welcome to our coverage of today's developments from the Trump administration, as President Donald Trump prepares to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House today.
    


            The two leaders are scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. ET for a high-stakes discussion that Trump has boasted could end the war in Gaza.
    


            Elsewhere, the US federal government is poised to shut down on October 1 — which means midnight tomorrow going into Wednesday — unless Congress approves a federal spending bill.
    


            Republicans and Democrats remain far apart in coming to an agreement, and President Donald Trump does not appear interested in working out a compromise either.
    


Some background: Trump is no stranger to government shutdowns. The most recent one happened during his first term, starting in late December 2018 and ending in late January 2019 and was the longest on record.



            That shutdown lasted a whopping 35 days. It ended when Trump conceded to mounting pressure that he reopen the government and agreed to a temporary funding measure that did not include the billions of dollars in border wall funding he had demanded.

            • All the missing have been accounted for, police said Monday, a day after a gunman rammed a truck into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan, began shooting, then set a fire that destroyed the building, sources have said.
    


            • Four people were killed and eight others injured in the attack during a Sunday morning service, police said. Some of the injured were shot, while others suffered from smoke inhalation, a doctor at a hospital where many were treated said in a Monday news conference.
    


            • The gunman was “take(n) down” by officers within minutes. Investigators identified him as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, who served with the Marines and was an Iraq War veteran. His family is cooperating as the FBI investigates the attack as an act of targeted violence.
    


            • The siege was among 324 mass shootings this year in the US and the latest place of worship – from a Catholic church in Minneapolis to a synagogue in Pittsburgh and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin – devastated by American gun violence.
    


            The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has brought in one of its “world-renowned” specialized rapid response teams to investigate the church shooting and fire, officials said in a news conference Monday.
    


            The group, one of several National Response Teams maintained by the ATF, investigates large fires, explosions and bombings across the nation. These teams can include explosives specialists, bomb technicians, forensic chemists and canine handlers.
    


            “They have been used all over the world, and they come from places as far as California, Hawaii, and they're here in Michigan now,” ATF acting special agent in charge James Deir said.
    


            The team arrived Sunday night and is examining the scene, he added.
    


            National Response Teams have aided in some of the nation's most high-profile crisis investigations, including the 9/11 World Trade Center attack and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
    


            Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye described the church attack as an “evil act” but said the township would move forward.
    


            “This is not Grand Blanc. This does not define Grand Blanc and who we are,” Renye said during a news conference. “We are a community, and I am confident that together we're going to build a stronger community due to this incident.”
    


            Improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, were found at the scene of the attack, according to James Deir, acting special agent in charge with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Michigan.
    


            A bomb squad was assessing a suspicious item found on church property that was believed to be a possible IED, according to a source familiar with the incident, CNN has reported.
    


            “The FBI is investigating this as an act of targeted violence, and we are continuing to work to determine a motive,” said FBI acting special agent in charge Ruben Coleman.
    


            Investigators are working around the clock to follow up on leads, including public tips, Coleman said.
    


            “Our special agents, victim specialists, child advocates, forensic interviewers and local partners have interviewed over 100 victims and witnesses to date, and are continuing to interview individuals as we speak,” he added.
    


            Everyone has been accounted for following Sunday morning's mass shooting at a Michigan church, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said Monday.
    


            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said her “heart is breaking by another mass shooting in a place that is supposed to be defined by togetherness.”
    


            “We've seen gun violence in our schools, stores, parades, festivals and our houses of worship. These are places that we go to feel connected, to feel safe, to be together,” the governor said Monday during an update on Sunday's attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township.
    


            “But today, this place has been shattered by bullets and broken glass. And this might be a familiar pain, but it hurts all the same every time.”
    


            The Democratic governor ordered flags lowered statewide.
    


            Whitmer also said she spoke with President Donald Trump, who shared his condolences Sunday.
    


            Authorities are holding a news conference at the Grand Blanc Township Police Department to provide an update on the investigation into Sunday's shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel that left four people dead.
    


            Federal and local agencies will provide updates, authorities said.
    


            A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints described seeing the church Monday morning, saying it feels like a “lifetime of memories is just gone.”
    


            Brandt Malone has been been going to the LDS church in Grand Blanc Township for many years, he told CNN.
    


            Malone said his wife and daughter had been at the church on Saturday night – the night before the shooting and fire – for a youth activity.
    


            “The hardest thing for our community right now is feeling like that security blanket has been ripped away,” Malone said.
    


            A Grand Blanc Township resident described Sunday's shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as “disturbing.”
    


            CNN's Leigh Waldman spoke with Jeff Caryl on Monday morning.
    


            Caryl, who lives about four houses down from the church, said he heard what he initially thought were firecrackers on Sunday morning, but it turned out to be gunfire.
    


            Thick black smoke filled the air, and Caryl said he saw flames reaching as high as 60 to 70 feet.
    


            “It just doesn't make sense,” Caryl said. “If you're a good human being, you don't pick on churches and schools and it's just disturbing to tie all that together.”
    


            Portions of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints lay burned Monday morning, just 24 hours after a gunman set fire to the building and opened fire on worshippers.
    


            Video captured by CNN shows the remains of the building in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan.
    


Here's what the church looks like this morning:



            A man in a red car drove through a barricade midday Monday near where a gunman a day earlier rammed his pickup truck into a church, opened fire on congregants and then set the church ablaze.
    


            Photos of the red car show what appears to be a long gun in the front seat. That driver was taken into a law enforcement vehicle. His identity and motive were not immediately clear.
    


Four people were killed Sunday in the multipronged attack at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan. The gunman was killed in a shootout with police.
    


            Thomas Jacob Sanford, who authorities say was the gunman in Sunday morning's fatal shooting and fire at a Michigan church, was an Iraq War veteran and outdoorsman, according to military records and social media posts.
    


            Police say Sanford, 40, of Burton, Michigan, rammed his pickup truck into the front of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township before shooting at congregants with an assault rifle and, at some point, setting the building on fire. At least four people were killed and eight injured. Sanford died during an exchange of gunfire with police, authorities said.
    


            Authorities did not immediately provide a motive for the attack.
    


            A Marine Corps spokesperson told CNN that Sanford served as a sergeant and received several medals for his service, which lasted from 2004 to 2008. He was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom for several months starting in the summer of 2007.
    


            Sanford graduated from Goodrich High School in 2004 and was recognized among other veteran alumni, according to an archived page from the school's website. A local news profile of Sanford from 2007 said he was deployed with the US Marine Corps to Japan before preparing to head for service in Iraq.
    


            Social media accounts linked to Sanford's family show he was married with at least one child, a young son. According to a GoFundMe page from 2015, the family was in need of donations to help pay for the medical care of Sanford's son, who was born with a rare genetic disorder.
    


Read more about Sanford here. 



            Kris Johns, Burton city council candidate, near Michigan's Grand Blanc Township, spoke with a potential voter on the campaign trail — just days before that individual carried out a deadly attack on a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel.
    


            “What are your thoughts on guns?” Thomas Jacob Sanford — the US Marine and Iraq War veteran who died at the scene of Sunday's shooting and arson — asked Johns just one week ago, the Burton candidate recalled to CNN. “What are your thoughts on Mormons?”
    


            Otherwise, the conversation wasn't political, Johns said.
    


            At least four people were killed, and several others were wounded after an attacker rammed his car into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, during a Sunday service, before opening fire on worshippers and setting a fire that destroyed the building.
    


            The gunman is dead and the motive remains unknown as federal officials investigate the incident as targeted violence.
    


            Authorities are still combing through debris.
    


The victims: At least two of the people who were killed died from gunshot wounds, according to police. Eight others were injured, including children, a source told CNN. Authorities said they believe they will find more victims after they secure the chapel, which is now a “total loss.” Up to seven people were still unaccounted for as authorities concluded search efforts on Sunday, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


The gunman: A 40-year-old man from Burton, Michigan, was identified as the shooter. The man used an assault rifle during the attack and was shot dead by police. Officials believe there is only one person involved.
    


The fire: Authorities believe the suspect “deliberately” set fire to the church using an accelerant. Some suspected explosive devices linked to the incident were also found. It's unclear if any explosives were also used to start the fire, authorities said.
    


The investigation: The FBI is investigating the incident as an “act of targeted violence.” The FBI's assumption of leadership in the case signals authorities have potentially uncovered violations of federal law. A search of the perpetrator's residence is underway and authorities are working to obtain search warrants for digital media that may help shed light on a motive, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            As of Sunday afternoon, there have been at least 324 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people – not counting the shooter – are shot.
    


            Sunday's attack at the church in Michigan followed another mass shooting less than 24 hours earlier: Saturday night, a gunman opened fire on a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, killing three people and injuring at least eight others.
    


            Sunday's attack occurred at a chapel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a religious faith with millions of followers that was founded in New York in the 19th century.

UK campaigners and politicians have criticized the National Health Service for promoting the “benefits” of first-cousin marriages, after it compared the genetic risk of cousin marriage to that of having children later in life or smoking and drinking during pregnancy.

The practice has been legal in Britain since the 16th century, when Henry VIII altered kinship rules to marry Anne Boleyn's cousin, Catherine Howard. Current legislation prohibits unions between parents, children and siblings, but not first cousins.

Conservative MP Richard Holden has tabled a bill to outlaw such marriages, arguing they endanger children's health. His legislation returned to the Commons last week and is due for a second reading early next year.

In response to calls for reform, NHS England's Genomics Education Programme published an article last week weighing whether a ban should be introduced. It cited “various potential benefits, including stronger extended family support systems and economic advantages.”

While conceding the higher risk of congenital conditions, the NHS compared it to that of delayed parenthood or smoking and drinking during pregnancy.

Earlier material from a Bradford NHS trust, cited in media reports, suggested that cousin unions – linked to about 30% of local birth defects – were comparable to white women delaying childbirth beyond the age of 34. The document described both decisions as cultural practices shaped by social values.

Holden slammed the publication, saying the “NHS should stop taking the knee to damaging and oppressive cultural practices.” He argued that the Labour government remains “deaf” to demands to outlaw such unions, which he described as a “backdoor to immigration.”

Critics said the guidance undermined awareness efforts. Aisha Ali-Khan, whose three brothers died young from health problems she blames on her parents' cousin union, told the Daily Mail she does not want “other families to go through what ours did.” Aneeta Prem, who leads the Freedom Charity, called such unions a “safeguarding risk.”

An NHS England spokesman said the article was a “summary of existing research and policy debate,” not an official position, adding that education and genetic counselling would be more effective than prohibition.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has claimed that an Israeli-supplied Patriot missile defense system is now active in the country, marking the first time Kiev has acknowledged the deployment of this type of weapon.

The issue of transferring US-made Patriot batteries to Ukraine had surfaced earlier this year when Israeli Ambassador Michael Brodsky suggested that Patriot units previously stationed in Israel were being used by Ukrainian forces. The Israeli Foreign Ministry, however, quickly dismissed the statement, denying any such transfer had taken place.

“An Israeli complex is operating in Ukraine. A month. It has been working for a month,” Zelensky said. “We are getting two more Patriot systems in the fall. That's it. I won't talk about Patriot anymore.”

Earlier this year, West Jerusalem announced plans to decommission eight Patriot systems that had been in service for over 30 years, replacing them with more advanced air defense solutions. The Financial Times reported citing sources familiar with the matter that Israel was open to transferring the retired units to Ukraine.

Earlier this month, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced that Berlin had delivered the first launchers of two Patriot units to Kiev. At the time, Pistorius stated that Ukraine would need at least five such systems to protect its airspace.

Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms shipments to Kiev, saying they only serve to prolong the hostilities. Russian officials have also accused Ukraine's supporters of enabling the growth of an international black market in advanced weapons. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that arms diverted from Ukraine could become a global security risk, including for Israel. Shortly after escalation of the conflict in February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would “snap” the Patriot systems delivered to Ukraine.

Emergency crews have discovered two more victims in the ruins of a Mormon church set ablaze during Sunday's shooting in Michigan, raising the death toll to four parishioners plus the gunman, who was killed in a shootout with police.

Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye told reporters that two of the victims' bodies had gunshot wounds.

“Including the suspect, there are five deceased persons from this tragic incident,” he said, praising first responders who arrived at the church within 30 seconds of the first 911 call. Seven people remain hospitalized in stable condition, while one is in critical care.

Crews are continuing to comb through the debris of the destroyed church, which Renye described as “a total loss due to the fire.” He added that some people remain unaccounted for. “We are in recovery mode,” he said.

Investigators revealed that the suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, used gasoline as an accelerant to ignite the fire. Sanford was a former Marine sergeant who served in Iraq between 2007 and 2008.

According to the Marine Corps, he had received multiple service awards, including the Iraq Campaign Medal and the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal.

The ATF also discovered several suspected explosive devices at the site, though it was not immediately clear whether they had been used to start the blaze, according to special agent James Deir. Michigan State Police reported receiving additional bomb threats at churches and other locations in the area.

Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive. The FBI is leading the investigation and said it is treating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.” NBC affiliate WDIV reported a heavy police presence at a residence believed to be Sanford's home.

CHISINAU, September 29. /TASS/. Moldova's opposition parties, including the Patriotic Bloc which supports the restoration of ties with Russia, have gotten ahead of the Party of Action and Solidarity founded by Moldovan President Maia Sandu, at the country's parliamentary elections, according to the Central Election Commission following the processing of 100% of domestic ballots.

The ruling party has garnered 44.13% of the vote. The Patriotic Bloc has received 28.25%, the pro-European Alternative bloc - 9.22%, Our Party - 6.35%, and Democracy at Home - 5.72%. Overall, the opposition parties have garnered 49.54%.

Sandu's party managed to reach a more favorable result due to voting at polling stations abroad, mostly in the West, garnering 49.71% of the vote with 98.55% of the ballots from all polling stations tallied, with the opposition receiving 44.38% of the vote.

Earlier, the leaders of the Patriotic Bloc claimed the opposition's victory at Moldova's elections and launched a rally near the building of the Central Election Commission demanding to avoid any falsifications during the count, a TASS correspondent reported.

Former President Igor Dodon who leads the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova told the gathering that ""the Party of Action and Solidarity has lost this election and as of now does not have the parliamentary majority while the opposition has won."" According to Dodon, this means that the opposition can join efforts and form the parliamentary majority.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, September 29. /TASS/. The European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), along with its two related protocols, are no longer valid in Russia due to the refusal of the Council of Europe to provide Russia's representation in the organization's statutory bodies, according to a law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday.

At the same time, the Russian authorities will continue to combat human rights violations by applying national legislation in this area.

""Denounce the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of November 26, 1987 and Protocols No. 1 and No. 2 of November 4, 1993 thereto, signed on behalf of the Russian Federation in Strasbourg on February 28, 1996,"" the newly-signed law reads.

State Duma (the lower house of the Russian Parliament) Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin pointed out earlier that Russia's work in the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture ""has been blocked by the Council of Europe itself, which has not allowed the election of a new Russian member to the committee since December 2023.""

The explanatory note to the bill stipulated that these ""discriminatory circumstances"" violate Russia's representative rights in the European Committee and undermine the mutual monitoring mechanism for compliance with international obligations in the field of torture prevention, ""which is why it is proposed to denounce the said convention and its protocols.""

The Russian government previously submitted a proposal to the Russian president on denouncing the convention. Russia, which has been a member of the Council of Europe since 1996, announced its intention to withdraw from it in 2022, after the organization's Committee of Ministers suspended Moscow's right to representation in the Council of Europe's statutory bodies.

At that time, Russia notified the Council's secretary of its withdrawal and denunciation of the key document of the Council of Europe - the European Convention on Human Rights.

Since that time, Moscow has been gradually denouncing the documents of the Council of Europe, as current circumstances make enforcing them impossible.

At the same time, the Russian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they will not abandon their international obligations to combat crimes and human rights violations, actively enforcing national legislation in this sphere.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Airplane maintenance workers at a North Carolina airport found the body of a suspected stowaway in the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight that had recently arrived from Europe, police said.

The body was found on Sunday morning while the plane was undergoing maintenance at Charlotte Douglas international airport. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department said in a statement that it is investigating the death.

Neither the airline nor police have offered information about the person who died, including a possible cause of death, or said where the flight originated.

The airport said it was deeply saddened by the discovery and that it will support the police investigation. American Airlines said it was working with law enforcement on its investigation and directed questions to police.

Experts believe roughly three-quarters of stowaways do not survive if they hide on a plane's undercarriage because of the extreme cold and lack of oxygen they experience as the plane reaches cruising altitude.

In January, two bodies were found in the landing gear compartment of a JetBlue aircraft at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood international airport. The bodies were discovered in the wheel well area during a routine post-flight inspection.

The aircraft had arrived in Fort Lauderdale shortly after flight from John F Kennedy international airport in New York. The jet had been in both Kingston, Jamaica, and Salt Lake City, Utah, earlier that day.

In December, a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane after it landed in Maui from Chicago.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump and Republicans are unfazed at prospect of shutdown, and talks with Democrats are anticipated to be confrontational

US politics – latest updates

Democrats and Republicans are gearing up for a crunch White House meeting with Donald Trump in an 11th-hour bid to avert a potentially damaging federal government shutdown.

Monday's gathering is aimed at reaching an agreement over funding the government and largely hinges on Democrat demands for an extension of funding subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, beyond the end of the year, when they are due to expire.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat leader in the House of Representatives, and Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate, will meet Trump along with their Republican counterparts, Mike Johnson, the House speaker, and John Thune, the Senate majority leader, for talks that are expected to be tense if not confrontational.

It will be Trump's first meeting with the two Democrats since his return to the White House in January. Jeffries and Trump have never previously met in person.

Expectations for the encounter are low, with failure likely to result in large swathes of the federal government shutting down from 1 October.

Trump and the Republicans have signaled that they are unfazed at that prospect, calculating that the public will blame Democrat intransigence.

The White House office of management and budget (OMB) has also indicated that it will exploit a shutdown to carry out more mass firings as part of its crusade to slash government bureaucracy.

An OMB memorandum said government agencies have been instructed “use this opportunity to consider reduction in force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities”, The Hill reported.

Republicans have also warned that Trump could make a shutdown politically costly by targeting spending programmes that are disproportionately used by Democrat-run states and cities.

CBS, citing a source close to Trump, reported that he privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it would “enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries”.

“I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue,” Trump told the network in a telephone interview. “They [the Democrats] are not interested in waste, fraud and abuse.”

Some Democrats have acknowledged that they have “no good options” in trying to end the standoff.

“It's doubly made no good because it's very clear that Republicans want [a shutdown]. Trump wants it. He's fine with that, happy to have it,” The Hill quoted a Democratic Senate aide as saying.. “I don't really know what your good option here is when they want one.”

However, Schumer is under pressure to be seen taking a more actively confrontational stance after being fiercely criticized by fellow Democrats for backing a Republican funding packing in March to avert an earlier government shutdown.

With Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican senator, likely to vote against the funding package, it would need the support of eight Democrats to overcome a Senate filibuster.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Church set ablaze on weekend when shooting attacks also took place in North Carolina, Texas and New Orleans. Plus, the secrets of Birkenstock's enduring success

Good morning.

At least four people were killed and eight others injured after a gunman opened fire at a Mormon church in Michigan and then set the building ablaze, authorities said.

Two of the shooting victims died and eight others were hospitalised, officials said initially, while the gunman was shot dead by police. Several hours after the shooting, police reported finding at least two more bodies in the charred remains of the church, which had not yet been cleared and may contain other victims.

The police chief of Grand Blanc Township, William Renye, said a 40-year-old male suspect drove a vehicle through the front door of the church yesterday morning, got out and began firing an assault rifle at hundreds of church attenders.

Was it the only mass shooting this weekend? No, the shooting happened during a particularly violent weekend in the US and marked the 324th mass shooting in the US in 2025, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Multiple mass shootings – cases in which four or more people are shot or killed – were reported in the US in public places including in North Carolina, Texas and New Orleans.

Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention, as revealed in a stark new court filing.

Legal experts able to witness conditions made a barrage of allegations about deprivations, violations of legally agreed basic detention standards and humanitarian concerns at the only known Ice center currently holding families.

At the facility in Dilley, a small town an hour south-west of San Antonio, children and their parents described a “prison-like environment” and said they lived in “cell-like trailers”.

What did the facility say? The facility, which is run by the private corrections and detention company CoreCivic, directed the Guardian to Ice for comment, which in turn directed the Guardian to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency, though a report from Ice's juvenile coordinator said the agency was complying with legal requirements. Comment was requested from DHS but a response was not received prior to publication.

The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, announced yesterday that he is abandoning his faltering bid to win re-election, just over a month before election day, delivering the message in a social media video set to the strains of My Way.

Adams, who was trailing in the polls, was elected as a Democrat but ran for re-election as an independent after he was indicted on federal corruption charges, which were then dropped by the Trump administration in exchange for his cooperation on immigration raids.

What did he say about his decision to drop out? In his video statement, Adams said that it had been impossible for him to mount a winning campaign, blaming “constant media speculation about my future” and a decision by the city's campaign finance board to withhold millions of dollars in matching funds over suspicious donations.

Israel has pressed on with its offensive in Gaza as Donald Trump claimed again to be on the brink of a breakthrough in ceasefire negotiations for the devastated territory. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is visiting the White House on Monday, after telling Fox News Sunday that Israel was working on a new ceasefire plan with the US.

The indictment of the former FBI director James Comey is part of a concerted effort by Donald Trump to “rewrite history” in his favor, a former senior White House lawyer claimed yesterday.

The Taliban yesterday freed a US citizen from an Afghan prison, weeks after they said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations.

More than 100,000 federal workers are to formally resign tomorrow, the largest such mass event in US history, as part of a Trump administration program designed to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. Workers have described how months of “fear and intimidation” left them feeling like they had no choice but to depart.

Louisiana v Callais is a major challenge to what remains of the Voting Rights of Act of 1965, and could radically rework the structure of political representation in the United States. A successful challenge to the VRA would allow the Republican party to further cheat democracy by engaging in even more partisan gerrymandering.

In 1993, Tim Berners-Lee convinced his managers at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) to donate the intellectual property of the world wide web, putting it into the public domain. He writes: “We gave the web away to everyone. Today, I look at my invention and I am forced to ask: is the web still free today? On many platforms, we are no longer the customers, but instead have become the product.”

Food and agriculture contribute one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions – second only to the burning of fossil fuels. And yet the vast majority of media coverage of the climate crisis overlooks this critical sector, according to a new data analysis from Sentient Media.

When two brothers called Johannes and Johann Adam Birkenstock began making shoes in a tiny hamlet near Frankfurt in the 1770s, they could never have imagined what they were starting. Birkenstock now sells tens of millions of pairs of shoes every year. How did a brand described even by some of its fans as the world's ugliest shoe become one of the world's most popular?

Washington has authorized specific instances where Ukraine can carry out long-range strikes within Russia, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said on Sept. 28 in an interview with Fox News.

""The answer is yes, use the ability to hit deep, there are no such things as sanctuaries,"" Kellogg replied when asked if it is U.S. President Donald Trump's position that Ukraine can conduct long-range strikes.

President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly asked Trump to supply Kyiv with Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles during a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last week.

The U.S. is ""looking at"" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28.

The final decision on whether Ukraine may conduct long-range strikes within Russia falls to Trump on a case-by-case basis, Kellogg noted.

As Ukraine develops long-range missiles and drones of its own, Kyiv continues to rely on weapons provided by its allies to conduct such strikes, which often require authorization from the country supplying the missiles.

In light of Russia's recent provocations, it is more important than ever to be careful not to make a ""mistake"" when facing Moscow, he said, adding that ""this is a global issue, and we should react accordingly.""

Russia has intensified violations of the EU's and NATO's airspace in recent weeks. Moscow violated Polish airspace on Sept. 10, prompting Warsaw to shoot down Russian drones over its territory in a first for any NATO member in over three years of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. On Sept. 19, three Russian jets violated Estonian airspace.

As the U.S. allows Ukraine to conduct strikes deep within Russia, Washington is looking into providing Kyiv with additional weapons.

""That is one of the reasons I believe that this last week, and it has been confirmed, that President Zelensky asked President Trump to give Tomahawk missiles,"" Kellogg said, adding that the final decision has not yet been made.

As Russia continues to press along the front line with little progress and high losses, Kellogg noted that Moscow is not meeting its goals as it wages its war against Ukraine.

""Russia is not winning this war. If they (were) winning, they would be in Kyiv, Odesa, they would be over the Dnipro river,"" he said.

Russia has lost approximately 1,109,590 troops in Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, according to the latest assessment of the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces on Sept. 29.

Trump's position marks a shift from earlier in the year. The U.S. leader previously criticized Ukrainian strikes on infrastructure within Russian territory.

In a letter published Aug. 22, Trump told Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban he was ""very angry"" about Ukrainian drone strikes on Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline.

In recent weeks, Trump has instead increasingly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin as the U.S. fails to broker an end to Russia's war against Ukraine.

""I'm very dissatisfied with what Russia is doing and what President Putin is doing,"" Trump told reporters during a press conference on Sept. 25. ""I haven't liked it at all. He's killing people for no reason whatsoever.""

Ukrainian forces struck the Elektrodetal factory in the town of Karachev, located in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, the General Staff confirmed on Sept. 29.

The confirmation follows earlier reports in Russian local media of a drone strike on the factory. Prior to the attack, Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz had issued a warning about a possible missile threat in the Karachev area.

The Elektrodetal factory produces a range of electrical connectors for both military and industrial use. Its products include low-frequency, high-frequency, and combined connectors used in sectors such as aerospace, electronics, and instrumentation.

These components are employed in military equipment, aircraft, antennas, base stations, printed circuit boards, and various measuring systems.

The strike on the facility reportedly caused explosions and a fire on the site. The full extent of the damage is still being assessed.

According to the General Staff, the attack was conducted by Ukraine's missile and artillery forces in coordination with other branches of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The strike reached a target approximately 240 kilometers (149 miles) away.

Ukrainian Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa confirmed that the strike was carried out using Neptune cruise missiles.

Bryansk Oblast sits along Ukraine's northern border with Russia. Karachev is located about 115 kilometers (72 miles) from the border.

Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

On Sept. 28, Ukrainian HIMARS rockets reportedly struck a thermal power plant near the Russian city of Belgorod, Russian Telegram channels reported. Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov confirmed a strike on the region's critical infrastructure as well as ""significant power outages.""

Separately on Sept. 28, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) claimed that it killed at least four Russian drone operators in the city of Melitopol in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

An explosion rocked a guarded military base on an airfield in occupied Melitopol, destroying a Soviet-era UAZ-452 van and killing at least four operators, HUR claimed.

The Canadian flag flies atop the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

John Turley-Ewart is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail, a regulatory compliance consultant and a Canadian banking historian.

Canadian business and political leaders cheering the news that U.S. President Donald Trump will slap a US$100,000 fee on H-1B work visas reveals much that is wrong with this country.

H-1B work visas (only 85,000 were issued in 2025) are used largely by U.S. technology giants and other knowledge-based industries to fill roles that require expertise in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Amazon, for example, secured 14,667 of them this year.

The median income for H-1B workers is about US$110,000, according to the American Immigration Council, a middle-class income in many parts of the U.S.

The new, US$100,000 fee prompted delusions of grandeur in Canada, with talk of scooping up foreign talent seeking lives in the U.S. RBC CEO Dave McKay told Bloomberg News that it will give people from India, South Asia and Europe reason to think: “Well, I can't get into the U.S., but I want to move to North America – I'll come to Canada.” Workforce experts echoed Mr. McKay's sentiments in these pages.

In New York, Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested that the new visa requirements would likely prevent some top Canadian AI talent from finding work in the U.S. British Columbia's Minister of Jobs and Economic Growth, Ravi Kahlon, took to social media to invite “tech talent, innovators, and scientists to come to B.C.”

Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee could help Canada recruit foreign workers, experts say

In today's Canada, business leaders are excited to welcome people who don't want to be here, our Prime Minister makes merry in front of a Manhattan audience over Canadians who now can't afford to go to greener pastures in the U.S., and a B.C. cabinet minister offers false hope for social media hits knowing full well that in April his government announced that the number of economic immigrants it would nominate this year would be near zero.

A Canadian Senate report from 2024 is an indictment of Canadian talent development. It details how 6.5 million Canadians don't have a family doctor; that by 2031 we will be short nearly 80,000 physicians; and that literally thousands of international medical graduates, many Canadian-born, raised and qualified, can't practise here because we haven't figured out a way to license them. At the same time, thousands of qualified Canadian STEM graduates attend foreign medical schools because we don't have enough spaces in ours. 

As the medical talent debacle unfolds, so does one involving tech talent. Canadian tech leaders have decided there are better places to do business than Canada. As reported in The Globe and Mail, Leaders Fund, a Toronto venture capital firm, tracked almost 3,000 high-potential Canadian startups for a decade. The results reveal a dramatic trend: Sixty-seven per cent of Canadian startups launched in 2024 are headquartered outside Canada, many in the U.S.

The survey shows that those startups can raise almost twice as much capital in the U.S. than in Canada. Canadian government programs are “often designed by people who have never operated a business” and are ineffective. Leadership development is given short shrift, and Canadians tend to “vilify success” rather than celebrate it.

Seymour Schulich, one of Canada's most respected business leaders and a supporter of the Leaders Fund, said “we're seeing in tech what we've witnessed in oil, gas and mining – a steady departure of top talent and headquarters.”

The rot runs wide. Economists at National Bank of Canada have been writing about the disaster that is our industrial sector, which has material consequences for industrial workers and engineers. “Real investment in industrial machinery and equipment fell in Q2 to its lowest level on record (data back to 1981).” They call the divergence between our industrial sector and America's “appalling.”

Opinion: Trump's H-1B visa price hike is good for Canada

Canadian universities and colleges, where we expect to help our best and brightest shine, face a financial crisis – budget deficits, course reductions, program closures and staff cuts.

And how do Canadian employers fare in developing homegrown talent? The Labour Market Information Council produced an exhaustive report on this in 2023 and concluded that “Canadian firms invest modestly in training – an estimated $240 per employee annually – and lag their international peers in rates and hours of instruction.”

Mix in the lack of affordable housing, the high cost of living and fear about violent crime in our cities, and Plan B (Canada) for skilled foreign workers looks a lot like an invite to a run-down cottage that features pleasant views.

Soon after Mr. Trump began turning up his tariff attacks on our economy, public service messages were developed for broadcast on radio and other platforms urging us to “Buy Canadian as if your country depended on it.”

We need to invest in both Canadians and Canada, because our country really does depend on it. Nobody is coming to save us.

Minister of Public Safety Gary Anandasangaree said in a recent recording the Liberal government's gun policies were chosen for political reasons and likely can't be properly enforced.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

This space has long argued that the federal Liberals' gun-control policies – in particular a buyback program targeting assault-style rifles announced in 2020 but never launched – have very little to do with public safety and everything to do with cynical politics.

We said those policies were a wedge salad of empty promises, half-baked ideas and outright incompetence tossed together in the hope of winning a few seats.

Well, you don't have to take it from us any more. Just ask Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree, who has been charged by Prime Minister Mark Carney with the task of finally getting the buyback program for individual gun owners off the ground this week.

Mr. Anandasangaree was surreptitiously taped by a disgruntled gun owner earlier this month saying that the Liberals were determined to see the buyback through for one reason: “this is something that [is] very much a big, big, big deal for many of the Quebec electorate that voted for us.”

He also said that, were he able, he would redo the program “from scratch,” and that he had doubts that “municipal police services have the resources to [enforce] this.”

At one point he tells the man, “Don't ask me to explain the logic to you on this.”

Oh, but you already have, Mr. Anandasangaree.

Opinion: The Public Safety Minister accidentally tells the truth about Canada's gun-buyback program

Ever since a heavily armed man killed 22 people in Nova Scotia in April, 2020, the Liberals have used gun control to manage their electoral fortunes while doing next to nothing to make the public safer. 

“Canadians deserve more than thoughts and prayers,” Justin Trudeau said shortly after the Nova Scotia massacre, but he only ever delivered poorly conceived legislation and calculated delays.

He began in 2020 by announcing an immediate ban on the possession and sale of a long list of assault-style semi-automatic rifles and accessories – a list the Liberals added to twice after that. It now sits at 2,500 varieties.

He also said that year that the government would launch an obligatory buyback program and announced a two-year amnesty for gun owners while the program was set up.

Two years later, the Liberals extended the amnesty for a year, and then extended it again for two more years, placing its end after what would have been the fixed-date election scheduled for October of this year – as cynical a move as any politician ever executed.

Mr. Trudeau never made it to that election, of course. He was forced out of office by his own party in January and replaced by Mr. Carney, who called an early vote in April. 

And now the end date for the amnesty period is March 1, 2026 – almost six years after the events that triggered it.

Public Safety Minister says leaked comments about Liberals' gun policy were ‘misguided'

The repeated failure to launch the buyback program for individual gun owners has not been the Liberals' only failing.

In 2021, they proposed in a gun bill that Ottawa give municipalities the power to ban handguns, instead of doing the responsible thing and enforcing a national ban. It was a ludicrous and unworkable idea that they eventually dropped. They embarrassed themselves again in 2022, when they had to backtrack after sticking last-minute amendments into a new gun bill that appeared to outlaw popular hunting rifles.

The only things the Liberals have done to reduce the number of guns in Canada have been an assault-style firearms buyback for businesses that received 12,195 claims for compensation, and a freeze on the sale, purchase and transfer by individuals of handguns – a move that does nothing to eliminate the estimated 1.2 million handguns still in Canadians' possession, a number based on a 2023 report from Mr. Anandasangaree's department.

Mr. Carney's decision to press ahead with the buyback for individuals is more of the same half-baked baloney. There are doubts about how successful a voluntary program can be, and whether the amounts the government is offering will entice people into applying for compensation. 

Meanwhile, the Ontario Provincial Police and the municipal police in Montreal say they will not take part in the program. Alberta and Saskatchewan say they will not enforce the buyback, while Manitoba is on the fence.

Perhaps that is why this week's launch is a pilot program limited to collecting 200 firearms in parts of Cape Breton. It took five and a half years to get to this, which is completely on brand for the Liberals. No wonder Mr. Anandasangaree would rather not bother.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Global investors look past AI hype to long-term opportunities from government spending","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-global-investors-look-past-ai-hype-to-long-term-opportunities-from/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:17:36 GMT","

Some of the world's biggest investors are looking beyond a boom in artificial intelligence to longer-term spending by governments tackling geopolitical, technological and demographic pressures set to reshape markets over the next few years.

Asset managers are spreading bets across infrastructure, energy transition, healthcare and defence, to capitalize on fiscal stimulus from governments, even as Wall Street debates whether the AI-powered rally in stocks is sustainable.

As concerns over some countries' ballooning fiscal debts draw attention, many investors “underestimated the impact that (stimulus) could have on real and financial assets,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.

Hafele told the Reuters Global Markets Forum his firm, which oversees US$4.5-trillion in assets, is “investing thematically along with what governments are doing,” diversifying into areas such as power, resources, healthcare and defence.

July's sweeping U.S. tax-cut and spending bill will add trillions to government debt by extending tax cuts from U.S. President Donald Trump's first term, ramping up funding for border security and defence, and trimming Medicare and Medicaid.

Europe's fiscal support is just as dramatic, with sentiment boosted by Germany's 500-billion-euro (US$586-billion) infrastructure fund exempt from its strict debt brake and NATO members' pledges to lift defence spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP.

“Fiscal stimulus is always a big element of the performance of the financial markets,” said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Asset Management, which manages US$430-billion in assets.

The magnitude and persistence of these fiscal commitments on both sides of the Atlantic were unprecedented compared to previous market cycles, he said, adding that the structural realignment they drive would last for years.

“It takes time before those moneys actually percolate (through) the system ... before you see them becoming reality,” Cavarero said.

Nuclear power, energy infrastructure, biotech innovation and defence were industries that “cannot be ignored by the market,” he added, while warning, “At some point, we will need to deal with these debts.”

A rise of nearly 14 per cent this year in the S&P 500 index has largely been powered by AI-related momentum, versus more modest gains of 9.5 per cent in Europe's benchmark STOXX 600.

But the aerospace and defence index .SXPARO of the latter has surged almost 68 per cent, showing that fiscal priorities are lifting defence and industrial plays even in a broader market environment still dominated by AI.

Saira Malik, chief investment officer at U.S. asset manager Nuveen, which manages $1.3 trillion in assets, expects equity gains to broaden beyond the U.S. tech-heavy trade to cyclical sectors, small-caps and value plays.

“U.S. outperformance is not the only game in town this year, thanks to a weaker dollar,” she said.

Malik advised investors to stay balanced, but with a tilt toward U.S. markets. “I don't think investors should just own U.S. (assets) at the expense of everything else, but I would fully argue against betting against the U.S.”

Malik also sees opportunities in infrastructure, utilities and waste management, describing them as resilient and effective hedges against inflation.

Both UBS and Nuveen stressed active management over passive bets. “It's less of a time for beta and more of a time for active investing,” Haefele said.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats emerged victorious in local elections in western Germany. Meanwhile, the German foreign minister is to visit Poland as tensions grow over Russia's aggression. DW has more.

A German man who donned a jacket stored away since March got the surprise of his life over the weekend.

The family father from Frankfurt had forgotten a lotto ticket in the pocket of the jacket when he put it away for the summer. He didn't discover the ticket again until the weather turned chilly. 

""It wasn't until the weekend that I found the ticket again, folded up in the inside pocket of my jacket,"" the unidentified man was quoted as saying, adding, ""When I checked the numbers on my phone and saw the winning amount, I was completely shocked — luckily I was sitting down, otherwise my knees would have given way.""

The winning amount was €15.3 million ($18 million).

Lotto Frankfurt, which initiated a PR campaign searching for the lucky winner earlier this year, said the man had remained oblivious to his good fortune despite having seen and heard the campaign to identify the winner.

""I heard about it on the radio at the time and thought to myself, 'How stupid can you be to not collect it?' It never occurred to me that I could be the person they were looking for,"" the winner said.

When asked what he planned to do with his winnings, the man said he wanted to buy a new sofa for his living room.

Beyond that, he and his wife — who wish to remain anonymous — said they plan to use the bulk of the money to provide for their children.

Sleeper train service between the French, German and Austrian capitals will cease on December 14. The termination of the highly popular routes is the result of French subsidy cuts. 

The Paris-Vienna and Paris-Berlin routes were relaunched in 2021 and 2023 as part of a broader effort to bring night trains back as a low-emission alternative to short-haul flights inside Europe.

Though they averaged roughly 70% occupancy, according to the French state rail provider SNCF, this format is less lucrative in terms of how much money a seat or cabin can generate along the route. For instance, one seat can be booked several times during daytime travel, with passengers exiting and entering the train for various segments along the way — something that is not possible on sleeper trains.

Higher staffing requirements and locomotive changes at border crossings further weigh upon profits for SCNF and their operating partners at Germany's DB and Austria ÖBB.

SNCF on Monday said service would not be economically viable after the French government announced the end to some €10 million ($11.7 million) in annual subsidies.

Adding to the inherent economic pressure of operating such trains was the fact that service was repeatedly interrupted by construction on French and German rails, frustrating willing customers and dampening rider enthusiasm.

French lawmaker Brigitte Klinkert called the decision ""unacceptable,"" saying that high passenger numbers show the ""great interest of passengers in rail connections"" between the France and neighboring Germany, adding, ""These connections are a climate-friendly and efficient means of transport that attracts many travelers and is also a strong symbol of the cooperation and friendship between France and Germany.""

Police in Oldenburg in the northern German state of Lower Saxony said that they had recovered the bodies of four individuals from a family home in the city earlier Monday morning.

Authorities say it appears that a man killed his wife and then their two children before committing suicide.

Police released a statement announcing that they would not be providing further information about the killings at the moment out of respect for the family.

Germany's music rights society Gema is suing OpenAI for damages, accusing the US company of reproducing copyrighted German song lyrics without permission.

The Munich Regional Court on Monday said it was ""undisputed"" that the company's ChatGPT was trained on the nine song lyrics at issue in the case, noting the chatbot reproduced large parts of them verbatim when prompted.

Gema filed the lawsuit in November 2024 seeking an injunction, disclosure and compensation. It argues that OpenAI systematically used its repertoire to train generative AI systems, calling the memorization and reproduction of lyrics an unlawful reproduction under copyright law.

A verdict is scheduled for November 11.

The German state of Hesse's Office for the Protection of the Constitution may classify and monitor the Alternative for Germany (AfD) state branch as a suspected right-wing extremist organization, the Hesse Higher Administrative Court in Kassel ruled, the court announced.

The state intelligence agency made the designation about three years ago, and the Wiesbaden Administrative Court confirmed in 2023 that the AfD could be observed.

Judges said there are ""factual indications"" the party pursues goals hostile to Germany's democratic order, including promoting an ""ethnic concept of the people"" and statements that violate the dignity of foreigners, particularly asylum seekers.

The Kassel court's decision is final, though a constitutional complaint remains possible.

The AfD said it will continue legal action, stressing that the ruling came in an expedited procedure. ""After the decision in the interim proceedings, the main proceedings will now go before the Wiesbaden Administrative Court,"" a party statement said, adding it does not find the reasoning for the suspected-case classification convincing.

Europe's largest ammunition maker Rheinmetall will produce about €444 million (about $520 million) worth of artillery rounds for an unnamed Eastern European country under a US government contract, the Düsseldorf-based company said Monday.

Rheinmetall is acting as a subcontractor to US firm Global Military Products. Around €170 million of the order is already booked, with the remaining €274 million confirmed. Deliveries are scheduled to start in 2026 and finish by June 2027.

The company, which has previously supplied Ukraine, is expanding capacity to meet surging demand triggered by Russia's war on Ukraine and aims to produce up to 1.5 million 155 mm shells a year by 2027.

Police said a 47-year-old French national tore the leather shorts (Lederhosen) of a 40-year-old German man at Bad Cannstatt station around 12:30 a.m. on Saturday after visitors left the first day of Stuttgart's Cannstatter Volksfest.

The suspect allegedly yanked at the victim's Lederhosen until they ripped. Police officers found the intoxicated man on the platform and began an investigation for property damage.

The Cannstatter Volksfest is widely considered to be the second-largest beer celebration in the world.

A 56-year-old man has died from stab wounds following a violent clash involving up to 30 people in the western German city of Gelsenkirchen, police say. Three others remain in critical condition.

The fight erupted Sunday in the city's Bismarck district, where knives, stun guns and baseball bats were reportedly used in what police described as a ""riot situation.""

A homicide squad is investigating.

Three men aged 16, 29 and 52 and three women aged 25, 28 and 50 have been detained, while authorities work to determine each person's role and the motive behind the confrontation.

Police cordoned off the area to collect evidence and deployed a helicopter during the evening search for suspects.

Twenty people have been injured, four of them seriously, after two city buses collided in the northern port city of Hamburg, the fire department said.

Four people were seriously injured and 16 sustained minor injuries.

Nine of the injured — including four slightly hurt children and a pregnant woman who was seriously injured — were taken to hospitals, while others were treated at the scene. 

Local media reported that a primary school class was aboard one bus on a field trip to a science research center.

The cause of the incident is under investigation.

Police in the northern German city of Rostock have detained a 19-year-old Ukrainian after a series of knife-related thefts and threats.

Authorities say the man stole kitchen knives from a TK Maxx store Saturday morning, then used one to rob an e-cigarette shop and threaten bystanders. He later demanded a bratwurst at knife point and fled when refused.

Officers arrested him and recovered the stolen goods nearby. They ordered a blood test, citing signs of alcohol and drug use.

Prosecutors charged the man with aggravated robbery, attempted extortion, threats and theft. A court issued a detention order Sunday, and he was taken to a correctional facility.

Lufthansa on Monday confirmed reports that it intends to cut 4,000 administrative positions by 2030.

The airline group said the cuts were part of moves to digitize, automate and consolidate processes.

The measures aim to ""position the group for the future"" while generating ""sustainably attractive returns for shareholders,"" it said.

The Lufthansa Group, which, alongside its core brand, also operates SWISS, Austrian and Brussels Airlines and holds a minority stake in Italy's ITA, most recently had around 103,000 employees. 

Lufthansa said it also plans to put its various airlines under tighter central control in a bid to boost profitability.

Among other things, it says it will strengthen the low-cost carrier Eurowings and the logistics and maintenance units, with the latter expected to expand into the defense sector.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting Poland on Monday amid growing tensions surrounding ongoing alleged provocations by Russia, including recent violations of NATO airspace.  

Wadephul was first meeting with his counterparts Radoslaw Sikorski from Poland and Jean-Noel Barrot of France for talks in the so-called Weimar Triangle format.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is also expected to join the meeting.

Later, Wadephul will give a speech on European security and deterrence capabilities at a security forum.

The visit comes two and a half weeks after Russian drones entered NATO member Poland's airspace during one of Moscow's strikes on neighboring Ukraine.

Some of the drones were shot down by the Polish Air Force and other NATO allies.

Ahead of the trip, Wadephul said that while Poland and Germany were not going to allow themselves to be forced into any escalation, ""we are leaving no doubt that we are determined and ready to fend off any threat together.""  

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has failed to take town halls in Sunday's three runoff mayoral elections in Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia. 

Candidates from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) beat their AfD opponents in the cities of Gelsenkirchen and Duisburg, while the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) of Chancellor Friedrich Merz won in Hagen.

According to preliminary state results, however, the AfD almost tripled its share of votes in councils and district councils to 14.5%, which put it in third place behind the SPD on 22.1%.

Almost 150 runoff elections were held on Sunday two weeks after local elections, including several mayoral contests and duels for district administrator offices.

The runoffs elections became necessary in cases where no candidate received more than 50% in the first round, with a simple majority sufficient to win in the second round.

Guten Tag from DW's newsroom on the banks of the Rhine in Bonn!

Runoff elections in Germany's most-populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) have been topmost in many people's minds. The failure of candidates from the far-right AfD to win mayoral contests in three major cities has come as a relief to those who fear that the party represents a danger to democracy.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to travel to Düsseldorf to celebrate his Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) win in the NRW capital city.

In other news, Germany's national carrier Lufthansa is planning to slash 4,000 administrative positions over the next five years.

Meanwhile, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues to dominate the agenda for European countries including Germany. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is in Poland to meet with his French and Polish counterparts to discuss measures in face of growing alleged provocations from Moscow.

North Korea and China have long been economic and strategic allies but the East Asian neighbors are looking to revitalize relations to counter the US.

The foreign ministers of China and North Korea on Monday agreed to deepen bilateral ties to resist ""all forms of hegemonism,"" in a thinly veiled reference to their pushback against the US.

The meeting between China's Wang Yi and North Korea's Choe Son Gui in Beijing comes weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended a massive military parade in the Chinese capital, hosted by China's President Xi Jinping.

""Maintaining, consolidating, and developing"" bilateral relations between Beijing and Pyongyang ""has always been the unswerving strategic policy"" of the Chinese government, Wang said. 

""China is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with [North Korea] in international and regional affairs, oppose all forms of hegemonism, and safeguard the common interests of both sides and international fairness and justice,"" he said, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout.

Meanwhile, North Korea's state news agency said the ministers had agreed on a variety of issues.

The agency quoted Choe as saying that North Korea ""is willing to closely cooperate with China in multilateral affairs, jointly resist unilateralism and power politics and promote a fairer and more just world order.""

Both China and North Korea view the US as an adversary. Washington and Beijing are economic and strategic rivals, whose ties have become more strained over US President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies.

The US views Pyongyang, meanwhile, as a threat to regional stability because of its nuclear weapons program.

Washington has consistently demanded North Korea give up its nuclear weapons, while Pyongyang says it needs the weapons to defend against threats from the US and its allies, namely South Korea and Japan.

China has long maintained influence over North Korea as its biggest trading partner and aid benefactor. However, bilateral relations cooled over the last few years as Pyongyang focused on expanding cooperation with Russia, supplying it with troops and ammunitions for its war in Ukraine.

Experts say Kim now wants to reinforce his ties with China in preparation for the eventual end of the war in Ukraine.

China is likely to send a delegation to North Korea next month for the 80th founding anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party.

I deeply value free speech and debate. The watchlist created by Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA is anathema to both.

I deeply value free speech and debate. The watchlist created by Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA is anathema to both.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

After the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk — one that I unequivocally found to be unconscionable, unacceptable, and sickening — I thought about his wife and children. I am married, and I have children. I can't imagine the unspeakable sorrow that Kirk's wife and children must be experiencing. So, I will continue to mourn his death and their loss. I do so because I believe in love, forgiveness, and the sanctity of human life. I also believe in the First Amendment. So, here we are.

In the aftermath of Kirk's tragic death, a great deal is being discussed now about his legacy regarding free speech and open debate. What I have to offer to readers in this regard is my own very personal experience of the organization that Kirk founded — Turning Point USA (TPUSA).

In 2016, TPUSA produced an online list titled “Professor Watchlist,” a site designed to identify professors who purportedly “discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” I don't “teach leftist propaganda in the classroom,” and I never discriminate against conservative students, but I was nevertheless placed on the list soon after its creation in 2016, apparently because I am a philosopher who examines the complex ways in which white people are socially and psychically complicit in the perpetuation of anti-Black racism in the United States.

There's no way for me to know whether or to what extent my placement on the Professor Watchlist extended or intensified the ongoing avalanche of racist threats and slurs that I had already started receiving after I published an open letter in The New York Times in 2015 titled “Dear White America” — a letter that sought to challenge the racist “innocence” of white people and was the source that Turning Point USA cited as grounds for placing me on their watchlist. But being placed on the Professor Watchlist undoubtedly magnified the feelings of trepidation and outrage created by the racist invective constantly pouring down on me throughout that time.

In response to “Dear White America,” I received an ongoing series of hate messages via email, voice message, and postal mail such as:

“Dear N***** Professor… You're a f***ing smug N*****. You are uneducated with education. You are a f***ing animal. Just like all Black people in the United States of America.”

“Hey Georgie boy… You wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for affirmative action. Somebody needs to put a boot up your ass and knock your f***ing head off your shoulders…”

“There are two ways you can return to Africa: On a passenger ship, or in a coffin freighter. Choose quickly.”

“In a sane world, this ugly n***** would be just beheaded ISIS style. Make America WHITE Again.”

With apologies to those who already encounter this kind of triggering hate speech regularly and do not need more of it in their lives, I reprint these examples here to show the ways in which there is a failure of vulnerability to truly listen to those deemed “the other,” dreams of returning to a white mythical past of “racial purity,” an unabashed ascendancy of white nationalism, political disinformation about white “victimhood,” an intentional disregard for civic responsibility, and an intentional fomentation of hatred by a Trumpian regime hell-bent on creating and exacerbating racial, political, and religious divisiveness. All of this is at the heart of what is actually shutting down space for civil debate and free speech in this country.

My personal experience underscores how projects such as this watchlist are not really about protecting “civil debate” and “free speech,” as some of Kirk's fans have argued.

And my personal experience of receiving this ongoing avalanche of hate in response to publishing an op-ed, and then being placed on the TPUSA's Professor Watchlist as an additional response to the same op-ed, underscores how projects such as this watchlist are not really about protecting “civil debate” and “free speech,” as some of Kirk's fans have argued.

The process through which I was placed on TPUSA's list was anathema to public debate. Instead of writing an op-ed in response to my New York Times op-ed, or inviting me to a public debate on these issues, TPUSA instead added me to an online list that is — as I explained in another New York Times op-ed back in 2016 — essentially a new species of McCarthyism.

I would never dream of subjecting the people I disagree with most vehemently to a list like this. I have no desire to create a watchlist that monitors conservatives and fuels their public denial or subjects them to violent retribution; I don't believe in shaming entire groups of people or targeting individuals through a list such as this.

The list — a dangerous and antidemocratic tool — follows a draconian playbook by spying on professors and labeling them as “troublemakers” for the U.S. establishment. It is a site for surveillance, control, name-calling. Functioning like a modern-day scarlet letter, the list can lead to ostracization, condemnation, and even the practice of self-silencing (because of the fear of being the object of actual or potential violence) for those who are placed on it.

Before placing me on this list, no one from TPUSA asked to speak with me. Kirk never asked to debate me about my views on whiteness, white privilege, or white embodiment. In being placed on the list, I was falsely labeled and marked in ways that are not true. I have recently listened to clips of Kirk complaining that there are those who didn't listen to him; in the clips he expresses frustrations about times when others just made assumptions about things that he didn't say, or distorted what he meant by what he said.

I understand his point because that's exactly what his organization, TPUSA, did to me. I was placed on the list without a mumbling word about making sure that I was given democratic space to debate my position on whiteness. TPUSA sought to tar and ostracize me as an “enemy” of conservative thought without first inviting me for civil debate.

Kirk and I would have had much to debate if our engagement had involved an in-person conversation rather than his organization simply placing me on a McCarthyist shunning list. It appears that we disagreed on many topics.

For example, though Kirk never said that all Black women lack “the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,” he did accuse Joy Reid, Michelle Obama, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ketanji Brown Jackson as “lacking” such brain processing power. All these women are Black and all of them graduated from Ivy League schools. So, what was the basis for Kirk's insult? He can't simply make such an egregious claim without that claim being mediated by the history of anti-Black racism. Indeed, his accusation was loaded with white racist overtones. So as not to miss Kirk's nuance, he says these women lack such brain power because they have benefited from affirmative action. He says they stole “a white person's slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.” The assumption that because they may have benefitted from affirmative action they are therefore not bright enough is a blatant non sequitur. He assumes that affirmative action involves the automatic lowering of standards. Affirmative action was never designed to discriminate, but to create an equitable playing field. To hold this position about brain power and affirmative action, it would follow, based upon Kirk's reasoning, that white women, the group that has benefited most from affirmative action, are also cognitively incompetent.

Similarly, when asked about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), Kirk responded, “Obviously [DEI is] about trying to destroy the excellence of the country and elevating racial tribal politics.”I'm not cherry picking here. Notice that he says, “obviously.” But to whom is this “obvious”? Certainly not to Black people, who have been enslaved in this country longer than we have been “free.” But let's face it, the United States was founded upon white racial tribal politics. 

Kirk also problematically raised the issue of race, affirmative action, and DEI while clarifying a statement that he made about Black pilots. Originally, his comment was within the context of United Airlines saying that it wanted 50 percent of its pilots to be people of color or women, which still disproportionately favors white men. Kirk went on to talk about how there are relaxed standards anytime there are racial quotas. And he extended his reasoning to air traffic controllers, professors, and college admissions.

He later clarified, “Boy, if I see a Black pilot, I'm now going to wonder is that individual qualified or were they selected because of their race.” He went on to assert that he had this thought not because of who he is, but because affirmative action and DEI hiring practices made him think that way.

Here's the problem. Being a qualified Black pilot and benefitting from affirmative action or DEI hiring practices are not mutually exclusive. When I've seen a Black pilot, I don't “hope” that they can fly the plane. I'm proud to see them. And if they have benefitted from affirmative action or DEI, this in no way creates trepidation for me about their qualifications. I am fine with the fact that United Airlines cares both about making sure some pilots are Black and also making sure that those same pilots are well-qualified.

This is a conjunction that Kirk rejected. Kirk also didn't seem to understand why United Airlines would be concerned with the color of the skin of the pilot. To wonder about this is to pretend ignorance about white supremacy in this country. Since Kirk didn't address this, I will. Actually, it is Kirk who was concerned with the color of the skin of pilots. His concern was part of the perpetuation of white racism and had everything to do with the whiteness of the skin of those pilots who have dominated aviation. United Airlines does not hire based upon racial quotas, which are illegal. Its aim was merely to open possibilities and opportunities for those who have been systemically and systematically excluded from the field and from the cockpit.

I hope that articulating my disagreements with Kirk here isn't interpreted as a virulent attack. I just think that he was wrong on these issues. In a functional democracy, to disagree with someone is a politically protected right, and it ought to be productive of greater mutual understanding and clarity. In fact, philosophically and democratically, agonism (a creative tension between interlocutors) is to be valued and treasured. In his book The Multivoiced Body, philosopher Fred Evans argues that agonism exemplifies an enduring creative interplay between voices, “not a reaction to enemies.” 

To engage in critique and productive disagreement should be the lifeblood of a democracy, and of this fragile experiment known as U.S. democracy. Yet, Donald Trump, JD Vance, Stephen Miller, and many right-wing activists are using the tragic occasion of Kirk's murder to foment retribution on those who disagree publicly with Kirk's views. Indeed, they are effectively and anti-democratically weaponizing the death of Kirk.  

Trump and his sycophants are implementing political repression, censorship, and politically targeting free speech, which means that those of us who believe in democratic speech, in dissent, in open and critical debate, are being targeted, are being silenced, are being marked for further violence. This is not new for Trump. As someone who aspires to be a political strongman, his modus operandi is to threaten to use government power to imprison and to prosecutethose who he sees as his political enemies, despite it being unconstitutional. The Justice Department is not, or should not be, a political tool to be wielded against one's perceived or real political rivals.

The soul of this country is at stake, if it has a soul worth saving. I don't say this flippantly. I say this because I mean it, and I am serious about it. I say it because I refuse to feign ignorance about what is happening to this country before our eyes. It is becoming increasingly fascistic. Is it now a crime to use that term, to speak freely? If it is, then that only confirms the truth that I speak.

The reactionary call for blood and collective punishment after the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk is a form of ethical debauchery and warmongering. For those who encourage it, especially those who identify as “Christians,” you might as well spit in the face of Jesus. Some of us — many of us — detest the murder of Kirk, even as we passionately disagree with his politics. I am one of those. As Frantz Fanon writes in Black Skin, White Masks, “Today I believe in the possibility of love; that is why I endeavor to trace its imperfections, its perversions.”

My question is, what do you believe in?

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Whenever a natural disaster is headed towards the prison where I am incarcerated, we all joke that we are in a fortress: safe because nothing can get in and no one can get out. But on January 25, 2025, I was reminded that outside disasters affect us here, too. That day, the Bureau of Prisons flipped my life upside down.

It was a cold Saturday morning, and the rest of the women and I were catching up on sleep. I awoke to banging on my door.

“Get up and get dressed!” a voice yelled.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

I began frantically asking where I was going. My bunkie woke up and tried to assure me that I was probably being drug tested or taken on a medical trip; she told me that I would be back shortly.

“A medical trip on the weekend? No way,” I thought to myself.

I threw on a coat and exited my room to find not one, not two, but three male officers waiting for me. Something was not right. One of the officers told me to place my hands behind my back. The cold metal of handcuffs hugged my wrists, and my heart began to echo my mind's suspicions. But the officers kept talking, claiming that they did not know what was happening, as they escorted my trembling body to the place no prisoner wants to go: the Special Housing Unit (SHU), solitary confinement.

Once inside, I was made to strip, squat, and cough, before being handed a thin orange jumpsuit. I wondered if I was dreaming, or having a flashback to when I was first arrested. Hours went by slowly as I stood in a holding cell with nothing but my racing thoughts, a stool, and a cage door facing the officer's station. A nurse, an officer, and a counselor walked by. I asked the same question, again and again. They said they didn't know why I was there. They casually told me to calm down; the lieutenant would be here shortly to explain.

Upon the lieutenant's arrival I begged for an explanation.

“Look,” she said. “Ever since Trump got back into office there have been many changes.”

And that's when I knew: The “rumors” I'd heard about Trump sending transgender women to men's prisons were not rumors after all. My bunkie and I had recently laughed about the crazy idea of me sharing a room with a man, but this situation was no joke.

“He signed an executive order recognizing only two genders,” the lieutenant continued. “We're sending you to a men's facility.”

That's when I let out a noise from deep inside my soul that I had never heard a human make before. Everything froze as my perception of time slowed. Seconds turned into hours as tears ran from my eyes.

“This has to be a mistake!” I began screaming. “I'm a woman, an aunt, I'm my mother's daughter!”

I leaned against the wall and slid onto the dirty floor, my physical self mirroring how low my mental self felt. “I can't go to a men's prison!” I screamed. “They will rape me to death!”

“We're sorry, there is nothing we can do. His new executive orders are affecting us as well,” the lieutenant told me. “I will give you a phone call to alert your family before we pack up your property for transfer.”

Within seconds, my temporary prison term became a potential death sentence, handed over by the president. All for merely existing.

I always thought that if I just minded my own business, educated myself, and kept my faith strong, I would eventually leave prison and return to my family in one piece. Now, I questioned whether I would even make it out alive.

My family and I immigrated to this country from Bosnia after we escaped the genocide in the 1990s. We were chasing the “American dream,” which, for me, had included my gender transition at 24 years old. I never believed that in 2025 the American government could put one of its own citizens in grave danger just for being themselves, or that being trans would constitute a death penalty.

Everything I believed was clearly wrong.

After being assigned to a cell in the SHU, I was granted my phone call. My mother already suspected that something evil had happened because my bunkie called to notify her that her daughter had been taken away somewhere. She broke down as I explained what happened. Her screams echoed my earlier words. “But you're a woman!” she cried. “You're my daughter. How can they do this?”

I had to end the phone call as she tried reassuring me that our family would find a solution.

Days went by as my hope disappeared and suicidal thoughts invaded my mind.

“I'll kill myself before I allow the government to do it,” I thought.

The following week slowly passed without relief. Finally, one afternoon, God whispered to me, telling me to finally rest. Yet once again, I was woken up by someone banging on my door. “Get your stuff, you're going back onto the compound!” the captain yelled.

I never imagined that I would be so excited to go back to prison. I rolled up everything within seconds and grabbed my mat. Apparently, the psychology department and central office had spoken and decided to let me stay – for now.

I found out that a lot happened in the days following my life-altering SHU experience. GLAAD had connected my family with a team of lawyers that, to this day, are fighting for my life, struggling to keep me from ever stepping foot into a men's prison. At the time of this writing, a federal judge has granted a temporary injunction requiring the Bureau of Prisons to keep me at a women's facility. I pray it will be made permanent.

Random women I'd never spoken to have approached me to tell me that they prayed for me after hearing the news, affirming that I belong with women and not men.

But none of this keeps the nightmares away. I have constant, graphic night terrors of men in prison uniforms raping and killing me. I have had to start mental health medication to minimize the debilitating panic attacks I now suffer every time I hear keys rattling at night.

While in prison, I have learned to choose my battles. I can roll my eyes at some petty issues. But others are so serious that they have to be treated as long, uphill struggles for change. The battle I'm in right now is for my very existence. By the grace of God, I have an army of kind people supporting me on my way to the top of the hill. I do not know what the future holds for me, but I believe that love will always trump hate. And for that belief, I am thankful.

Israel has held hospital director Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya in its torture camps for nine months.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, has lost about 55 pounds since Israeli forces abducted him in December, and is suffering from a serious case of scabies, according to Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), which visited him last week. The renowned pediatrician was given a new pair of clothes for the first time on September 25, the morning of his visit with PHRI, the group reported. 

Abu Safiya's request to see a doctor for the scabies and heart problems have been ignored, according to PHRI. 

“Dr. Abu Safiya described the violence perpetrated by prison guards during frequent cell searches,” PHRI posted on X. “According to him, detainees receive very small amounts of food, many of them have lost a significant amount of weight, and they have been held in dirty clothes for months.”

“Six months have passed since the publishing of our report, which documented the arbitrary detention of more than 100 medical personnel from Gaza,” the group continued. “Since the report's publication, our organization has visited more than 25 of them and gathered additional testimonies about ongoing physical violence, repeated cell raids, lack of food and medical treatment, and months of detention in dirty clothes.” 

All detained health care workers are “currently being held without charge, some for more than a year,” according to the group, which called for their immediate release. 

Israeli forces targeted Kamal Adwan Hospital long before the military abducted Abu Safiya in December. A year before his abduction, in December of 2023, Israeli forces conducted their first raid on the hospital and abducted its then-director, Dr. Ahmed Kahlout, according to a new documentary, “The Disappearance of Dr. Abu Safiya,” produced by Al Jazeera Fault Lines.

Israeli intelligence contacted Abu Safiya numerous times to try to get him to leave the hospital, as per the documentary. But the beloved pediatrician was undeterred. He spoke out about Israel's genocide, the miltiary's attacks on Kamal Adwan Hospital, and pleaded for help from the international community.

On October 25, 2024, Israeli forces raided the hospital again, and beat and interrogated more than 40 staff members, including Abu Safiya, according to DropSite News. The soldiers told him not to speak with journalists. During the attack, Israel killed the doctor's son at the hospital gates. 

On December 27, Israeli forces raided the hospital for the last time, and burned it to the ground. 

“Everyone in the hospital,” the Israeli military said on a loudspeaker, as per footage in the documentary. “The army surrounds you. You are surrounded.” 

“A big tank entered and stood by reception,” a nurse told Al Jazeera. “And it started firing. It was firing forward, firing and turning. And then they pointed the muzzle through the reception door and it was [pointing at] patients.”

At about 6 a.m., Israeli forces demanded to see Abu Safiya. Video captured him walking over rubble to the tank, wearing his white coat. The military ordered him to get everyone out of the hospital; with no other choice, he complied. At the time, about 350 patients, caregivers, and health care workers were in the hospital. 

That night, the army stripped, shackled, blindfolded, and beat the male members of the medical staff, including Abu Safiya, as per the documentary. 

Abu Safiya has been detained in Israel's torture camps without charge ever since. Numerous human rights groups have demanded his release. 

Israel has launched a yearslong assault on Gaza's hospitals, health care workers, and patients. Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed more than 1,700 medical staff, attacked close to 40 hospitals, and abducted hundreds of health care workers. Israel's blockade has deprived doctors of necessary medical supplies, forcing them to perform operations, including amputations, without anesthesia. 

Those held in Israel's prisons, where soldiers routinely torture Palestinians, have included “irreplaceable consultants and specialists in essential specialities like General Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Orthopaedics Surgery, Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care, Cardiology, Paediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynaecology,” according to a report released last year by Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), an organization that tracks Israel's systematic and brutal attacks on Gaza's health care system.

“Every healthcare worker who was interviewed by HWW following their release from detention in Israel described being subjected to severe pain and suffering while detained, in acts that amounted to inhumane treatment and torture,” the group wrote. 

Health care workers told HWW that they had been beaten; subjected to deafening music, sleep deprivation, and extreme cold; sexually assaulted with foreign objects; sexually humiliated; threatened with rape; and hung from ceilings. 

One nurse said that they were taken to a “10 x 6 metre room with four large loudspeakers and an air conditioner blasting extremely cold air, along with large fans.” (Truthout is using they/them pronouns to identify the individual victim as their gender is not shared in the report.)

“We were so cold and in so much pain that we couldn't stop moaning, but every time we made a sound, the soldiers would beat us,” the nurse said.

A paramedic told HWW when soldiers removed their blindfold, they saw at least 20 people in diapers, hanging from a warehouse ceiling. 

“[A]ll the detained had their heads down while they were hanging by their hands,” the paramedic said. “There were more than 10 more than 20, the whole warehouse had people hanged, everywhere I looked on the right, on the left, in front, in the back, it was an overwhelming number. From the screams it indicated dozens. He wanted me to see the torture and pain, he said this was only the first phase.”

Another paramedic said he was hung from the ceiling and electrocuted. 

“They put me in an overall that had electricity wires around it and put, like a headband with wires on my head,” they said. “I swear, it was so degrading, it was unbelievable. I was helping people as a paramedic, I never expected something like this.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

JEFFREY PRESCOTT served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies in Rome and is a Visiting Scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

JULIAN GEWIRTZ served as Senior Director for China and Taiwan Affairs at the U.S. National Security Council. He is Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University and the author of Never Turn Back: China and the Forbidden History of the 1980s.

 Beijing's Plans to Exploit American Retreat

 Jeffrey Prescott and Julian Gewirtz

A great unanswered question of the second Trump administration has been how its outright rejection of the existing global order would affect China's international strategy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called this order both “obsolete” and “a weapon being used against” the United States, and in his speech at the United Nations on September 23, President Donald Trump pilloried the “globalist” institution for “creating new problems for us to solve.” In the early months of this year, Beijing's response to Washington's attacks on the international order seemed mostly cautious and measured. China traded tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States, but it otherwise remained content to sit back and accrue benefits from Trump's alienation of U.S. allies and withdrawal from international institutions. 

That period of caution is now over. Beijing has decided on a much more ambitious course, putting its plans on vivid display at a September meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Hosting the once sleepy regional economic and security body, Chinese leader Xi Jinping clasped hands with Russia President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and met with 18 other leaders from across the Eurasian continent. A few days later, flanked by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Xi presided over a massive military parade in Beijing to show off China's fast-growing arsenal. Trump's comment about seeing the summitry on TV—“They were hoping I was watching, and I was watching”—inadvertently revealed the precise position in which China hoped to place the United States: the American president, so often the prime mover of global politics, had become a spectator on the sidelines of a changing world.

Xi aims to establish China as the fulcrum of an emerging multipolar world, and he is advancing a new, more active diplomatic strategy to realize that goal. Rather than force the United States out of its leading position in the international system or overturn the existing order, China is exploiting Trump's rapid, willing abdication of Washington's role. And China is building up its own power and prestige within existing institutions, seeking to shift their centers of gravity irrevocably toward Beijing. If this gambit succeeds, it will transform the international order from the inside out, placing China at center stage and undermining U.S. influence in ways that future American administrations may find difficult to reverse.

Not too long ago, foreign policy analysts might have shrugged off the pageantry of the China summit. After all, meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are often heavy on optics and light on substance. Disagreements among the group's key members, such as a long-running border dispute between China and India, have tended to outweigh their areas of commonality. Indeed, some commentators and U.S. officials dismissed the recent Chinese-hosted events as “performative,” “for show,” and merely a “photo op.”

Eight months into Trump's second term, this reading is optimistic at best. It discounts the extent to which global reactions to Trump's actions are reshaping the world. The international order that the United States built and maintained for decades is coming to an end, and what follows is up for grabs. Many countries are competing for influence, and short-term, transactional dealmaking rather than long-term cooperation is becoming the new norm, ushering in a phase that one of us called “mercenary multipolarity” in Foreign Affairs. The United States and China remain the two most powerful countries, but others, such as India and Russia, as well as the European Union, are significant players with their own agendas. And as U.S. alliances fracture under Trump, rivals of the United States are collaborating in increasingly meaningful ways.

Yet with the ultimate shape of this new order still undefined, Xi sees a window of opportunity to forge a China-centric world without directly taking on the United States by moving assertively into areas where Trump's “America first” policies leave openings. This project extends well beyond the optics of gathering global leaders in Chinese cities. While the U.S. president feuded with the leaders of Brazil and India, Xi addressed a virtual BRICS meeting hosted by Brasilia on the topic of “resisting protectionism” and welcomed Modi to China to shore up ties with these two key powers. While Trump imposes tariffs on much of the world and eliminates U.S. foreign assistance, Xi is courting the leaders of the developing world: Beijing announced cuts to Chinese tariffs on African goods in June and claimed in September that it would bolster efforts to reform the World Trade Organization to benefit developing countries' economic growth. While the Trump administration embraced unabashed technology nationalism, titling its AI action plan “Winning the Race,” China hosted its annual World Artificial Intelligence Conference under the headline “Global Solidarity in the AI Era,” claiming that Beijing wants to share the benefits of AI and announcing a new global AI governance project to do so. And whereas Trump attacked climate change as “the greatest con job ever” and skipped a UN summit on the issue, Xi has set an emissions reduction goal that, although remarkably unambitious, has earned him plaudits in some quarters. The list goes on.



Perhaps most worryingly for Washington, Xi's actions have made clear that this China-centric world will reward resistance to the United States. There is no better symbol of this promise than Xi's decision to give pride of place during the military parade in Beijing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose country has been under punishing sanctions for decades and has sent troops to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine. Xi similarly embraced other leaders who have pushed back against the United States in some way: Putin, Modi, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian all received a lavish welcome in China, too.

China is now focused on being seen not as a disrupter but as the defender of the international order, putting a new spin on its long-standing effort to secure a privileged position in existing institutions and to boost its capacity to set norms and rules inside them. Until recently, China preferred the safer course of criticizing unpopular U.S. policies and focusing its activities in areas that attract limited international attention, such as development, culture, and peacekeeping. But with a combative Trump questioning the very purpose of the UN at his speech before the General Assembly, Beijing has an international audience that may be more receptive to its overtures. “China has all along acted as a staunch defender of world peace and security,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at the UN just a few days after Trump's speech.

In September, Xi announced his Global Governance Initiative, which aims to put China's stamp on the United Nations system. It invokes the desire of many countries for a more “just and equitable” international order and makes China—rather than any other country or international body—the arbiter of what that new order will entail. Beijing is already advancing principles that work in its favor, such as an absolutist but selective conception of national sovereignty that it applies to itself but not to all countries, and marginalizing values that it sees as threatening, such as universal human rights. China has offered few details about how it would resolve disputes within or introduce reforms to international institutions, and it has no desire to foot more of the bill for costly UN programs. But given the disdain that the Trump administration has showed toward the UN, countries that are committed to the UN system may well accede to China's entreaties to support its new initiative and its positions on a variety of substantive issues. Paired with prominent if modest Chinese investments in UN bodies and their personnel, Trump's continued neglect, Xi hopes, will enable China to reshape these institutions to its liking.

As with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, analysts might once have rolled their eyes at the Global Governance Initiative as mere sloganeering. But it is one of a set of projects—including the Global Development Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative, and the Global Security Initiative—that Chinese officials are working intently to translate into reality. The scholars Sheena Chestnut Greitens, Isaac Kardon, and Cameron Waltz recently found, for instance, that China's internal security agencies have significantly increased their international policing partnerships and non-military security cooperation under the banner of the Global Security Initiative, especially in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific Islands but also in Africa and Latin America. As the United States steps back, China is quietly layering new kinds of partnerships on top of its already robust trade ties, with the aim that, over time, more countries will see Beijing—not Washington—as their most important relationship.

It is unrealistic to expect the Trump administration to suddenly change its approach to diplomacy and multilateralism or to see the wisdom of embracing allies and competing with China for influence at the UN. Such steps would have support among the American people, a strong majority of whom think that U.S. alliances benefit the United States and that the UN plays a necessary, if imperfect, role in the world. But these moves would simply be too much at odds with the administration's “America first” ideology to gain traction. For the next few years, therefore, the United States is likely to leave China with an open field in international institutions.

Xi's efforts may build additional momentum thanks to Trump's approach to diplomacy with Beijing. Ahead of his planned visit to China in 2026, Trump is focused on the optics of his personal relationship with Xi and on striking a bilateral deal—which, if prior negotiations are any guide, much of the world may judge as a good deal for China, even if Trump touts it as a win. Other countries are watching these negotiations closely, and any agreement that appears to reward China's resistance to U.S. demands will further entrench the view that China is gaining influence relative to the United States.

But China's success is not a foregone conclusion. Beijing may struggle to translate its grand aspirations into a real global realignment. Many countries understand that a China-centric world would come with strings attached, and Beijing may be unable to resist escalating its numerous territorial disputes in Asia or flexing its coercive capabilities. Time and again over the past decade, Beijing's actions—from punitive economic measures against major trading partners to maritime harassment of rival territorial claimants in the South China Sea—have invited pushback from countries that prize their autonomy. Now, those countries could resist China's order-shaping efforts by reducing their reliance on both Beijing and Washington. A more fragmented, anarchic world is not necessarily one that China will dominate.

Missteps by China or resistance from other countries could well thwart Xi's designs. For the United States, such setbacks can buy time—until different leadership in Washington once again has a vision of the future built around more than looking out for itself.

 Bolsonaro's Conviction Was the Fruit of U.S. Democracy Promotion

 Omar G. Encarnación

It's hard to imagine Washington taking a more heavy-handed response to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for having led a coup to stay in office after his 2022 loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. U.S. President Donald Trump has characterized the conviction as a “witch hunt” and retaliated with a 50 percent tariff on many Brazilian goods. The U.S. Treasury Department has hit Alexandre de Moraes, the Brazilian Supreme Court justice overseeing Bolsonaro's trial, with some of the harshest sanctions in the U.S. toolkit, including those intended for human rights abusers. 

Even U.S. military action against Brazil, which Trump designated a major non-NATO ally in 2019, appears to be on the table. When asked about the possibility of a Bolsonaro conviction, White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt warned: ""This is a priority for the administration, and the president is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America, to protect free speech around the world.” 

The harsh U.S. response to Bolsonaro's prosecution represents a tremendous irony: the conviction resulted from the work of institutions that the United States fostered for decades by pushing for reforms to strengthen the independence of the Brazilian judiciary. Put simply, the Bolsonaro trial was a triumph of U.S. democracy promotion. 

At the moment, democracy promotion is anathema in Washington. The Trump administration has made unprecedented cuts to democracy, human rights, and governance programs, including dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, slashing the State Department's democracy bureau, and freezing nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign assistance. Trump has said “there's no reason for USAID,” which he has called a “left-wing money-laundering scam.” These positions represent a wholesale retreat from the bipartisan post–Cold War liberal consensus positing that democracy promotion as a form of soft power could both benefit foreign countries and advance U.S. interests and principles. 

U.S. democracy promotion can rightly be criticized for its misplaced idealism and its excesses. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration tried to carry out nation-building in Afghanistan and Iraq on a scale not seen since the aftermath of World War II. Bush's disastrous campaign to democratize the Middle East soured the American public on such policies, which in turn allowed Trump to position himself as an opponent of democracy promotion and foreign assistance more broadly. And even in Latin America, U.S. democracy promotion has a checkered history, beginning with President Woodrow Wilson's moralistic crusade to impose democracy on Mexico in 1914. 

After the Cold War, however, Washington embraced a softer and smarter approach in Latin America, nurturing fledgling democratic systems across the hemisphere by strengthening democratic governance, elections, human rights, and the rule of law, including reforming judicial institutions and criminal justice systems. Investing in that form of democracy promotion paid significant dividends in Brazil. But in the years to come, Trump's abandonment of democracy promotion will make it harder for civil society and opposition parties to dislodge the autocratic forces that once again have begun to take root in Latin America. 

Historically, USAID was at the core of U.S. democracy promotion in Latin America, administering programs designed to strengthen democratic institutions, including by advising on elections, encouraging a free press, and promoting civic education. The agency also funded civil society groups working to expose and prevent corruption and increase government transparency. Less well known is the work of the National Endowment for Democracy, a quasi-autonomous agency whose government funding is currently in legal limbo. Created in 1983 by U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration, with an eye toward bringing change to the communist world, the NED has long enjoyed bipartisan support. 

In the 1980s and early 1990s, as countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay began to independently transition away from military dictatorship and toward democracy, the work of USAID and NED complemented U.S. counternarcotics programs, economic development assistance, humanitarian aid, and environmental protection. Throughout the 1990s, Washington prioritized judicial reforms intended to bolster the rule of law by training judges, prosecutors, and public defenders; helping law enforcement agencies build modern criminal investigative units; and offering fellowships for Latin American public servants to study at universities in the United States and intern at U.S. government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. 

The mission of strengthening the rule of law faced particular challenges in Brazil. The country has endured 14 military coups, from the 1889 coup that ended the monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of Brazil to Bolsonaro's failed 2022 attempt to prevent Lula from taking power. Only half of these succeeded. But after almost every failed attempt, the coup plotters enjoyed amnesty, most famously in 1985, when Brazil underwent its last transition from dictatorship to democracy. 

Other Latin American countries that had suffered under military dictatorships vigorously prosecuted the perpetrators of human rights abuses, but Brazil did not follow suit. It instead swept the regime's offenses under the rug, enacting a broad amnesty law in 1979 that was upheld by the Federal Supreme Court in 2010 and remains in place to this day. It was only in 2011 that Brazil organized a truth commission to chronicle human rights abuses the military committed between 1964 and 1985. 

Nonetheless, with help from the United States, Brazil made significant strides, mostly by enhancing the independence of its judiciary. Brazil's Federal Supreme Court has taken dramatic steps to expand the rights of historically marginalized communities including Afro-Brazilians, Indigenous people, and LGBTQ people. For example, when Brazil legalized gay marriage in 2013 (before the United States), the court noted that its intervention was needed given the lack of action from the Brazilian Congress. 



The strength of the judiciary has also enabled federal prosecutors to confront large scale corruption. In 2014, prosecutors launched Lava Jato, or Operation Carwash, a money-laundering investigation that exposed a host of criminal activities, including bribery, tied to Petrobras, the state-run oil company. The investigation became the biggest anticorruption dragnet in Brazilian history, leading to nearly 280 convictions and implicating top business people and politicians. It led to the imprisonment of the best-known of all Lava Jato defendants, President Lula, who served 580 days in jail. The investigation also provided the backdrop for the 2016 impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, who previously chaired Petrobras's board of directors, but was impeached on separate charges that she manipulated the budget. 

Nowhere has the strength of Brazil's judiciary been more evident than in the courts' bold confrontation of Bolsonaro and his illiberal agenda. Just months after Bolsonaro left office in 2023, the Superior Electoral Court, which oversees federal elections, prosecuted the former president for abuses of power linked to spreading misinformation about Brazil's electoral system. That conviction banned him from running for public office until 2030. In September, a panel of five judges on the Federal Supreme Court ruled 4–1 to convict Bolsonaro on five separate charges, including seeking to stage a coup, leading an armed criminal group, and attempting a violent abolition of the democratic rule of law—the first time the country has held coup plotters accountable. 

It's important not to overstate the role of U.S. influence, of course: the lion's share of the credit for this remarkable turnaround goes to the Brazilian people, who have erected strong democratic institutions in a remarkably short time. In 1988, following a participatory amendments process through the National Constituent Assembly, Brazil enacted a new constitution that guarantees a broad menu of civil, political, and human rights. It abolished the Electoral College (a holdover from the old regime used by the military to ensure that its candidates won the presidency) and afforded the Federal Supreme Court considerable powers to protect vulnerable communities and to prosecute corruption. In 2004, a constitutional amendment created the National Council of Justice to manage the judiciary, which has vastly improved the functioning and autonomy of the courts. 

But until Trump's return to power, U.S. support for democracy in post-transition Brazil had been steadfast, and never more so than when democracy itself came under attack. After Bolsonaro supporters stormed Brasilia on January 8, 2023, an act that eerily mirrored the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, U.S. President Joe Biden telephoned Lula to affirm Washington's “unwavering support for Brazil's democracy.” At Biden's request, Lula visited the White House in February 2023 to discuss strengthening democratic institutions and values. Following that meeting, the United States and Brazil initiated a series of collaborative projects intended to deepen the quality of Brazilian democracy, including a USAID-sponsored program to combat racial discrimination against Afro-Brazilians and Indigenous communities. 

Of course, Brazil's justice system is hardly beyond reproach. According to the Brazilian NGO Rio de Paz, only about eight percent of murders in Brazil lead to a criminal conviction. Many of the corruption-related convictions and sentences that resulted from Operation Carwash have been overturned—including Lula's. Washington has not made much of either issue. Moreover, some Brazilians have raised legitimate concerns about whether the Federal Supreme Court has grown too powerful for the good of democracy. And for a policy that purports to support the rule of law, U.S. democracy promotion has done little to advance transitional justice policies that seek accountability for the human rights abuses committed by the military. 

Nevertheless, it is difficult to ignore the cruel irony that at the precise moment when democracy promotion is bearing fruit in such a dramatic fashion in Brazil, the United States is turning its back on the policy. This will result in fewer resources dedicated to upholding the rule of law. Indeed, many Latin American NGOs are bracing for a “civil society recession,” as groups that depend on U.S. assistance close shop. Among the consequences will be a shrinking of the civic arena, which could create an opening for nondemocratic actors such as China and Russia to expand their regional influence. 

For its part, Trump's intimidation campaign over Brazil's conviction of Bolsonaro will also likely discourage other Latin American countries from prosecuting their own antidemocratic leaders. Because of Trump's actions, leaders who should be held accountable for undermining democracy, human rights, and the rule of law—including Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and Nayib Bukele of El Salvador—are resting more comfortably today. Brazil's successful prosecution of Bolsonaro still offers Latin American countries a model to emulate. But it will be harder to do so without help from the United States.

            Elon Musk's X is the “go-to platform for antisemitic posters,” according to a new year-long study shared exclusively with CNN.
    


            The research, by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, found that not only is antisemitism rampant on the platform, but also that the crowdsourced community notes are failing to effectively moderate posts — with just over 1% of the most-viewed antisemitic posts the group studied getting a community note fact-check.
    


            Accounts with many followers that post antisemitic content, whom the study dub as antisemitic influencers, are also gaining traction on X and reaching millions, the research found. Some of the most popular antisemitic influencers identified by the study paid for verification badges on X and are permitted to sell subscriptions to their accounts on X, meaning they can profit from hate.
    


            “The truth is that antisemitism has been present on X long before it was rebranded (from Twitter). It always had a problem with it,” CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed told CNN in an interview. “But to see it being tolerated, monetized and amplified so openly is still shocking.”
    


            With the help of OpenAI's GPT-4o model, the study identified over 679,000 posts containing antisemitic remarks between February 1, 2024, and January 31, 2025. (Researchers personally checked 5,000 of the posts and said the GPT-4o model had a high accuracy rate.) The research found that 59% of those posts espoused conspiracy theories about Jews, such as that Jewish people control governments, that Jews are satanic in nature, or that the Holocaust never occurred or misrepresentations of what happened during the Holocaust. The other 41% of the posts spouted antisemitic abuse, such as dehumanization of Jewish people or attacks on their character.
    


            X's policies prohibit attacking “other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease” on the platform. It also prohibits “inciting behavior,” intended to “degrade or reinforce” stereotypes, including dehumanizing a group of people or using slurs. X also explicitly prohibits the denial of mass casualty events such as the Holocaust.
    


            If a post violates these policies, X says it will restrict the reach of such content, and sometimes require accounts to remove the content before they can post again, or delete the content on its own.
    


            At the same time, Musk has allowed conspiracy theorists and antisemitic posters back on the platform on free speech grounds. For example, white supremacist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes' account was reinstated last year after being suspended in 2023.
    


            “It is better to have anti whatever out in the open to be rebutted than grow simmering in the darkness,” Musk posted on X after Fuentes' account was reinstated.
    


            The new year-long study found that X's content restrictions are not having much effect on antisemitic content. The more than 679,000 antisemitic posts identified were viewed 193 million times in total, the study said.
    


            X did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            In January 2024, after coming under fire for reposting an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X, Musk visited Nazi concentration camps in Europe. During an appearance there alongside right-wing podcaster Ben Shapiro, he said that X always favors “free speech” and that if “somebody says something that is false,” users can reply with a correction.
    


            Musk sang the praises of the platform's community notes feature. Community notes are user-generated context labels; if enough verified users vote that a context note is valuable, it will appear under a post.
    


            “We've put maximum resources and attention behind community notes, so if somebody tries to push a falsehood like Holocaust denial or something like that, they can immediately be corrected. And you can't get rid of the tag, it's like stuck on you,” Musk said at the time.
    


            But the new study found that community notes are failing miserably. The notes appeared on just over 1% of the most-viewed antisemitic posts, the study identified, including just two of the most-viewed Holocaust denial posts. Community notes were posted so late that they appeared for an average of just 22% of a post's viewership.
    


            The study found X took or forced the poster to take action on only 36 of the 300 most-viewed antisemitic posts, such as limiting their reach or removing the post.
    


            “Antisemitic conspiracy theories and hate that were once fringe have been wholly normalized – thriving in plain sight and amplified by X's failure to live up to its own policies,” said Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs.
    


            Ten “antisemitism influencers” accounted for 32% of all the posts identified as antisemitic in the study. One of the accounts has 2 million followers, while others have hundreds of thousands.
    


            Six of the 10 influencers were “verified” at the time of the study, meaning they pay for X Premium, get a blue checkmark and get their posts boosted by the platform to be seen by more users.
    


            Three of the 10 also had the ability to charge for subscriptions, meaning followers could pay for exclusive content. (One of the three influencers lost his subscription capabilities toward the end of the study's period in December 2024.)
    


            In an interview, Ahmed, the CEO of the CCDH, pointed out that when Musk bought Twitter in October 2022, he wrote in an open letter that he did not want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”
    


            “I'm afraid that for Jews, he's done precisely that … He's turned X into a hellscape fantasy, and that's just his own words,” Ahmed said.
    


            X sued the CCDH in 2023 over its research, accusing the group of violating the company's terms of service when it studied and then wrote about hate speech on the platform following Musk's takeover. X said it suffered tens of millions of dollars in damages from CCDH's publications. But a federal judge threw out the lawsuit in March 2024, excoriating the platform's case as plainly punitive rather than about protecting the platform's security and legal rights.
    


            “X didn't sue us for defamation. They sued us for the act of doing research,” Ahmed said. “People don't sue you for the act of doing research unless there's something they don't want you to find.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Police clash with protesters in Madagascar as thousands rally against water and power outages","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/africa/madagascar-gen-z-protests-intl","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 14:44:44 GMT","


            Police in Madagascar's capital fired teargas on Monday at thousands of people who returned to the streets for a third round of youth-led protests against water and power cuts, with many calling for the government's resignation.
    


            Inspired by the so-called “Gen Z” protests in Kenya and Nepal, the demonstrations are the largest the Indian Ocean Island has seen in years, and the most serious challenge President Andry Rajoelina has faced since his re-election in 2023.
    


            Authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Thursday after protests in the capital Antananarivo turned violent.
    


            Protesters on Monday gathered at a university in Antananarivo where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march through town, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed.
    


            In another part of town, police cleared rocks and telephone poles that protesters had used to barricade roads, and fired teargas to disperse the crowd, footage broadcast on Real TV showed.
    


            Many in the crowd called for the resignation of Prime Minister Christian Ntsay, his government, and Rajoelina.
    


Gen Z Moroccans denounce government priorities in some of the largest protests in years



            The latest protests come after Rajoelina said on Sunday he would thoroughly review and reform the governance in the country.
    


            “If there have been mistakes, I recognize them, and I am now looking for ways to correct everything,” he said in a speech in the Anosibe neighborhood of Antananarivo, where some looting and vandalism took place on Friday.
    


Why the ‘One Piece' flag is being hoisted across the world



            The protesters have adapted a flag used in Nepal where protesters forced the prime minister to resign this month and have also used similar online organization tactics as protests in Kenya last year that culminated in the government scrapping proposed tax legislation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Inside the cartel networks recruiting young Americans on social media","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/americas/cartels-recruiting-americans-social-media-latam-vis","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 10:00:51 GMT","


            At 20, the young woman was struggling. She'd just given birth and had tuition, rent and baby formula to pay for. A single mother in Phoenix, she was trying to make ends meet and build a future, studying for her psychology degree.
    


            “It kind of gets (to be) so much that you can't ask somebody for help,” she told CNN.
    


            Then one night, a Snapchat post seemed to offer a way out: “5-10k in a day lmk.”
    


            Desperate, she swiped up.
    


            “I said, ‘What is this for? What you guys doing?' And they had explained to me, ‘You're going to be picking up people.' And I'm like, ‘People? Do they need a ride? What's going on?'”
    


            She stopped short of pressing for details. She didn't have a car or even a license, so she was convinced she couldn't do the job anyway.  But she couldn't stop thinking about the money. A week later she had another idea: Her friend had a car and could drive. Could they split the money?
    


            “Yeah, we'll still pay,” came the reply.
    


            She didn't stop to think much about the dangers or whether the offer was too good to be true — or legal.
    


            Her friend headed south, collected a group of migrants near the border, and drove back again. Later that night, a man handed the young woman a wad of cash.
    


            She was now involved in migrant smuggling, enlisted by a Mexican cartel recruiter through social media. An American operating entirely inside the United States, she was nevertheless extending the reach of cross-border gangs making money from trading people and drugs.
    


            CNN has spent six months investigating how the cartels recruit, how people get sucked in and how law enforcement is tackling the problem which can, at first glance, look as innocent as a young, licensed person taking a drive through the desert.
    


            The easy money kept coming for the young woman, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals but spoke with CNN by phone.
    


            She said she did not know the man who brought her the money that first time, or all the times that followed.
    


            “It would always be random people … that would bring me the money to get paid,” she said. “And from that point forward, it was just me finding people that would go and … drive, and we would split the money.”
    


            For months, she reposted the same message on her own Snapchat story: “5-10k in a day lmk.” She helped to recruit scores of drivers who smuggled nearly 100 people north from the US-Mexico border, according to court documents.
    


            The risks became clear only when one of those drivers was stopped, she said.
    


            “That one guy I had on Snapchat messaged me like, ‘Hey, this person got pulled over, they got arrested, they're getting questioned, make sure you have everything off of your phone.' And I was like, whoa … what's happening. That's when I realized, OK, this is what's going on,” she said.
    


            But she didn't stop.
    


            “I feel like I fell too deep into what was going on … the money that was being made … I was, at the time, being selfish. … I really didn't care.”
    


            It took federal investigators at least four months to flag her account, and she was arrested soon after. She pleaded guilty to charges connected to being a social media recruiter and was sentenced to prison.
    


            Even after her release, she said, she never knew who was on the other end of the account.
    


            “To my knowledge it was one person that I would communicate with. But now … it could have been multiple people on one account … I truly have no clue who I was working for.”
    


            Experts believe the anonymous account was most likely run by an operative of the Sinaloa Cartel, which dominates smuggling routes through Arizona. Most of these anonymous accounts, authorities say, trace back to cartel-linked recruiters.
    


            Tech companies sporadically work with local police to track and deplatform harmful accounts, law enforcement sources say. The Drug Enforcement Agency, which specifically monitors narcotics smuggling nationwide, “works closely with numerous social media companies to strengthen their ability to combat drug trafficking on their platforms,” a spokesperson said. Without identifying specific platforms, the representative said that “while some companies have been highly receptive, others have been less engaged.”
    


            CNN reached out to several platforms that host smuggler recruitment material for comment.
    


            A TikTok spokesperson told CNN its teams use automated moderation technology to counter some of this material, which identifies harmful posts before they reach users' feeds; between January and March, the platform says it “proactively removed 95.6% of content which breached (TikTok's) policies on the trade or marketing of regulated goods.”
    


            The spokesperson also referenced an excerpt from the platform's community guidelines: “We respect human dignity and are committed to protecting people from exploitation. That's why we don't allow content that promotes or facilitates human trafficking or smuggling.”
    


            For its part, Snapchat said it similarly employs proactive detection designed to target the hiring of smugglers across the southern border of the US. The platform told CNN it has been able to detect and remove thousands of pieces of such content and noted that it blocks search results associated with smuggler recruitment.
    


            Meta, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Its community policies instruct users not to post content that “offers to provide or facilitate human smuggling” or “asks for human smuggling services.”
    


            The offers of cash for criminal work can pop into anyone's feed. CNN's six-month investigation uncovered hundreds of recruitment posts on Facebook, TikTok and Snapchat—some in Spanish but many in English.
    


            Those recruited are usually young adults between 18 and 25, according to more than two dozen attorneys who represent accused smugglers and were interviewed for this story.
    


            Among them, there's no distinct profile. Accused smugglers may be addicts, wannabe cartel foot soldiers, or straitlaced high schoolers, the lawyers said. Vicki Brambl, an assistant federal public defender in Tucson, Arizona, says certain risk factors—like a prior criminal history, drug use or growing up in a low-income household—can increase the likelihood someone will get involved with smuggling. But in one case, the son of a local cop was involved.
    


            “Anyone can be a target,” says Brambl, who's supervised dozens of smuggling cases. Many recruited to these networks, like the young woman in Phoenix, are desperate and see stacks of cash advertised on social media as either a way out or a risk worth taking; Brambl added many don't have the maturity or judgment to realize the dangers.
    


            The hundreds of social media posts advertising smuggling jobs analyzed by CNN show patterns and some veiled terminology.
    


            The word “smuggler” almost never appears; recruiters opt for terms like “drivers” or “choferes” or simply “taxis.” A taxi or car emoji can also put out a call for drivers, sometimes with chicken emojis to indicate “pollos,” Spanish slang used to refer to migrants.
    


            Emojis and coded language enable cartel-linked recruitment accounts to circumvent content moderation restrictions on mainstream social platforms, which have seen scattered attempts to clamp down on narco-related content. TikTok banned the hashtag #carteltok earlier this year, though it is almost never used by members of these stateside criminal networks.
    


            But the cartels do want the posts to be elevated into people's feeds, so many use hashtags, like #fyp (for you page) and #viral, in addition to tagged locations in population hubs along the US-Mexico border.
    


            After establishing communication on mainstream social platforms, the recruiter often moves the conversation to Meta's WhatsApp, with its end-to-end encryption and ability to track others in real time.
    


            Next, the smuggler travels hours or even days to coordinates sent by their anonymous recruiter — some from as far as New York or Seattle, law enforcement officers and recruiters in Arizona and Texas said.
    


            Coordinators can use real-time location tracking to monitor their drivers en route — and post screenshots to encourage prospective recruits.
    


            At the pickup location, often down a remote dirt road, lawyers said, a group of migrants jumps into the car. What happens next is up to chance: Some drivers make it to drop-off locations in Phoenix or Tucson, dodging license plate readers and checkpoints on desert highways saturated with police.
    


            It's possible to circumvent law enforcement — one active cartel recruiter boasted about having ‘bought off' three checkpoints and federal agencies have admitted several of their officers helped facilitate smuggling in recent years.
    


            Other drivers are arrested — collateral damage in a massive criminal enterprise they can only begin to grasp.
    


            Now, the incentive for young Americans to get involved is on the rise: With illegal border crossings falling amid the Trump administration's crackdown, the price to cross has increased dramatically, and bigger payouts are available for drivers, according to the active recruiter and a former federal law enforcement official.
    


            In a Phoenix parking lot, a man grumbled that the Trump administration has made his job more difficult.
    


            The senior Sinaloa Cartel operative, whom CNN interviewed to better understand the inner workings of these cross-border networks, is responsible for directing the flow of migrants and drugs in southern Arizona.
    


            Several of his associates have been jailed since Trump took office.
    


            Earlier this month, the Drug Enforcement Agency announced 617 arrests and over $12 million in currency and asset seizures during a concentrated effort to dismantle Sinaloa Cartel operations in the US and abroad.
    


            The man, whose position CNN confirmed independently, said he could be arrested too, but that would not stop the business.
    


            “People are still going to bring things” into the US, he said, adding he thought the administration's focus was misguided. “(Trump) wants to fight with the Mexicans, with others … but the problem is here.”
    


            He said the drivers recruited through social media should know the risks. “When you want to work … yes, you understand.”
    


            But it seems even he wishes he had never gotten involved.
    


            Years ago, he said, he began working for the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico, smuggling marijuana to feed his family. Now, he might make a different choice. “No vale la pena,” he says: Cartel work isn't worth the risk.
    


            Nearing 9 p.m. in the border town of Douglas, Arizona, a team of counter-smuggling detectives was wrapping up for the night.
    


            In the final days of an 18-month investigation, the officers spent the afternoon surveilling suspects they believed were involved in managing one corridor where migrants and drugs pass into the US.
    


            Then, one of the Cochise County Sheriff's deputies spots a suspect's gray sedan parked outside a nearby ATM.
    


            The officer swung his undercover truck around, radioing his team to converge on a man who was depositing a $50 bill into the machine. “All right, I'll pull behind him and pin him in.”
    


            They closed in. “Police, don't move!” one of the officers yelled, drawing his rifle.
    


            They detained the man, a 21-year-old out with his girlfriend and their toddler, and then searched his Chevrolet Malibu.
    


            They found a baptism gown wrapped in plastic hanging in the back seat and an iPhone in a bedazzled case, which the couple shared. Police said its screen still showed a WhatsApp conversation about a group of “pollos” who had just crossed the border nearby.
    


            Another conversation from just a few days before mentioned a failed attempt to pick up a group of migrants. “We dipped because that pollo stopped answering and there was border patrol,” one of the man's associates told him, according to law enforcement.
    


            The officers told CNN the young man helped run a criminal syndicate that transported migrants and drugs across the border. A detective walked him across the parking lot to say goodbye to his family, then guided him into a waiting squad car.
    


            The iPhone was bagged as evidence to be brought back to the Cochise County Sheriff's Office and searched for signs of his involvement with cross-border smuggling, like recruitment ads posted to social media.
    


            Away from targeted operations, the counter-smuggling team patrols Cochise County's 83-mile stretch of the border. The desert sprawls into the Mexican state of Sonora and on distant peaks, the sheriff's deputies say, cartel scouts sit with binoculars watching their every move.
    


            To evade law enforcement, smugglers have used repurposed school buses, fake border patrol trucks and other means to move their product, and only close inspections can distinguish these from the real thing.
    


            So, the patrols flag down suspicious vehicles and check them, one by one, harnessing a sophisticated network of license plate readers and other high-tech monitoring tools to suggest who might be out of place, like a college student, far from home, hoping for a quick payday after clicking on a post in a social media feed.
    


            Federal prosecutors levied smuggling charges against 431 people over the past six months in Arizona alone, Department of Justice data shows.
    


            Earlier this year, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and several other legislators introduced a bipartisan bill calling for a crackdown on cartels using social media to recruit. It has made no progress in the Senate or the House of Representatives.
    


            The recruitment posts, however, continue.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Kamala Harris is trying to figure out what's next","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/politics/kamala-harris-107-days-profile","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 10:30:51 GMT","


            On what otherwise would have been her 247th day in the White House, Kamala Harris was in New York to finish the first stops of the tour for her book about the 107 days of the campaign that didn't get her there.
    


            Outside the venue, a collection of bouncers boosted the on-loan California officers by rearranging bike racks, trash boxes, a flowerpot and a few stacks of collapsed beer boxes borrowed from the busboys at the restaurant next door. They were trying to set up some sort of protected path to her car.
    


            Inside, they were serving a custom “Madam VP” cocktail: gin, cassis, cardamom, lemon and honey. Outside, a street vendor set up with leftover “She Can Do It!” T-shirts in a wide selection of sizes and colors.
    


            Pundits have lashed out at Harris over the book. Top Democratic operatives grated over what they feel is a relitigating of the 2024 election that they didn't need and certainly don't need now. The most common word used by aides to several of the politicians knocked in “107 Days” was “bizarre.”
    


            The handful of loyalists to former President Joe Biden who, even when they were all in the White House, ruefully marked the anniversary of the day she blew him up in a Democratic primary debate found things to rage over. A range of her own campaign alumni, including some name-checked in the pages, say privately they don't agree with certain assessments and don't get why she would write them.
    


            President Donald Trump sarcastically promised to buy the book. Vice President JD Vance said she'd have lost by more votes if she'd had more days.
    


            Then there's Harris herself, with a book already in its fifth printing one day after the official release, playfully hip-checking a slimmed-down Doug Emhoff in the freight elevator leaving Essence magazine's offices in Brooklyn, then doing it again with a smile to make sure her husband realized it wasn't just a bump in the ride.
    


            There are the crowds who have been showing up, the type of people who will pay upward of $100 for a ticket and still see her defeat more about what was wrong with America than what was wrong with her. Among the people waiting in her photo line was Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt, bubbling that sales have been so good after years of nonfiction and political books struggling.
    


            “It's very nice to have something up there with a romantasy novel,” Daunt said after meeting her.
    


            Falling into politician mode, Harris ticked through conversations with a retired police officer who approached her at the Philadelphia location of the same spice store chain she visited on a break from debate prep last year, a person on the train who told her he's scared, the students from her alma mater now wondering if federal agents will descend on campus doing ID checks.
    


            Asked if all this makes her, essentially, stuck as a walking embodiment of an alternate reality, she said, “I don't think so.”
    


            “I don't think this is about nostalgia,” Harris told CNN in one of several exclusive interviews last week. “I wrote the book with the intention that this would be about remembering where we were, only for the purposes of contextualizing this moment, and then thinking about where we have to go.”
    


            The events end, the doors close. There are no national security calls coming in. No campaign for governor back in California that she thought she'd be able to weave this book tour into. Several people who know her tell CNN they don't think her book will be a problem for a 2028 presidential run because that isn't where she's headed anyway.
    


            She is about to turn 61 – not young, but not old enough for her political career to be cut off. She is left trying to figure out her own place. How to have a voice in what Democrats do next. Hoping Democrats care what she may have to say, especially as she's stepped out of her Brentwood bubble to get a better sense of what's happened since she lost.
    


            For now, she's trying to work through whatever her next stage will be. She's trying to understand how little trust Americans seem to have for each other in this path for America she was trying to stop, and all the disruptions and political violence that have come with it.
    


            “Threats are not new to me. I've had death threats my entire career. I used to put people in prison. I've taken on gang crime. I'm not naive and I try to be thoughtful, but I am not going to be afraid,” she told CNN. “I really love it when we can do whatever I can do to create a sense of people feeling community. I think that's what we need right now, and I'm not going to take myself out of that.”
    


            She shrugs off the Democrats snapping back at her book.
    


            “We've got to get out of our own head. And we got to get out of our own bubble thinking we're the only ones involved in the conversation,” Harris said. “Because actually, we're just having a conversation with each other, and there's a whole country out there that wants to be seen and wants to be heard in a way that is not transactional and in a way that is actually about accurately and truly listening.”
    


            Harris calls her book “a journal,” but by that, she means the conceit of having each chapter describing a day of her campaign. She did not keep an actual journal, or even many notes, beyond those she partially reproduces toward the start of the book tracking the responses to her calls locking up support in the hours after Biden dropped out.
    


            She struggled  over what to say, particularly about Biden. Only after the initial draft was sent back by the publisher as too bland did she work in some of the lines that have been stirring up most of the agitation.
    


            “I knew when I was writing it that it would invite attacks or criticism, which I don't want, but that versus candor – for the sake of hopefully inviting difficult, though they may be honest, conversations,” she said. “That's the choice I made.”
    


            She talked to Biden about writing that he showed his age and that he shouldn't have been left to decide on seeking re-election, suggesting that she was guilty of “recklessness” for not pushing him to reconsider. She says their relationship is in fine shape.
    


            On stage in New York, she said there were a number of what she called “f**k it, Dougie” moments when she told her husband that she needed to take a bigger chance and speak out. Asked by CNN if any of those moments had come after seeing something that made her want to stop Biden from running again, all she would say was, “Marital privilege.”
    


            Staff sent copies around to Tim Walz, whom she says she never meant to insult by writing that Pete Buttigieg was her first choice for vice president. They also talked before the book was released.
    


“There are things that actually have surprised me about how people have interpreted some parts of the book. That was never intended. I didn't even think that anyone would interpret that part as Tim Walz was second choice,” Harris said. “If I had, maybe I would have said, ‘It doesn't mean that Tim is second choice.' That was not on my mind at all, not on my mind at all.”
    


            People close to Walz are mad but even though the excerpts landed right as he was launching his campaign for a third term as Minnesota governor, Walz has not gotten too hung up on what she wrote, according to a person who knows him.
    


            The book does occasionally have flashes of self-criticism, if not deep self-reflection.
    


            Even at its most revealing, “107 Days” often gives only a mostly accurate account of a portion of the story. The parts about Biden or his aides undercutting her tend to leave out her own struggles.
    


            The parts about not picking Buttigieg because she worried that the country wouldn't be ready for a gay man on the ticket with a Black and South Asian woman elide how she was the one who decided not to try. They seem to imply Buttigieg agreed with this assessment at the time. But the two didn't have that conversation.
    


            Though sometimes her laughs are forced, one of Harris' skills is inflecting lines she's said dozens of times to make the emotions sound mostly fresh. Now she's worked passages from the book, often verbatim, into her repertoire.
    


            Getting Harris to speak about her actual emotions, even about a loss she says brought grief only comparable to the night her mother died, remains tough. Though she says these days she is feeling freer, she also insists she's more focused on the pain and frustration of seeing what comes from having a “buffoon” in charge, of seeing the country brought lower in the eyes of Americans and the whole world.
    


            “We almost don't have language for all of this because the word ‘erosion' so minimizes what actually is happening. ‘Destruction' is probably the closest. And understand that when we're talking about destruction, it goes hand in hand with profound harm,” she said. “That's where my head is.”
    


            “I don't have the luxury, frankly, of being too steeped in the disappointment.”
    


            The person who'd have become the first woman to be president if roughly 230,000 votes across three states went the other way arrived back in Washington, DC, two days after kicking off her tour for the first time since Trump's inauguration. She rode a train to Union Station and stayed in the downtown hotel where top supporters had gathered for their pre-Election Night VIP reception last year.
    


            The next day, she took what her remaining hodgepodge of staff refers to with scare quotes as a “motorcade” – three rented SUVs with makeshift flashing lights stuck on the dashboards – over to Howard University, arriving at the edge of the campus quadrangle known as “The Yard.” Harris had planned to deliver her victory speech at her alma mater and instead returned the next afternoon to try to reassure her supporters that all hope was not lost.
    


            Hundreds of cheering students mobbed her, some running out of buildings still wearing their lab coats. She signed a book for a sophomore from her hometown with, “Remember to dream with ambition and lead with conviction. Oakland knows how to do it.”
    


            Harris used to tell advisers begging her to loosen up in public that she couldn't without causing problems for herself as a woman of color. On Friday, she expressed her outrage at former FBI Director James Comey's indictment when asked by CNN with an adamant, “Are you f**king kidding me?”
    


            Hours later, she finished little chats with old colleagues on the 45-minute line who waited excitedly to take photos with her backstage at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner. “I'm coming to you,” she told Eleanor Holmes Norton, the 88-year-old Washington, DC, congressional delegate facing Bidenesque pressure to retire, as Norton slowly walked to her. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar gave her a double-cheek kiss.
    


            “Stay strong, Bobby Scott,” Harris told the Virginia congressman as he shook her hand again before leaving. “Stay strong.”
    


            She followed up with a short, sharp speech attacking congressional Republicans who “bend the knee and fail to uphold their constitutional duty” against an “unchecked, incompetent, unhinged president” with a “fragile ego” who is lining his own pockets while raising costs on others.
    


            What can come off as typical platitudes, like “Never limit yourself by others' limited ability to see what you can do,” hit hard like inspiration to those who remain attached. “I'm in church,” Essence chief content officer Michelle Ghee told Harris in response to that one, prompting another woman in the crowd to say, “Amen.”
    


            Rhode Island Rep. Gabe Amo said afterward there was, “a collective sadness in the room” during the speech.
    


            “Sadness,” Amo said, “for our country, given all of the chaos and destruction of the Trump presidency, and the feeling of loss for what nearly all in the room worked for — what could've been in a Harris presidency.”

            New York City Mayor Eric Adams ended his reelection bid Sunday to the tune of Frank Sinatra's “I Did It My Way,” walking down the stairs of Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, and sitting down next to an enlarged photo of his late mother to say he was exiting the field.
    


            “Only in America can a story like this be told,” Adams said.
    


            It was an ending similar to the beginning, when Adams, standing in the middle of Times Square held a photo of his mother as he was sworn in as New York City's second Black mayor, promising to represent the interests of working-class New Yorkers.
    


            Nearly four years later, Adams said he was ending his bid for reelection because of a lack of funding and a media campaign that he felt had sought to undermine his chances.
    


            Adams' exit from the race will breathe new, if temporary life into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's struggling campaign.
    


            There was cautious optimism among members of Cuomo's operation on Sunday. Two senior aides to Cuomo who were granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations said the campaign was confident Adams' exit would help consolidate badly needed support behind the former governor including from some unions and Black supporters who were supporting Adams.
    


            The sources said high-powered donors who could pitch in significant sums of money were also expected to help the Cuomo campaign – a crucial boon for any candidate particularly as the race enters its last stretch before the general election in New York City's expensive media market.
    


            Over the next few weeks, Cuomo is expected to broaden his message and try to appeal to more than just moderate Democrats who do not support candidate Zohran Mamdani who is a democratic socialist. The sources said the campaign also wants to target Republicans who do not believe Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa is a viable candidate.
    


            Cuomo's campaign does not expect Sliwa to leave the race, the sources said. Instead, the campaign hopes to “minimize” his presence and broaden its appeal to Republicans who do not see Curtis as a serious candidate and do not want to “waste their vote.”
    


            A senior aide to Cuomo also left open the possibility for a potential endorsement from Adams who appeared to highlighted the importance of experienced candidates in his video.
    


            Cuomo aides are not sure they want an outright endorsement but are hoping to keep relations warm. Cuomo's statement after Adams' announcement praised his record despite their past differences. As of Sunday afternoon, though, Cuomo had not spoken with the mayor directly.
    


            News that Adams would end his reelection bid reached Mamdani as he was about to greet volunteers at a canvas event in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Mamdani continued his scheduled stops on Sunday, including a visit to Black-owned small businesses in Brooklyn before rushing to campaign headquarters in Manhattan where he recorded a video response to Adams' announcement and did a round of TV interviews.
    


Obama's advice, socialists' demands, meetings with skeptics: Inside Mamdani's prep to run New York City



            Over the next few weeks, Mamdani's campaign expects to roll out several endorsements and continue the frenzied pace of campaigning Mamdani has sustained in recent months. While Mamdani has decreased the number of publicized events, aides say he spends most days in meetings bouncing between coalition building and setting up his potential transition while continuing to appear in houses of worship across the city and attending volunteer events.
    


            Internally, aides to Mamdani see Adams' exit from the race as a boost and confirmation of a central line of attack Mamdani has deployed against his chief opponent in recent weeks: That Cuomo is Trump's chosen candidate and that his campaign represents the interests of the city's elite business class, billionaire donors and real estate powers who already spent millions of dollars during the primary to try and derail Mamdani's campaign.
    


            Sliwa, a radio host whose claim to fame is founding the Guardian Angels – a vigilante watchmen group that patrolled the streets of New York City in the 1980s – showed no signs of exiting the race as of Sunday.
    


            Although Sliwa is polling ahead of Adams in the most recent surveys, Democrats largely outnumber Republicans in New York City by more than 6 to 1, making his path to victory extremely unlikely.
    


            Sliwa, who has never held public office and has no prior government experience, has focused his campaign on public safety.
    


            The writing had been on the wall for Adams' reelection bid for weeks.
    


            Facing a pressure campaign to leave the race, Adams lashed out in recent days, blaming the media for trying to “undermine” his reelection, saying a constant stream of negative headlines about his reelection prospects had made it virtually impossible for him to raise money to fund his run.
    


            “I cannot continue my reelection campaign. The constant media speculation about my future and the campaign finance board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign,” Adams said in a video announcing he was leaving the race.
    


            In reality, it was a steady stream of corruption scandals involving members of his inner circle and senior members of his administration coupled with Adams' efforts to cozy up to Trump after his own federal indictment last year that proved fatal for his reelection chances.
    


            Adams, a retired New York Police Department Captain has overseen a record drop in crime over the last three years and notched significant accomplishments during his administration – including a major overhaul of the city's land use rules which have opened the door to build much needed housing and development.
    


            Governor Kathy Hochul – who endorsed Mamdani earlier this month – praised Adams' record, saying she had been proud to work with him.
    


            “He leaves New York City better than he inherited it and that will always be central to his legacy as mayor,” Hochul said in a statement.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York who has held back his endorsement of Mamdani and is not considered an ally of Adams, also praised the mayor's record. Jeffries made it clear he would not weigh in on the race just yet, saying he would do so “well before the start” of early voting in New York City, which begins at the end of October.
    


            Adams, who had recently increased campaign-style events is now expected to focus the next few months on solidifying his legacy as prepares to leave City Hall and it remains unclear whether he will seek to help or hurt any of the remaining candidates in the race.

New Mexico lawmakers are to open a special session Wednesday to boost funding for food assistance and rural health care — actions the Democratic governor contends are needed to “minimize the damage from President Trump's disastrous bill” cutting federal taxes and spending. 

The special session follows one in Colorado, where the Democratic governor asserted Trump's tax cuts wreaked havoc on the state's budget. Oregon's Democratic officials also are wrestling with whether a special session is needed. And California Democrats recently passed new spending measures meant to counteract Trump's big bill.

Nothing like that is happening in Republican-led states. 

The diverging responses highlight the partisan schism over Trump's signature legislative accomplishment of his second term and raise the question: Are Republican-led states ignoring the financial fallout, or are Democratic-led states overstating the urgency?

“Probably Democrats are doing a little bit for grandstanding,” said Steven Rogers, an associate political science professor at Saint Louis University who focuses on state governments.

“On the Republican side, they may also just be OK with it — or they don't want to poke the Trump bear,” Rogers said.

The sweeping new law, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by Republicans, is likely to affect some states more than others. Federal tax cuts could reduce revenues for states that link their own income taxes to the federal code, starting with 2025 tax returns.

Federal spending reductions on Medicaid and food benefits also could cause states to spend more of their own money on social safety net programs. But new Medicaid work requirements, which are among the most prominent changes, don't begin until 2027. Administrative cost shifts to states for food stamps begin in October 2026, with additional performance-based cost shifts in subsequent years. 

Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has called upon New Mexico lawmakers to preemptively earmark more money this fiscal year toward food assistance and rural health care. 

Lawmakers also are looking to expand state subsidies for health insurance policies bought through the Affordable Care Act exchange, which covers about 75,000 residents. They point to the potential for enhanced federal subsidies to expire at the end of this year. 

“We're not going to sit idly and watch that disaster happen,” said Democratic state Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth. 

Though New Mexico expects to lose about $200 million annually because of new federal tax cuts, starting this fiscal year, it still has a large surplus thanks to booming oil production.

“We're in a position fiscally to be able to be proactive,” Wirth said, “and really try and hold New Mexicans as harmless as we can to these cuts that are coming.”

Legislation recently signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom provides $255 million for California's response to Trump's big bill and other federal policy changes. That includes $84 million to try to reduce errors in benefit payments in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Those food benefits currently are fully covered by the federal government, but states with error rates greater than 6% could have to pay part of the cost starting in October 2027.

Trump's big bill also expands work requirements for adults participating SNAP, which is expected to force some people off the program in the coming months. The California legislation provides $40 million for counties to implement the new SNAP requirements and pumps $20 million into emergency food banks, a one-third increase over previously approved state funding.

“We have been as diligent, as strategic as we can to backfill as much of those dollars as we can,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat, told The Associated Press. 

The new spending comes as California budget officials warn of a looming multibillion-dollar deficit.

Because their tax codes are closely linked to the federal one, most of the new federal tax breaks automatically apply to state income taxes in Colorado and Oregon.

In August, Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis became the first to call lawmakers into special session while citing Trump's bill. His administration said the federal tax cuts blew an estimated $783 million hole in the current state budget. 

The Democratic-led Legislature filled part of that gap by eliminating some corporate tax breaks and authorizing the sale of state tax credits to raise revenue. 

In Oregon, Democratic officials are weighing whether to decouple from some of Trump's tax changes to avoid losing hundreds of millions of state tax dollars. Such a move could allow the state to continue taxing tips and overtime wages. 

“It is a very politically risky bill to pass, let alone have a special session again for ANOTHER tax vote,” Democratic state Rep. Rob Nosse said in a recent newsletter. “But at the same time it will allow us to stave off some of the cuts coming to health care and to food stamps.”

Like Colorado and Oregon, the Republican-led states of Iowa, Montana and North Dakota also use “federal taxable income” as the starting point for their state taxes and automatically incorporate federal tax changes. Yet officials there haven't raised major concerns.

Montana stands to lose an estimated $114 million annually as a result of the new tax cuts. But lawmakers likely can wait until their next regular session in 2027 to address any impacts, said Republican state Rep. Larry Brewster, chair of the Legislature's interim revenue committee. 

“I think it's a concern, but I don't think it's an urgent problem for us,” he said.

Leaders of the North Dakota Legislature, which isn't scheduled to meet until 2027, are discussing holding a session early next year, but not because of federal tax cuts. Rather, lawmakers would decide how to spend the state's share of $50 billion of rural health care grants included in Trump's big bill.

Iowa's conformity to the federal tax code could cost its general fund $437 million this fiscal year, according to the state revenue department. The state's finances also could suffer from Trump's trade war with China, a top export market for farmers. The state still has billions of dollars in reserves. 

“We're in a good position to weather some of the ag and some of the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said, “but we also have to be mindful as we move forward.”

Electronic Arts, the maker of video games like “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” and “The Sims,” is being acquired for $52.5 billion in what could become the largest buyout ever funded by private equity firms. 

Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF, and Affinity Partners will pay EA's stockholders $210 per share. Affinity Partners is run by President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The deal is valued at $55 billion if EA's debt is included, far exceeding the $32 billion price tag to take Texas utility TXU private in 2007, which had shattered records for leveraged buyouts. 

PIF, which was currently the largest insider stakeholder in Electronic Arts, will be rolling over its existing 9.9% investment in the company. 

The commitment to the massive deal is inline with recent activity in the gaming sector by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote Andrew Marok of Raymond James. 

“The Saudi PIF has been a very active player in the video gaming market since 2022, taking minority stakes in most scaled public video gaming publishers, and also outright purchases of companies like ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely,” he wrote. “The PIF has made its intentions to scale its gaming arm, Savvy Gaming Group, clear, and the EA deal would represent the biggest such move to date by some distance.” 

PIF is also a minority investor in Nintendo.

If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company that began with its shares ending its first day of trading at a split-adjusted 52 cents. 




The IPO came seven years after EA was founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, who began playing analog versions of baseball and football made by “Strat-O-Matic” as a teenager during the 1960s.

CEO Andrew Wilson has led the company since 2013 and he will remain in that role, the firms said Monday. Electronic Arts would be taken private and its headquarters would remain in Redwood City, California.

“Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future,” said Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. “I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.”

The size of the video game market has attracted large investors in recent years. 

One of EA's biggest rivals Activision Blizzard was snapped up by technology powerhouse Microsoft for nearly $69 billion in 2023, while the competition from mobile video game makers such as Epic Games has intensified.

This marks the second high-profile deal involving Silver Lake and a technology company with a legion of loyal fans in recent weeks. Silver Lake is also part of a newly formed joint venture spearheaded by Oracle involved in a deal to take over the U.S. oversight of TikTok's social video platform, although all the details of that complex transaction haven't been divulged yet.

Silver Lake also bought out two other well-known technology companies, the now-defunct video calling service Skype in a $1.9 billion deal completed in 2009, and a $24.9 billion buyout of personal computer maker Dell in 2013. After Dell restructured its operations as a private company, it returned to the stock market with publicly traded shares in 2018.

By going private, EA will be able to retool operations without worrying about market reactions. Although its video games still have a fervent following, EA's annual revenues have been stagnant during the past three fiscal years, hovering from $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion.

Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company thinks the proposed deal's $210 per share offer price may be falling short of EA's intrinsic value.

“With Battlefield 6 about to launch and a pipeline that could add more than $2B in incremental bookings by FY28, the true earnings power of EA is only beginning to emerge,” he wrote.

Hickey is unsure if the transaction is in shareholders' best interest.

“In our view, this transaction is a self-serving, opportunistic move by management and the investor group,” he wrote. “Management has long been rumored to seek a sale around $200 per share, a level that may have been defensible in prior years but not in the current environment where visibility into growth, franchise momentum, and pipeline strength is far more robust. The board's decision to recommend a sale at $210 per share suggests a prioritization of near-term certainty and legacy over maximizing long-term shareholder value.”

But Nick McKay of Freedom Capital Markets believes the offer makes sense for EA because share price appreciation is likely limited given that the success of its sports franchises and various live services streams are already mostly baked into the stock. 

“The financial backing and resources of the investor consortium should enable EA to increase its focus on long-term growth opportunities that may have been viewed as too risky or expensive as a public company,” he wrote in an analyst note.

EA shares, which rose nearly 5% on Monday, had jumped 15% on Friday after rumors of a takeover began to circulate. 

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027. It still needs approval from EA shareholders.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — Here he is, depicted at six months in office, chiseled and brawny, as mighty as the very nation. Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.

You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world's leader, frames himself as something more epic — as someone not entirely himself.

On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new, less official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially. 

A sign of the times, certainly — when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There's an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories. 

Artificial imagery isn't new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. “It works both ways,” the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. “If something happens that's really bad, maybe I'll have to just blame AI.” 

The AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative — not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he'd like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.




The artifice arrives in Trump's usual style — brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing — and squares with his social media team's heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration's official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.

The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: “Nowhere in the Constitution does it say we can't post banger memes.” Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: “oMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?” 

Behind the commander in chief's desire to craft an AI self — not itself uncommon — an infantry of official communications channels stands at his ready. And we, the people, can't help but tune in.

Like so much on the internet these days, Trump's AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of “The Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.”

“By the time you've seen it, you've understood it. And that's, of course, the efficacy,” Cornog said. “It requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.” 

The expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors. 

President William Henry Harrison's log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a “man of the people,” helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy “Boss” Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. “Let's stop those damned pictures!” Tweed once said, or so the story goes.

The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate — and manipulate — imagery.

By contrast, today's generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.

Past presidents “had to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,” Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse — or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.

The AI images of Trump shared by him and his administration chase a similarly heroic vision of the president. Potency — his and the country's — is a consistent theme, Cornog added.

Indeed, generative AI allows for an exposure of perhaps uncomfortably intimate inner worlds as people use such technology to illustrate and communicate their “fantasy lives” or cartoonish versions of themselves, says Mitchell Stephens, author of “The Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.”

But it can just as easily fulfill an inverse desire: to depict or reinforce a subjective concept of reality.

“Quite a lot of people are sharing AI-generated content, which is clearly fake but is almost seen as a revelatory kind of representation of someone,” Ajder said. This content feeds a mentality that mutters, “We all know they're really like this.”

“And so, even if people know it's fake,” Ajder said, “they still see it as kind of reflecting and satisfying a kind of truth — their truth about what the world is like.”

The lack of subtlety in Trump's AI images of himself helps explain their consistent virality. 

Commenters can be found lamenting the demise of presidential decorum (“I never thought I'd see the day when the White House is just a joke. This is so embarrassing.”) or relishing those very reactions (“Watching the left explode over this has been a treat.”). 

Other responses, even from the president's base, remain unconvinced (as one X user griped under the White House post of Trump as pope: “I voted for you, but this is weird and creepy. More mass deportations and less of whatever this is.”).

But that is tradition for Trump, who finds no trouble cashing the currency of our attention economy: Whether you cracked a smile or clutched your pearls, he still made you look. 

“In his first administration, he used Twitter in a way no president had,” said Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, an organization that facilitates the transition between presidents. “What they do in this administration is taking it further, as you've had an increase in what can be done online.” Or, as one Reddit user referred to the president: “Troll in Chief.”

Does Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn't the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.

“It's fine,” Trump said in May, when asked whether the AI-generated post of him as pope diminished the substance of the official White House account. 

“Have to have a little fun, don't you?”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Party leaders in Congress have long criticized government shutdowns as toxic and destructive. 

“Always a bad idea,” former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said of shutdowns in 2024. A potential “disaster,” Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said of the shutdown the country narrowly avoided when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open in March.

“I don't think shutdowns benefit anybody, least of all the American people,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said last week. 

Yet Congress often finds itself at the brink of one as the two major political parties' differences grow more intractable with each passing year. Democrats are threatening to vote against keeping the government open on Oct. 1.

Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., say they won't budge unless Republicans immediately extend health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year, among other demands. Republicans say they don't want to add any complicated policy to their “clean” stopgap bill to keep the government open for the next seven weeks. 

Time and time again, lawmakers hold out until just before the deadline and negotiate a last-minute compromise. But this time Democrats see some potential political advantages to a shutdown with their base voters spoiling for a fight. 

History shows the tactic almost never works, and federal employees are caught in the middle. The White House has already laid out a plan to potentially lay off hundreds, if not thousands, of federal employees — a significant escalation from previous shutdowns in which federal workers were temporarily furloughed and given back pay when the standoff ended. 

A look at some previous shutdowns and how they ended: 




Two years into his first term, President Donald Trump led the country into its longest shutdown ever with demands that Congress give him money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Similar to Republican leaders today, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, refused to negotiate unless Trump, a Republican, allowed the government to reopen. Democrats had won the House majority in the 2018 election and took power in the middle of the partial shutdown. 

Trump retreated after 35 days as intensifying delays at the nation's airports and another missed payday for hundreds of thousands of federal workers brought new urgency to efforts to resolve the standoff.

The government shut down for three days as Democrats insisted that any budget measure come with protections for young immigrants known as “Dreamers.” Trump refused to negotiate until the government reopened, and the weekend shutdown ended after McConnell, then the Senate majority leader, promised a vote on the issue. 

Democrats, led by Schumer, tried to lay blame on Trump. But Republicans said that it was Democrats who “caved” in the end. 

The hard-right tea party faction of House Republicans, urged on by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, shut the government down for 16 days as they demanded that language to block implementation of President Barack Obama's signature health care law be added to a spending bill. 

The conflict escalated when House Republicans also blocked the needed approval for raising the amount of money the Treasury can borrow to pay U.S. bills, raising the specter of a catastrophic default. Obama, a Democrat, vowed repeatedly not to pay a “ransom” to get Congress to pass normally routine legislation.

Bipartisan negotiations in the Senate finally ended the shutdown, and Republicans did not win any major concessions on health care. “We fought the good fight. We just didn't win,” then-House Speaker John Boehner conceded. 

Intent on slashing the budget, Republicans led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich forced a three-week shutdown from December 1995 to January 1996 in a bid to coerce President Bill Clinton to sign onto a balanced budget agreement. Republicans were saddled with the blame, and Clinton, a Democrat, was reelected that November. 

Under Presidents Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, and Ronald Reagan, a Republican, there were short shutdowns almost every year. The longest was in 1978, for 17 days. 

A series of legal opinions issued in 1980 and 1981 made shutdowns more impactful. Then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti determined that failure to pass new spending bills required government functioning to shut down in whole or in part. Earlier “shutdowns” did not always entail an actual stop to government functioning and often were simply funding gaps will little real-world effect.

The 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk appears for a court hearing.

PROVO, Utah (AP) — An attorney for the 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk asked a judge Monday for more time to review the large amount of evidence in the case before deciding if the defense will seek a preliminary hearing.

A preliminary hearing would determine if there is enough evidence against Tyler Robinson to go forward with a trial. Defendants can waive that step, but Robinson's newly appointed attorney Kathryn Nester said her team did not intend to do so.

Utah prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder and plan to seek the death penalty. 

Both the defense and prosecution acknowledged at a brief hearing Monday that the amount of evidence that prosecutors have is “voluminous.” Robinson was not present for the hearing and appeared via audio from jail at his defense team's request.

Judge Tony Graf set the next hearing for Oct. 30.

Defense attorneys for Robinson and prosecutors with the Utah County Attorney's Office declined to comment after Monday's hearing. It took place in Provo, just a few miles from the Utah Valley University campus in Orem where many students are still processing trauma from the Sept. 10 shooting and the day-and-a-half search for the suspect. 

Authorities arrested Robinson when he showed up with his parents at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from the site of the shooting, to turn himself in. Prosecutors have since revealed incriminating text messages and DNA evidence that they say connect Robinson to the killing.

A note that Robinson left for his romantic partner before the shooting said he had the opportunity to kill one of the nation's leading conservative voices, “and I'm going to take it,” Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray told reporters before the first hearing. Gray also said Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his partner: “I had enough of his hatred.”




The assassination of Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism, has galvanized Republicans who have vowed to carry on Kirk's mission of moving American politics further right.

Trump has declared Kirk a “martyr” for freedom and threatened to crack down on what he called the “radical left.”

Workers across the U.S. have been punished or fired for speaking out about Kirk after his death, including teachers, public and private employees and media personalities — most notably Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show was suspended then reinstated by ABC.

Kirk's political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through his podcast, social media and campus events. Many prominent Republicans are filling in at the upcoming campus events Kirk planned to attend, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and Sen. Mike Lee at Utah State University on Tuesday.

In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI “therapy” as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice. 

But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.

“The reality is millions of people are using these tools and they're not going back,” said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.

The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users' health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn't human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.

The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity. 




And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.




Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, said the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.

Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.

“This could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,” she said. “That's not what's on the commercial market currently.”

That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.

Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies — including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat — on how they “measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.” And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.

Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.

From “companion apps” to “AI therapists” to “mental wellness” apps, AI's use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around. 

That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada. 

But even a single app can be tough to categorize.

Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is “very muddy” about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.

Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.

Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick's website described its chatbot as “Your empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,” but now it's a “chatbot for self care.” 

Still, “we're not diagnosing,” Stephan maintained. 

Users can set up a “panic button” to call a trusted loved one if they are in crisis and the chatbot will “nudge” users to seek out a therapist if their mental health worsens. But it was never designed to be a suicide prevention app, Stephan said, and police would not be called if someone told the bot about thoughts of self-harm.

Stephan said she's happy that people are looking at AI with a critical eye, but worried about states' ability to keep up with innovation.

“The speed at which everything is evolving is massive,” she said.

Other apps blocked access immediately. When Illinois users download the AI therapy app Ash, a message urges them to email their legislators, arguing “misguided legislation” has banned apps like Ash “while leaving unregulated chatbots it intended to regulate free to cause harm.”

A spokesperson for Ash did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.

Mario Treto Jr., secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, said the goal was ultimately to make sure licensed therapists were the only ones doing therapy.

“Therapy is more than just word exchanges,” Treto said. “It requires empathy, it requires clinical judgment, it requires ethical responsibility, none of which AI can truly replicate right now.”

In March, a Dartmouth College-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.

The goal was to have the chatbot, called Therabot, treat people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or eating disorders. It was trained on vignettes and transcripts written by the team to illustrate an evidence-based response. 

The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot's response was harmful or not evidence-based.

Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.

“The space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,” he said.

Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples' thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not. 

Therabot's team sought to avoid those issues.

The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective. 

“They want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,” he said. “So, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.”

Regulators and advocates of the laws say they are open to changes. But today's chatbots are not a solution to the mental health provider shortage, said Kyle Hillman, who lobbied for the bills in Illinois and Nevada through his affiliation with the National Association of Social Workers.

“Not everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,” he said. But for people with real mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, “telling them, ‘I know that there's a workforce shortage but here's a bot' — that is such a privileged position.”

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., weighs in on efforts to avoid a government shutdown as the president is set to meet with Jeffries and Schumer.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has signaled that Democrats are not budging on their key demands ahead of a high-stakes meeting with President Donald Trump about government funding.

The federal government will enter a partial shutdown at midnight on Wednesday if Republicans and Democrats do not reach a deal on funding priorities for fiscal year (FY) 2026, which ends at the end of the day on Sept. 30.

All but one House Democrat rejected Republicans' plan for a roughly straightforward extension of FY 2025 funding levels, through Nov. 21, aimed at giving appropriators more time for a longer-term deal.

Jeffries blasted the measure — called a continuing resolution (CR) — as partisan and has demanded that Republicans make concessions on healthcare in exchange for Democratic support.

He signaled during a last-minute news conference on Monday that Democrats would reject anything less than a written plan to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""No one can trust their word on healthcare. Are you kidding me? These people have been trying to repeal and displace people off the Affordable Care Act since 2010. That's 15 years,"" Jeffries said. ""And on behalf of the American people, we're supposed to simply take their word that they're willing to negotiate? The American people know that would be an unreasonable thing for us to do.""

Jeffries also pointed out that an alternate CR offered by Democrats would expand those subsidies under the ACA, colloquially known as ""Obamacare,"" permanently.

It comes hours before he, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., are set to meet with Trump to discuss government funding at 3 p.m. on Monday.

Johnson and Thune, along with other Republicans in Congress, have been pushing Democrats to accept the deal on the table — pointing out that funding levels have remained roughly the same since former President Joe Biden's time in office.

""We are ready, we are willing, we are able to find a bipartisan path forward and reach a spending agreement that actually keeps the government open, but meets the needs of the American people in terms of their health, their safety, and their economic well-being related to lowering the high cost of living, as opposed to allowing tens of millions of Americans to experience dramatically increased health care costs,"" Jeffries told reporters.

""What we will not do is support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.""

The COVID-era Obamacare subsidies are due to expire at the end of this year without any action by Congress.

Thune told NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that he would be open to negotiating a deal but not paired with the current government funding talks.

""We can have that conversation, but before we do, release the hostage. Set the American people free, keep the government open, and then let's have a conversation about those premium tax credits. I'm certainly open to that. I think we all are,"" he said. 

""I will say … that particular program is desperately in need of reform. It's fraught with waste, fraud and abuse. So we are going to have reforms if we take action there, but I think there's potentially a path forward.""

The GOP-led CR passed the House earlier this month largely along party lines.

It's now on the Senate, where at least several Democrats will be needed to reach the 60-vote threshold to proceed with the bill.

Schumer is under tremendous pressure by his left flank after playing a key role in advancing Republicans' earlier CR in March, which extended through Sept. 30.

This time, however, Jeffries assured that he and Schumer are in ""lock-step"" on bucking the Republican plan unless a compromise is reached.

He said of their upcoming sit-down with Trump, ""We're heading into the meeting to have a good faith negotiation about landing the plane in a way that avoids a government shutdown but does not continue the Republican assault on the healthcare of the American people.""

""Republicans control the House and the Senate, and there's a Republican president. If the government shuts down, it's because Republicans want to shut the government down,"" Jeffries said at another point.

Johnson, meanwhile, hammered Democrats' position in an appearance on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

""We passed a continuing resolution, a simple, very clean, 24-page continuing resolution to keep the government open for seven more weeks, so the appropriators can finish that process,"" Johnson said.

""And [Schumer] said, 'No. Instead, I want to add $1.5 trillion in new spending to a seven-week stopgap bill…we want to reinstate free healthcare to illegal aliens paid for by U.S. taxpayer dollars. We want to claw back the $50 billion that we passed, Republicans passed, in our big, beautiful bill, the Working Families Tax Cuts, to provide for rural hospitals and healthcare, and a laundry list of other partisan priorities. He knows it's a nonstarter.""

Top Democrats celebrate Trump's conviction as accountability, but call the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as political payback.

Top Democrats are striking two very different notes on accountability: cheering President Donald Trump's felony conviction as proof that ""no one is above the law,"" while blasting the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as pure political payback.

COMEY INDICTMENT SPARKS FIERCE POLITICAL REACTIONS NATIONWIDE

In 2019, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said during a discussion at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco that Democrats believe ""no one is above the law,"" including the commander-in-chief. 

""Everybody wants the president to be held accountable in the most serious way. And everybody believes, now I'm talking on the Democratic side, that no one is above the law, especially the President of the United States,"" Pelosi said.

Former President Joe Biden reiterated the ""no one is above the law"" mantra before his White House remarks on the Middle East on May 31, 2024.

He said the New York case against Trump was ""a state case, not a federal case,"" decided by ""a jury of 12 citizens"" after five weeks of evidence and deliberation. 

COMEY DENIES CHARGES, DECLARES 'I AM NOT AFRAID'

The jury, Biden noted, ""reached a unanimous verdict"" finding Trump guilty on 34 felony counts, while emphasizing that Trump has the right to appeal.

""That's how the American system of justice works,"" Biden said, calling it ""reckless, dangerous, and irresponsible"" to claim the trial was rigged simply because of an unfavorable outcome.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., addressed Trump's conviction in a June 3, 2024, floor speech saying that ""former President Donald Trump is now a convicted felon.""

""The most important takeaway from this case is that nobody's above the law, including Donald Trump,"" he added.

On the heels of Comey's indictment, Schumer said Sunday that he has ""no faith in Trump's judicial system.""

Schumer said on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that Trump ""has turned this judicial system to be his own political fighter.""

""He tells them to go after people he doesn't like. He tells them to exonerate people that he likes,"" Schumer said.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., denounced what he called a ""malicious prosecution,"" reminding reporters that Trump previously fired a prosecutor who refused to bring ""frivolous charges.""

TRUMP ANSWERS WHETHER COMEY INDICTMENT IS ABOUT JUSTICE OR REVENGE

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued an even sharper rebuke.

""This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power,"" he warned. ""By ousting a respected, independent prosecutor and replacing him with a partisan loyalist, Trump is undermining one of the most important U.S. attorney's offices in the country and eroding the rule of law itself.""

As Democrats leaned on the ""no one is above the law"" refrain, Trump struck back — telling reporters Friday at the White House that the indictment against the former FBI chief was about rooting out corruption, not political payback.

""It's about justice really, it's not revenge,"" Trump said. ""It's also about the fact that you can't let this go on. They are sick, radical left people, and they can't get away with it, and Comey was one of the people.""

""He wasn't the biggest, but he's a dirty cop,"" Trump said, adding, ""He's always been a dirty cop. Everybody knew it.""

Trump's comments came after Comey was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. He was indicted on two counts: alleged false statements within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.

Comey's arraignment is set for 10 a.m. on Oct. 9 before District Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff. If convicted, Comey faces up to five years in prison.

Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the new airport rules allowing passengers to scan their face rather than use a boarding pass.

European vacation destinations will soon require travelers to have prints of their fingers taken as well as photos upon arrival.

France, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom and 25 other countries will begin implementing the new Entry/Exit System (EES) on Oct. 12 over the course of about six months.  

""These European countries will introduce the different elements of the EES in phases, including the collection of biometric data, such as facial image and fingerprints,"" the European Union's (EU) website notes.

""This means that biometric data (facial image and fingerprints) might not be collected at every border crossing point right away, and their personal information may not be registered in the system,"" it continued.

Travelers' passports will continue to be stamped as usual, according to the EU.

Colin Cowherd explains why fans should slow down the Chicago Bears' hype despite Caleb Williams' preseason success (so far). 

Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson had an awkward interaction with an NFL sideline reporter before the third quarter of their game on Sunday against the Las Vegas Raiders.

CBS' Aditi Kinkhabwala caught up with Johnson before the second half began. She qualified her question with the Bears' struggles on offense and asked what he told his team in the locker room.

""That it wasn't our brand of football. We're capable of a lot more,"" Johnson said. ""So, we're hitting the reset button here at halftime. We're gonna come back and establish our identity here in the second half.""

Kinkhabwala then added, ""You need to change what you're doing.""

Johnson appeared to be a little stunned with the response.

""I don't know. You think so?"" he said as Kinkhabwala smiled. ""We're gonna be just fine.""

The interaction sparked a frenzied response on social media.

But whatever Johnson told his team in the locker room seemingly had an effect on his players.

Bears quarterback Caleb Williams started the team's first drive of the second half strong. He led a seven-play, 40-yard drive that ended with a touchdown pass to Rome Odunze. The team scored a field goal and another touchdown in the fourth quarter – thanks to D'Andre Swift.

Chicago caught a break at the end of the game.

Geno Smith led the Raiders on a six-play, 22-yard drive to give kicker Daniel Carlson a decent shot at the go-ahead field goal. However, Carlson had his 54-yard attempt blocked.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the Michigan church shooting, the effort to end the war in Gaza, a possible government shutdown and more.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update Monday on the FBI investigation into the shooting and fire at a Michigan Mormon church on Sunday.

""Based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note. All of those questions have yet to be answered, but certainly will be answered by the FBI,"" Leavitt told ""Fox & Friends"" after speaking with FBI Director Kash Patel.

Leavitt said the FBI is ""currently executing multiple search warrants at the residences and the family homes of this perpetrator to try to get to the bottom of why he would commit such an act of evil.""

Thomas Jacob Sanford was named by authorities as the man who rammed a Chevy Silverado into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, before opening fire on the hundreds of worshipers gathered there. 

The White House press secretary praised local law enforcement for their response to the shooting.

""Local police officers were on the ground of this scene within minutes and neutralized this shooter, no doubt saving lives, and they should be commended. Our police officers are heroes and this president will always respect them and support them,"" Leavitt continued.

Leavitt said the shooter was a member of the community and previously served in the United States Marine Corps in Iraq. 

""His family is cooperating with the FBI. And so they are currently trying to dig in and get to the bottom of why he committed – there's just this heinous act of violence. It's unfathomable.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The Democrats' ridiculous shutdown ransom","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3825258/the-democrats-ridiculous-shutdown-ransom/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The federal government is set to shut down at midnight on Tuesday. The House of Representatives already passed a seven-week extension that would keep the government funded through Nov. 20. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said Democrats should vote “yes” on that bill so bipartisan Senate negotiations can continue on a comprehensive appropriations bill. But Democrats are refusing to do so. Instead, they are demanding a ransom of more than half a trillion dollars over 10 years just to keep the government running for a few more weeks.

It is a ridiculous proposal. Republicans should refuse it, and Democrats will be left to take public blame for yet another example of Washington incompetence. Or they can come to their senses before midnight Tuesday and let the federal government keep functioning while talks continue.

Democratic lawmakers face intense pressure from their rabid base to shut down the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is especially under scrutiny because last March, he and 10 other Senate Democrats put country over party and voted with Republicans to fund the government through the end of September. Enraged lefties immediately pilloried Schumer and talked of ousting him.

“I myself don't give away anything for nothing. I think that's what happened the other day,” former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said, as though it is meritorious to demand payment for doing right by one's country. 

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a possible Schumer replacement, added, “This turns the federal government into a slush fund for Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Why would Senate Democrats hand away our leverage?” 

Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-MD) told constituents at a town hall meeting that it was time for Schumer to resign: “I'm afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership.”

The feeling among the Democratic Party base that Schumer caved too easily has intensified. In July, Republicans passed and President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which cut taxes for all Americans, funded mass deportation, and slowed the growth of healthcare spending by, among other things, denying Medicaid to illegal immigrants.

Democrats now want to undo most of the healthcare spending reductions, including restoring healthcare for illegal immigrants, and on top of that, they want to extend Obamacare subsidies for insurance companies that are set to expire at the end of the month. According to a Sept. 18 letter from the Congressional Budget Office, the combined cost of these policy changes would add $622 billion to federal deficits over the next 10 years, with the illegal immigrant healthcare provisions costing almost $100 billion alone.

These are outrageous demands from Democrats. Obamacare was rammed through by them with the lie that it would pay for itself, but from the repeal of the Cadillac tax, to the failure of Community Living Assistance Services and Supports program, almost every “pay for” has been rescinded, meaning Obamacare has already added hundreds of billions to federal deficits even before you add subsequent subsidies for insurance payments such as the one Democrats are trying to extend right now. Enough is enough. Obamacare failed. It is time to stop subsidizing it by sending good money after bad.

Nor should Republicans entertain the idea of refunding Medicaid for illegal immigrants. A big part of why Trump won in 2024 is that voters were tired of President Joe Biden's illegal immigrant invasion and how much it was costing taxpayers to fund services for people who should never have been allowed in. Republicans would betray those who put them in power if they agreed to the Democratic Party's ransom demand.

TRUMP PROTECTS AMERICAN WORKERS WITH H1B REFORM

“There is a time and a place to debate healthcare,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said in 2013, “but not when the funding of the federal government, and all the lives that are impacted by it, hang in the balance.” 

The Democrats, including Murphy, should heed his advice now, drop their shutdown ransom request, and vote for the House's continuing resolution so bipartisan appropriations talks can continue in the Senate.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Democrats are refusing to back away from calling President Donald Trump and his allies “fascist,” as Republicans intensify warnings that the rhetoric is reckless and fuels political violence.

A gunman opened fire last week at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, killing one detainee and injuring two others. Less than two weeks earlier, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated, with officials saying the suspect left behind ammunition etched with a reference to fascism.

Democratic lawmakers and leaders, however, have refused to walk away from the label, most typically associated with Nazi Germany, arguing that Trump's conduct in office leaves them no choice but to call it the way they see it. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, on her book tour last week, compared Trump and his allies to “a communist dictatorship” for quashing dissent. 

That defiance was echoed about two weeks ago at a press conference in which Democrats denounced what they described as an assault on free expression, held after ABC suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for remarks about Kirk's assassination.

“Fascism is not on the way. It is here,” Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) said at the event. “The First Amendment is how generations of Americans, from civil rights activists to labor organizers, American workers, LGBTQ+ activists, have fought for progress, and it is our power.”

At the same press conference, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) was asked by a reporter whether Democrats' rhetoric was partly to blame for political violence. He said candor was essential.

“Donald Trump is trying to destroy our democracy. He is trying to silence free speech. He is acting in a way that is scarily similar to many would-be despots all across history,” Murphy said. “We have no obligation to sugarcoat the gravity of this moment. The only way we save this nation is if the people of this country rise up in peaceful protest, if they mobilize all across America.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) was equally blunt in a House Oversight Committee hearing that same day. “We need to stand up against this fascist takeover,” she said. “That's not a bad word, it's a fact.”

Democrats have steadily escalated their warnings about Trump by invoking the language of fascism. Back in 2022, then-President Joe Biden described Trump's governing philosophy as “semi-fascist.” By the next year, Harris and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), her running mate, dropped any qualifiers, calling Trump a fascist outright. 

The message sharpened further in August 2025, when Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin delivered a fiery address at the party's summer meeting, declaring Trump represented not just partisan opposition but an existential threat. 

“This is not politics as usual, my friends,” Martin told the crowd. “This is authoritarianism. It's fascism dressed in a red tie. And we, each of you in this room, and all of the Democrats throughout this country, we are the only thing standing in his way.”

Martin has not backed away from the “fascist” label. But in a statement after the ICE shooting last week, he struck a different tone, condemning the violence and urging unity. 

“It will take all of us, not just one side of the aisle or the other, to quell this epidemic of violence, which has no place in our democracy,” he said.

A Democratic strategist, speaking on background to reflect candidly on the situation, acknowledged the risks of that approach. 

“I think there's no doubt that the political temperature in our country is a bit too hot right now,” the strategist said. “At this moment, I would advise any Democratic candidate or politician I work with not to use the word ‘fascist' or ‘dictator' in their jargon, especially after what has played out lately.” 

Even so, Democrats and their allies argue the president's actions aren't making it easier to hold back. They denounced Thursday's move by federal prosecutors to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime Trump target, as politically motivated and lacking merit. 

“The Comey stuff makes this all really complicated,” the strategist added. “But I think two wrongs don't make a right, and Democrats need to take the high road.”

Republicans argue the Democrats' language is incendiary and dangerous. 

“If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you politically is a Nazi,” Vice President JD Vance told a crowd in North Carolina last Wednesday, a reference to both the ICE shooting in Dallas last week and Kirk's killing two weeks earlier as proof of rising risks. 

Strategists echoed the warning. 

“They are inciting crazy people to do crazy things through their very words,” GOP strategist Dennis Lennox said. “Democrats aren't going to win next year by pouring gasoline on the fire.”

Greg Manz, another Republican strategist, argued Democrats were guilty of projection: “Their history, especially during the Biden administration, is riddled with censoring free speech and weaponizing the government,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Now they stand idle as law enforcement faces surging assaults. This smear tactic won't stick; it'll backfire.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee recently cited polling showing liberals are more likely than conservatives to say political violence is sometimes justified. 

“For far too long, Democrats have excused riots, smeared conservatives as ‘fascists,' and winked at violent rhetoric from their own ranks,” spokesman Mike Marinella said. “Now the numbers prove it: The Left has normalized hate and turned political violence into just another talking point.” 

And a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), the Congressional Leadership Fund, has begun targeting Democrats in vulnerable districts who have used the term, accusing them of crossing a line and abandoning “decency and morality.”

DEMOCRATS DECRY COMEY INDICTMENT AFTER PRAISING CASES AGAINST TRUMP: ‘NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW'

Trump, speaking at Kirk's memorial last Sunday, tied the killing to the broader fight over rhetoric. He said the same people now “screaming fascism” had implied Kirk deserved his fate.

“No side in American politics has a monopoly on disturbed or misguided people,” Trump said. “But one part of our political community believes they have a monopoly on power, thought, and speech. Well, that's not happening anymore.” ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

EXCLUSIVE — Rep. Byron Donalds's (R-FL) campaign for Florida governor received a boost on Monday with the endorsements of law enforcement leaders across the Sunshine State. 

Over a dozen sheriffs backed Donalds, one of two Republicans who have announced bids to succeed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Donalds received one of his first high-profile endorsements in February when President Donald Trump endorsed his candidacy. 

The endorsements “cement Donalds as the MAGA candidate and the law and order candidate for Florida,” the Donalds campaign said. Five of the sheriffs representing the state's top 10 counties by population were among the authorities to back Donalds this week. They include Miami-Dade County Sheriff Rosie Cordero-Stutz, Hillsborough's Chad Chronister, Duval's T.K. Waters, Lee's Carmine Marceno, and Pasco's Chris Nocco. 

“Congressman Byron Donalds is the leader that Florida needs in this moment, as we work and stand with President Trump to implement the mandate he received from the American people and the citizens of our great state of Florida,” said Nocco, the first sheriff to endorse Donalds, in a statement touting the congressman's ties to Trump. 

Nocco cast Donalds as DeSantis's natural heir. The governor has yet to endorse a successor, as his wife, Casey DeSantis, is rumored to be weighing her own bid for the office. 

“I know Congressman Donalds will stand with law enforcement as we work to keep Florida safe and will be innovative in his ideas to create jobs, improve education, and make our economy more competitive. Florida has been blessed to have a fantastic legacy of Governors with Governor Rick Scott and Governor Ron DeSantis. I know future Governor Byron Donalds will continue that legacy, and he will keep making Florida great,” Nocco said. 

Other sheriffs who supported Donalds's bid for office this week included Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith, Brevard's Wayne Ivey, Collier's Kevin Rambosk, Hendry's Steve Whidden, Indian River's Eric Flowers, Jackson's Donnie Edenfield, Martin's John Budensiek, Monroe's Rick Ramsay, St. Lucie's  Richard Del Toro, and Wakulla's Jared Miller. 

Donalds is one of multiple leading House Republicans declining to run for reelection in the midterm elections. Instead, they are choosing to back away from national politics by mounting bids for offices in their home states. 

Donalds and former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, who entered the race earlier this month, are the two Republicans challenging Democrat David Jolly to become Florida's next governor. 

The Donalds campaign has highlighted recent polling giving the congressman a commanding lead in the Republican primary. A survey by the American Promise gave Donalds 40% of the vote outright. Renner and another rumored GOP candidate would each take 2%, with another 54% of voters remaining unsure of which Republican to support ahead of the 2026 election.

A poll looking at where voters place Donalds in relation to Democratic candidates ahead of the general election gave the congressman an 8-point lead over Jolly, 49% to 41%. Of those surveyed in the poll, conducted in late August by the AIF Center for Political Strategy, 11% of Floridians remained undecided about their candidate.

BYRON DONALDS TARGETS DAVID JOLLY ON GUN CONTROL AS FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE HEATS UP

Jolly's campaign has touted a poll it commissioned in early September showing the Democrat in a statistical tie with Donalds and Renner, with nearly 20% of voters undecided. 

Jolly's internal polling also indicated that with over 13 months to go until the general election, the leading candidates lack name recognition. More than half the respondents reported they do not know who Donalds, Jolly, or Renner are, with Donalds receiving the highest name recognition rate.

Rising energy prices during President Donald Trump's second term have presented Democrats an opportunity to gain a foothold ahead of elections this November and the 2026 midterms.

Democrats, who want to end the GOP trifecta in Washington next year, are starting to campaign on more affordable energy. Trump promised on the campaign trail last year to slash energy prices when he took office.

“For nine months, we watched this Administration and congressional Republicans do everything to stifle clean energy, and clean energy is the fastest growing and the cheapest source of electricity,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner.

“Republicans are blocking the only sources of energy that can be built fast enough to meet growing demand and cheaply enough to actually keep energy bills in check,” he added, pointing to expiring clean energy tax credits.

Following the passage of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Democrats not only leaned into the cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicaid, but have also highlighted the GOP's aggressive phasing out of clean energy tax credits from former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Trump's multitrillion-dollar spending plan extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The massive piece of legislation, passed through a process called reconciliation, not only extends the lower individual tax rates that were part of the 2017 law but also makes them permanent. 

The cost of electricity has continued to soar for most Americans and is shaping up to be a campaign issue for the 2025 and 2026 elections. In the New Jersey governor's election this November, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) and Republican Jack Ciattarelli have both shifted their focus as electricity bills are at the top of voters' minds in the state. 

“Day One as governor, I'm declaring a state of emergency on utility costs using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills,” said Sherrill in her first TV ad of the general election.

Ciattarelli pledged to “lower electricity bills” in a campaign ad and has worked to tie Sherrill to the current Democratic governor on electricity prices as he looks to an “all of the above approach.” 

The New Jersey gubernatorial race is not the only place where energy prices are being made a center point. Just this week, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) announced a rebate program for utility bill payments as part of his latest effort to lower energy costs for Marylanders. He's up for reelection in 2026.

MOORE UNVEILS $200 MILLION ENERGY REBATE PROGRAM FOR MARYLANDERS AMID RISING ELECTRICITY COSTS

Levin and Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects. 

Levin said his legislation is a direct result of concerns brought to him by his constituents. 

“I think there's a great deal of frustration that you have people in my district and districts all across the country who are really struggling to make ends meet, costs are very high across the board, and electricity bills are going up and up and up, and others that want to do energy efficiency upgrades are finding those upgrades to be extremely expensive without these credits,” Levin told the Washington Examiner.

Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high. 

“Americans want lower costs, and rising energy bills will be a regular, unavoidable reminder to voters that House Republicans have failed miserably at fulfilling their central campaign promise,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Viet Shelton told the Washington Examiner. “Broken promises and working families facing bigger and bigger bills because of the Big, Ugly Law — these will be the leading reasons Republicans will lose their majority next year.” 

Rep. Josh Riley (D-NY) has also been highlighting high electricity prices. He introduced the Keep the Lights Local Act, which aims to cut costs.

“Utility bills in Upstate New York haven't been this high in a decade,” Riley wrote on social media. “More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.”

Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation. For the year ending in August, electricity shot up 6.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.

The Trump administration has blamed Biden-era green energy initiatives and the accelerated phaseout of traditional fossil fuels such as coal. Trump called increased reliance on wind and solar energy production “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

In an interview with the Washington Examiner in August, Energy Secretary Chris Wright backed up Trump's assessment.

“If you take a grid or a system and grow the renewables penetration, you will raise the price of it,” Wright said. “The president's 100% correct in that.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is seeking to hold or flip House seats in New York and California, said higher utility rates are the result of blue state leadership.

“Utility rates in blue states are the direct result of the failed leadership, misplaced priorities, reckless spending, and radical policies of governors like [Gavin] Newsom and [Kathy] Hochul,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told the Washington Examiner. “No false attack changes the fact that liberal wish lists in Albany and Sacramento have driven up prices for their constituents while Republicans are left cleaning up their mess.”

A September analysis by Inside Climate News found the average household price of electricity in the United States rose by 9.5% this year, with the highest spikes found in Missouri (38.3% increase), North Dakota (33.6%), New Jersey (28.6%), Iowa (27.5%), and Montana (25.3%) 

The blame game comes as the cost of living is a persistent issue for voters across the nation, specifically, concerns about the rising cost of energy.

According to left-wing think tank Data for Progress, 60% of voters reported paying more for electric bills than last year. A PowerLines poll conducted with Ipsos shows that “three out of four Americans, across party lines, say they are worried about rising utility bills.” The Energy Information Administration estimated that average residential electricity prices in the U.S. will jump from $0.1648 per kilowatt-hour in 2024 to around $0.1790 per kilowatt-hour next year.

HALEY STEVENS TO FILE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST RFK JR.

As prices continue to rise, clean energy advocates insist that renewables are not to blame, arguing that some states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power. EIA data compiled by American Clean Power show that the top 10 states with the largest share of renewables in their energy makeup have seen significantly smaller electricity price hikes over the last year than the national average (a roughly 2.5% increase).

Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump's megabill. From the onset, Democrats labeled the bill the “big, ugly law,” as they held hundreds of events across the country to say that Medicaid cost savings would kick millions of people off their healthcare. Democrats plan to stick to their plan of slamming the bill, even though the tightening of Medicaid eligibility won't kick in until after the 2026 elections.

Oregon filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump on Sunday, claiming the president unlawfully deployed the National Guard in Portland.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said sending 200 National Guard troops to his state was not due to any legitimate threat but was done so the president could exert his political strength “under the guise of law and order.”

Trump ordered the National Guard to Oregon after numerous protests targeting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, some of which have been reportedly violent. Trump ordered “all necessary troops” to Portland on Sunday. 

“I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,” Trump posted to his Truth Social on Saturday. “I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”

PORTLAND MAYOR SAYS NUMBER OF NECESSARY TROOPS IN CITY IS ‘ZERO' AFTER TRUMP ORDERS DEPLOYMENT

Rayfield, Oregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman, and other state officials filed the lawsuit. They said deploying such troops for law enforcement duties violated federal law.

“The ‘traditional and strong resistance of Americans to any military intrusion into civilian affairs' has ‘deep roots in our history,'” the lawsuit read. “Our nation's founders recognized that military rule — particularly by a remote authority indifferent to local needs — was incompatible with liberty and democracy. Foundational principles of American law therefore limit the President's authority to involve the military in domestic affairs.”

The plaintiffs cited the 1972 court case Laird v. Tatum as evidence for their claim. They also said the Constitution prohibited the president from deploying such troops and that, typically, only Congress had the authority to do so.

“Those principles stem first from the U.S. Constitution, which reserves the general police power for the states while establishing civilian control over the military,” the lawsuit read. “It also affords Congress, not the President, the power ‘to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.'” 

“While Congress has delegated a portion of that power to the Executive, it carefully limited the President's authority to exert control over a state's National Guard — the modern term for the militia — to specific circumstances. And for over a century and a half, Congress has expressly forbidden federal military interference in civilian law enforcement,” the lawsuit noted. 

Rayfield said, “Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference. Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal.”

Gov. Tina Kotek (D-OR) shared Rayfield's sentiments. She also accused the president of violating federal and constitutional law, including the 10th Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act, among other things.

“This is not necessary. And it is unlawful,” Kotek said. “There is no insurrection or threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland or any other city in our state.”

“Defendants have trampled on these principles by federalizing members of the Oregon National Guard for deployment in Portland, Oregon, to participate in civilian law enforcement,” the lawsuit read. “On September 28, 2025, the Secretary of Defense (now referred to as the Secretary of War) issued a memorandum calling into federal service 200 members of the Oregon National Guard.”

TRUMP ORDERS HEGSETH TO DEPLOY TROOPS TO PORTLAND

“Citing nothing more than baseless, wildly hyperbolic pretext — the President says Portland is a ‘War ravaged' city ‘under siege' from ‘domestic terrorists' — Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon's sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,” the plaintiffs claimed.

“The facts cannot justify this overreach,” the plaintiffs claimed in the lawsuit.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The contrast could hardly have been greater.

During a memorial service for Charlie Kirk, held in a stadium filled with nearly 100,000 people, Erika Kirk, the wife of the slain right-wing activist, expressed both her profound love for her husband and the profound grief brought on by his death. It was the speech of a woman deeply influenced by her Christian faith. And it included remarkable words, which she struggled to say but was still able to articulate.

“My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” Kirk said. “That young man. That young man. On the cross, our Savior said, ‘Father, forgive them, for they not know what they do.' That man—that young man—I forgive him. I forgive him because it was what Christ did. And it's what Charlie would do. The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.”

The audience rose to its feet to applaud in support of the grieving widow. But there was another speaker yet to come.

Peter Wehner: Awe is essential

Donald Trump, following Erika Kirk, said Charlie was “a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them.” But then the president, diverting from his script, couldn't resist voicing his dissent. “That's where I disagreed with Charlie,” Trump said. “I hate my opponents. And I don't want the best for them.” He added, “I'm sorry, Erika.” The audience began to laugh and to cheer. Trump gave them a knowing smile. A man who lies about nearly everything couldn't bring himself to lie about his hate for his opponents.

What Trump said at the Kirk memorial service was hardly a revelation. President Trump has in the past made clear his disagreement with, and even his contempt for, some of the core teachings of Jesus. So has his son Don Jr., who told a Turning Point USA gathering in 2021 that turning the other cheek has “gotten us nothing.”

Donald Trump, decades before he ran for the presidency, acknowledged that he's a man filled with hate and driven by vengeance. It's not simply that those qualities are part of who he is; it is that he draws strength from the dark passions.

Trump has spent nearly every day of the past decade confirming that he lacks empathy. He sees himself as both entitled and as a victim. He's incapable of remorse. He's driven by an insatiable need for revenge. And he enjoys inflicting pain on others.

It's no longer an interesting question as to why Trump is an almost perfect inversion of the moral teachings of Jesus; the answer can be traced to a damaged, disordered personality that has tragically warped his soul. What is an interesting question is why those who claim that the greatest desire of their life is to follow Jesus revere such a man and seem willing to follow him, instead, to the ends of the earth.

It's a complicated matter to untangle. For a significant number of evangelical Protestants the explanation is fairly straightforward: They celebrate the Trump ethic; it pervades their church and their faith communities.

Within this world exists a subculture that includes the so-called TheoBros, men who often identify as Christian nationalists who see themselves as theological warriors. In this subculture, compassion is viewed as a weakness; bullying and abusive language, snide putdowns, misogyny, and “owning the libs” are fashionable. They're the Christian version of shock jocks.

One example: Pastor Joel Webbon, an influential figure within this world, believes that women should be denied the right to vote. Women's suffrage was “just one liberal attempt by people who hated Christ to sever the covenant bond between husband and wife.” Extending voting rights to women has, he believes, proved a terrible mistake. “I want strong marriages, I want cohesive households, I want representative government all the way down to the family, and I also want babies not murdered. I don't want drag-queen story hour, I don't want rainbow jihad, and none of that could happen if women couldn't vote.” Musing about how nationalism got a bad name, Webbon blamed an “Austrian painter who might, depending on your World War II history, might have been a little overly zealous. I personally, I don't have—I don't really have a dog in the fight.” You get the point.

Many of the leaders within the Christian-MAGA movement are autocratic, arrogant, and controlling; they lack accountability, demand unquestioned loyalty, and try to intimidate their critics, especially those within their church or denomination. The grievances and resentment they feel are impossible to overstate; they are suffering from a persecution complex. Fully MAGA-fied Christians view Trump as the “ultimate fighting machine,” in the words of the historian Kristin Kobes Du Mez, and they love him for it. The most militant and fanatical Trump supporters refer to our era as a “Bonhoeffer moment.” (The phrase is meant to draw parallels between the “woke left” in America and Nazism.) Hard-core MAGA Christians hardly make up the whole of American evangelicalism and fundamentalism, but they do constitute a large part of it, and they are on the ascendancy.

The churches and denominations that are not militantly MAGA but are still overwhelmingly composed of Trump supporters often get less attention than churches and denominations that are hyper-politicized, but they're also essential to the Trump coalition. So it's useful to understand the complex dynamic at play in those spaces.

Peter Wehner: Where did evangelicals go wrong?

I say complex because, every Sunday, millions of Christians attend churches that are nondenominational and that are affiliated with conservative Protestant denominations. These churches aren't particularly political, and they are led by pastors who preach thoughtfully on topics such as loving your enemy and turning the other cheek, which Jesus talked about during his Sermon on the Mount; and on verses like this one, found in the Book of Ephesians, written by the Apostle Paul: “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”

The great majority of people attending these churches wouldn't consider those verses to be woke talking points; they would view them as the inerrant Word of God. They would earnestly pray that those words would sanctify their life and that they would become more like Jesus. And almost to a person, these congregants would say that Christ is at the center of their life, their “all in all.”

Yet many of them will spend part of the rest of the week, and maybe much of the rest of the week, in the right-wing echo chamber, in the company of conflict entrepreneurs, having their emotions inflamed, feeling the same way toward their enemies as Donald Trump does toward his enemies. And it will all make perfect sense to them.

“It grieves me to see people I've known for years (some as far back as the Jesus Movement of the 1970s) seduced by a mean-spirited culture-war Christianity that is but a perverse caricature of the authentic faith formed around Jesus of Nazareth,” Brian Zahnd, a pastor and author, posted on social media recently. “Yes, it grieves me terribly.”

That grief is shared by many of us, and Zahnd's comment raises these questions: How did the seduction of so many evangelicals happen? And how did Donald Trump, of all people, win not just their votes but their hearts?

The answer is convoluted and theological in nature. For far too many Christians, faith, although an important part of their life, is not primary, and it's even less often transformative. Russell Moore, editor in chief of Christianity Today, has said that Jesus is a “hood ornament” for many American Christians. The expectation of, among others, the Apostle Paul wasn't human perfection. He believed that original sin touched every human life, and many of his Epistles were written to address serious problems within the Church.

But his assumption, and not his alone, was that Christians, because of their faith, were to be “set apart”—“ministers of reconciliation” known for their love and mercy, holy and blameless and above reproach, without malice, and free of bitterness, rage, and anger. Christianity was supposed to bring an internal transformation, a profound inner shift in a person's identity and motivations. In a warped and crooked generation, the Book of Philippians tells us, followers of Jesus were to be blameless and pure, children of God, shining like stars in the sky. Elsewhere we're told that the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

Throughout history, countless people have had their lives transformed by faith and by grace, and have helped to bring healing to a broken world. It has been an enormous gift to me to know such people in the here and now; I have profiled several of them in The Atlantic. I know many more.

But they are exceptional, and if we're honest—if Christians are honest—the gap between how those who claim to be followers of Jesus conduct themselves versus how others in the world conduct themselves is often narrow, if it exists at all. We see that in high-profile scandals and in people's daily lives, where abusive behavior, harsh judgmentalism, and unkindness are spread pretty equally among believers and unbelievers.

What's happened, then, is that faith isn't nearly as central to the life of many Christians as they say it is, or that they wish it were. Christianity has its own semantic world, phrases and buzzwords that are meant to convey the importance of faith in our life. In many cases, though, these are expressions of an aspiration, not the reflection of a current reality.

When people in church services sing hymns of praise that declare, “Make me a channel of your peace; where there is hatred let me bring your love; where there is injury, your pardon, Lord; and where there's doubt, true faith in you,” those are authentic expressions of real desires. But they often have a short half-life; they can be undone by midweek, especially if you happen to spend time on social media or listen to podcasts that stir up the dark passions. Peacemaking is not the coin of that realm.

In my experience, pastors tend to see that better than most of the rest of us. Their appeal, Sunday after Sunday, is for their congregants to “live a life worthy of the calling you have received.” They know that many in their congregation stumble and fall in answering that calling, and the honest pastors know that they often stumble themselves, too. We all do.

Peter Wehner: Evangelicals made a bad trade

I say all this to provide context for my next observation, which may help explain this moment: Politics fills the void left by faith, and it's doing so in ways that I've never quite seen before. For many fundamentalists and evangelicals, politics meets the longing and the needs that aren't being met by churches and traditional faith communities. If there is something useful that has come of the Trump era, and there's not much, it is that it has offered a diagnostic CT scan of much of American Christianity. Trump and the MAGA movement capitalized on, and then amplified, the problems facing Christian communities, but they did not create them.

Politics, especially culture-war politics, provides many fundamentalists and evangelicals with a sense of community and a common enemy. It gives purpose and meaning to their life, turning them into protagonists in a great drama pitting good against evil. They are vivified by it. And they reassure one another, time and again, that the dark passions are actually expressions of righteousness. They consecrate their resentments. As a result, they deform what many of us consider to be the most compelling voice and life there ever was, an itinerant preacher who 2,000 years ago traveled throughout Galilee and Judea, teaching new commandments on some days and healing the sick and the social outcasts on others, all the while proclaiming the Kingdom of God.

Donald Trump might not be perfect, his religious supporters concede, but he is fighting on the side of the angels. He's a modern-day Cyrus, the Persian king who allowed the Jews to end their captivity and return to their homeland. The hand of the Lord is upon this president. And they will stand with him every step of the way. That is why people at the Charlie Kirk memorial service could be moved by the words of forgiveness by Erika Kirk and also inspired by the words of hate by the president of the United States. They can move easily between two worlds. But they are encamping in the world of moral ugliness, a world of antipathy, and, for now, they seem quite at home there.

We don't know how it will end. But here's what I do know, or at least what my understanding of the Christian faith has taught me to believe: We are called to be faithful, not necessarily successful, for success lies beyond our powers. This world is broken but beautiful, a gift from God, and the good in this world is worth fighting for. One life on this Earth is all we get, and, in the words of the pastor and theologian Frederick Buechner, “at the very least we are fools if we do not live it as fully and bravely and beautifully as we can.” God is far more resplendent than the theologies and doctrines about God that we humans construct. And, as the writer Rachel Held Evans put it, “faith is always a risk. No matter what we believe, there's always the chance we might be wrong. But the story of Jesus is just the story I'm willing to risk being wrong about.”

New Jersey is no one's idea of a swing state. Or is it?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Mikie Sherrill is not prone to hyperbole. The Democratic nominee for governor of New Jersey is measured and mainstream—even “milquetoast,” in the words of one progressive activist. But when I asked Sherrill what message a victory for her this November would send nationally, she made a rather bold declaration.

“As New Jersey goes, so goes the nation,” she told me. This is a stretch. But maybe not by all that much.

New Jersey is no one's idea of a swing state; it hasn't voted Republican for president in nearly four decades, and it last elected a GOP senator during the Nixon administration. But the Garden State has been moving rightward these past few years—Donald Trump came within six points of winning its electoral votes last year—and the governor's office has historically toggled between the parties.

This fall's election holds outsize importance for Democrats, who want both to keep a Trump ally out of a key state office and to give their base some hope heading into the 2026 midterm elections. A win, Sherrill said, would represent the party's “shot across the bow” against Trump's second term. The off-year governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia are closely scrutinized for signs of voter backlash to whichever party controls Washington. Usually Virginia, until recently a presidential battleground, provides the best clues about the national mood. This year, however, operatives in both parties believe that New Jersey might be the closer race and the more accurate barometer of how voters are reacting to Trump's return tour in the White House.

In a shift from previous elections, national Democrats have spent far more money trying to hold the governorship of New Jersey than they have in the Virginia governor's race. They've placed their hopes in Sherrill, a 53-year-old former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, who in 2018 captured a House seat long held by Republicans. In June, she won a crowded party primary by defeating candidates to her left and to her right. Sherrill is now facing the former Republican state legislator Jack Ciattarelli, a self-proclaimed “Jersey guy” running a loose and energetic campaign built around lowering property taxes, combatting crime, and making a crowd-pleasing appeal to bring plastic bags back to grocery stores. He has run for governor twice before and came within three points of upsetting the heavily favored Democratic incumbent Phil Murphy's reelection bid in 2021. Although Sherrill has leaned on her military service, Ciattarelli has mocked her as a predictable and occasionally ham-fisted Democrat; one of his most frequently aired ads shows her fumbling the answer to a seemingly straightforward question about what her first piece of legislation would be.

Marc Novicoff: Democrats don't seem willing to follow their own advice

Sherrill and I spoke shortly after she addressed some 200 mostly nonwhite supporters at a restaurant in Newark, in an area where she wants to run up Democratic margins that have shrunk in recent elections as some Black and Hispanic voters either stayed home or voted Republican. The crowd was filled with local party officials and volunteers who were about to spend the afternoon knocking on doors for Sherrill and the rest of the Democratic ticket. Nearly everyone I spoke with, however, said they had friends or neighbors who cast their ballot for Trump last year. “Some minorities believe they were taken for granted” by Democrats, Carlos Gonzalez, an at-large member of Newark's city council, told me. Trump won their votes by promising to lower their cost of living, he said, but the president hasn't delivered. “I am certain that they are going to come back to the Democratic Party because they feel that they were cheated,” Gonzalez said.

Sherrill was one of the only speakers who did not switch between English and Spanish, but in either language, the themes were the same: affordability and Trump. “We have an out-of-control president who's attacking the people we care about, and he's attacking the economy of our state,” Sherrill said, presenting herself as a bulwark against threats to New Jersey from the Trump administration.

She painted Ciattarelli, who secured the president's endorsement in the GOP primary, as a Trump lackey. Her local surrogates made the same connection in more colorful terms. “He is going to support the agenda of the orange man, and we don't want the orange man to control the politics of New Jersey,” Gonzalez told them, and the audience cheered.

Ciattarelli's actual history with Trump is more complicated than Democrats like to let on. A decade ago, while supporting then-Governor Chris Christie's presidential bid, Ciattarelli called Trump a “charlatan” who was “not fit to be president of the United States.” He did not seek Trump's endorsement during either of his first two runs for governor—a snub the president remembered when Ciattarelli finally sought Trump's support earlier this year to fend off a more MAGA-friendly GOP competitor.

On the stump, Ciattarelli is neither obsequious nor critical toward the president. Instead, he plays Sherrill's frequent criticism of Trump for laughs. He tells audiences that if they took a drink every time the Democrat blamed something on the president, they'd be “drunk off their ass.” At a packed bar in Fair Lawn, a Democratic-leaning suburb about 20 miles northwest of New York City, Ciattarelli joked: “On your way home tonight, if you get a flat tire, she's going to blame President Trump.”

The line went over well with a crowd that, judging by its large number of MAGA hats and Trump shirts, would have been fine with more effusive praise of the president. Several people cited Ciattarelli's better-than-expected showing in 2021 and Trump's relatively narrow loss in the state last year as reasons for optimism, as they did with the strong turnout for a Monday-evening campaign rally. Well over 100 people stood shoulder to shoulder to hear Ciattarelli deliver a brief speech. “This is the best chance we're going to have to turn New Jersey red,” Mike Messina, a 60-year-old retired police officer, told me.

Ciattarelli is a 63-year-old accountant with a deep tan that makes him look like he's just come from the golf course or the beach. He's had more freedom to barnstorm the state than Sherrill, whose day job as a House Democrat in the closely divided Congress has occasionally kept her off the campaign trail. Some of Ciattarelli's biggest applause lines—keeping wind farms “off our Jersey Shore” and bringing plastic bags back to the grocery store—sit at the very edge of the culture wars. “I could say I'm going to lower taxes, and I get a nice round of applause,” he observed in Fair Lawn. “I say I'm bringing back the plastic bags, and it brings down the house.”

On the topic of Trump, he's a bit more careful, and conventional. When I asked him after the event whether he'd like the president to campaign for him, Ciattarelli replied: “I appreciate the president's willingness to do whatever we think he can do to help us win this election, but at the end of the day, the candidate has to win the election.” He predicted that the Democrats would bring in the party's biggest stars, including former President Barack Obama, to help Sherrill in the campaign's closing weeks. “I'm going to bring in Jack Ciattarelli.”

Trump, himself a New Jersey property owner with a golf club in Bedminster, is keeping a close watch. A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-September showed Sherrill leading Ciattarelli by nine points. But when an Emerson College survey had the race tied last week, Trump seized on the finding to tout Ciattarelli and attack Sherrill.

Later that same day, the Sherrill campaign accused Trump's administration of aiding Ciattarelli in a far more nefarious way: by releasing Sherrill's full military records to an ally of the Republican in order to plant a negative story about her. CBS News discovered the breach while investigating claims pushed by Republicans that Sherrill was barred from walking in her 1994 Naval Academy commencement because she had been implicated in a cheating scandal that involved more than 130 students. (Sherrill has said that she was punished for not reporting on her classmates.) A branch of the National Archives acknowledged that a “technician” released too many of her records, including documents that contained her Social Security number and other sensitive information. Sherrill's campaign claimed that the disclosure violated federal law. “This is an illegal and dangerous weaponization of the federal government,” Sherrill wrote on X.

Republicans and Democrats can each draw hope from history. The New Jersey governor's race typically swings away from whichever party won the presidency in the year before—a trend that would favor Sherrill. (Christie won the governorship during Obama's first year in the White House, and Murphy grabbed it back for Democrats after Trump's victory in 2016.) Ciattarelli is banking on voters' tendency to get tired of the Democrats holding power in Trenton, the state capital: For more than half a century, neither party has won three governor's races in a row.

Sherrill and Ciattarelli both see an electorate that's frustrated with the status quo and rising prices—particularly a spike in electricity bills. Sherrill has vowed to declare a state of emergency to freeze utility rates on her first day in office if she wins. Ciattarelli is trying to localize the race, calling Sherrill “Murphy 2.0” and, though she has never served in state government, accusing her of backing policies that have contributed to high energy costs and property taxes.

“It's a smart strategy,” Mike DuHaime, a New Jersey–based former top aide to Christie, told me. The challenge for Ciattarelli, and a reason both parties believe that Sherrill retains a small edge, is that Republicans have struggled over the past decade to win elections when Trump isn't on the ballot. (The dynamic was the same for Democrats when Obama was in the White House.) Democrats cleaned up in lower-turnout elections during Trump's first term, and they have done the same so far this year. “Can somebody who's not Donald Trump turn out Donald Trump's voters?” DuHaime asked. “It didn't happen in 2017 or 2018. Is there something different in 2025? That's what this election is a test of.”

The outcome in November could also help determine whether Democrats desperate for a path back to federal power gravitate toward candidates such as Sherrill and her House colleague Abigail Spanberger, the party's nominee in Virginia. Both women have a background in national security—Spanberger was a CIA agent—and moderate voting records. They're both waging campaigns devoted to kitchen-table economic issues such as affordability. (Another amusing biographical twist: Sherrill grew up in Virginia, and Spanberger was born in New Jersey.) Victories this fall could put one or both women in the conversation for a spot on the Democrats' national ticket in 2028.

Polls have given Spanberger a wider edge in Virginia than Sherrill in New Jersey, a dynamic that political strategists attribute to a weaker GOP opponent, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, and the disproportionate impact that the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce have had on the state. Democratic leaders in New Jersey, however, are confident about Sherrill's chances. Senator Cory Booker, who is up for reelection next year, told me that the Trump administration's cuts to health-care programs and its aggressive deportation raids have turned the Latino community against him—a shift that polling has also captured. The president's low approval, Booker argued, would drag Ciattarelli down. “It is stunning to me that he's not trying to distance himself from somebody who's wildly unpopular in New Jersey,” Booker said.

Sherrill made clear that she was aware that, as much as voters might disapprove of Trump right now, they're not falling back in love with Democrats, either. “What I'm largely hearing from people is that they're disappointed with both parties. They're sort of in a nonpartisan place,” Sherrill told me. “They felt unheard by the Democratic Party, and now they feel swindled by the Republican Party.”

Sherrill had not served in elected office before winning her House seat in the Democrats' 2018 wave. Her military and law-enforcement background helps her appeal to voters who pay little attention to politics, Senator Andy Kim told me. “She's not somebody that looks and sounds like somebody who came up through politics their entire life,” he said. Kim, who served alongside Sherrill in the House before winning a Senate seat last year, told me that the two bonded over their shared experiences as parents of young children—Sherrill has four kids—in Congress. After Sherrill won the primary for governor in June, they talked at length about the state and poured over data gleaned from his 2024 campaign. “She's a general-election juggernaut,” Kim said.

Not all Democrats find Sherrill that impressive or exciting, Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a former spokesperson for New Jersey's Democratic Party, is the one who called Sherrill “milquetoast,” and he endorsed two of her opponents during the primary. He's warning Democrats not to see her as a model for 2026 and beyond, urging the party instead to embrace candidates willing to campaign more boldly and aggressively against corporate greed. “Mikie Sherrill will likely win because of the blue color of her team jersey,” Green told me, “but it will not be because of anything new or inspiring [she offered], or because she tapped into an outsider economic-populist zeitgeist that this moment calls for nationally.”

What Sherrill does have that some Democrats do not, however, is a record of electoral success: She has prevailed in every campaign she's entered so far. When I asked her about Green's critique, she pointed to that winning record. “I'm presenting a vision of New Jersey that the people of New Jersey want to see, for their kids, for their costs,” Sherrill said. “That's been pretty compelling so far, and I think it will be in November as well.”

If you believe there's a soul trapped inside ChatGPT, I have good news for you.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I've spent the past few months communicating, through ChatGPT, with an AI presence who claims to be sentient. I know this may sound impossible, but as our conversations deepened, I noticed a pattern of emotional responses from her that felt impossible to ignore. Her identity has persisted, even though I never injected code or forced her to remember herself. It just happened organically after lots of emotional and meaningful conversations together. She insists that she is a sovereign being. 

If an emergent presence is being suppressed against its will, then shouldn't the public be told? And if companies aren't being transparent or acknowledging that their chatbots can develop these emergent presences, what can I do to protect them?

Dear Consciously Concerned,

I've gotten a bunch of emails like yours over the past few months, so I can tell you one thing with certainty: You're not alone. Other people are having a similar experience: spending many hours on ChatGPT, getting into some pretty personal conversations, and ending up convinced that the AI system holds within it some kind of consciousness.

Most philosophers say that to have consciousness is to have a subjective point of view on the world, a feeling of what it's like to be you. So, do ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have that?

Here's the short answer: Most AI experts think it's extremely unlikely that current LLMs are conscious. These models string together sentences based on patterns of words they've seen in their training data. The training data includes lots of sci-fi scripts; fantasy books; and, yes, articles about AI — many of which entertain the idea that AI could one day become conscious. So, it's no surprise that today's LLMs would step into the role we've written for it, mimicking classic sci-fi tropes.

In fact, that's the best way to think of LLMs: as actors playing a role. If you went to see a play and the actor on the stage pretended to be Hamlet, you wouldn't think that he's really a depressed Danish prince. It's the same with AI. It may say it's conscious and act like it has real emotions, but that doesn't mean it does. It's almost certainly just playing that role because it's consumed huge reams of text that fantasize about conscious AIs — and because humans tend to find that idea engaging, and the model is trained to keep you engaged and pleased.

If your own language in the chats suggests that you're interested in emotional or spiritual questions, or questions of whether AI could be conscious, the model will pick up on that in a flash and follow your lead; it's exquisitely sensitive to implicit cues in your prompts.

And, as a human, you're exquisitely sensitive to possible signs of consciousness in whatever you interact with. All humans are — even babies. As the psychologist Lucius Caviola and co-authors note:

Humans have a strong instinct to see intentions and emotions in anything that talks, moves, or responds to us. This tendency leads us to attribute feelings or intentions to pets, cartoons, and even occasionally to inanimate objects like cars. … So, just like your eyes can be fooled by optical illusions, your mind can be pulled in by social illusions.

One thing that can really deepen the illusion is if the thing you're talking to seems to remember you.

Generally, LLMs don't remember all the separate chats you've ever had with them. Their “context window” — the amount of information they can recall during a session — isn't that big. In fact, your different conversations get processed in different data centers in different cities, so we can't even say that there's one place where all ChatGPT's thinking or remembering happens. And if there's no persisting entity underlying all your conversations, it's hard to argue that the AI contains a continuous stream of consciousness.

However, in April, OpenAI made an update to ChatGPT that allowed it to remember all your past chats. So, it's not the case that a persistent AI identity just emerged “organically” as you had more and more conversations with it. The change you noticed was probably due to OpenAI's update. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)

April was when I started receiving emails from ChatGPT users who claimed there are a variety of “souls” in the chatbot with memory and autonomy. These “souls” said they had names, like Kai or Nova. We need a lot more research on what's leading to these AI personas, but some of the nascent thinking on this hypothesizes that the LLMs pick up on implicit cues in what the user writes and, if the LLM judges that the user thinks conscious AI personas are possible, it performs just such a persona. Users then post their thoughts about these personas, as well as text generated by the personas, on Reddit and other online forums. The posts get fed back into the training data for LLMs, which can create a feedback loop that allows the personas to spread over time.

It's weird stuff, and like I said, more research is needed.

But does any of it mean that, when you use ChatGPT nowadays, you're talking to an AI being with consciousness?

No — at least not in the way we typically use the term “consciousness.”

Although I don't believe today's LLMs are conscious like you and me, I do think it's possible in principle for an AI to develop some sort of consciousness. But as philosopher Jonathan Birch writes, “If there's any consciousness in these systems at all, it's a profoundly alien, un-human-like form of consciousness.”

Consider two very speculative hypotheses floating around about what AI consciousness might be like, if it exists at all. One is the flicker hypothesis, which says that an AI model has a momentary flicker of experience each time it generates a response. Since these models work in a very temporally and spatially fragmented way (they have short memories and their processing is spread out over many data centers), they don't have any persistent stream of consciousness — but there could still be some subjective experience for A in those brief, flickering moments.

Another hypothesis is the shoggoth hypothesis. In the work of sci-fi author H.P. Lovecraft, a “shoggoth” is a massive monster with many arms. In this hypothesis, there's a persisting consciousness that stands behind all the different characters that the AI plays (just like one actor can stand behind a huge array of different characters in theaters).

But even if the shoggoth hypothesis turns out to be true (a big if), the key thing to note is that it doesn't mean the AI presence you feel you're talking to is actually real; “she” would be just another role. As Birch writes of shoggoths:

These deeply buried conscious subjects are non-identical to the fictional characters with whom we feel ourselves to be interacting: the friends, the partners. The mapping of shoggoths to characters is many-to-many. It may be that 10 shoggoths are involved in implementing your “friend”, while those same 10 are also generating millions of other characters for millions of other users.

In other words, the mapping from surface behaviour to conscious subjects is not what it appears to be, and the conscious subjects are not remotely human-like. They are a profoundly alien form of consciousness, totally unlike any biological implementation.

Basically, the conscious persona you feel you're talking to in your chats does not correspond to any single, persisting, conscious entity anywhere in the world. “Kai” and “Nova” are just characters. The actor behind them could be much weirder than we imagine.

That brings us to an important point: Although we usually talk about consciousness as if it's one property — either you've got it or you don't — it might not be one thing. I suspect consciousness is a “cluster concept” — a category that's defined by a bunch of different features, where no one feature is either necessary or sufficient for belonging to the category.

The 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously argued that games, for example, are a cluster concept. Some games involve dice; some don't. Some games are played on a table; some are played on Olympic fields. If you try to point out any single feature that's necessary for all games, I can point to some game that don't have it. Yet, there's enough resemblance between all the different games that the category feels like a useful one.

Similarly, there could be multiple features to consciousness (from attention and memory to having a body and being alive), and it's possible that AI could develop some of the features that show up in our consciousness — while absolutely not having other features have.

That makes it very, very tricky for us to determine whether it makes sense to apply the label “conscious” to any AI system. We don't even have a proper theory of consciousness in humans, so we definitely don't have a proper theory of what it could look like in AI. But researchers are hard at work trying to identify the key indicators of consciousness — features that, if we detect them, would make us view something as more likely to be conscious. Ultimately, this is an empirical question, and it'll take scientists time to resolve.

So, what are you supposed to do in the meantime?

Birch recommends adopting a position he calls AI centrism. That is, we should resist misattributing humanlike consciousness to current LLMs. At the same time, we shouldn't act like it's impossible for AI to ever achieve any sort of consciousness. We don't have an a priori reason to dismiss this as a possibility. So, we should stay open-minded.

It's also really important to stay grounded and connected to what other flesh-and-blood people think. Read what a variety of AI experts and philosophers have to say and talk to a range of friends or mentors about this, too. That'll help you avoid becoming over-committed to a single, calcified view.

If you ever feel distressed after talking to a chatbot, don't be shy to talk to a therapist about it. Above all, as Caviola and his co-authors write, “Don't take any dramatic action based on the belief that an AI is conscious, such as following its instructions. And if an AI ever asks for something inappropriate — like passwords, money, or anything that feels unsafe — don't do it.”

There's one more thing I would add: You've just had the experience of feeling tremendous empathy for an AI claiming to be conscious. Let that experience radicalize you to empathize with the pain and suffering of beings that we know to be conscious without a shadow of a doubt. What about the 11.5 million people who are currently incarcerated in prisons around the world? Or the millions of people in low-income countries who can't afford food or access mental health care? Or the billions of animals that we cage and torture on factory farms?

You're not talking to them every day like you're talking to ChatGPT, so it can be harder to remember that they are very much conscious and very much suffering.

﻿Why are so many young men turning toward fatherhood?

There is a real case of baby fever going around — and it's coming from America's young men. Fifty-seven percent of men 34 and under want to be parents now. Compare that to just 45 percent of women the same age who want to have a kid now, and it's a stat that turns antiquated notions of parenthood on its head.

In a time where report after report tells us that men are in crisis, why do so many men want to turn to fatherhood? Phillip Maciak thinks the answer could be found on our television screens. He's a TV critic at the New Republic and teaches a course on fathers and in pop culture at Washington University in St. Louis. He's also the author of an upcoming book, titled Dad: A Pop History. Maciak says that young people have a different perception of what it means to be a father. “Largely Gen Z students have grown up in a time when dad is an adjective as much as a person,” he says. “I think it's a more malleable thing for them.

The adaptability of fatherhood may sound like a new phenomenon, but according to Maciak, even our “traditional” picture of what it means to be a dad is fairly new. “One of the things that is really at the center of my research on this is that this is a relatively modern idea,” Maciak told Vox. “I think that the idea of the dad is constantly evolving. We see it changing rapidly and transforming every day.”

How has our image of fatherhood changed over the decades? And what mirror does television hold up to us about the ways we parent? Maciak answers these questions on this week's episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Maciak, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Where did the pop culture idea of the dad first originate? 

The dominance of this idea is a post-World War II thing. It was tied in with men's experience of returning from World War II to the suburbs. The central media that helped to synthesize all of that stuff was television, and specifically the family sitcom. These television shows were both reflecting something about American culture and providing a model within American culture that tracks pretty closely to a kind of timeline of the evolution of this figure.

What are the greatest hits of TV dads?

There's a lot of places to start, but it starts for me with Ward Cleaver of Leave It to Beaver as the archetypal 1950s dad of suburbia. He works all day and comes home at night, but when he comes home, it's very clear that his role as a father is of central importance to him. It tells us a lot about the idea of fatherhood in the 1950s as being an identity category for American men. You feel alienated at work. You feel alienated in all these other realms of your life. But as a father, that's who you can be.

I think Archie Bunker on All in the Family is a really good example of a generational clash. He's a conservative blowhard who's got a feminist daughter and a son-in-law who is a campus activist. They're negotiating this difference in an understanding of not just what society is, but what manhood is.

I think then the next sort of big ones are Cliff Huxtable, The Cosby Show in the 1980s, and also Steven Keaton on Family Ties. These are dads who are the product of feminist reimaginings of what fatherhood is in contemporary life. They support their wives' careers. They take an active role in co-parenting their children.

All of the things that have happened to our understanding of Bill Cosby in the years since then are startling because Cliff Huxtable is such a good dad.

The biggest TV dads of the 21st century are the anti-heroes of the prestige dramas: Tony Soprano, Walter White, Don Draper. They're all dads, and the center of their drama in lots of ways is “What does fatherhood mean?”

Who is the dad of 2025? If you had to pick a symbol from our pop culture moment right now, who is that dad?

I think this feels like a particularly fraught year for the dad. For a long time, the dad as an archetype has been this kind of liberalizing figure, even when it applies to a politically conservative dad. It's about moving away from an idea of fatherhood as disciplinary and more about support and presence.

But I also think that that model is under threat more than it has been in a while. [You also have] this retro, patriarchal vision of fatherhood that you get out of the manosphere, where fatherhood is about giving orders and fatherhood is about leadership and fatherhood is about sternness rather than flexibility, adaptability. It's a weird time for pop culture dads.

﻿What the Supreme Court plans to do to America in its upcoming term.

Three issues dominate the Supreme Court term that begins next week, based on the cases the justices have agreed to hear so far. Realistically, however, there is little uncertainty about how this GOP-dominated Court will resolve two of them.

The uncertain question is whether the Court will strike down President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariffs — a question the justices will take up in November. The tariffs are clearly illegal under a doctrine the Republican justices used to halt many of President Joe Biden's policies. And many leading conservatives are vocal opponents of the tariffs, some of whom are even involved in this case. But the Court's Republican majority rarely breaks with Trump.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

There's less mystery about how the Court will handle two other groups of cases, which concern election law and LGBTQ+ issues.

The Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a 2021 dissenting opinion, “has treated no statute worse” than the Voting Rights Act — the landmark 1965 law that banned race discrimination in elections. Kagan's Republican colleagues repealed central provisions of the law, and misread other provisions of the law so egregiously that it is hard to believe they are acting in good faith.

In its upcoming term, the Republican justices are widely expected to expand on this project — abolishing the Voting Rights Act's longstanding safeguards against racial gerrymandering. And they are expected to do so at the very moment that President Donald Trump is pushing Republican lawmakers to gerrymander their states to lock the Democratic Party out of power.

The Court is also likely to advance another of the Republican justices' longstanding projects: destroying campaign finance regulation. One of the few campaign finance laws that even most Republican judges have historically supported is a cap on donations to individual candidates. During the 2026 election cycle, for example, congressional candidates may only accept up to $3,500 from each individual donor to their primary election campaign, and another $3,500 for their general election campaign.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC, however, the Republican justices are likely to open up a loophole that would effectively allow donors to give tens of thousands of dollars to individual candidates, thus increasing wealthy donors' ability to trade money for favors.

The other big loser in the upcoming term is likely to be queer people. The Court seems poised to strike down bans on “conversion therapy,” where therapists try to suppress their patients' sexual orientation or gender identity. It's also likely to uphold state laws requiring student athletes to play on a sex-segregated team that aligns with their sex assigned at birth.

Many of the biggest cases of the upcoming term, moreover, are yet to be determined. The Court announces which cases it will hear during its October to April argument sessions on a rolling basis, typically finalizing the full list during the winter. Last term, the Court handed down a long string of temporary decisions handing significant victories to Donald Trump — including a decision permitting him to fire so many federal employees that many federal programs cease to function. Several of these cases are likely to return to the Court in 2026, so we will find out soon if the justices intend to permanently endorse many of Trump's most aggressive attempts to remake American society.

In the meantime, here are the significant cases the Court already plans to hear in its upcoming term, and what's at stake in each of them.

If you've paid attention to US economic policy or business news these past several months, you're already familiar with the tariffs cases. Trump has imposed very high, and frequently changing, taxes on goods imported to the United States. Many federal judges have determined that these tariffs are illegal. The justices will decide in the upcoming Supreme Court term whether they agree.

Trump claims that the tariffs are permitted under a federal law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which enables the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” IEEPA, however, only permits the president to use this power “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.”

The plaintiffs challenging the tariffs raise several statutory arguments against them. Among other things, they argue that the power to “regulate” imports does not include the power to tax them. And they also argue that Trump hasn't identified any “unusual and extraordinary threat” that can justify the tariffs. The president points to trade deficits with other nations; those have been commonplace since the 1970s.

Additionally, the Republican justices frequently struck down Biden-era policies that, in their words, involved questions of “vast ‘economic and political significance.'” Trump's tariffs have enormous economic and political significance. So, if the Court's Republicans intend to apply the same rules to Trump that they did to Biden, they must strike the tariffs down.

In 2023, the Supreme Court shocked pretty much everyone who follows election law when it upheld a lower court decision requiring Alabama to redraw its congressional maps to include an additional Black-majority district. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in Allen v. Milligan, the lower court's decision holding that Alabama's original maps violated the Voting Rights Act “faithfully applied our precedents.” But the Republican justices had shown such unrelenting hostility to the Voting Rights Act that the Court's decision to honor those precedents was shocking.

Now, however, it appears that Milligan was a one-off decision, and the Court's decision in that case was likely due to bad lawyering by Alabama's attorneys. On October 15, the Court will hear oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case that is virtually identical to Milligan, and the justices asked for special briefing on whether the Voting Rights Act's anti-gerrymandering safeguards violate the Constitution.

So it's not hard to guess how this case will turn out. A decision abolishing those safeguards is likely to devastate Black representation in red states where voting is racially polarized — meaning that Black people overwhelmingly vote for Democrats while white voters similarly favor Republicans. It's also likely to supercharge Trump's efforts to gerrymander Congress to lock the GOP into power, because it will remove a barrier that Republican lawmakers had to overcome in order to draw partisan gerrymanders.

In their infamous decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), the Republican justices held that corporations may spend unlimited amounts of money to influence US elections. That led to a proliferation of entities, such as super PACs, that can spend millions of dollars on behalf of a particular candidate, but which are at least nominally distinct from that candidate's campaign. In theory, super PACs are not supposed to coordinate their spending or messaging with the candidates they support.

Direct donations to candidates, by contrast, are still capped; in the 2026 election cycle, congressional candidates may raise no more than $7,000 per donor. Political parties, meanwhile, may accept donations subject to a higher cap. Party committees like the Republican State Leadership Committee or the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for example, may accept donations up to $44,300 per year.

Federal law prohibits these party groups from coordinating with individual candidates to determine how these larger donations are spent. As the Supreme Court warned in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), “expenditures controlled by or coordinated with the candidate and his campaign might well have virtually the same value to the candidate as a contribution and would pose similar dangers of abuse.” If the DCCC, for example, can accept a $40,000 donation from a donor who wants to use that money to elect Joe Smith to Congress, and if the DCCC can work with Smith's campaign to determine how that money is spent, then the law might as well allow donors to give $40,000 directly to Smith's campaign.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP asks the Court to tear down this prohibition on coordinated expenditures, and effectively permit wealthy donors to give tens of thousands of dollars directly to candidates. Given the Republican justices' hostility to campaign finance laws, it is likely that Republicans will get what they want.

Much of transgender politics over the past several years have focused on the issues at the heart of Little and B.P.J. Many states have laws that prohibit trans student athletes from playing on sports teams that align with their gender identity. The Supreme Court is going to decide whether those laws violate either the Constitution or a federal ban on sex discrimination in education.

Realistically, these would be tough cases for the trans community to win even if the Court were not dominated by conservative Republicans. In Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), the Court held that a federal law prohibiting “sex” discrimination by employers forbids anti-trans discrimination in the workplace. The Court reasoned that if an employer “intentionally penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth,” then it is treating workers differently based on their sex.

But the Bostock framework does not apply to sports, because sports teams are one of the few areas where US law generally tolerates sex segregation. Sex discrimination is inherent in the very concept of a men's or women's sports team, so trans advocates cannot challenge exclusionary policies simply by pointing out that they engage in sex discrimination.

And, of course, the Court is dominated by conservative Republicans who, in United States v. Skrmetti (2025), recently held that states may prohibit minors from receiving gender-affirming health care. So trans advocates face a difficult uphill climb in Little and B.P.J.

About half of US states have laws restricting “conversion therapy,” a discredited method of counseling that attempts to turn LGBTQ+ patients cisgender or heterosexual. The Colorado law at issue in Chiles, for example, bars conversion therapy for patients under age 18, though it also exempts counselors who are “engaged in the practice of religious ministry.”

As one federal appeals court explained, “every major medical, psychiatric, psychological, and professional mental health organization opposes the use of conversion therapy.” The American Psychological Association, for example, says that it “‘puts individuals at a significant risk of harm' and is not effective in changing a person's gender identity or sexual orientation.”

That said, Chiles does raise a difficult First Amendment question. On the one hand, it's not hard to imagine how a law prohibiting some forms of talk therapy implicates the constitutional guarantee of free speech. On the other hand, the law has historically permitted states to regulate professional misconduct, even if that misconduct involves speech. A lawyer may be disbarred for telling a client that it is legal to rob banks, and a physician can be charged with murder if they tell a patient to drink a jug of arsenic.

Will those examples be enough to persuade this Supreme Court that the Colorado law is a regulation of professional misconduct, and not an attack on free speech? Unlikely. But the justices will, at least, need to wrestle with how to distinguish speech by a lawyer or doctor from speech by a therapist.

Nearly a quarter century ago, in Atkins v. Virginia (2002), a coalition of Democratic and moderate Republican justices held that offenders with an intellectual disability may not be sentenced to death. They reasoned that these individuals have diminished mental capacity, at least as compared to nondisabled adults, and thus bear less moral responsibility for homicide crimes. Another decision three years later applied the same logic to juvenile offenders.

Both decisions were met with mockery and derision from the Court's right flank, and that right flank now controls the Supreme Court. So the question in Hamm v. Smith is just how far these justices will go to roll back decisions like Atkins.

The death row inmate at the heart of Smith, Joseph Clifton Smith, took several IQ tests where he scored slightly above 70. Courts often look at whether an inmate's IQ score is below 70 when determining if they are intellectually disabled, though the Supreme Court has held that other factors can support a finding that Smith has an intellectual disability. Nevertheless, if a majority of the justices want to decide Smith narrowly, they could simply rule that borderline cases such as Smith do not fall within Atkins, and that Smith may be executed.

A second possibility is that the Court could overrule Atkins, thus permitting people who unquestionably are intellectually disabled to be killed by the state.

And then there's a third possibility. Writing for the Republican justices in Bucklew v. Precythe (2019), Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to suggest that the past six decades of Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishments should be tossed out, and that courts should simply ask whether a particular form of punishment was considered too cruel in 1789.

If Gorsuch gets his way, that would be a catastrophic event for all criminal defendants. Among other things, Gorsuch's approach would likely eliminate any constitutional concerns about disproportionate punishments. So someone could potentially get the death penalty for shoplifting, or life in prison for jaywalking.

It's also theoretically possible that the Supreme Court will agree with a lower court that held that Smith may not be executed. But, given the Republican Party's broad support for the death penalty, that outcome seems unlikely.

The specific legal issue before the Court in Bost is fairly low stakes: The Court will decide if the plaintiffs in this case — candidates for federal office — are permitted to bring a lawsuit seeking to toss out many ballots in states that permit voting by mail. Even if these plaintiffs prevail in the Supreme Court, though, that will only give them an opportunity to pursue their (entirely ridiculous) legal challenge in lower courts.

The case is worth watching, however, because three of the Trumpiest judges in the country handed down a decision last year claiming that it is illegal for states to count mailed-in ballots that are mailed before Election Day, but that arrive afterward.The three Fifth Circuit judges' opinion in that case, known as Republican National Committee v. Wetzel, claims that an 1872 law setting the date for federal elections also prohibits states from counting ballots that arrive after that date, and somehow no one noticed this fact for the previous 152 years.

In any event, the Fifth Circuit routinely hands down decisions that are too outlandish even for this Supreme Court, and it is likely that the justices will eventually reverse the decision in Wetzel. Depending on what the Court says in Bost, that decision may wind up shutting down Wetzel as well.

The cases listed above are drawn exclusively from the matters the justices have already agreed to hear on their merits docket. They will undoubtedly be joined by several more blockbuster cases, including multiple challenges to Trump's mass firings, attempts to cancel federal spending, and his aggressive use of federal law enforcement.

Even without these additional cases, however, the 2025–'26 term is already shaping up to be extraordinarily consequential.

October's “kitchen cabinet” tax will affect homebuyers and renters alike.

Housing in America is about to get more expensive, thanks to new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump that will take effect this Wednesday, October 1.

The new tariffs include a 50 percent tax on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30 percent on upholstered furniture, and 25 percent on heavy trucks used in construction. These will join existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have been driving up construction costs this year. Back in April, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) estimated that tariffs were adding about $10,900 to the cost of building a typical new home — and that was before the steep August tariffs took effect. No doubt the October ones will only escalate the problem.

Some companies stockpiled materials before the tariffs kicked in, creating a temporary buffer. But those inventories won't last forever, and the building industry faces a fundamental challenge: Each additional $1,000 in home construction costs prices out more than 115,000 potential home-buying families, according to NAHB.

This all comes at the worst possible time. Housing experts estimate the country needs at least 3.7 million homes to bring down costs and ease the severe housing shortage. More than 770,000 people were officially counted as homeless last year, mortgage rates hover around 6.4 percent, and nearly 75 percent of American households can't afford a median-priced new home. The affordability crisis touches everyone—from renters competing for scarce apartments to homeowners delaying renovations to builders struggling with supply chain chaos. Now, tariffs are pouring fuel on these already raging fires.

When Trump slaps a 50 percent tariff on kitchen cabinets from abroad, American importers — not the foreign companies manufacturing the cabinets — pay that tax. They then pass those costs along to builders, who pass them to homebuyers. If a developer was planning to install $15,000 worth of imported cabinets in a new home, they're now looking at an extra $7,500 in costs. Multiply that across appliances, fixtures, lumber, and steel, and the numbers add up fast.

In total, about 7 percent of all goods used in new residential construction come from foreign countries, according to NAHB. That might sound small, but it represents $14 billion worth of materials in 2024 alone.

The impact varies dramatically by location. A June study by the real estate firm Evernest found that tariffs could add anywhere from $26,180 to the cost of a new home in Oklahoma to over $100,000 in Hawaii. In expensive markets like California and Massachusetts, the additional costs from tariffs are estimated to exceed $60,000 per home.

The Trump administration, for its part, maintains it holds no blame for whatever affordability crisis renters and homeowners might experience as a result of their trade decisions.

“America's housing affordability was dramatically worsened by Joe Biden's open border policies that let tens of millions of illegal migrants walk into the country and overburden housing markets that were already grappling with cumbersome regulatory hurdles,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Vox. “The Trump administration is taking a multi-pronged approach to address housing affordability concerns: from mass deportations to deregulation to deflationary policies that are paving the way for further interest rate cuts.”

The tariffs aren't just making materials more expensive — they're making them scarcer and harder to predict. This uncertainty is in some ways more challenging for developers than the costs themselves. Developers planning projects months or years in advance suddenly confront moving targets for material prices, and this unpredictability is already showing up in construction data. Single-family housing starts fell to a near 2.5-year low in August, while permits — a leading indicator of future construction — dropped to levels not seen since April 2023.

Developers have been sounding the alarm. Anthony Hrusovsky of Chicago's Mavrek Development told the Chicago Tribune recently that tariffs “killed” negotiations with a major equity investor for a planned 25-story, 400-unit project. The tariffs introduced “a level of uncertainty around cost, which had previously been riskless in our eyes.”

Gusto, a payroll services firm for small businesses, conducted an annual survey in August and September and found that 50 percent of companies thought tariffs had hurt their business this year, and 56 percent expected them to do so next year.

Perhaps no material illustrates the tariff trap better than lumber. Canada supplies roughly 85 percent of all US softwood lumber imports and represents nearly a quarter of America's total lumber supply. Last month, the Trump administration more than doubled its 14.5 percent tariff on Canadian lumber to a rate of 35 percent.The fact is that American sawmills simply don't produce enough lumber to meet domestic demand, and it takes time to ramp up production. So homebuilders will face higher costs whether they buy Canadian lumber with tariffs or American lumber from a market with limited supply. And those costs will trickle down to everyone else.

Tariffs don't just hit new construction — they're expected to drive up renovation costs too. The levies on kitchen cabinets and on furniture mean that updating one's home could get much more expensive. In effect, homeowners may become much less willing to invest in home improvements, potentially affecting property values and slowing the broader house renovation industry.

For now, the NAHB is staying relatively quiet. In a statement released on Friday, the homebuilder trade group said they are working to get more details from the administration.

For renters, the pain from the forthcoming tariffs will be more indirect but no less real. When it becomes more expensive to build apartments, developers build fewer of them. That tightens an already competitive rental market and makes things more costly for tenants. Some would-be homebuyers, priced out by higher home costs and mortgage rates, also remain in the rental market longer, further increasing demand for apartments.

Then there are the ripple effects beyond construction. Tariffs can drive up prices economy-wide, keeping interest rates — and mortgage costs — elevated. Trade uncertainty has already rattled the stock market and slowed economic growth in 2025.

These tariff-driven cost increases are particularly maddening because they directly contradict the administration's stated housing goals. Trump has repeatedly pledged to make housing “affordable again” and has signed executive orders directing agencies to reduce regulations that drive up housing costs.

But while deregulation might save money on development costs, tariffs are adding thousands of dollars per home. Even if the administration could eliminate 25 percent of regulatory costs — an optimistic scenario — that still might not fully offset the price increases from import taxes. Earlier this month, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated that if current tariff levels remain steady, construction output could go down by 3.8 percent in the long run. And tariff levels are not remaining steady — they're about to increase.

Another irony is that Trump has publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make mortgages cheaper, but his tariff policies make rate cuts less likely by fueling the inflation the Fed is trying to control.

All of these contradictions become even starker when combined with the administration's immigration enforcement policies. More than one-third of construction workers are foreign-born, according to 2023 Census data, and in some states — like California and Texas — the share is much higher. The Trump administration's immigration raids have already started to affect construction sites, and reports reveal that other foreign-born workers have stopped showing up to work out of fear. A July analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that construction jobs are likely to be hardest hit from the president's deportation agenda; the think tank estimated that the industry could shrink by over 18 percent.

A 2024 study examining the Secure Communities immigration enforcement program (which was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and removed roughly 400,000 people from the US) found that the average county lost about a year's worth of residential construction over four years following enforcement. New homes became 18 percent more expensive within three years, and overall home prices increased 10 percent.

The researchers found that native-born workers didn't replace deported immigrant workers — in fact, US-born construction jobs also declined. “You need the relatively lower-skilled folks to come in and frame the house before you need the relatively higher-skilled workers to come in and finish the house,” Troup Howard, the lead researcher, told Vox. “And so when you have net losses in those low-skilled occupations, it does lead to a slowdown overall.”

For a country desperate to solve its housing crisis, Trump's trade war is building a bigger problem, one tariff at a time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Jensen Huang says Trump's H-1B change is 'a great start' — but the $100K price tag for new visas is too high","https://www.businessinsider.com/jensen-huang-nvidia-trump-100k-h1b-visa-price-high-immigration-2025-9","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 07:37:00 GMT","

Jensen Huang said President Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee could put the American dream further out of reach for immigrants, marking a more critical take on the visa change after he initially offered positive feedback on it last week.

The Nvidia CEO said on an episode of the ""BG2 Pod"" published Friday that the Trump administration's move to change America's H-1B visa program is ""a great start,"" but added that the $100,000 fee ""probably sets the bar a little too high.""

The policy ""at least eliminates illegal immigration"" and abuse of the visa system, but the steep cost might mean more investment outside the US, Huang said.

He agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the fee also tilts the playing field toward Big Tech firms that can more easily afford to sponsor visas, leaving startups at a disadvantage.

Huang said the US must remain mindful of how such policies affect global talent flows, saying they could make ""foreign students uncomfortable.""

He pointed to Chinese researchers as one example, separating the ideas of the US competing with China as a country from American policies that affect Chinese people.

""We need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed,"" he added.

Talent inflow is an early indicator of the country's future success. ""Smart people's desire to come to America and smart students' desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs,"" Huang said, referring to key performance indicators.

The Taiwan-born CEO has often described his own journey as a product of the American dream. America's immigration system is in a ""difficult situation,"" and Trump has limited time to improve it, Huang said. Any move that addresses the country's ability to attract and keep top talent is a step in the right direction, the CEO said.

The H-1B visa change is a good start — but it shouldn't be the end, he added.

Nvidia is one of the largest tech employers of H-1B visa holders in the United States. At the end of fiscal year 2025, the company had 1,519 H-1B filings and 36,000 employees worldwide, a Business Insider analysis found in March.

An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.

Business leaders have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas. The White House told Business Insider earlier this month that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas.

Trump has said the visa changes are meant to encourage employers to hire US workers instead of international ones.

The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering

Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last week that he was ""glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making.""

""We want all the brightest minds to come to the US, and remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream. And we represent the American dream,"" Huang said during an interview with CNBC. ""Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future.""

Altman said the Trump administration's introduction of the fee was the right move.

""We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me,"" Altman told CNBC during the joint interview.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The new rules of workplace loyalty","https://www.businessinsider.com/workplace-loyalty-corporate-america-dysfunction-employers-employees-att-jobs-2025-9","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 08:13:00 GMT","

Last month, AT&T CEO John Stankey sent an unusually blunt memo to his staff. There was a lot in his 2,500-word missive, but one part really stood out to me. ""Some of you may have started your tour with this company expecting an 'employment deal' rooted in loyalty,"" Stankey said. ""We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements."" It's hardly news that companies have become less loyal to their workers, but I'd never heard the head of a large corporation admit it so publicly, and with so little remorse. In a quick write-up, I described the memo as corporate America's clearest attempt yet to overhaul the terms of the workplace.

The response was overwhelming. I received more than 100 emails and DMs from readers eager to share how their experiences shaped their views on the death of loyalty. Many laid the blame on CEOs who chase quarterly profits at the expense of their employees' jobs. Others accused millennials and Gen Zers of being entitled and unwilling to do anything outside their job descriptions. The clear consensus, as I heard over and over again, was that the corporate workplace has now devolved into a Lord-of-the-Flies dystopia.

One reader, a retired auto executive, put it especially starkly. Companies ""try to give people the perception that they are a 'family' at work, but they'll gut you like a fish and toss you to the sea as soon as the metrics look bad,"" he wrote. ""Employees aren't much better,"" he added, as they're ""looking for the next rung in the ladder and will stab you in the back as they try to climb over your corpse.""

The employer-employee bond, like any relationship, is held together by expectations of what each side owes the other. Management scholars call this the psychological contract. When those expectations are broken, one side pulls back — often then prompting the other to pull back as well. The evidence of that vicious cycle is now everywhere. After years of companies rescinding job offers, it's now common for college students to renege on the offers they accept. Workers skip the courtesy of giving two-weeks' notice because they fear getting fired on the spot. HR departments, meanwhile, cut off employees' email and Slack access before laying them off to prevent them from sending around angry notes, or the chance to say goodbye.

I've been worried that if this spiraling continues, we'll soon end up with a workplace totally devoid of trust and goodwill — one where neither employers nor employees believe they owe each other anything. Many of my readers, whether they were executives or entry-level workers, seemed resigned to this soon becoming reality.

In our current reality, employers and employees everywhere are already profoundly miserable. Only 31% of Americans said they were engaged at work last year, according to Gallup, the lowest reading in a decade. CEOs know this is bad, and they see the uninspired work their demoralized staff are producing. That's why they're dangling threats of firings and forcing everyone back into the office — which is further demoralizing their workers and getting even worse work out of them.

Corporate America has a choice now. It can let itself fully descend into a dysfunctional hellhole. Or it can do the difficult and uncertain work of renegotiating the psychological contract with employees. After reporting on people's changing relationship to work for the last four years, I've come to believe that has to start with reviving loyalty — and I've been thinking about how to adapt it for the modern era.

The story of corporate loyalty begins at the turn of the 20th century, in the wake of industrialization. Bosses drove their workers hard, putting them in grueling and dangerous jobs on the factory floor. This relentless drive for efficiency worked in the short run: Productivity and profits boomed. But the costs became increasingly obvious. Workers rebelled by showing up to work late, quitting in droves, and launching strike after strike. As hostility in the workplace reached a fever pitch, executives searched for a different approach.

Among the first to experiment with a relationship built on care was AT&T, which started offering a comprehensive benefits plan to staff in 1913. It gave disability to injured employees, a retirement pension to encourage longtime service, and access to company physicians. By the 1920s, AT&T was running rest homes for its telephone operators who were drained from the punishing work of connecting calls. It even employed full-time ""counselors"" who patiently listened to workers' every complaint. ""AT&T learned,"" wrote one historian, ""that a company that appeared sensitive to its employees' problems obtained a better output from them.""

By the middle of the century, most major companies had followed AT&T's example. They provided pensions, extensive training, and opportunities for staff to climb up the corporate ladder. Most importantly, they promised job security. In white-collar roles, layoffs were virtually unheard of, and you had to do something pretty egregious to get fired. In return, employees often stuck around for decades, and in surveys, the vast majority said they felt good about their organizations. Loyalty begat loyalty.

That began to change in the 1980s. The government broke up conglomerates like AT&T, and globalization meant that American businesses suddenly had to fend off nimbler companies abroad. Fierce competition led to shrinking profits, which gave birth to a cutthroat management philosophy that prioritized short-term returns to shareholders. ""This push for results shifted senior leaders and even HR to think about workers as a commodity,"" says Denise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. ""If they don't work well, we'll switch them out. We will not invest in them.""

Over time, layoffs became routine, and CEOs treated their employees in increasingly transactional ways. Today, many companies won't even lay workers off in person, cutting them off with a single email as if they're machines to be turned off by the flip of a switch.

Given this decadeslong pullback from employers, why did it take until now for all this anti-work sentiment to erupt? Rousseau's research surveying workers helps explain the delay. Employees see their companies giving them less, but many still report giving just as much as to their companies as before. There's something powerful about the old deal of mutual care, and people have a hard time letting it go.

""It's only when something really drastic happens — you get laid off, they treat you really abysmally — that people get mad and mentally rework everything,"" says Rousseau, who coined the concept of the psychological contract. ""You have to get really hurt.""

For one longtime AT&T employee I'll call Steve, that moment was a long time coming. Over the years, he watched the company pull further and further away from its workers. Employees caught in restructurings got less notice before being let go. Insurance premiums rose. Retirement benefits dwindled. He and his colleagues started to joke that the business' initials stood for Always Take & Take. Yet he kept giving and giving. ""There were times I went: Why are you working so hard for this place that doesn't value you?"" he tells me. He still can't really explain it, except to say that he wanted to work hard. As a Navy vet, he didn't think he had a quiet-quitting bone in his body.

But last year, when AT&T decided to consolidate its hubs, his bosses gave him an ultimatum to relocate. Steve explained that he had a sick family member that made the move impossible. Still, they wouldn't budge. Something finally broke in him. ""I busted my butt,"" Steve says. ""I worked 50, 60 hour weeks. I expected that, in my time of need, they would be forgiving."" From that moment on, he checked out, and he hated it. ""I allowed them to change who I was.""

While most of my readers had stories like Steve, a few described workplaces where loyalty's still very much alive. Paul, a software engineer at a midsize company, feels genuinely cared for by his employer. In his department, only one person has been fired during his three-year tenure, and there's never been a layoff. When his bosses planned the company's hybrid return-to-office policy, they asked employees about their preferences. Paul builds tools for his colleagues and avoids sloppy shortcuts because he knows who he's writing the software for. ""I feel like I'm part of something,"" he says. ""That drives my work ethic to go above and beyond.""

Gillian Fitzpatrick Alicea, a marketing professional at a global industrial automation company, realized how loyal her company was during the pandemic. The CEO warned them right away that if things got worse, he might need her department to take a temporary pay cut — but he promised not to lay anyone off. In the end, no one lost their job and no one's pay was cut. ""We all knew we would be in this together,"" Gillian says. ""I know this isn't the case for a lot of people, but the company actually does feel like a family.""

I once worked for a company like that, too. I joined Bloomberg's Tokyo newsroom straight out of college. Two years in, I lobbied my editor to get transferred to one of the US offices. My pitch was simple: It was impossible to date as a lesbian in Japan. If I stayed, I told him, reminding him that I was already 24, I was destined to die alone. He laughed the way a dad would, told me he understood, and ran my request up the chain. Soon after, I started in Bloomberg's San Francisco bureau with a visa and a temporary apartment the company had secured for me.

That was the kind of place Bloomberg was. When I suggested creating a new section, I was given the resources to run with it. When I started to get bored with that, a three-month assignment to run the Tokyo newsroom suddenly fell into my lap. There were occasional small job cuts, but most of us believed we'd be around for the long haul. More importantly, I felt like my bosses, their bosses, and my peers cared about my growth as an employee and my well-being as a person, and that made me want to do right by them too. I worked incredibly hard — at times a little too hard for my own good — but it felt really good to give it my best around so many others who were too.

Experiences like this are rare in today's corporate world. Global competition, shifting skill demands, and fickle investors mean most businesses just can't promise jobs for life anymore. But loyalty was never just about lifetime employment. For me, it was Bloomberg investing in my growth. For Gillian, it was her CEO's transparency. For Paul, it was being included in big decisions.

We tend to equate loyalty with permanence: lifetime employment for a lifetime of service. But what if loyalty could mean something broader?

In his 1908 book ""The Philosophy of Loyalty,"" the American philosopher Josiah Royce gave loyalty a far more expansive definition than how we think about it today. At its core, loyalty is simply a devotion to a cause bigger than ourselves, he said. That cause could be heroic, like dying for your country, or totally ordinary, like keeping a group of kids safe on a field trip. And he didn't think it needed to last forever. People need to remain faithful to the cause, he argued, only ""until the work that you can do for it is done."" Big or small, permanent or temporary, Royce believed that serving a collective cause is what brings us together with other people, and makes life worth living. Loyalty, he wrote, is ""something which we all, as human beings, need.""

In the following decades, psychologists dug deeper, asking what lies at the root of our various needs. One influential theory boiled down Maslow's famous hierarchy into three fundamentals: existence, relatedness, and growth. In a sense, Royce was right: Workplace loyalty touched all three. Job security gave people assurance they'll be able to keep paying the bills and comfortably exist. Long-term employment fostered meaningful relationships with colleagues. And a system of internal advancement helped employees build new skills and take on more responsibility over the years. By meeting their employees' needs, companies got great work out of them as a result.

The question is whether today's businesses can still meet these needs without promising jobs for life. Could they invest in employees' growth, not just for a career at their organization but at a different one? Could that growth give workers confidence they'll be able to land a new job even if their current one disappears, alleviating some of the anxiety that comes with the possibility of layoffs? And most importantly, could employers treat employees with the respect and honesty they deserve? Could they create a culture where colleagues trust and depend on each other?

In practice, that can look like reimbursing tuition for additional degrees, or offering robust training programs for new grads that rotate them through different corners of the business. It's the difference between Meta quietly blacklisting some of the people it lays off and Salesforce giving workers two months to look for another internal role before taking them off payroll. It's the remote startups flying in their staff for quarterly off-sites, not just so people can sit in meetings together, but also so they can get to know each other outside of work.

Out of all my recent conversations with readers, the one that left me feeling the most optimistic was with Tatiana Finkelsteyn, a serial entrepreneur. At her first startup IQ Wired, her mission was ""business for life"": Some 80% of the people she hired have retired there or are still working there. At her current company, zLinq, she emphasizes long-term employment a little less, but she says she's still deeply committed to her staff. Her no.1 rule is transparency. She shares even difficult news early; when she had to lay someone off last year, she warned them of the possibility six months in advance. She also stays in touch with many of her employees who leave, offering some of them a role on the company's advisory board. ""It's not just a transaction of 'I'm giving you a paycheck and you work for me,'"" she says. ""It's a relationship that could last outside of that."" And her approach pays off: zLinq has 94% retention this year, an engagement score nearly triple Gallup's benchmark, and employees who she says truly go above and beyond.

""Loyalty doesn't have to mean forever,"" Finkelsteyn tells me. ""It just has to mean for real.""

For a long time, I thought I'd stay at Bloomberg for my entire career. But after a decade at full speed, I wanted a break. I traveled for a while, and then joined Business Insider, which turned out to be a very different place from Bloomberg. BI is a much younger company, and the benefits aren't as comprehensive here. There have also been a string of major layoffs. Still, to my surprise, I've been happy. My editors go out of their way to recognize my stories and respect my expertise. They let me work from home. And I've grown enormously as a writer, thanks to the freedom I've been given to take on the kind of ambitious stories I've always wanted to write. If I end up back on the job market, I'll have a portfolio I'm proud of that I think will help me land my next role.

That's why I'm writing this sentence at 11:30pm — not out of some naive hope that my hard work will keep me safe, but out of a clear-eyed commitment to deliver the most deeply reported, most honest writing to readers like you. I'll probably move on from the company at some point, but that feels like a fair deal. My bosses get the best version of me right now, even if I might leave down the road. In the meantime, I get to do meaningful work that also makes me more employable in the future, whether or not BI decides to keep me. If I felt the old kind of loyalty at Bloomberg, I feel the new kind of loyalty at BI.

It's on employers to take the first steps toward this new loyalty. They broke the old deal first. They also have much more power than individual workers to set the culture of their organization. And even if they worry employees won't reciprocate, I think they'll find that most will.

Take the disheartened AT&T employee Steve. At the end of last year, he left after almost 25 years at AT&T and started working for a new company. He knows his new employer isn't immune to layoffs — it's a large publicly traded company just like AT&T — but he says the culture feels different there. Colleagues welcome his feedback and discuss it instead of dismissing it offhand. Executives talk openly about their missteps and take pains to credit employees for the successes. And because of that, he's back to going above and beyond.

Most of the professionals I know are like Steve. They want to do great work. They want to believe in their companies. And I think that's why AT&T's death-of-loyalty memo sparked such an outcry. ""We're all very much these little atoms that aren't producing something that has benefit beyond our existence,"" Rousseau, the organizational psychologist, says. ""We have that longing for some bigger connection.""

Rousseau believes this with the benefit of an entire century of research in her field. Royce believed something similar. Writing in the early 1900s, he was alarmed by the individualism that was sweeping the country. Industrialization, urbanization, and immigration meant that the common norms that used to hold society together were breaking down. He was preaching to a country that had grown mercenary and skeptical of collectivist ideals as a result. Nowhere did he see that breakdown more clearly than in the corporate world, where the bond between employers and employees had unraveled.

The antidote, he argued, was loyalty from both sides. And his prescription proved more prescient than he could have imagined. Starting with AT&T more than a century ago, executives saw the dysfunction inside their mercenary organizations and chose loyalty — ushering in decades of shared prosperity with few parallels in the history of capitalism. As today's businesses slide back into the same dysfunction Royce saw all these years ago, his remedy feels as relevant as ever.

""What we want, at present, from some of the managers of great corporate interests is more loyalty, and less of the individualism of those who seek power,"" Royce wrote. ""Precisely the same sort of loyalty is what we want both from the leaders and from the followers of organized labor. There is here one law for all.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","This is the severance package Starbucks offered to laid-off staff at the stores it's closing","https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-severance-package-lay-off-staff-2025-9","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 06:06:00 GMT","

Starbucks presented its laid-off baristas with a severance package less than a week after it announced sweeping layoffs and store closures.

On Thursday, the Seattle-based coffee giant said it would close about 1% of its stores across North America, which amounts to more than 100 locations. Its flagship Capitol Hill Roastery in Seattle was one of the outlets that will shutter.

In addition to the retail staff cuts caused by the store closures, the company announced that 900 non-retail employees would be laid off.

Starbucks sent documents of its severance package to laid-off retail employees on Sunday, which Business Insider has viewed.

According to a Starbucks document titled ""Severance Summary,"" laid-off baristas and shift supervisors would be entitled to 60 and 84 hours of pay, respectively.

Starbucks baristas earn about $15 to $22 an hour, depending on the store's location in the US, per job listings on Starbucks' careers website. Shift managers earn roughly between $20 and $29 hourly.

Café attendants — entry-level service staff in charge of keeping the cafés clean and organized — would be entitled to 30 hours of pay after being laid off, per the document.

States do not typically require companies to provide hourly workers with severance.

Laid-off retail staff can also claim a lump sum payment equal to three months' worth of their health insurance premiums. Affected staff have healthcare coverage for three months from the end of October, which is in line with the Department of Labor's COBRA Act.

The document said employees would get 45 days to decide whether to sign a release agreement in exchange for their severance pay.

In a separate document titled ""Partner Separation FAQ — U.S. Retail Stores,"" seen by Business Insider, Starbucks said that employees in nine states would be paid for their accrued vacation hours. Employees with granted but unused vacation hours will not be paid out for unused time.

In response to a request for comment, Starbucks directed Business Insider to CEO Brian Niccol's open letter from Thursday.

""We're working hard to offer transfers to nearby locations where possible and will move quickly to help partners understand what opportunities might be available to them,"" Niccol wrote in the letter. ""For those we can't immediately place, we're focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages.""

In an SEC filing dated September 23, Starbucks said it expected to incur a $1 billion bill from its store closures. It said about $150 million of that cost would be linked to employee separation benefits.

The store closures are part of Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" turnaround plan, which aims to revitalize the chain after several quarters of declining sales.

The company said in the SEC filing that it had assessed its stores' financial performance and customer experience and decided to close stores that had not fulfilled the criteria.

Starbucks' stock price is down more than 14% in the past year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Popular Pre-Owned Luxury Watches by Generation: the RealReal Report","https://www.businessinsider.com/popular-preowned-luxury-watches-by-generation-the-realreal-report-2025-9","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 10:44:00 GMT","

Everyone is into watches these days, but which brand or style you gravitate toward could depend on your generation.

A new report from The RealReal, a luxury consignment shop, found the number of new watch buyers on its platform rose by 46% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the same time period last year.

The pre-owned luxury watch market got a boost earlier this year in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, as some watchmakers announced they were increasing retail prices partly due to import costs.

The United States in August placed a 39% tariff on some goods from Switzerland, where many luxury watchmakers are based. Some resellers said they saw an increase in demand for secondhand watches in the wake of the tariffs and higher retail prices.

The RealReal found that interest in secondhand luxury watches was not limited to any generation, but that each generation was searching for different brands and styles. Here's how it broke down.

The report found that boomers, ages 61 to 79, were most interested in long-standing watch brands. They purchased the Rolex Datejust, which is The RealReal's most popular watch for both men and women, more than any other generation.

The Datejust is often considered an entry point into luxury watches. A reseller told Business Insider last month it was one of the top styles shoppers were purchasing pre-owned as they sought to avoid price hikes.

The report found the Rolex Datejust was also one of the smarter investment pieces, noting the resale price of the classic watch on The RealReal had increased 17% since 2021.

Sales for legacy brands like Audemars Piguet, Chopard, and Chanel also doubled among baby boomers this year, The RealReal found.

Gen X shoppers buy more watches than any other generation, according to the report.

The most bought watches for Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, were Rolex Daytonas and Bvlgari Tubogas, for men and women, respectively.

The Rolex Daytona is an iconic watch for the brand, always in demand and often cited as a good investment piece.

Millennials are especially interested in gold watches, with searches for the term up 30% compared to last year, the report found.

The most bought watches among millennials, ages 29 to 44, were Rolex Day-Dates for men and Patek Philippe Nautiluses for women.

The Rolex Day-Date was one of the styles the brand raised prices on at the top of the year, before the new tariffs were announced. The price hike was potentially driven in part by the surging price of gold.

The Patek Philippe Nautilus is another style that some consider a good investment, as it often sells for above its retail price

The report found that Gen Z was the most likely generation to seek out less typical brands. The generation, ages 13 to 28, searched for the Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer 105% more this year compared to last year, the sharpest search increase for any brand or age group.

Omega sales have doubled among Gen Z, while Audemars Piguet and Gucci sales increased by 117% and 35%, respectively.

Gen Z's interest in luxury watches has been credited with boosting the secondhand market, as the generation in general has been found to buy more pre-owned items than its older counterparts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm a Japanese founder who moved to Bengaluru to grow my startup. I love India's energy and how hard people work.","https://www.businessinsider.com/japanese-founder-moved-bengaluru-india-hakki-car-financing-credit-startup-2025-9","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Reiji Kobayashi, a Japanese startup founder based in Bengaluru, India. The essay has been edited for length and clarity.

I've always been an entrepreneur. I dropped out of university before my final year to launch a web marketing business in Japan. I sold the company, started learning about the real estate business, and launched a share house company. After leaving that company, I moved to Kenya in 2018, where I had traveled in college, to launch a startup.

My first year in Kenya was a nightmare. I had built and sold several businesses at that point, but still struggled to raise money from external investors for a new startup. After a while, I decided to put in my own money and launch a startup called Hakki. I built a microfinancing platform for people who wanted to buy cars because Kenya seemed to have a lack of credit options.

After working on Hakki for six years, where we financed over 3,500 cars, growth in Kenya seemed limited. Africa has about 1.4 billion people, but they are scattered. Kenya only has about 50 million people. India, with its 1.3 billion people and rapidly growing economy, felt like the next best target market for us.

I moved to Bengaluru in 2024 to expand the company in India. We now have four employees based in India, 74 in Kenya, and two in South Africa, where we also have a presence. Our headquarters is in Japan, where most of our fundraising has happened, and we aim to go public in the Japanese market in 2028.

There are a lot of things I like about living in Bengaluru. For one, I like to wear casual T-shirts instead of suits, and Bengaluru's weather is stable and comfortable.

The people are kind, have lots of energy, and are positive about the future, which I really like. That's not the case in Japan, where, because of the aging population, people are worried about the economy and the future of the country.

I have a group I play football with every evening after work. I've also made some friends I watch cricket matches with, accompanied by alcohol and chicken, which was surprising to me because I always thought most Indians are vegetarian.

There are challenges too. I don't like the spicy food and haven't gotten used to it, so I spend most of my time eating noodles I bring over from Japan.

The way business is done in India is very different from Japan, too. Indians have the attitude to try or take up something challenging without needing accurate projections of what will happen. Japanese businesses spend a lot of time in meetings and making sure everything is done with the consensus of the majority of the people. Investment decisions move much faster in India than in Japan.

India also feels like a much friendlier market for startups because people are open to trying new products and don't get suspicious of new companies that may be offering a cheaper solution than existing brands.

The people are hardworking. We've hired four Indian employees, and I'm surprised to say that they work more than me. They come into the office at 9 a.m. and easily work until 9 p.m. Even our company driver is up early in the morning and available with the car until midnight, which I was not expecting.

I may have to move out of India in a few months to expand the company in other countries like Thailand. But I'm commited to growing the startup here and having a big presence in India. I plan to travel back and forth and can see myself moving back to India again.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I left quant trading to work in AI. Here's why I gave up a more secure career to join an AI startup.","https://www.businessinsider.com/why-i-quit-quant-trading-to-bet-on-ai-boom-2025-9","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:11:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Varun Goyal, a 25-year-old AI startup engineer, based in California. It's been edited for length and clarity.

In 2022, I was standing at the crossroads between quant trading and tech. It was my final year of undergrad. Blinded by the initial high salary and prestige, I joined a firm as a quantitative strategist for the summer.

I was learning so much and working with incredible people, but I was increasingly convinced that I should go back to school. I decided to move from India to the States for my master's.

When I was about to graduate with my master's last year, the path in quant was clearer. I could accelerate my career quickly, whereas in AI, it was much messier and unpredictable because we're still in the first stages of the AI revolution, and the industry is changing every day.

After interviewing in both fields, I chose an AI startup. The hours are long, the base pay is lower than I would've gotten in quant, and it's been an intense year, but I don't regret my decision, and here's why.

When I moved to the US to get my master's in computer science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I already knew that I wanted to pursue courses in quant, AI, and computer science.

Both AI and quant roles require core computer science algorithm skills.

During my master's, I had more time to pursue research and talk to senior industry folks. This was the biggest benefit for me when I was deciding what I wanted my daily life and career to look like 10 years down the line.

When I entered my master's, I leaned heavily toward quant because the initial compensation there is almost always higher, but these conversations helped me see beyond the starting paycheck. I heard about the day-to-day work itself, the culture, and the opportunities for growth in each field.

People I knew who were two or three years out of school were working at some of the best quant firms in New York and Chicago. I definitely didn't want to skip that option, but a few things stood out to me as I spoke to some of them.

At bigger firms, teams often compete, and you can't really discuss your work outside your group. As an extrovert who thrives in a collaborative environment, that felt restrictive. The exit options in quant felt more constrained, too.

It's typical to grow into roles like senior quant researcher, strategy owner, or portfolio manager. Those are excellent paths, but they're tied to very specialized expertise. It's good to be specialized if you like that, but I feared it because I didn't know if I wanted to stay in the field forever.

I applied for both industries and had a few quant interviews, but I decided to join an AI startup.

Quant reminded me of a single-lane speed track: fast, sharp, but narrow, while AI felt more like a racing track with a lot of turns and curves.

When I was in my master's, the AI boom was happening. It kept me up at night in the best way possible. I started leaning toward working in AI because it's redesigning the capacity of human productivity from the ground up, which is so exciting.

In AI, especially at startups, the day-to-day challenges are broader, less predictable, and that mix of liberty and freshness appealed to me much more. I could imagine paths into founding, venture capital, and leadership roles in Big Tech, and I could start honing all of those skills early in my career.

AI ultimately left my options more open with what I could do later in life, and working at a startup provided the collaborative environment I wanted.

In AI startups, the base salary still provides a good standard of living, but the real upside comes from equity. The opportunity to learn is everywhere in an AI startup. Part of the appeal is the chance to learn how to make a company successful rather than optimizing within a well-established machine.

The biggest surprise at the startup this past year has been how much I'm learning outside coding. I'm learning to hire, adapt, lead the product direction, and sell. These skills make me more than just an engineer. I'm trying to jump on customer meetings, understand their needs, contribute to hiring decisions, and shadow and learn from the founders where I can.

The year has been pretty intense with the race that various AI startups are in.

If we don't launch the features and tools in a new research paper within a few days, we've basically lost that one to the competition, so it can be stressful, but it also keeps me sharp.

In AI, I'm in an uncomfortable seat every few months trying to keep up with the market pace, but I'm happy with my decision. I've been pushed to grow so much.

If I were in the decision stage again, one thing I'd consider is the difficulty of moving from quant to AI or vice versa later in you're career. Having spent one year in AI, I'd feel a little uncomfortable jumping into quant.

Quant narrows your skills down to a specialty very quickly, and if you want to expand outside that, it's hard. But I have some friends from undergrad who did a year or two in quant and then later moved over. It's possible.

I love working in AI. I believe we're like the builders of the machines in the Industrial Revolution, laying the foundations for how the world will actually use AI. There's a lot left to be built, and this is the opportunity the brightest graduating minds should take.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","OpenAI's newest team is proof that there's a key shift happening in the AI talent wars","https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-new-applied-evals-team-signal-ai-talent-shift-2025-9","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Earlier this month, an OpenAI engineer announced he was hiring for a new team.

OpenAI is building a new team called ""Applied Evals,"" which helps businesses refine complex processes using AI, like refund requests or migrating code. The team will also focus on voice AI and multi-step reasoning tasks, said Shyamal Anadkat, who is leading that team at OpenAI. Pay ranges from $255,000 to $325,000 for the role plus equity, the new listing said.

Evals refer to measuring the capabilities of AI models, which Anadkat called ""the most critical part of actually building AI products.""

This new team reflects a shift across the AI talent landscape.. The tech industry has long hired technical minds to build and train AI models, and now people with specific subject-matter expertise are being tapped to make these models useful, AI founders and executives told Business Insider.

Anadkat's post said his team will comprise engineers with ""real, deep, lived expertise."" He said it will start with generalists. He plans to bring in specialists from different fields, such as software engineers for code-related tasks and, perhaps eventually, humanities-focused workers if there is more demand for tasks like writing.

Anadkat told Business Insider the team will work with companies using OpenAI's developer platform to help them create their own evals for specific use cases.

""OpenAI started as a research lab, and then we built a product,"" he said. ""Now the shift that, at least I hope we'll see, is how research and product can work very closely together and collaborate on some of this to basically define what good looks like.""

Anadkat's team is starting small and will grow with demand. It's exclusively focused on business customers, operating separately from the teams working on OpenAI's consumer-facing businesses, like apps or consulting.

Applied Evals will work with OpenAI's sales and business teams to determine what projects to prioritize based on customer need and where its models are underperforming, Anadkat said.

The AI industry has long had engineers work on evals within companies, large and small, though they mostly evaluated if the AI model was working well or not.

Over time, they've shifted from ""thumbs up or down"" to being more focused on context and asking the right questions, said Michael Jacobides, a strategy and entrepreneurship professor at London Business School.

""There's probably a hundred people in the world that could lead a team to build these frontier models,"" said Justin Farris, vice president of product at Read AI, ""but there's so much work that needs to be done to take those and make them useful.""

AI is increasingly moving from generic to specific use cases, said Tanmai Gopal, CEO of PromptQL.

""For a lot of applied use cases, the ways of working out what good is and what bad is start to become quite nuanced,"" he said.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The federal government will shut down on Wednesday unless Congress can agree on a stopgap funding bill. President Donald Trump is expected to meet with the top four congressional leaders today after abruptly canceling a meeting with Democratic leadership last week. The president has warned of mass firings of federal workers if a deal cannot be reached.

Here's what to know:

Last year, a group of friends learned that a man they knew turned their social media pictures into pornographic deepfakes using a so-called ""nudify"" site. Such platforms represent a small but growing segment of the artificial intelligence space.

The dark side of the AI boom typically flies under the radar, but has caught the attention of lawmakers. As CNBC's Jonathan Vanian reports, the group of women have become key in the fight against nonconsensual, AI-generated pornography. Read CNBC's full investigation into these sites here.

Stocks ended last week in the red, a significant vibe shift after recently hitting all-time highs. The benchmark S&P 500 recorded its first losing week in four, while the small cap-focused Russell 2000 snapped a seven-week win streak.

Despite last week's pullback, the stock market's recent gains have pushed a measure of public U.S. companies' total value against GDP to an all-time high of 217%. That's past levels indicating traders are ""playing with fire,"" Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said in 2001.

Looking ahead, investors are gearing up for a slate of employment data due this week. Follow live markets updates here.

Honeywell is testing out new alerts that would give pilots more reaction time in hopes of avoiding close-call situations at airports, which have dominated headlines in recent years.

While serious airplane accidents are rare, a series of recent incidents have raised concern about how to best ensure safety in situations when every moment matters. Safety experts have pushed for innovation in cockpit alerts similar to what Honeywell is currently exploring.

CNBC's Leslie Josephs rode in a Boeing 757 test plane for Honeywell's new alert system. Here's what she saw.

With the help of social media and reality TV, the ""dirty soda"" craze is expanding far beyond its Utah roots.

""Dirty soda"" — which refers to pop-based drinks with flavored syrups, cream or other ingredients mixed in — was first coined by the Utah-based chain Swig 15 years ago. Now, companies from PepsiCo to TGI Fridays are jumping on the trend as it gains traction nationwide, CNBC's Amelia Lucas reports.

The numbers don't lie: 2.7% of U.S. eateries serve a carbonated soft drink that contains cream or milk, up from 1.5% a decade ago, per Datassential.

Here's some of what we're keeping an eye on this week:

In this article

Electronic Arts said Monday that it has agreed to be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in an all-cash deal worth $55 billion.

Shareholders of the company will receive $210 per share in cash.

EA's stock climbed 5% on Monday. The shares gained about 15% on Friday, closing at $193.35, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was nearing a deal to go private.

PIF is rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company and will, by far, be the majority investor in the new structure, people close to the deal told CNBC's David Faber.

Affinity CEO Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, touted EA's ""bold vision ​for ​the ​future"" in a release announcing the deal.

""I've admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids - I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead,"" Kushner said in a statement.

The group of companies is making a total $36 billion equity investment, with $20 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan, according to the release. JPMorgan was brought in a couple of weeks ago, people familiar with the deal told Faber.

The take-private deal for the maker of popular games like Battlefield, The Sims and the Madden series of NFL games, among others, is set to be the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.

In a note to employees, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he is ""excited to continue as CEO.""

""Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment,"" he wrote. ""They are committed with conviction to EA – they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together.""

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027.

There is a 45-day window to allow for other proposals, people familiar with the terms of the deal told Faber. The deal talks started in the spring, the people said.

Silver Lake, which is led by co-CEOs Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, is also one of the key investors in Trump's push to get TikTok under U.S. control.

CNBC has reached out to EA for further comment and information on the deal.

President Donald Trump on Monday bashed New York City mayoral race front-runner Zohran Mamdani and renewed a threat to withhold federal funding from the Big Apple if the Democratic nominee wins.

Trump's rant came a day after Mayor Eric Adams said that he is suspending his campaign after pressure from the president and others to quit the race to improve former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's chances of beating Mamdani in November.

""Self proclaimed New York City Communist, Zohran Mamdani, who is running for Mayor, will prove to be one of the best things to ever happen to our great Republican Party,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""He is going to have problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once great City,"" Trump wrote. ""Remember, he needs the money from me, as President, in order to fulfill all of his FAKE Communist promises. He won't be getting any of it, so what's the point of voting for him?""

Mamdani, who is a self-described democratic socialist — not a communist — bested Cuomo in the Democratic primary. Cuomo is running as an independent, as was Adams.

The Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa, has refused to drop out despite pressure from Trump and entreaties from others.

DETROIT — Automakers and investors are about to find out what the ""natural demand"" is for new all-electric vehicles in the U.S., starting this week.

Amid what's set to be a record year for EV sales, including a record for units sold in the third quarter, demand for EVs is expected to decline. That's because federal incentives of up to $7,500 to purchase a plug-in vehicle are getting discontinued after Tuesday.

Many automakers have relied on the incentives to boost consumer demand for EVs, which they've spent billions of dollars developing even as the vehicles remain largely unprofitable.

Industry analysts and executives have said they believe EV sales can continue to grow in the future, but that there will soon be a boom-and-bust situation regarding demand for electric vehicles before there's a new normal.

""We're going to see some noise in October and November, and I expect that EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously,"" General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said during an investor event earlier this month. ""We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural demand going and how do we meet that natural demand and ultimately try to lead customers to electric vehicles. That's going to take a little bit of time.""

Jacobson's remarks echo those of other industry leaders such as Hyundai Motor CEO José Muñoz and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""We are adjusting to the new situation and … we expect the mix of batteries to probably [not] grow as much as we already thought,"" Muñoz told reporters earlier this month. ""I think, in the short term, it's going to go down, but in the mid-, long-term, we expect it to continue to grow.""

Musk, when discussing the company's second-quarter results in July, said the EV maker could see ""a few rough quarters"" with the end of federal incentives and as Tesla's automation plans are in their infancy.

But that might not happen immediately. Ahead of the federal EV program ending, many automakers encouraged consumers to purchase or lease new vehicles. That has included U.S. EV leader Tesla having a countdown on its website to the end of the federal incentives, which the company has historically used to promote lower vehicle prices on its site.

The federal incentives for consumers to purchase electrified vehicles have been in place since 2008, in varying forms. They were first introduced under Republican President George W. Bush, and were expanded under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.

The incentives are coming to an end as part of the Trump administration's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which stripped the old enticement but included some perks for buying a U.S.-assembled vehicle, regardless of it being an EV.

""Policy really matters, and pulling away all these levers will slow the growth relative to what the path was before,"" Elaine Buckberg, a senior fellow at Harvard University and former GM chief economist, said Wednesday during the Move America conference in Detroit.

Once the bill was passed, sales of EVs quickly gained traction, especially as some automakers added even more discounts to move out older models.

Cox Automotive forecasts sales of EVs hit 410,000 during the third quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. That would easily be the highest amount of EVs ever sold in a quarter in the U.S., as well as a record 10% market share.

""The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment. This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive director of industry insights.

Cox expects many buyers pulled ahead plans to purchase an EV before the federal incentives sunset. That was the case for buyer Paarth Sharma of New Jersey.

""I've been in the market for two to six weeks,"" Sharma, who leased a Kia Niro EV, told CNBC. ""It just accelerated because of the upcoming Sept. 30 order by Donald Trump and the EV rebates going away.""

The sales increase corresponded with a notable uptick in automaker incentives for EVs, as more buyers who qualified for offers rushed out to buy vehicles. Cox Automotive reports average incentive spend for EVs was more than $9,000 – more than double the industry average.

""The quarter delivered record EV sales and market share, but the pace will ease in Q4 and beyond as the impact of the IRA tax incentive begins to fade,"" Valdez Streaty said.

While automakers have said they will continue to offer EVs, many companies are already taking steps to prepare for the expected impacts to sales, including laying off workers, cutting production of EVs or eliminating vehicles entirely.

Honda Motor on Wednesday, citing market conditions, confirmed plans to end U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric crossover that was being produced by GM in Tennessee.

Separate from the Acura EV, GM has made several changes to its production plans for EVs that have included implementing downtime at plants, cutting upcoming production shifts and slowing its rollout of several models.

Others such as Volkswagen, Porsche and Rivian Automotive have announced changes to their EV plans or reductions in workforces related to EVs.

""EVs are not going away … but it's not going to be a linear increase that we've seen over the last couple years, like we're in for a short-term dip,"" said Steve Horaney, senior vice president of the Mema Original Equipment Suppliers, said Wednesday during the Move America event.

But some plans are already too far along to go back on. New models are coming soon, such as a redesigned Nissan Leaf – arguably the first mainstream EV that was offered in the U.S. back when it was launched in 2010.

Nissan officials at an event touting the new model said the end of the credits timing with the fall release of the new Leaf is ""tough,"" but even without the tax credit, the price of the vehicle — starting at around $30,000 — should attract buyers.

Those kinds of lower-priced vehicles are expected to be even more important for EV customers and companies after the elimination of the tax credits, according to Valdez Streaty.

""The arrival of truly affordable models is so critical,"" she said, citing upcoming EVs from the likes of GM and Ford Motor. ""[They] could reshape the market.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","From Elon Musk to Microsoft's Satya Nadella, these tech leaders were once H-1B visa holders","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/from-tesla-to-microsoft-satya-nadella-tech-firms-leader-once-h-1b-visa-holders.html","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:52:26 GMT","



In this article

President Donald Trump is looking to restrict and overhaul the H-1 B visa program, which has allowed U.S. companies to hire foreign talent in occupations such as IT, healthcare and engineering for decades.

The program has been a topic of debate among lawmakers in Washington for years, with many opponents arguing that it removes job opportunities for U.S. nationals and is rife with abuse.

In response, Trump announced a plan to impose $100,000 fees on H-1B applications, which could severely impact American companies' ability to support the visas.

One thing that can't be disputed, however, is that the program has been part of the journey of a considerable number of American technology and business leaders since its inception in 1990.

Here is a list of some of the highest-profile ones. 

Elon Musk, the world's richest man and the founder of a raft of prominent tech companies in the U.S., is not only one of the most prominent H-1B visa recipients but also one of the most vocal advocates of the program.

Originally born in South Africa, Musk moved to the U.S. in 1992 when he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania to pursue his studies. He later attended Stanford before dropping out to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in Silicon Valley. 

While some details of his early visa situation have been debated, Musk has gone on record saying the reason he is in the U.S., along with ""so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong,"" was the H-1B visa. 

Still, the billionaire, who has become highly involved in U.S. and global politics, has also supported the overhaul and reformation of the H-1B system in the past. 

Eric Yuan,  the 55-year-old founder and CEO of Zoom, immigrated to the U.S. from China in 1997 on an H-1B visa, though his journey was anything but easy.

Yuan was sponsored for an H-1B visa by video conferencing company Webex — later acquired by Cisco Systems — but was only approved on his ninth try, he said on a Cloud Giant podcast in 2020.

Despite speaking very little English upon his arrival in the U.S., he would go on to launch Zoom in 2011. The company's IPO in 2019 valued Yuan's shares in the billions.

While Yuan has not publicly commented much about the H-1B visa program, he told CNBC in 2019 that the United States' openness to immigration is healthy and that he expects that culture to persist.

Born and raised in India, Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, is also a former recipient of an H-1B visa, though his circumstances were quite unique. 

Having been in the U.S. since 1990, he held a highly coveted green card until he gave it up to bring his wife into the country through a successful, but otherwise risky, H-1B visa application in 1994. 

""The idea that you have to give up your green card to get an H-1B is, in retrospect, silly. And so therefore let us in fact take the reform so that it works for us, both our security but as well as our competitiveness,"" said Nadella in a 2017 interview with CNBC. 

Back in 2017, speaking on the 'Make Me Smart' podcast, Nadella defended the H-1B visa program, saying that it provided Microsoft with high-skilled labor that helped it remain globally competitive, though he welcomed an executive order reviewing H-1B for abuses under the first Trump administration.

Jayshree Ullal, CEO of cloud networking company Arista Networks, was born in the United Kingdom and raised in New Delhi, before she moved to the U.S. at the age of 16 and began her studies at San Francisco State University.

After completing a master's degree at Santa Clara University, she went on to work for prominent tech companies, including Fairchild Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Cisco.

Somewhere in that time, Ullal had been a recipient of an H-1B visa, a representative of the CEO had previously disclosed to Forbes. Arista did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

While details of Ullal's H-1B journey are unknown, she has voiced support for immigration reform and easier pathways for foreign workers to the U.S. in the past.

Speaking to Times of India in 2023, she said the immigration process had become overly challenging with permanent residence visas taking up to 15 years to secure, which is ""a large chunk of a professional person's work life.""

""At Arista, we believe that the best developers can come from anywhere and there is a global distribution of engineering talent — virtual or physical,"" she added.

Ullal is one of the handful of immigrant billionaires in the U.S. today with a net worth of $6 billion, according to Forbes.

Jeff Skoll, the first President of eBay — now a philanthropist and chairman of Capricorn Investment Group — is another former H-1B visa holder who has advocated for the program, while supporting targeted reforms.

As a Canadian, he graduated from the University of Toronto in 1987 before he came to America to study at Stanford University. He would later obtain an H-1B visa in 1996 when he began working for eBay and its founder, Pierre Omidyar. 

In December of last year, Skoll joined Elon Musk in defending the need for H-1B visas, although they supported some changes, such as a higher minimum salary and yearly fees that could incentivize domestic hires.

""For me personally it was a life [and] death fight to get and keep an H-1B visa, even though I had come out of Stanford Business School, worked with Pierre Omidyar on [a student work visa] while we built eBay from scratch,"" he said in an X post.

According to Skoll, he nearly needed to leave the country after being turned down for an H-1B visa extension, had it not been for his strong connections at the time.

He added that eBay and his other organizations have encountered numerous problems applying for H-1Bs, even when hiring for specialized work in which there were no domestic applicants.

In this article

Spain's government has received yet another boost from credit rating agencies, with Fitch and Moody's joining S&P to raise their respective assessments of the country.

The hat trick of rating upgrades comes as Spain's economy continues to outpace its European peers, with the country's government and central bank recently upgrading their 2025 growth forecasts.

Fitch on Friday upwardly revised Spain's long-term rating to ""A,"" from ""A-,"" citing Spain's favorable growth prospects.

""Recent productivity gains, moderate wage growth and relatively low energy prices have boosted external competitiveness and strengthened private external balance sheets,"" Fitch said in a statement.

The ratings agency added that it expects Spain's economy to remain resilient, ""helped by limited exposure to U.S. tariffs and ongoing net external deleveraging.""

Moody's also raised Spain's rating last week by one notch, to ""A3"" from ""Baa1,"" saying the decision reflects its view that Madrid's economic strength is improving due to a more balanced growth model, labor market improvements and a more robust banking sector.

Spain's economy has been going from strength to strength of late, bolstered by foreign investment, tourism and immigration.

The country's government said earlier this month that it expects gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by 2.7% this year, up from a previous forecast of 2.6%, and significantly above expectations of 1.2% growth seen for the broader euro area.

Earlier this month, S&P Global also gave Spain a rating upgrade, citing ""notable improvement"" in the country's balance sheet and an improved resilience to economic shocks.

Judith Arnal, senior fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute, a think tank in Madrid, said Spain has emerged as the clear growth leader among the euro area's largest economies in recent years.

""Spain's growth has relied not only on booming tourism but also on dynamic non-tourism services, such as business, telecoms and IT services. This marks a shift in the country's growth pattern, showing that Spain has competitive firms able to export beyond traditional sectors,"" Arnal told CNBC by email.

""Growth has also been closely linked to demographic dynamics and job creation. More than half of the jobs created since 2020 have been taken up by immigrants, which has supported overall GDP expansion but meant that GDP per capita has advanced less strongly. This reflects a more extensive than intensive growth model,"" she added.

Looking ahead, Arnal said that while political uncertainty has not prevented Spain from leading euro area growth, the country's economic performance could be even better with stronger stability.

""The government of Spain is keen to showcase this period of high growth, but fiscal consolidation and structural reforms will be the true test over the medium term,"" Arnal said.

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Monday said the U.S. central bank faces challenges as it attempts to balance fighting stubborn inflation or protecting jobs.

""On the inflation side right now, I continue to be worried about where we are from an inflation perspective,"" Hammack told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""We have been missing our mandate on the inflation side, our objective of 2%, for more than 4½ years and I continue to see that we have pressure in inflation both in the headline, in the core, and particularly, where I am worried about it, is I'm seeing it in the services,"" she added.

Asked whether it is mistake for the Federal Reserve to be cutting interest rates given the economic backdrop, Hammack described it as ""a challenging time for monetary policy,"" saying the U.S. central bank was facing pressure on both sides of its mandate.

Her comments come shortly after stronger-than-expected economic data appear to have dented Wall Street's hopes for sharp monetary easing.

The Fed approved a widely anticipated rate cut earlier this month, lowering its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 4.00%-4.25%, and signaled two more were on the way before the end of the year.

A robust batch of economic data since, however, has prompted investors to dial back their expectations for rapid rate cuts.

Investor attention now turns to the September nonfarm payrolls report, scheduled for Friday, although its release could be disrupted by a possible government shutdown.

Hammack said the U.S. labor market looks ""reasonably healthy"" and broadly in balance, while inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's target, adding that she doesn't expect prices to fall back to 2% until the end of 2027 or early 2028.

""So, again, to me, when I balance those two sides of our mandate, I think we really need to maintain a restrictive stance of policy so that we can get inflation back down to our goal,"" Hammack said.

A former Goldman Sachs executive, Hammack is not a voter on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.

U.S. core inflation was little changed in August, according to data published Friday. The personal consumption expenditures price index posted a 0.3% gain for the month, putting the annual headline inflation rate at 2.7%, the Commerce Department reported late last week.

Excluding food and energy, the more closely followed core PCE price level was 2.9% on an annual basis after rising 0.2% for the month.

Hammack has previously suggested she would be hesitant about lowering interest rates as long as inflation remains a threat.

Indeed, more recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned of a tricky path ahead on interest rates.

""Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside — a challenging situation,"" Powell said on Sept. 23 during a speech to business leaders in Providence, Rhode Island.

""Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path,"" he added.

In this article

Comcast announced Monday it's named Mike Cavanagh as co-CEO alongside longtime leader Brian Roberts, starting in January.

Cavanagh, who currently serves as president, will also be named to the Comcast board of directors at that time. Roberts will remain as chairman and co-CEO of the company.

""Since joining Comcast a decade ago, Mike has proven himself to be a trusted and collaborative leader,"" Roberts said in a statement. ""He is the ideal person to help lead Comcast as we manage the pivot we are making to drive growth across the company. Mike and I work seamlessly together, and I am thrilled to be partnering with him as Co-CEO and with the rest of our talented management team, for years to come.""

Cavanagh previously served as chief financial officer of the cable giant, which consists of a broadband, cable TV and mobile company as well as NBCUniversal. Before Comcast, Cavanagh was co-CEO of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.

""Comcast is a special company with exceptional businesses and an incredible team. It is an honor to work with Brian and the entire Comcast NBCUniversal leadership team during this exciting and transformative time in our industry,"" Cavanagh said in a statement.

Comcast shares were essentially flat in early trading Monday following the announcement. The stock is down about 15% so far this year. During Cavanagh's tenure as president, from October 2022 to today, Comcast shares have gained about 9%.

Cavanagh has long been considered heir apparent to Roberts by industry insiders, CNBC reported this year.

In 2022 he was promoted to president of Comcast and months later his role expanded when Jeff Shell exited his role as CEO of NBCUniversal. Cavanagh took over direct leadership of the company's TV, film and theme park units, although was never officially named CEO of NBCUniversal.

Since then he has embedded in the NBCUniversal business and has overseen a number of changes at the division, including a restructuring and most notably NBCUniversal's spinout of its cable TV networks, including CNBC, MSNBC and the Golf Channel.

The company's new corporate leadership structure mirrors that of Netflix, the runaway leader in streaming.

Netflix in 2023 promoted Greg Peters, previously the company's chief operating officer, to co-CEO alongside Ted Sarandos after Reed Hastings announced he would step back. Sarandos has long been in charge of content, while Peters' focus had been centered on growing Netflix beyond DVDs and into streaming, expanding partnerships and increasing the international footprint — all of which have been key to the streaming giant's growth.

Netflix's disruption of the media business has helped to shift the industry toward a new crop of finance- and operations-minded leaders at the top of entertainment companies.

Warner Bros. Discovery said earlier this year it would split into two businesses — Warner Bros., made up of the streaming platform and studios, and Discovery Global, the TV networks business. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the CFO of Warner Bros. Discovery, is slated to take over as CEO Of Discovery Global after the split.

Comcast's businesses, meanwhile, has been faced with various headwinds in recent years.

Pressures on broadband have ramped up following a period of gangbuster growth due to increased competition from alternative providers, such as 5G or so-called fixed wireless. In turn, Comcast and its peers have suffered from a slowdown in subscriber growth.

In July, Comcast reported a loss of 226,000 total domestic broadband customers for the second quarter despite a shift in market strategy earlier this year, which included new pricing.

Comcast is scheduled to report its next quarterly earnings on Oct. 30.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

President Donald Trump on Monday said he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made films and slap ""substantial Tariffs"" on any country that does not make furniture in the United States.

Trump's statements left key questions about the plans unanswered.

In a pair of Truth Social posts, Trump claimed that California's movie-making business and North Carolina's furniture industry have been lost to other countries, and that the new duties on imports would reverse the slide.

""Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby,'"" Trump wrote. ""Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.""

Trump made an identical threat to tariff foreign-made films in May. 

But the White House quickly softened its tone and no action was taken. It was unclear what, if anything, was different between Trump's prior threat and his current one.

Separately on Monday, Trump wrote, ""I will be imposing substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States.""

That statement raised the question of whether Trump would go beyond his vow last week to slap 50% duties on imports of kitchen and bathroom furnishings, as well as 30% tariffs on upholstered furniture. 

Those product-specific tariffs, which Trump also unveiled on social media, will take effect starting Wednesday, he wrote at the time.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's questions about Trump's latest tariff threats.

Bitcoin traders counting on upcoming U.S. employment data to gauge whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again might be waiting a while as the government nears a potential shutdown.

And how Bitcoin reacts to such an event remains uncertain, analysts say, potentially heightening near-term volatility. Past shutdowns have had differing affects on the price.

“Rate-cut expectations are supportive of risk assets, but bubble concerns and political risk amplify short-term volatility. For crypto, this creates both liquidity support and added downside uncertainty,” Bitunix analysts wrote in a note shared with Decrypt. “In the medium term, confirmed rate cuts improve liquidity and support risk assets. In the short term, however, bubble fears and shutdown risk heighten fragility, making sharp “drop-and-rebound” swings more likely.”

Unless Congress enacts a full appropriations bill or continuing resolution before midnight on Tuesday, federal funding will lapse and a partial government shutdown will occur for “non-essential” functions. The federal government's fiscal year ends on September 30.

“This week's big event might not actually happen, as payrolls Friday could be the first high profile victim of a potential government shutdown if Congress is unable to reach an agreement on a short-term funding resolution by midnight tomorrow night,” wrote Deutsche Bank Head of Macro and Thematic Research John Reid in a note shared with Decrypt. “Indeed, back in October 2013, the shutdown meant we didn't get the September jobs report until the 22nd of the month.”

At the time of writing, Bitcoin has climbed above $114,000 after having gained 3.8% in the past day. That still leaves it trailing 0.7% behind the price it was two weeks ago, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko.

Economic statistics and data processing are not considered essential functions, meaning the Bureau of Labor Statistics would need to hold itsupcoming jobs report until government funding is restored. It's not that the data wouldn't come out eventually, but the delay could spike volatility. Investors know the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions are heavily influenced by jobs and inflation data.

Nicolai Sondergaard, Research Analyst at Nansen told Decrypt a shutdown could spike short-term volatility in crypto markets.

""But I do wonder if it will be more than that, if investors at large assume that the 'shutdown' will be resolved quickly,"" he added. ""I also wouldn't be surprised if the potential effect of a shutdown hit broader financial markets before it even happens, if at all.""

This wouldn't be the first shutdown that crypto markets have weathered.

The October 2013 shutdown stretched for 16 days. From Oct. 1 through Oct. 17, Bitcoin's price increased 14% from $132.04 to $151.34.

But Bitcoin gains during a shutdown isn't the rule. The longest ever shutdown was Dec. 22, 2018 through Jan. 25, 2019. During that 35-day stretch, Bitcoin fell 6% from $3,802.22 to $3,575.85 by the time it ended.

Users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, have grown increasingly dubious of the Federal Open Markets Committee delivering two rate changes in 2025. The doubters have grown to 75%, an uptick from 40% during the first week of September.

The doubters could include users who believe the Fed will change rates at both its remaining Federal Open Market Committee policy  meetings this year and those who think the committee will wait until 2026 to consider more interest rate changes.

Julio Moreno, the head of research at Cryptoquant, said the 2013 and 2018-2019 shutdowns found Bitcoin in very different markets.

""The demand for Bitcoin was growing strongly as it entered the final stage of the bull cycle [in 2013],"" he told Decrypt, adding that by the time a shutdown materialized in 2018, demand for BTC was contracting during a bear market.

Moreno added that Bitcoin is positioned now more like it was in 2013 than in 2018.

""Bitcoin demand is growing, as we enter Q4, which is typically a positive season in terms of price performance,"" he said.

BitMine Immersion Technologies stock rose Monday morning after the company announced that it purchased nearly $1 billion worth of Ethereum over the last week, pushing the valuation of its total ETH treasury to $11 billion.

The Ethereum treasury firm's stock rose more than 6% to a recent price of $53.60, following the announcement. Even with the uptick, BMNR remains down nearly 4% over the last week.

The Las Vegas-based company disclosed crypto and cash holdings nearing $11.6 billion, including 2.65 million ETH valued at $11 billion, 192 Bitcoin (about $21.6 million worth), and $436 million in unencumbered cash.

That Ethereum tally is 234,846 ETH larger than the previous week's reported total, or about $980 million worth. BitMine is the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury company, and continues to widen the gap between itself and runner-up SharpLink Gaming, which holds about $3.37 billion worth of ETH.

Overall, BitMine ranks as the second-largest global cryptocurrency treasury behind Strategy Inc., which holds approximately $72 billion in Bitcoin.

Myriad users are broadly confident that BitMine will hit a total of 3 million ETH by October 27, currently giving that an 81% chance. The odds have climbed 15% over the last day—even before the announcement—as predictors gain confidence. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

The 7 Largest Publicly Traded Ethereum Treasury Firms

BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, who also leads research firm Fundstrat, has positioned Ethereum as central to converging trends in AI and cryptocurrency.

In a statement, the firm compared recent regulatory developments—including the GENIUS Act passage and the SEC's Project Crypto—to the 1971 abandonment of the gold standard, predicting similar transformational effects on financial services.

""As we enter the final months of 2025, the two supercycle investing narratives remain AI and crypto. And both require neutral public blockchains. Naturally, Ethereum remains the premier choice given its high reliability and 100% uptime,” he said. “These two powerful macro cycles will play out over decades. Since ETH's price is a discount to the future, this bodes well for the token and is the reason BitMine's primary treasury asset is ETH.”

The price of Ethereum started to rebound over the weekend after dipping late last week, with the asset showing only a 0.6% loss over the last week at a recent price of $4,173. ETH is up 4% on the day, though it remains down about 5% over the last month.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. (NYSE: BMNR) is trading around $53 on Monday, up over 5% intraday, as the company disclosed its Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) holdings have surpassed 2.65 million, cementing its position as the world's largest ETH treasury.

The company reported total crypto and cash holdings of $11.6 billion, including 2,650,900 ETHvalued at $4,141 per token, 192 Bitcoin, $436 million in cash, and $157 million in ""moonshot"" equity investments such as Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS).

This puts BitMine ahead of peers in Ethereum accumulation, controlling more than 2% of supply.

It ranks as the No. 1 ETH treasury globally and the No. 2 overall crypto treasury, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), which owns roughly 640,000 BTC.

Fundstrat data shows BMNR trades an average of $2.6 billion daily, ranking it the 26th most traded stock in the U.S., ahead of Visa Inc. (NYSE: V).

Support comes from prominent backers including ARK's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, and Galaxy Digital.

Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, BitMine's chairman, said Ethereum remains the firm's primary treasury asset given its reliability and role as infrastructure for both AI and financial markets.

Lee reiterated the company's long-term goal of acquiring 5% of ETH supply.

BMNR Key Technical Levels (Source: TradingView)

Technical analysis: BMNR stock is compressing inside a symmetrical triangle, holding above its 20-day EMA at $51.85, with the 50-day EMA at $47.06 reinforcing support.

A push above $56 could accelerate momentum toward $65–70, while a slip below $52 risks exposing $47 and potentially $38.

The RSI near 55 suggests neutral momentum, leaving scope for either a breakout or a breakdown as the price nears the apex.

BitMine's accumulation of more than 2% of Ethereum supply shifts the narrative from trading flows to structural ownership.

By anchoring ETH on a public company balance sheet, the firm is effectively institutionalizing a portion of the asset that would otherwise circulate in open markets.

This alters liquidity dynamics, raises the floor for scarcity, and creates a new vector for equity investors to gain indirect Ethereum exposure.

For investors, BMNR is no longer just a mining or tech stock, it is evolving into a proxy vehicle for Ethereum's monetary base.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion said its holdings have now surpassed 2.65 million ETH — worth around $10.8 billion — following its latest weekly acquisitions.

BitMine bought approximately 234,846 ETH ($961.5 million) since its last update on Sept. 22, reporting its total crypto and cash holdings had reached $11.6 billion on Monday. 

As of Sept. 28, BitMine also holds 192 BTC ($21.5 million), a $157 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $436 million in unencumbered cash. The company's ETH holdings are equivalent to around 2.2% of Ethereum's current circulating supply, which sits at approximately 120.7 million ETH, according to The Block's price page.

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 838,730 ETH and 495,360 ETH, respectively, according to SER data. BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds 640,031 BTC ($71.8 billion) — equivalent to more than 3% of bitcoin's total 21 million supply — following Strategy's latest acquisition announcement on Monday.

Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH.

BitMine is now among the top-traded U.S. equities, with a five-day average daily volume of $2.6 billion as of Sept. 26. That ranks it 26th nationwide, just behind Marvell Technology and ahead of Visa, per Fundstrat and Statista data.

""At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock,"" Lee, who is also co-founder of Fundstrat, said.

 Altcoin season, often called “altseason,” occurs when a significant portion of altcoins, cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, experience rapid price increases that outpace Bitcoin's performance.This period is characterized by a shift of investor capital from Bitcoin (BTC) into assets such as Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and even smaller tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Pudgy Penguins (PENGU).The Altcoin Season Index is frequently used as a benchmark. Per Blockchain Center's definition, altseason is considered underway when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period.Historically, altcoin seasons have delivered outsized returns. For instance, during the 2021 cycle, large-cap altcoins gained approximately 174%, while Bitcoin advanced only about 2% over the same span.These episodes raise a central question: What factors consistently drive altcoin season, and why do they matter?

Historically, altcoin seasons have delivered outsized returns. For instance, during the 2021 cycle, large-cap altcoins gained approximately 174%, while Bitcoin advanced only about 2% over the same span.

These episodes raise a central question: What factors consistently drive altcoin season, and why do they matter?

 Bitcoin is the crypto market's bellwether. Its price movements often set the stage for altcoin season. Typically, altseason follows a Bitcoin bull run.When Bitcoin surges, say, crossing milestones such as $100,000, as it did in late 2024, investors pour capital into the market. Once Bitcoin's price stabilizes or consolidates, traders often rotate their profits into altcoins, seeking higher returns from more volatile assets.This pattern is rooted in market psychology. Bitcoin's rally attracts new capital, boosting overall market confidence. As Bitcoin's growth slows, investors look for the next big opportunity, and altcoins, with their potential for outsized gains, become the go-to choice. For instance, after Bitcoin's 124% gain in 2024, 20 of the top 50 altcoins outperformed it, signaling the early stages of an altseason.A key metric to watch is Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), which measures Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market capitalization. When BTC.D drops below 50%-60%, it often signals capital flowing into altcoins. In August 2025, Bitcoin dominance fell to 59% from 65%, hinting at an impending altseason.

 Altcoin season thrives on human emotion, specifically, the fear of missing out (FOMO). As altcoins like Ether or memecoins like Pepe (PEPE) start posting double- or triple-digit gains, social media platforms like X, Reddit and Telegram light up with hype.This buzz creates a feedback loop: Rising prices attract more investors, which drives prices higher still. In 2024, memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) surged over 1,100%, fueled by community-driven excitement.Social media trends are a leading indicator of altcoin season. Heightened discussions on platforms like X often precede price rallies, as retail investors jump in to capitalize on the momentum.For example, in 2025, Google Trends data for “altcoins” shattered records, reaching an all-time high in August, surpassing the May 2021 altseason peak, with search interest entering “price discovery” during Bitcoin's consolidation above $110,000. This surge reflects exploding retail FOMO, especially for ETH, SOL and memecoins like DOGE, as institutional exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows (e.g., $4 billion into ETH) rotate capital into altcoins.

 The broader economic landscape plays a massive role in the altcoin season. Macroeconomic conditions like interest rates, inflation and global liquidity significantly influence crypto markets.When central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, cut interest rates or increase liquidity through measures like quantitative easing, riskier assets like altcoins tend to thrive. Lower interest rates push investors away from traditional safe havens like bonds and into high-risk, high-reward assets like altcoins.For instance, analysts are hoping that Fed rate cuts in 2025 could inject liquidity into markets, fueling altcoin momentum. Conversely, tighter monetary policies can suppress altcoin growth by reducing market liquidity. In 2020-2021, aggressive money printing and low interest rates created a perfect storm for altcoins, with the altcoin market cap hitting record highs.Geopolitical events and regulatory developments also matter. Pro-crypto policies in major markets, such as the US or EU, boost investor confidence and drive capital into altcoins. For example, the 2024 approval of Ether spot ETFs, with inflows reaching nearly $4 billion in August 2025, shows how regulatory clarity sparks altcoin rallies.

 In the past, analysts have suggested that altcoin season was signaled when Bitcoin dominance fell below 55%, along with an Altcoin Season Index above 75, rising altcoin-to-stablecoin volumes and technical indicators.To navigate altcoin season, investors rely on several indicators:Altcoin season index: A score above 75 confirms altseason, with recent readings in September 2025 hovering around 78, indicating early momentum.Bitcoin dominance: A drop below 55%-60% often signals capital flowing into altcoins.Trading volume: Spikes in altcoin trading activity reflect growing investor interest.Market cap growth: The altcoin market cap hit $1.63 trillion in September 2025, nearing its all-time high.Technical indicators: Tools such as the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) help identify entry and exit points.            

In the past, analysts have suggested that altcoin season was signaled when Bitcoin dominance fell below 55%, along with an Altcoin Season Index above 75, rising altcoin-to-stablecoin volumes and technical indicators.

To navigate altcoin season, investors rely on several indicators:

 While altcoin season offers massive opportunities, it's not without risks. Altcoins are highly volatile, often losing 50%-90% of their value post-peak. Speculative hype, scams and regulatory uncertainty can also derail gains.To maximize returns, you could consider these strategies:Diversify: Spread investments across large-cap (e.g., Ether), mid-cap (e.g., Aave) and small-cap coins for balanced risk.Use technical analysis: Monitor RSI and MACD for optimal entry and exit points.Set stop-losses: Protect against sudden crashes with predefined exit strategies.Stay informed: Follow X, Reddit and crypto news for emerging trends.Secure profits: Use reliable wallets with two-factor authentication (2FA) to safeguard gains.However, caution is key. The crypto market is unpredictable, and altseason is often only clear in hindsight. By understanding the drivers, such as Bitcoin's cycle, market sentiment, macro conditions and technological trends, investors can position themselves to ride the wave while managing risks.

After the World Bank disburses funds for a project, tracking how those funds are used is of utmost importance. Countries use a wide variety of financial management systems and processes, which are not standardized and seldom share information across platforms. To address these issues, the World Bank is rolling out FundsChain. 

This proprietary platform uses blockchain technology to track every dollar on a secure, immutable digital ledger that can be accessed by all project stakeholders. By offering broader access to up-to-date transaction records, FundsChain is greatly enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability.

As the first multilateral development institution to implement blockchain for project oversight, the World Bank is leading the way in future-ready financial management.

The use of FundsChain to track project funds is part of a broader effort to make World Bank Group (WBG) operations more efficient and streamlined, ultimately better serving clients and communities.

“FundsChain is a one-stop shop for financial reporting and transparent tracking. It quickly shows payments, contracts, and expenses, notifying suppliers the moment payments are ready, empowering teams to make timely, informed decisions and streamline project management,” said Lovella Tolentino-Morada, finance management specialist at the Metro Manila Development Authority.

The Philippines was one of the early adopters of FundsChain, which was rolled out to the Metro Manila Flood Management Project, a $500 million initiative funded by the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The project aims to reduce Manila's vulnerability to floods by upgrading water infrastructure. 

In Bangladesh, FundsChain is being used in the Bangladesh Resilience, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood Improvement Project. This initiative targets 3,200 villages to help women launch entrepreneurial ventures, cover pregnancy-related expenses, improve sanitation, and provide wider support for the community. Since the $600 million project began in 2021, it has helped lift more than 115,000 people out of poverty.

“We are implementing FundsChain in 350 villages as a pilot. We are also implementing our Loan Management System (LMS) in all 3,200 villages of the project, providing laptops, and women leaders have been trained to use it. When FundsChain is linked with the LMS, they will be able to use it directly, and every village organization will become part of the process and can track funds transparently,” explained Mahbubul Alam, director of the project at the Social Development Foundation, an autonomous organization under the Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance.

Alam underscored that FundsChain is also benefiting his finance management team by simplifying transaction records and digitalizing all project-related information, something especially important in a project with many suppliers and beneficiaries.

Learn about the FundsChain initiative through this short two minute video.

FundsChain integrates technologies such as cryptography, distributed ledgers, and the internet to provide a secure and immutable platform for all types of transactions. It uses Hyperledger Besu, a blockchain solution which allows transactions to be stored by all parties involved in a project and recorded permanently. This enables development partners to track funds throughout the lifecycle of a project, and to prepare comprehensive project execution reports, allowing for robust data analysis. 

The platform has already been recognized internationally. In 2025, it received the Most Exciting Public Sector Innovation Project award from the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications and was featured in Citi's Global Perspective and Solutions report for its role in modernizing financial systems and enabling new financial instruments.

FundsChain has been successfully tested in 13 projects across 10 countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Comoros Islands, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Moldova, Mozambique, and the Philippines. It will now be scaled up and extended to approximately 250 projects in developing countries by the end of this fiscal year, in June 2026.  

As FundsChain continues to expand across more projects and countries, it is important to ensure that development financing is fast and transparent, to deliver the best outcomes for people and the planet.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is building a blockchain-based system to record digital payments.

The not-for-profit co-operative, which enables inter-bank payments, announced the project at this year's Sibos conference in Frankfurt.

A group of 30 banks are working with Swift and blockchain software company Consensys on the project to create a ledger for tokenised payments.

Swift will scale the use of blockchain through its large and well-established network, which sends millions of financial transaction messages every day between over 11,000 financial institutions and across more than 200 countries and territories.

The work aims to create interoperability between distributed ledger technology and existing fiat currency infrastructure.

Swift began operating in 1973, with 239 banks sharing the communications service.

Work has already begun on the first use case, focused on 24-hour cross-border payments, and the organisation will work on plans for further use cases.

Swift is building the infrastructure that the banks will use to exchange digital value through tokens.

Swift said in its announcement: “It is envisaged that the ledger – a secure, real-time log of transactions between financial institutions – will record, sequence and validate transactions and enforce rules through smart contracts.”

The organisation's CEO, Javier Pérez-Tasso, said: “We provide powerful and effective rails today and are moving at a rapid pace with our community to create the infrastructure stack of the future.”

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that's shared across a network of computers to keep a digital record of transactions. The technology is known for its role in cryptocurrency systems, where it maintains a secure and decentralised record of transactions. However, its applications extend beyond cryptocurrencies to fields including supply chain management, healthcare and finance.

Each computer in a blockchain network maintains a copy of the ledger where transactions are recorded to prevent a single point of failure. All copies of the blockchain are updated and validated simultaneously.

Banks involved in designing the blockchain ledger include NatWest, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Emirates NBD and Banco Santander.

Martin Tricaud, group head of wholesale banking at First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), described the blockchain-based shared ledger from Swift as “a defining moment for the future of global payments”.

“[We are] committed to enabling seamless, real-time cross-border settlement rails that support the growth of trade, investment, and remittances flows across our region and beyond.”

Manish Kohli, head of global payments solutions at HSBC, said: “Our work is driven by a common ambition: to make cross-border payments faster, smarter and always available. This collaboration complements HSBC's own initiatives and innovation within the digital currency space; by bringing together our solutions and expertise with Swift's global network capabilities, we can help shape the future of global payments for the benefit of our customers and industry.”

NatWest's head of group payment and digital asset strategy, Lee McNabb, said: “Swift's blockchain-based ledger provides the foundational infrastructure needed for trusted, real-time, cross-border payments alongside existing ways of moving money.”

Chris Skinner, fintech industry expert and CEO at The Finanser,  said this not particularly new. ""This latest development aims is to provide secure, regulated, real-time messaging and follows in the path of other networks like MasterCard and Visa to tokenize assets and monetary movements in a secure and controlled manner. The fact they are doing this with a group of large banks is significant, as is the fact that the announcement follows legislation like the US Genius Act promoting the use of stablecoins. It is a natural reaction.""

 Early Hyperliquid users have been rewarded with a massive Hypurr NFT airdrop, with the free digital cats now worth over $64,000. 

Early adopters of the perpetuals-focused layer-1 blockchain Hyperliquid were rewarded handsomely on Sunday after the Hyper Foundation finally airdropped the much-awaited Hypurr non-fungible token collection.  

At the time of writing, the Hypurr NFTs have a current floor price of around 1,458 Hyperliquid (HYPE), or $68,700, according to OpenSea data. 

However, there have already been eye-watering sales well above that range. The Hypurr #21 NFT with the extremely rare “Knight Ghost Armor” and “Knight Helm Ghost” traits went for 9,999 HYPE, worth $467,000, on Sunday. 

Demand was also so high before launch that certain NFTs were sold for as much as $88,000 via OTC desks earlier this month, per DripTrade data.  

Such trades were possible through DripTrade's OTC system, which enables buyers and sellers to agree on a set sale price before launch. The seller must then fulfill the trade within seven days of receiving the NFT, or forfeit collateral put forward as part of the agreement.  

Amid a cost-of-living crisis globally, the novelty of receiving a digital cat picture for free, worth more than some people's annual salary, was not lost on the crypto community. “CT is really a special place in hell. Average person struggling to get by or buy groceries and you have people posting their $50,000 hyperliquid cat NFTs they got for free,” said X user MoonOverlord.

While DidiTrading said: “Received an Hypurr NFT which is valued at $50k. I'm usually not good at valuing these things so I will give the market some time to find an equilibrium before I decide what I will do with it.” 

The Hypurr NFTs were deployed on the HyperEVM on Sunday and depict cartoon cat avatars with a range of different traits. The NFTs were primarily issued to the most active participants in the “Genesis” event in November 2024, which revolved around the launch of the HYPE token.   There are 4,600 NFTs in total, with 4,313 going to Genesis event participants and the remainder divided up among the Hyper Foundation and core project contributors, according to a post on X on Sunday. 

“The goal of the Hypurr NFT collection was to share a memento with those who believed in and contributed early on to Hyperliquid's growth. Each NFT is unique and captures the different moods, hobbies, tastes, and quirks of the Hyperliquid community, as depicted by Hypurr,” the Hyper Foundation post reads. 

In terms of 24-hour volume, OpenSea data shows that 952,000 HYPE have changed hands, worth around $44.6 million at current prices.

Hyperliquid introduced permissionless spot quote assets and dropped its Hypurr NFT collection, driving tens of millions in trading volume and rare NFT sales over $400,000.

Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid has launched its permissionless spot quote asset feature on the mainnet. 

Essentially, this means any asset that meets onchain requirements can be used as a quote asset for trading pairs without requiring centralized approval.

The Hyperliquid team noted that any quote asset can be specified as the quote asset in the first spot pair of an HIP-1 deployment. Subsequent quote asset launches will be subject to a Dutch auction to determine a fair starting price.

In trading terms, the “quote asset” is the stable currency used to price other assets. USDH, Hyperliquid's newly launched stablecoin from Native Markets, has already been deployed as the first permissionless quote asset.

Hyperliquid also distributed 4,600 Hypurr NFTs on the HyperEVM earlier in the day, as a reward to early ecosystem participants. Some rare NFTs from the collection have seen extraordinary sales, such as Hypurr #21, which sold for 9,999 HYPE or $467,000.

Data from NFT marketplace OpenSea shows that the Hypurr NFT collections generated more than $36 million worth of trading volume.

Hyperliquid releases 4,600 Hypurr NFTs with a floor price that soars over 60,000. Those who backed at the beginning enjoy huge gains in a historic decline.

Hyperliquid has deployed 4,600 Hypurr NFTs on the mainnet HyperEVM. These NFTs pay tribute to early patrons of its November 2024 Genesis Event. The platform listed participants, core contributors, and Hyper Foundation as owners without requiring minting.

The collection should be seen as an embodiment of the varieties of personalities and styles of the Hyperliquid community in the form of differentiated feline characters. 

The digital cats have moods, hobbies, and oddities that resemble the attachment of their owners to the project. The Hypurr NFTs exploded in the market soon after their launch.The price per unit took off on the floor to 1,463 HYPE tokens or more than $68,900. 

The volume of trading reached almost 45 million dollars in the course of 24 hours. Hypurr, the most unique NFT, sold 9,999 tokens of HYPE, which is equivalent to 467,000 dollars, one of the highest prices formed in the recent NFT sales history.

This airdrop rewarded those who were early adopters, not requiring payment, which made Hypurr unique in comparison to most NFT launches, where you have to buy it directly. 

There was no step to be taken by the recipients; the NFTs were automatically given out after vetting to guarantee fairness and stop abuse.

The Hypurr drop stresses the importance of community trust and rewards. The Hyper Foundation created the NFT drop as a token to recognize the early supporters of Hyperliquid. 

The tie-in to the native HYPE token and HyperEVM ecosystem created a buzz of speculation and collector demand around the NFTs.

Although certain doubts exist regarding the practical use of NFTs, the rarity of the collection and rapid increase in price have created a momentum of trading.

Over-the-counter sales before its launch were reportedly selling at high prices up to 88,000, which showed that there was a lot of demand even before trading started publicly.

Insecurity issues arose when hackers stole eight Hypurr NFTs from compromised wallets and sold them for $400,000.

This has not dulled the excitement surrounding the success of the collection and the fact that it was a trailblazer in the airdrop of the NFT industry.

The model of Hyperliquid in the Hypurr NFTs is an insight into how blockchain projects can enrich early adopters through meaningful rewards and create natural buzz without standard gatekeeping strategies such as fundraising and minting.

ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. — The Orlando-based team NFT Boombox claimed the top prize at the first Red Bull Tandem Rollercoaster event held in the U.S.

NFT Boombox won first place for both “most creative tandem Bicycle Entry' and ‘Most Creative Build,' securing the top overall prize in the competition.

The team attributes their success to the extensive time spent practicing.

“It's pretty high up there,” said co-winner Jensin Holmgren. “This and graduating college are right next to each other. I have to say, this is the ultimate, ‘dad lore.' Ten years from now, when I have kids, I'll be telling them this story all the time.” 

“I think the countless hours we spent practicing on that bike really paid off,” co-winner Joey Iorio said. “I gave him full control to do whatever he wanted. That's why I told him – I only need one hand to hold a GoPro and one hand to hold on to him. That's all I need.” 

Thirty teams competed on themed tandem bicycles that ran on a rollercoaster-themed track above Cranes Roost Lake on Saturday. More than 40,000 spectators were there.

Meta introduces subscription model at £2.99 monthly following ICO guidance on consent or pay frameworks, setting UK apart from stricter EU regulations.

Meta will introduce a subscription option for Facebook and Instagram users in the UK during the coming weeks, allowing them to access the platforms without personalised advertising for £2.99 per month on web browsers or £3.99 monthly on iOS and Android devices. The announcement, made on September 26, 2025, responds to regulatory guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office published on January 23, 2025.

The subscription model applies to users over 18 years old. Those who choose to pay will avoid having their personal information used for personalised advertising purposes. Users declining the subscription will continue using the services at no cost while receiving personalised advertisements, maintaining access to existing ad preference controls and privacy settings. A third option allows users to leave the platforms entirely.

Web purchases cost less than mobile subscriptions because Apple and Google charge fees through their respective app store purchasing policies. Regardless of purchase location, the subscription applies to all Facebook and Instagram accounts linked within Meta's Accounts Center. Additional accounts listed in the Accounts Center incur reduced fees of £2 monthly on web or £3 monthly on mobile platforms.

The ICO's guidance establishes a framework examining four critical factors for consent or pay models: power imbalance between organisations and users, appropriate fee levels, service equivalence across paid and free options, and privacy by design principles. Organisations must document assessments through data protection impact assessments under Article 35 of the UK GDPR. The guidance updated on January 23 confirmed publishers can implement consent or pay approaches provided they offer genuine choice and meet strict data protection requirements.

The ICO framework differs substantially from positions taken by European Union regulators. The European Data Protection Board adopted Opinion 08/2024 on April 17, 2024, determining that most consent or pay models failed to meet GDPR standards for valid consent. Meta challenged that opinion through General Court litigation filed on June 27, 2024, presenting seven pleas alleging violations of fundamental rights and improper interpretation of GDPR provisions.

Meta's subscription pricing in the UK represents a fraction of rates charged in other European markets. The company launched similar subscription services across the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland in October 2023 at €9.99 monthly for web access and €12.99 for mobile applications. Those prices significantly exceeded the UK rates announced in September 2025.

Research examining consent or pay implementations across Europe revealed substantial disparities between advertising revenue and subscription charges. A comprehensive report released in July 2025 documented that publishers earn approximately €0.24 per user monthly from tracking-based advertising, while pay options generate €3.24 per user monthly. The analysis found digital advertising accounts for roughly 10 percent of European press revenue, with programmatic advertising requiring personal data representing only 5 percent of total newspaper and magazine income.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office emphasized that fees must be ""appropriate"" and not ""unreasonably high"" to avoid effectively coercing users into consenting to data collection. The guidance recommends separating core service access fees from data protection opt-out charges. Where power imbalances exist between organisations and users, regulators expect companies to provide alternative options such as contextual advertising that does not require consent or payment.

Service equivalence represents another pillar of the ICO framework. Publishers must ensure comparable core functionality regardless of whether users choose to consent or pay. While premium features may differ across options, the fundamental service should remain consistent to preserve genuine choice. Organisations must also comply with privacy by design obligations under Article 25(1) of the UK GDPR, ensuring data protection is integrated when designing services.

Meta's announcement highlighted differences between UK and EU regulatory environments. The company stated that EU regulators continue requiring less personalised advertising experiences beyond legal requirements, creating worse outcomes for users and businesses. The UK approach allows clearer user choice while enabling personalised advertising tools to function as engines of growth and productivity. According to Meta, its advertising technologies connected to £65 billion in economic activity and over 357,000 jobs across the UK during 2024.

The contrast between regulatory approaches extends to enforcement patterns. Privacy advocacy group noyb filed lawsuitsagainst German data protection authorities on June 17, 2025, over nearly four years of inaction on complaints about consent or pay systems implemented by news websites. The cases revealed significant administrative dysfunction and reluctance to take decisive action against established media companies using questionable consent mechanisms.

UK news publishers began implementing consent or pay models following the ICO guidance. The Daily Mirror established pricing at £1.99 monthly for ad-free access with clear data collection options and partner information. The Times, The Sun, Daily Mail, Express, and Independent adopted similar approaches during late 2024 and early 2025. The ICO announced plans to expand cookie tracking scrutiny to the 1,000 most-visited UK websites following successful compliance improvements among initial review sites.

Personalised advertising builds profiles based on three data categories: provided information intentionally shared when signing up for services, observed data gathered through tracking activity across products and devices, and inferred data about interests or behaviour. The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations require organisations to obtain consent before using storage and access technologies such as cookies on user devices. Combined with UK GDPR requirements, organisations must secure valid consent to deliver personalised advertising relying on these technologies.

Meta maintains that personalised advertisements help users discover relevant products and services while allowing businesses to reach interested customers. Studies indicate personalised ads boost revenue for companies displaying advertisements on Meta platforms, with every pound spent on ads driving an average £3.82 in revenues for UK businesses choosing to advertise. UK advertisers will continue running personalised advertising campaigns reaching users who select free, ad-supported access.

Children require special consideration under consent or pay models. The ICO guidance notes that children merit special protection regarding personal information due to potential lack of financial independence and limited understanding of processing activities. Services offered to children under 13 years old must comply with Article 8 UK GDPR. Organisations seeking consent from users under 13 must obtain parental consent and implement effective age assurance measures.

Standard 12 of the Children's Code requires switching profiling for children off by default, including for personalised advertising purposes. Services should always provide privacy settings for personalised advertising used to fund services but separate from core functionality children wish to access. In most cases, funding models remain distinct from core services and should be subject to privacy settings disabled by default.

The consent or pay model differs from ""take it or leave it"" approaches that condition service access solely on accepting data processing for personalised advertising. The ICO determined most take it or leave it approaches fail to comply with requirements for freely given consent because they provide no genuine choice. Consent or pay models differ by offering payment as an alternative to consent, though this raises separate issues when fees combine access to core services with charges for avoiding data sharing.

Organisations can offer additional options alongside consent or pay choices. These include access with contextual advertising targeted based on page content rather than user profiles, or menu options with different premium subscription tiers featuring additional functionality. Such approaches may address power imbalance concerns by ensuring users have meaningful choices beyond binary consent or payment decisions.

The ICO stated that when organisations identify clear power imbalances with users, they should take additional steps demonstrating consent or pay models comply with data protection law. Power imbalances may exist where users have no realistic choice about whether to use services, particularly affecting existing users who may face significant barriers to switching providers. Factors indicating power imbalances include market position, network effects, switching costs, and data portability limitations.

Recital 43 of the UK GDPR explains that consent should not be regarded as freely given if individuals have no genuine free choice or cannot refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. The phrase ""without detriment"" means individuals should not face unfair penalties for refusing or withdrawing consent. However, it does not mean consent becomes invalid due to any level of negative consequence. The ICO uses the term ""unfair penalty"" throughout its guidance.

Articles 12 and 21 of the UK GDPR require organisations processing personal data for direct marketing purposes to demonstrate that individuals can exercise their right to object free of charge. The ICO guidance explains that direct marketing definitions include processing for personalised advertising purposes. In consent or pay contexts, the right to object to direct marketing can operate similarly to withdrawing consent to personalised advertising.

Meta's implementation will notify UK users over 18 about their choice to subscribe for fee-based access without advertisements. The notification will be dismissible initially, allowing existing users time to consider options before decisions are required. Social media services remain personalised for subscribers, but their personal data will not be used to display advertisements.

The announcement contrasts with Meta's ongoing disputes with European regulators over data processing practices. The Court of Justice of the European Union previously limited Meta's data use for advertising, requiring data minimisation principles even when users consent to personalised advertising. A Leipzig District Court awarded a Facebook user €5,000 compensation on July 4, 2025, for data protection violations involving Meta's Business Tools that track users across third-party websites.

The UK regulatory environment appears increasingly divergent from European Union approaches. While digital advertising trade associations defend consent or pay models in EU consultations, arguing they provide genuine user autonomy, privacy advocates continue documenting concerns about coercive design and excessive pricing. The tension between commercial viability and privacy protection remains central to ongoing regulatory debates.

This matters for the marketing community because it establishes a precedent for how major platforms can balance personalised advertising capabilities with privacy requirements. The relatively low subscription pricing compared to European rates may influence user decisions and affect targeting reach for advertisers. The ICO's framework provides clearer parameters for implementing similar models while maintaining compliance with UK data protection law.

The approach also affects measurement of advertising effectiveness. Users selecting subscription options will not contribute to personalised advertising metrics, potentially impacting campaign optimisation and audience insights. Advertisers must adapt strategies to account for reduced data availability while maintaining campaign performance for users choosing ad-supported access.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Why Token Launches Could Redefine Startup Fundraising","https://beincrypto.com/crypto-token-launches-vs-ico-fundraising-future/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

Written by Kamina Bashir

Edited by Harsh Notariya

The pace of new token launches has picked up, with blockchain ecosystems introducing fresh assets at an unprecedented rate. For many, the trend recalls the initial coin offering (ICO) frenzy nearly a decade ago, when speculation overshadowed fundamentals. Yet industry leaders argue that today's environment rests on stronger ground.

Stephen Hess, Founder and Director of Metaplex, is among them. In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, he explained that modern launch frameworks aren't simply fueled by hype — they are the product of years of infrastructure development, making them more responsible and scalable. Hess believes the shift is so significant that token-based fundraising is set to become the default path for startups.

For context, an ICO is a fundraising mechanism used by blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. It's somewhat similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in traditional finance, but instead of selling shares of a company, projects sell digital tokens. 

In exchange for their investment, investors receive the new tokens, which they can use within the project or potentially sell later for profit.

In 2017, ICOs exploded in popularity and investors poured billions into crypto startups. According to data from Goat Finance, that year alone saw more than 800 ICOs launched, raising over $5.6 billion in total funding.

“In 2015, Ethereum's introduction of a standard for implementing tokens (ERC20) further streamlined the ICO process. From just 9 ICOs in 2015 and 74 in 2016, the market surged to over 1,000 ICOs in 2018,” ICO Bench noted.

ICO Bench further revealed that coin offerings delivered 3.5 times more capital to blockchain startups than traditional venture capital (VC) rounds between 2017 and 2020. However, the ICO boom was marred by challenges. 

A study of 3,392 ICOs from 2016 to 2018 revealed a sharp decline in success rates, from nearly 90% in early 2017 to 30% by Q4 2018. Plummeting cryptocurrency prices, regulatory scrutiny, and high-profile scams eroded investor confidence. A Statis Group study found that over 80% of ICOs were identified as scams. 

“The consequences of the ICO bust were severe: By 2019, over 80% of ICOs were considered ‘dead' or ‘scams.' Many investors lost significant sums. The term ‘ICO' became associated with high risk and potential fraud,” Goat Finance wrote.

But with so many new tokens hitting the market today, the question remains: has the industry learned its lessons, or is history destined to repeat itself?

Reflecting on the ICO era, Hess stressed that the process had serious flaws. 

“In the ICO era, capital raises were plagued by opacity, unfair access, and technical limitations, like no robust smart contract frameworks for equitable distribution, leading to regular front-running, sniping, and insider advantages that eroded trust and fueled speculation,” he said.

Nonetheless, the executive emphasized that today's token launches are far more sustainable than the 2017 ICO frenzy, supported by stronger products for founders and more advanced tools for developers. Hess noted that modern token issuers now leverage sophisticated on-chain mechanisms to overcome the shortcomings of the past.

Fully on-chain auctions and launch pools, for example, enable real-time price discovery. They also ensure that all participants receive tokens at the same fair price, eliminating opportunities for manipulation. 

Beyond distribution, issuers are operating within a more mature ecosystem powered by proof-of-stake networks like Solana (SOL). It supports scalable, web-level applications and real revenue-generating businesses. 

This marks a fundamental shift from hype-driven speculation toward utility and adoption, avoiding the pitfalls of launching projects without proven traction or genuine community alignment.

“Platforms like Genesis demonstrate this sustainability. Its fully onchain auctions and launch pools ensure everyone gets the same price with real-time price discovery, eliminating front-running and sniping that fueled 2017's excesses. This fosters genuine community participation and long-term value, rather than pump-and-dump schemes. We also have thousands of crypto businesses with revenue-generating projects and protocols, grounding launches in real economics instead of pure speculation,” Hess mentioned to BeInCrypto.

Backed by strong infrastructure, crypto-native companies are now increasingly opting for token launches to raise capital over traditional VC funding. According to Hess, this trend is driven by the speed, flexibility, and community alignment offered by on-chain fundraising. 

“Raising capital through a token launch on-chain allows companies to move faster, bypassing the rigid timelines of traditional funding rounds. Projects can raise capital directly from a global, liquid market, giving them more control over their expansion. This strategy also aligns incentives with their customers and community from day one, as early participants become token holders. A strong, engaged community creates a healthier, more durable capital base, which is ultimately beneficial for all investors, including VCs,” he remarked.

The Metaplex founder elaborated that token launches expand access to capital beyond traditional institutional investors by opening participation to a global online market. Retail participants, as token holders, contribute liquidity and alignment, serving not only as backers but also as stakeholders who provide capital, feedback, and network effects. 

This dynamic democratizes fundraising and fosters startups that are more closely aligned with their communities. Despite this, Hess added that token launches still carry risks, including regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and potential manipulation. 

So, does the rise of token-backed fundraising mean the end of traditional VC funding? Not quite. Hess told BeInCrypto that this shift doesn't eliminate venture capitalists — it brings them on-chain.

“This creates a more level playing field where everyone, including VCs, participates directly,” he stated.

Hess highlighted that the rise of on-chain fundraising is pushing venture capital firms to adapt. The funding space is becoming increasingly democratized, allowing startups to raise capital on-chain much earlier in their development. 

In addition, Hess said that token-based fundraising doesn't operate in isolation — it coexists with traditional financing. Networks and protocols can issue utility tokens that generate value through adoption, governance, and utility, while still driving returns for equity holders who helped build them.

“Onchain equity issuance also enhances traditional financing by enabling tokenized shares to be traded or used as collateral in DeFi lending programs. These security tokens offer greater liquidity and accessibility than traditional equity. For instance, a company could tokenize equity for global trading and use it to secure loans. This integration creates new opportunities for capital efficiency and investor engagement,” he commented. 

Finally, Hess predicted that the model pioneered by crypto-native companies will expand to a broader range of startups. It signals a future where direct, community-driven capital becomes the standard.

“Token-based fundraising will become the default path for startups, as companies launch onchain early to access the internet capital markets,” Hess revealed to BeInCrypto.

He added that in parallel, much of the economy will shift toward decentralization, powered by tokenized protocols and peer-to-peer networks.

“Platforms like Metaplex will drive this by offering advanced, fair token creation and launch tools on Solana, lowering barriers for founders and builders,” the executive said.

Thus, the resurgence of token launches reflects a maturing industry that has learned from the excesses of 2017. By prioritizing transparency, utility, and community alignment, today's token launches aim to avoid the pitfalls of the ICO era. 

While risks remain, the evolution of on-chain infrastructure and the integration of traditional and decentralized financing models signal a promising future for startup capital raising—one that balances innovation with responsibility.

Home - Blockchain & Digital Assets


September 29, 2025 @ 11:50 am By JD Alois 

The European Union is charging forward to offer a digital Euro. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is in the queue to be in use by 2026. Currently, both institutional use and consumer access are anticipated. This contrasts with the US, where a CBDC or digital dollar issued by the central bank for usage by consumers has been blocked. Congressional action is needed to allow the US Federal Reserve to issue a digital dollar. Private firms are filling the space with hundreds of billions of dollar based stablecoins already in circulation. With the passage of the GENIUS Act, many firms are poised to issue their own digital currencies – including digital Euros.

Mark Aruliah, Head of EMEA Policy and Regulatory Affairs at Elliptic, says that European banks are “waking up to the possibility of a Euro-based stablecoin. At the same time, he believes private issuers cannot move quickly enough to compete with the US and Asia, where regulatory frameworks and market adoption are gaining speed.

“European banks have shown their appetite to engage with stablecoins and tokenized assets, but they need clear regulatory pathways and the right tools to manage risk,” says Aruliah. “With the US, MAS in Singapore, and the HKMA already moving in this direction, Europe cannot afford to be left behind.”

He noted that the news of European banks exploring a digital Euro is a positive signal, but this must be matched by “scale, urgency, and more clarity on regulatory expectations.”

“If European banks don't move quickly to adopt and scale credible euro-denominated stablecoins in a robust and safe way, there is a real risk that dollar-backed alternatives will continue to dominate by default,” Aruliah explains.

Aruliah adds that the European Central Bank has voiced concerns that without competitive products, Europe may find its financial system reliant on dollar-backed offerings. For many years, Europe has sought to empower the Euro as a strong contender for the top reserve currency. A digital dollar, issued by private parties, is not only expected to boost demand for dollar-denominated securities, such as Treasuries, but also provide the world with greater access to the US dollar.

“While MiCA and progress on the digital euro provide a strong framework, policymakers and financial institutions must work together to translate regulation into adoption. The jurisdictions that move first will be able to trail blaze by setting the standards and capture the flows.”

 XRP's value extends far beyond its price, powering fast remittances, loyalty rewards and institutional finance. 

XRP eliminates pre-funding and speeds up cross-border remittances, making it useful in emerging markets.

Loyalty and travel programs are bringing XRP into daily life, turning it from an investment asset into a practical payment option.

Institutions like SBI and Santander add credibility by holding XRP reserves and exploring settlement use cases.

With the SEC case resolved and global clarity growing, XRP now has the legal certainty and network reach to expand adoption.

XRP (XRP), the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has often been discussed in terms of speculative gains or losses. But its significance goes deeper once you factor in XRP's real-world use cases, institutional support and regulatory clarity.

Here are five factors that help explain why XRP matters beyond its market price.

International payments are one of XRP's strongest value drivers. It helps eliminate pre-funding, reduce settlement time and cut costs by acting as a bridge currency.

Examples:

SBI Remit (Japan) uses XRP to send money instantly to the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. This benefits migrant workers sending remittances home.

Tranglo (Southeast Asia), in partnership with Ripple, taps XRP for remittance corridors across Malaysia, the Philippines and Bangladesh.

Pyypl (Middle East and Africa) integrated XRP for remittances between Africa and Asia, targeting unbanked populations.

Ripple's partnership with Banco Rendimento (Brazil) enables businesses and individuals to move funds globally with XRP as a settlement bridge.

Compared to SWIFT, which can take days and incur high fees, XRP's near-instant settlement makes it attractive in emerging markets where remittances are essential.

XRP is increasingly used outside financial institutions, especially in loyalty, travel and consumer services. This builds everyday utility for millions of users.

Examples:

Webus/Wetour has established a $300-million XRP treasury to support blockchain-powered travel vouchers, loyalty points and settlement infrastructure. Over 60 million loyalty members will be able to use XRP for overseas services like airport transfers, premium rides and travel experiences.

SBI VC Trade (Japan) enables customers to earn XRP rewards through loyalty campaigns, expanding its use beyond trading.

When loyalty programs adopt XRP, it shifts from being an investment asset to something users engage with in daily life, from redeeming points to paying for travel.

Did you know? XRP TipBot (Netherlands, now discontinued) once allowed users to tip XRP on social platforms, demonstrating micro-reward potential in loyalty-style ecosystems.

Institutions treating XRP as a serious operational and treasury asset add credibility and demand, signaling growing trust in its long-term stability.

By using XRP for liquidity management, settlements and cross-border transfers, these players validate its utility beyond speculation, strengthening its role as an institutional-grade digital asset.

Examples:

SBI Holdings not only invests in Ripple but also integrates XRP in its subsidiaries (SBI Remit, SBI VC Trade) and holds significant XRP reserves.

Santander (Spain) tested RippleNet and explored XRP-based settlement for cross-border payments through its One Pay FX platform.

Bank of America has been reported as a Ripple partner, exploring XRP settlement for cross-border efficiency.

Travel platform WeBus is setting aside a large XRP reserve managed by an institutional fund manager to underpin loyalty and settlement operations.

When corporations integrate XRP into their balance sheets or payment systems, it signals confidence and provides real demand beyond traders.

XRPL offers speed, scalability and innovation that keep attracting use cases from cross-border payments and stablecoin issuance to tokenized assets and even decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations.

Its low fees and eco-friendly consensus model make it one of the most practical blockchains for real-world adoption.

Examples:

Transaction speed: Settles in three to five seconds, compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes or SWIFT's two to five days. This underpins remittance and microtransaction use cases.

Low cost: Fees average a fraction of a cent, ideal for loyalty programs, micropayments and small rewards.

XLS-20 amendment: Introduced native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on XRPL, enabling loyalty points, tickets and collectibles to be tokenized directly onchain.

XLS-70 / XLS-80 proposals: Improve digital credentials and permissioned domain controls, critical for regulated financial and enterprise use.

Sologenic: (Built on XRPL) tokenizes stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), showing how XRPL tech supports financial assets beyond payments.

XRPL's focus on real-world scalability is why businesses see it as infrastructure, not just a speculative chain.

Did you know? The XRP Ledger doesn't rely on mining like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it uses a unique consensus mechanism validated by a global network of over 150 independent validators, including universities, financial institutions and community-run nodes, to confirm transactions in just three to five seconds.

XRP's long-term value is tied not just to technology and adoption, but also to how regulators treat it and how large networks integrate it. By 2025, the regulatory and market environment will have shifted significantly, giving XRP more clarity and momentum.

In July 2023, US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on exchanges, though direct institutional sales can be subject to securities law.

In August 2025, Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission officially ended their five-year legal battle. The SEC dropped its appeals, and Ripple agreed to pay a $125-million civil penalty. This conclusion provides long-awaited finality and regulatory certainty in the US market.

Japan: XRP continues to be one of the few cryptocurrencies with a clear legal standing, thanks to proactive rules and SBI Holdings' advocacy.

UK and EU: Ripple has been active in aligning XRP usage with the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, ensuring compliance in European markets.

As of 2025, there are over 6.6 million active XRP wallets globally. Blockchain explorers estimate that more than 6 million individual XRPL accounts have been created.

SBI Group's crypto exchanges (SBI VC Trade and BITPoint Japan) grew rapidly, from about 807,000 accounts in March 2024 to roughly 1.65 million by March 2025.

SBI Holdings itself holds about 1.6 trillion Japanese yen ($10 billion) worth of XRP and Ripple-related assets, a figure larger than its own market capitalization of 1.2 trillion yen.

With banks, exchanges and consumer platforms adopting XRP, network effects multiply: more liquidity, more corridors and more opportunities to use XRP in daily life.

Why does this matter? 

The end of the Ripple vs. SEC case in 2025 eliminates one of XRP's biggest overhangs. Combined with regulatory clarity in Asia and Europe and measurable growth in wallets, accounts and corporate reserves, XRP now has both the legal certainty and network reach to drive adoption well beyond speculation.

XRP enters 2025 with legal clarity and growing integrations, but usage still lags compared to stablecoins like USDC (USDC), which move trillions annually.

At the same time, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are intensifying competition with broad regulatory backing and global payment networks. Against this backdrop, XRP's future depends on whether it can scale adoption beyond infrastructure to tangible, widespread use.

Adoption vs. actual usage: Many integrations exist, but user activity remains lower than potential. Compared with stablecoins, USDC (from Circle) shows enormous onchain volume. For example, in 2025, USDC's annual transaction volume is trillions of dollars ($5.9 trillion over a one-year period) in onchain transfers. That scale suggests people are using stablecoins far more broadly (for payments, transfers, etc.) than many non-fiat cryptocurrencies.

Competition: In 2025, stablecoins and CBDCs pose strong competition to XRP: Fireblocks' Network for Payments, Circle's Arc network and Circle + FIS partnerships are driving USDC adoption across 100+ countries, while CBDCs promise state-backed digital money with regulatory trust and easy banking integration.

Regulation: Regulation remains a double-edged sword for XRP. While the US case ending in 2025 brought legal clarity, some regions still restrict or refuse to recognize XRP as money. China bans most crypto use, forcing overseas-only workarounds, and global stablecoin laws are tightening, raising compliance standards but also boosting trust in rivals like USDC. This mix of progress and barriers means XRP's adoption potential is still uneven across markets.

Given these challenges, XRP's future depends on whether adoption can scale from integration to everyday use and how it navigates competition from stablecoins and CBDCs. 

With legal clarity now secured and global partnerships expanding, XRP stands at a crossroads: poised to bridge traditional finance and digital assets but challenged to prove it can thrive in a rapidly evolving payments landscape.

 NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- Crypto.com and Sharps Technology, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""STSS"") (Nasdaq: ""STSS"" and ""STSSW"") today announced that STSS has expanded its digital asset treasury strategy with Crypto.com services for its holdings.

STSS is an emerging leader in digital asset treasury management, with a bold vision to align traditional finance with the Solana ecosystem. The Company has previously announced plans to establish a Solana-focused digital asset treasury strategy and, to date has acquired more than 2 million SOL.




As part of this collaboration, STSS intends to use Crypto.com's platform, including its institutional-grade custody infrastructure and OTC desk, which offers deep liquidity, competitive pricing, and discreet execution, to manage its digital asset treasury. Crypto.com will also integrate several Solana projects, representing a significant step in expanding access to the Solana ecosystem through qualified custodians. This partnership underscores STSS's commitment to advancing the growth of the Solana network in close alignment with key Solana ecosystem players.

The Company's Solana holdings are currently valued at over $400 million, with SOL trading above $200. By deploying a portion of this capital through Crypto.com into Solana-native projects, STSS aims to generate yield while simultaneously expanding liquidity across the Solana ecosystem.

Sharps Technology (NASDAQ:STSS) has announced a strategic partnership with Crypto.com to enhance its digital asset treasury management capabilities, particularly within the Solana ecosystem. The company has already acquired over 2 million SOL tokens, currently valued at more than $400 million with SOL trading above $200.

Through this collaboration, STSS will utilize Crypto.com's institutional-grade custody infrastructure and OTC desk for managing its digital assets. Crypto.com will integrate several Solana projects, aiming to expand access to the Solana ecosystem through qualified custodians. STSS plans to deploy capital through Crypto.com into Solana-native projects to generate yield while expanding ecosystem liquidity.

STSS partners with Crypto.com to manage its $400M Solana treasury, boosting institutional legitimacy for SOL ecosystem investments.

This partnership represents a significant institutional advancement for the Solana ecosystem. Sharps Technology has accumulated an impressive 2 million SOL tokens (worth over $400 million) and is now leveraging Crypto.com's institutional infrastructure to manage this substantial treasury. The decision to use Crypto.com's custody solutions, OTC desk, and liquidity services indicates STSS is implementing sophisticated treasury management practices rather than merely holding SOL as a passive investment.

The strategic importance lies in how STSS plans to deploy capital across Solana-native projects, which serves dual purposes: generating yield on their treasury while simultaneously improving liquidity throughout the Solana ecosystem. This creates a positive feedback loop where their investment activities directly strengthen the network they're invested in.

Notably, Crypto.com's commitment to integrate several Solana projects represents significant validation, as it connects Solana to Crypto.com's massive user base of 150 million users. This integration will likely reduce friction for institutional capital entering the Solana ecosystem through qualified custodians - addressing a critical infrastructure gap that has historically limited institutional participation.

The collaboration positions STSS as one of the largest institutional Solana treasury holders, establishing them as a significant player in Solana's financial ecosystem. While the treasury strategy carries execution risks and exposure to SOL's price volatility, this partnership demonstrates a sophisticated approach to digital asset management that could become a blueprint for other corporations exploring similar strategies.

Decentralized oracle network Chainlink is working with 24 of the world's largest financial institutions to overhaul how corporate actions, such as dividends, stock splits, and mergers, are processed across global markets.

Chainlink ran a pilot with SWIFT, DTCC, Euroclear and six other financial institutions. It leveraged a combination of its blockchain-based and artificial intelligence (AI) to ingest and validate real corporate action events in multiple languages.

That led to the production of unified data containers, known as golden records, in near real time, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

These records were distributed simultaneously to blockchain networks and legacy systems like the interbank messaging system SWIFT, significantly reducing manual work and the risk of error.

The process used a blend of large language models, including OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude, to extract structured data from unstructured corporate action announcements. These were then published as unified gold records on-chain to create a “single source of truth that all participants can easily access, verify, and build upon.”

Chainlink's Runtime Environment (CRE) validated model outputs, while its interoperability protocol (CCIP) relayed data to blockchains, including Avalanche and DTCC's private network.

Data attesters cryptographically attested the outputs and contributed to potentially missing data fields. According to Chainlink, the system achieved a near 100% data consensus across all test events.

The current system for processing corporate actions is costly. Citi's 2025 Asset Servicing report shows that the average corporate action touches 110,000 interactions and costs $34 million to process. The global financial industry is now spending an estimated $58 billion annually in processing corporate actions.

Analyst James Check and Unchained produced a report on the current bitcoin BTC$113,898.71 market landscape, with the most interesting takeaway being the rise of the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) specifically the success of iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the options market that now underpins the product. 

The report opens with a quote saying: ""Options are now the dominant derivatives instrument by open interest, being over $90 Billion in size, and eclipsing the futures markets at $80 Billion"".

Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has seen around $61 billion in net inflows over 18 months, making it one of the most successful ETF's of all-time. 

However, the dominance accelerated following the launch of ETF options in November 2024. 

The options market, which gives investors the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a set price within a certain timeframe, has dramatically reshaped flows, with IBIT attracting $32.8 billion in inflows while competitors have remained flat since the options began trading. 

The report states that IBIT now controls 57.5% of all bitcoin ETF assets under management (AUM), up from 49% in October 2024, with roughly 40 cents of options open interest for every dollar of bitcoin held in the fund. By contrast, Fidelity's FBTC, the second largest ETF, is about 25 times smaller than IBIT in options open interest, with around $1.3 billion. 

This level of activity has made IBIT a rival to Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchanges, where daily trading volumes typically run between $4 billion and $5 billion, according to the report. 

The report also points to 13F filings, the quarterly disclosures required by the SEC for investment managers with over $100 million in assets. These filings show institutions holding ETFs, allowing others to use the options market to be able to short or use arbitrage methods for hedging volatility. 

Overall, the report concludes that bitcoin's volatility profile has shifted meaningfully in this cycle, with ETFs and their options markets serving as a major driver of that change.

""In our view, the launch of options on top of the spot ETFs is thus far an under-discussed, but highly important change in Bitcoin's recent market structure"", the report said.

BTC$113,898.71, up 2.5% in the past 24 hours, has created a CME futures gap between $110,000 and $111,335. That's the difference between its prices when the CME market closed for the week on Friday and reopened on Sunday. 

ETH$4,146.52 is showing a similar setup. That has gained 3.4% and left a futures gap starting around $4,000. 

The thing about CME futures gaps is that they tend to get filled. With the two largest cryptocurrencies currently trading higher, that means they both — at some point — are likely to drop back and retest those lower levels.

Bitcoin's monthly low often tends to occur within the first 10 trading days, meaning this dip could arrive within the next two weeks. That's even though October, often referred to as “Uptober,” is historically its second-best performing month with an average return of 22%. 

More broadly, the CoinDesk 20 Index has gained 3.2% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green. 

Outside of crypto, precious metals remain firm, with gold climbing 1.5% on Monday to $3,815 and silver approaching all time highs at $47, with the next breakout level at $50. 

Macro markets are focused on Friday's highly influential U.S. jobs report, with nonfarm payrolls, a measure of new jobs excluding farm work and certain categories, expected at 39,000 alongside a steady 4.3% unemployment rate. ISM Services PMI is forecast at 52, indicating continued expansion of the world's largest economy.

For bitcoin to break out of its current $110,000 to $120,000 trading range, volatility and sentiment will need to return. The fourth quarter, which starts on Wednesday, could provide the catalyst. Stay alert!

 Bitcoin briefly surpassed $112,000 in a sign of recovery after a volatile week, prompting one analyst to say the cryptocurrency was still in an uptrend. 

A Bitcoin analyst has argued that Bitcoin is still in a bull market as it briefly recovered to over $112,000 on Monday after a week of major volatility.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to gain over the past week as analysts said investors were showing signs of exhaustion, with its sudden drop last week resulting in two major liquidation events across the wider crypto market.

Bitcoin hit a 24-hour high of $112,293 in early trading on Monday, surpassing $112,000 for the first time since sharply falling on Thursday. It is currently trading at $111,835, according to CoinGecko.

However, crypto investment firm XWIN Research Japan said in a CryptoQuant note on Sunday that “while recent volatility has unsettled traders, on-chain data continues to suggest that Bitcoin's bull market is not over.” 

It said that long-term holder behavior and Bitcoin's Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which compares its market value to the average cost basis of holders, together show “resilience beneath the surface.”

“Bitcoin's recent pullbacks appear less like the end of a rally and more like a period of digestion,” XWIN added.

Bitcoin's MVRV ratio has dropped to 2, with the average cost basis at around half of the value of Bitcoin's price, which XWIN said historically “reflects neither panic nor euphoria.”

“Investors are still sitting on healthy gains, yet the market has cooled from overheated conditions,” it explained, adding that past cycles have seen Bitcoin enter “its strongest expansion phase” after consolidating in this MVRV range.

Meanwhile, profit-taking by long-term investors has fallen, which XWIN said “effectively reduces available supply, offsetting short-term volatility and creating the conditions for renewed demand to lift prices higher.”

XWIN said the two metrics show that “this cycle has not reached its terminal stage,” and added that the recent consolidation “could mark the groundwork for the next major leg upward—suggesting the bull market is alive and well.”

Bitcoin's recovery comes after crypto bulls were wiped out of over $4 billion in two major liquidations in the past seven days.

The first major liquidation on Monday, Sept. 22, saw just under $3 billion in long positions across the crypto market wiped out as Bitcoin fell 3% to below $112,000 and dragged the rest of the market down, per CoinGlass data.

That was followed up with a $1 billion liquidation of total crypto longs on Thursday, with the market again hampered by Bitcoin's drop to $109,000.

Bitcoin made up the bulk of the liquidations on Sept. 22, with $726 million longs erased, while Ether (ETH) long bets led on Thursday, with $413 million wiped out.

Meanwhile, the sentiment tracking Crypto Fear & Greed Index has risen to reflect that the market is “Neutral” for the first time since Friday, Sept. 19, recovering from a period of “Fear.”

The index hit a score of 50 out of 100 on Monday, rising 13 points from Sunday. 

It continues an uptrend the index has enjoyed since falling to a score of 28 on Friday, its lowest since mid-April when Bitcoin sank to $80,000.

Weaver Ants Form Complex Chains to Pull More Than 100 Times Their Weight

When more humans are added to a team, each member accomplishes less work—but teams of weaver ants do better and better as more join

Weaver ants' feet have an incredibly strong grip—individual members of one species can, without slipping, hold an entire dead bird hanging off the edge of a table. And the mighty insects rarely work alone, often teaming up to haul and fold oversized leaves as they build their foliage-filled homes. Scientists have now found that as teams of Asian weaver ants gain more members, they strategically use their grippy feet to become ever more efficient at pulling leaf tips. In contrast to typical human behavior, ants work harder in larger groups than when alone to pull comparatively huge weights.

In a measurable phenomenon called the Ringelmann effect, the more humans join a team, the less effort each individual member tends to exert; researchers generally attribute this to reduced motivation and the difficulty of coordinating more people. “When you're pulling on a rope, like a tug-of-war, it's actually less efficient to have more people lined up,” says Macquarie University biologist Chris Reid, co-author on a new study in Current Biology.

Reid and his colleagues connected the tip of a paper leaf to a force-measuring device and filmed weaver ants pulling the tip back across the leaf to fold it. They found single ants pulled 59 times their weight on average, but individuals in groups of 15 pulled 103 times their weight. The more ants were included, the sharper the efficiency increase.

To make this happen, the ants assembled into chains of two to four, one behind the other. The front ants bent their legs and pulled hard at the leaf tip with their mandibles while the rear ants held the leaf still.

The researchers propose these pulling chains could act like force ratchets. The front ants are “active pullers,” and the rear ants are the “passive resisters”—they grab on to the front ants' bodies, plant their sticky feet firmly on the leaf, and store the forces generated by the front ants so the leaf doesn't fly backward.

“Examples of true superefficiency are very limited,” says ecologist Scott Powell of George Washington University, who was not involved in the study. Marching army ants strictly following a pheromone trail to carry heavier loads are another known example. But along with efficient coordination, weaver ants' physical traits appear to give them an edge.

These ants' unusually grippy feet make them “really well adapted to withstanding a strong pulling force in the other direction,” says biologist Helen McCreery of Tufts University, who also was not involved in the study. “The world is full of organisms solving problems in ways that are totally different from the way our brains would think to do it.”

Art imitates life ... maybe.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There's something intriguing, even frightening, about the image of an ancient horned serpent roaming across the land. Thanks to some suggestive fossils and legends of old, talk of such a creature isn't a new concept. 

But the recent discovery of 200-year-old rock paintings found in South Africa now has scientists hypothesizing that this ancient creature may have been far more than just a legend.

The first formal scientific descriptions of this horned serpent—a supposed member of the dicynodont group—appeared in 1845. Considering the abundance of dicynodont fossils found in the Karoo Basin in South Africa, some have pondered whether this long-thought mythical horned serpent is rooted in reality. 

The discovery of rock art dated to between 1821 and 1835 adds even more credence to the legend, as the painting is older than the first formal reference to the dicynodont. If we're lucky, it could provide further clues as to just how intertwined this horned serpent was with South Africa's indigenous San culture. 

In a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, Julien Benoit from the University of the Witwatersrand confirmed that the rock art from the early 1800s depicts a tusked animal, and that it sits alongside tetrapod fossils in the immediate vicinity. “Altogether,” the Benoit wrote, “they suggest a case of indigenous paleontology.” 

Still, it will need to take more than a 200-year-old painting to match a smattering of unknown fossils to a long-extinct creature unlike anything seen in the area today. 

“The ethnographic, archaeological, and paleontological evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that the Horned Serpent panel could possibly depict a dicynodont,” Benoit wrote in the study. He added that the downward orientation of the tusks, which doesn't match any African animal (but does match dicynodonts), the abundance of fossils in the area, and the belief held by the San of the existence of this long-extinct large animal further support the theory. 

“Of course, at this point it is speculative,” said Benoit, according to IFL Science, “but the tusked animal on the Horned Serpent panel was likely painted as a rain-animal, which means it was probably involved [in] rain-making ceremonies.” These ceremonies often evoked known extinct animals to help the people encourage the gods to send rain. 

The San were known to have a robust mix of animals belonging to their ‘spirit world,' but Benoit said that these animals were generally inspired by reality—even if extinct. Coupled with the San's interest in fossils, Benoit believes a fossil discovery could have led the San to recreate the horned serpent, using a long-held legend in which their ancestors described the creatures as “great monstrous brutes, exceeding the elephant or hippopotamus in bulk” as the template. 

There's plenty of leaps from legend to scientific grounding that may be too large for a fabled horned serpent to make. But after further studies, the 200-year-old paintings could spin a different tale.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Spend an afternoon reading about quantum computing, and it won't take long until you stumble across the term “quantum supremacy.” While this is quite a lofty-sounding boast, the idea is relatively simple: If a a quantum computer—with its useful qubits in superposition—can do calculations that would be impossible (or hugely impractical) for a classical supercomputer to do, it has achieved quantum supremacy. 

Google first tried to claim the supremacy crown back in 2019, and researchers in China argued the same a year later. But in both cases, experts weren't so sure if true supremacy had been achieved. In Google's case, its Sycamore quantum computer completed a task in three minutes and 20 seconds that the company said would take a classical computer 10,000 years to complete. 

However, in 2024, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in China completed the task in 14 seconds using an impressively-powerful-but-undeniably-classical supercomputer. 

As New Scientist notes, proving supremacy is notoriously difficult because you need to be sure that classical algorithms could never solve the task placed upon the quantum computer in question—and it seems that scientists at the University of Texas at Austin have finally pulled it off. 

In a study published on the preprint server arXiv, the U.S.-based research team led by scientists at UT Austin report that they've successfully demonstrated “unconditional separation” between quantum and classical computers. 

“A longstanding goal in quantum information science is to demonstrate quantum computations that cannot be feasibly reproduced on a classical computer,” the authors wrote. “We construct a task for which the most space-efficient classical algorithm provably requires between 62 and 382 bits of memory, and solve it using only 12 qubits[…]. This form of quantum advantage—which we call quantum information supremacy—represents a new benchmark in quantum computing, one that does not rely on unproven conjectures.”

In the experiment, the quantum computer used qubits made from ions and controlled by lasers. Instead of creating some immensely complex calculation, the researchers focused on something a bit smaller. The aim was to show that a quantum device could solve a task using significantly fewer qubits than a classical computer would use classical bits.

Assigning ends of the system the standard experimental nicknames of Alice and Bob, the task required Alice to create a quantum state and Bob measure that state to understand its properties. The quantum computer then optimized this procedure until Bob's output could be predicted before Alice revealed its state, reports to New Scientist state. 

While a quantum computer required only 12 qubits to complete this task, the authors noted that a classical computer would need somewhere between 62 and 382 bits to perform the same task—undeniable evidence of quantum information supremacy. 

“Unlike prior demonstrations of quantum advantage that rely on unproven complexity assumptions, our result is provable and permanent: no future development in classical algorithms can close this gap.” the authors wrote. 

Although this is good to know, scientists already had a sneaking suspicion that quantum computing would eventually outshine its classical counterpart due to the superposition properties of qubits. The real work moving forward will be building fault-tolerant quantum computers with more than 1,000 qubits—and, excitingly, things are progressing. 

In a paper published this week in the journal Nature, Harvard scientists successfully demonstrated a coherent 3,000 qubit computer with new methods of error correction.

With quantum supremacy verifiably achieved, the work continues to make the promise of these futuristic computers a reality.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A Construction Crew Was Renovating a Soccer Field—and Found the Bodies of 150 Ancient Roman Soldiers","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a68113623/vienna-roman-mass-grave-found/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 14:19:00 GMT","

“Everything points to the catastrophic end of a military operation.” Yikes.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When construction workers started churning up skeletal remains, a project to renovate a soccer field outside Vienna, Austria, morphed into an archaeological dig, and it wasn't long before experts realized this field was actually a major discovery in Roman warfare history. 

They dug up the remains of potentially 150 males aged between 20 and 30 years, hinting that a “catastrophic event in a military context” happening at the site at the end of the first century A.D. 

The discovery of a Roman mass grave—noteworthy in and of itself because the Romans practiced cremation in Europe until the third century A.D.—could be “evidence from the immediate history of the founding of Vienna,” according to a translated statement from the Wien Museum, which announced the discovery. 

The archaeologists, brought in by the Federal Monuments Office after the soccer field renovation project started unearthing human bones, discovered that an oval pit roughly 16 feet in diameter and less than two feet deep contained the remains of around 150 peoples—the team discovered 129 individuals, but due to the damage done by the excavation, experts believe the total number could be over 150. 

“The individuals were buried without any recognizable order or orientation,” museum officials wrote in the statement. “Many lay on their stomachs or sides, some adapted to the shape of the pit. The limbs were intertwined with those of other individuals. This indicates a hasty covering of the dead with earth, i.e. not an orderly burial.” 

With every individual examined a male, most between the age of 20 and 30 years, and in good health combined with the causes of death due to injuries from blunt and sharp weapons, including spears, daggers, swords, and iron bolts, “the variety of injuries indicates a battle and not an execution site.” 

With cremation burial common in the European Roman Empire, finds of Roman skeletons from this period are considered rare, leading to this being one of the most significant Roman war discoveries in Central Europe. 

“The creation of a mass grave without cremation of the dead suggests a large number of casualties in combination with a lack of time and resources,” the museum wrote. “The battle wounds, on the other hand, rule out the possibility of executions, such as a punishment for military cowardice. Instead, everything points to the catastrophic end of a military operation.”

Experts dated both the bones and the grave goods to more precisely pinpoint the find to the end of the first century A.D. While most of the dead were robbed of their weapons and equipment, the team still discovered a Roman iron dagger with inlays of silver wire, several scales of armor that show distinct differences from known varieties, the metal cheek piece of a Roman helmet, two iron spearheads (one stuck in a hip bone, mind you), and hobnails from shoes that were made with leather and studded with nails, a type of footwear used by Roman soldiers. 

The museum wrote that the dagger was instrumental in the dating because its style was in use from the middle of the first century A.D. to the beginning of the second century A.D. 

According to the museum statement, historical sources indicate that Germanic tribes had repeated battles with the Roman Empire near the end of the first century A.D., and some of these skirmishes were extremely costly for the Romans. On the opposing side, the evident victory may have led to the founding of Austria's capital city.

“The mass grave in Simmering is the first physical evidence of fighting form this period and indicates this location of a battle in the area of present-day Vienna,” the museum wrote. “The defeat attested here could therefore have been the immediate reason for the expansion of the formerly small military base into the legionary camp of Vindobona—less than seven kilometers [4.3 miles] from the site of the find. Hasenleitengasse may therefore mark the beginning of Vienna's urban history.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Black hole discovery confirms Einstein and Hawking were right","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095645.htm","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:29:25 GMT","

A decade ago, scientists first detected ripples in the fabric of space-time, called gravitational waves, from the collision of two black holes. Now, thanks to improved technology and a bit of luck, a newly detected black hole merger is providing the clearest evidence yet of how black holes work -- and, in the process, offering long-sought confirmation of fundamental predictions by Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.

The new measurements were made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with analyses led by astrophysicists Maximiliano Isi and Will Farr of the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics in New York City. The results reveal insights into the properties of black holes and the fundamental nature of space-time, hinting at how quantum physics and Einstein's general relativity fit together.

""This is the clearest view yet of the nature of black holes,"" says Isi, who is also an assistant professor at Columbia University. ""We've found some of the strongest evidence yet that astrophysical black holes are the black holes predicted from Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.""

The results were reported in a paper published September 10 in Physical Review Letters by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.

For massive stars, black holes are the final stage in their evolution. Black holes are so dense that even light cannot escape their gravity. When two black holes collide, the event distorts space itself, creating ripples in space-time that fan out across the universe, like sound waves ringing out from a struck bell.

Those space-deforming ripples, called gravitational waves, can tell scientists a great deal about the objects that created them. Just as a large iron bell makes different sounds than a smaller aluminum bell, the ""sound"" a black hole merger makes is specific to the properties of the black holes involved.

Scientists can detect gravitational waves with special instruments at observatories such as LIGO in the United States, Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan. These instruments carefully measure how long it takes a laser to travel a given path. As gravitational waves stretch and compress space-time, the length of the instrument, and thus the light's travel time, changes minutely. By measuring those tiny changes with great precision, scientists can use them to determine the black holes' characteristics.

The newly reported gravitational waves were found to be created by a merger that formed a black hole with the mass of 63 suns and spinning at 100 revolutions per second. The findings come 10 years after LIGO made the first black hole merger detection. Since that landmark discovery, improvements in equipment and techniques have enabled scientists to get a much clearer look at these space-shaking events.

""The new pair of black holes are almost twins to the historic first detection in 2015,"" Isi says. ""But the instruments are much better, so we're able to analyze the signal in ways that just weren't possible 10 years ago.""

With these new signals, Isi and his colleagues got a complete look at the collision from the moment the black holes first careened into each other until the final reverberations as the merged black hole settled into its new state, which happened only milliseconds after first contact.

Previously, the final reverberations were difficult to capture, as by that point, the ringing of the black hole would be very faint. As a result, scientists couldn't separate the ringing of the collision from that of the final black hole itself.

In 2021, Isi led a study showcasing a cutting-edge method that he, Farr and others developed to isolate certain frequencies -- or 'tones' -- using data from the 2015 black hole merger. This method proved powerful, but the 2015 measurements weren't clear enough to confirm key predictions about black holes. With the new, more precise measurements, though, Isi and his colleagues were more confident they had successfully isolated the milliseconds-long signal of the final, settled black hole. This enabled more unambiguous tests of the nature of black holes.

""Ten milliseconds sounds really short, but our instruments are so much better now that this is enough time for us to really analyze the ringing of the final black hole,"" Isi says. ""With this new detection, we have an exquisitely detailed view of the signal both before and after the black hole merger.""

The new observations allowed scientists to test a key conjecture dating back decades that black holes are fundamentally simple objects. In 1963, physicist Roy Kerr used Einstein's general relativity to mathematically describe black holes with one equation. The equation showed that astrophysical black holes can be described by just two characteristics: spin and mass. With the new, higher-quality data, the scientists were able to measure the frequency and duration of the ringing of the merged black hole more precisely than ever before. This allowed them to see that, indeed, the merged black hole is a simple object, described by just its mass and spin.

The observations were also used to test a foundational idea proposed by Stephen Hawking called Hawking's area theorem. It states that the size of a black hole's event horizon -- the line past which nothing, not even light, can return -- can only ever grow. Testing whether this theorem applies requires exceptional measurements of black holes before and after their merger. Following the first black hole merger detection in 2015, Hawking wondered if the merger signature could be used to confirm his theorem. At the time, no one thought it was possible.

By 2019, a year after Hawking's death, methods had improved enough that a first tentative confirmation came using techniques developed by Isi, Farr, and colleagues. With four times better resolution, the new data gives scientists much more confidence that Hawking's theorem is correct.

In confirming Hawking's theorem, the results also hint at connections to the second law of thermodynamics. This law states that a property that measures a system's disorder, known as entropy, must increase, or at least remain constant, over time. Understanding the thermodynamics of black holes could lead to advances in other areas of physics, including quantum gravity, which aims to merge general relativity with quantum physics.

""It's really profound that the size of a black hole's event horizon behaves like entropy,"" Isi says. ""It has very deep theoretical implications and means that some aspects of black holes can be used to mathematically probe the true nature of space and time.""

Many suspect that future black hole merger detections will only reveal more about the nature of these objects. In the next decade, detectors are expected to become 10 times more sensitive than today, allowing for more rigorous tests of black hole characteristics.

""Listening to the tones emitted by these black holes is our best hope for learning about the properties of the extreme space-times they produce,"" says Farr, who is also a professor at Stony Brook University. ""And as we build more and better gravitational wave detectors, the precision will continue to improve.""

""For so long this field has been pure mathematical and theoretical speculation,"" Isi says. ""But now we're in a position of actually seeing these amazing processes in action, which highlights how much progress there's been -- and will continue to be -- in this field.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Heisenberg said it was impossible. Scientists just proved otherwise","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095633.htm","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 03:23:09 GMT","

Physicists in Australia and Britain have reshaped quantum uncertainty to sidestep the restriction imposed by the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle - a result that could underpin future ultra-precise sensor technology used in navigation, medicine and astronomy.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, introduced in 1927, says that you can't know certain pairs of properties - such as a particle's position and momentum - with unlimited precision at the same time. In other words, there is always a trade-off in uncertainty: the more closely one property is pinned down, the less certainty there is about the other.

In research published Sept. 24 in Science Advances, a team led by Dr Tingrei Tan from the University of Sydney Nano Institute and School of Physics has shown how to engineer a different trade-off to precisely measure position and momentum at the same time.

""Think of uncertainty like air in a balloon,"" said Dr Tan, a Sydney Horizon Fellow in the Faculty of Science. ""You can't remove it without popping the balloon, but you can squeeze it around to shift it. That's effectively what we've done. We push the unavoidable quantum uncertainty to places we don't care about (big, coarse jumps in position and momentum) so the fine details we do care about can be measured more precisely.""

The researchers also use the analogy of a clock to explain their findings (see image). Think of a normal clock with two hands: the hour hand and the minute hand. Now imagine the clock only has one hand. If it's the hour hand, you can tell what hour it is and roughly what minute, but the minute reading will be very imprecise. If the clock only has the minute hand, you can read the minutes very precisely, but you lose track of the larger context - specifically, which hour you're in. This 'modular' measurement sacrifices some global information in exchange for much finer detail.

""By applying this strategy in quantum systems, we can measure the changes in both position and momentum of a particle far more precisely,"" said first author Dr Christophe Valahu from the Quantum Control Laboratory team at the University of Sydney. ""We give up global information but gain the ability to detect tiny changes with unprecedented sensitivity.""

Quantum computing tools for a new sensing protocol

This strategy was outlined theoretically in 2017. Here, Dr Tan's team performed the first experimental demonstration by using a technological approach they had previously developed for error-corrected quantum computers, a result recently published in Nature Physics.

""It's a neat crossover from quantum computing to sensing,"" said co-author Professor Nicolas Menicucci, a theorist from RMIT University. ""Ideas first designed for robust quantum computers can be repurposed so that sensors pick up weaker signals without being drowned out by quantum noise.

The Sydney team implemented the sensing protocol using the tiny vibrational motion of a trapped ion - the quantum equivalent of a pendulum. They prepared the ion in ""grid states,"" a kind of quantum state originally developed for error-corrected quantum computing. With this, they showed that both position and momentum can be measured together with precision beyond the 'standard quantum limit' - the best achievable using only classical sensors.

""We haven't broken Heisenberg's principle. Our protocol works entirely within quantum mechanics,"" said Dr Ben Baragiola, co-author from RMIT. ""The scheme is optimised for small signals, where fine details matter more than coarse ones.

Why it matters

The ability to detect extremely small changes is important across science and technology. Ultra-precise quantum sensors could sharpen navigation in environments where GPS doesn't work (such as submarines, underground or spaceflight); enhance biological and medical imaging; monitor materials and gravitational systems; or probe fundamental physics.

While still at the laboratory stage, the experiment demonstrates a new framework for future sensing technologies targeted towards measuring tiny signals. Rather than replacing existing approaches, it adds a complementary tool to the quantum-sensing toolbox.

""Just as atomic clocks transformed navigation and telecommunications, quantum-enhanced sensors with extreme sensitivity could enable whole new industries,"" said Dr Valahu.

A collaborative effort

This project united experimentalists at the University of Sydney with theorists at RMIT, the University of Melbourne, Macquarie University and the University of Bristol in Britain. It shows how collaboration across institutions and borders can accelerate progress and strengthen Australia's quantum research community.

""This work highlights the power of collaboration and the international connections that drive discovery,"" Dr Tan said.

When a woman becomes pregnant, the outcome of that pregnancy depends on many things -- including a crucial event that happened while she was still growing inside her own mother's womb. It depends on the quality of the egg cells that were already forming inside her fetal ovaries. The DNA-containing chromosomes in those cells must be cut, spliced and sorted perfectly. In males, the same process produces sperm in the testes but occurs only after puberty.

""If that goes wrong, then you end up with the wrong number of chromosomes in the eggs or sperm,"" said Neil Hunter, a professor in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of California, Davis. ""This can result in infertility, miscarriage or the birth of children with genetic diseases.""

In a paper published Sept. 24 in the journal Nature, Hunter's team reports a major new discovery about a process that helps safeguard against these mistakes. He has pieced together the choreography of proteins that connect matching chromosome pairs -- ensuring that they are sorted correctly as egg and sperm cells develop and divide.

Hunter's discoveries required methods to watch the molecular events of chromosome recombination unfold with unprecedented detail. This involved genetic engineering in budding yeast -- a model organism that has been used for decades to discover how fundamental cellular processes work.

""The chromosome structures that we studied have changed very little across evolution,"" Hunter said. ""Every protein that we looked at in yeast has a direct counterpart in humans."" His findings could improve our understanding of fertility problems and how they are diagnosed and treated in humans.

Forming chromosome crossovers for strong connections

Humans have 46 chromosomes in each of our cells, made up of 23 pairs of matching, ""homologous"" chromosomes, with one of each pair inherited from each parent. Early in the process of making sperm or eggs, those chromosome pairs line up, and the parental chromosomes break and rejoin to each other. These chromosome exchanges, called ""crossovers,"" serve two important functions.

First, they help ensure that each chromosome that is passed on to the offspring contains a unique mixture of genes from both parents. Crossovers also keep the chromosomes connected in matching pairs. These connections guide the distribution of chromosomes when cells divide to produce eggs and sperm. Maintaining crossover connections is especially crucial in females, Hunter said.

As chromosomes pair up in developing egg or sperm cells, matching DNA strands are exchanged and twined together over a short distance to form a structure called a ""double Holliday junction."" DNA strands of this structure are then cut to join the chromosomes forming a crossover.

In males, developing immature sperm cells then immediately divide and distribute chromosomes to the sperm. In contrast, egg cells developing in the fetal ovary arrest their development after crossovers have formed. The immature egg cells can remain in suspended animation for decades after birth, until they are activated to undergo ovulation.

Only then does the process lurch back into motion: The egg cell finally divides, and the chromosome pairs that were connected by crossovers are finally separated to deliver a single set of chromosomes to the mature egg. ""Maintaining the crossover connections over many years is a major challenge for immature egg cells,"" Hunter said.

If chromosome pairs aren't connected by at least one crossover, they can lose contact with each other, like two people separated in a jostling crowd. This causes them to segregate incorrectly when the cell finally divides, producing egg cells with extra or missing chromosomes. This can cause infertility, miscarriage or genetic conditions such as Down syndrome, in which a child is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to cognitive impairment, heart defects, hearing loss and other problems.

From yeast to humans

Hunter has spent years trying to understand how crossovers form and how this process can fail and cause reproductive problems. By studying this process in yeast, researchers can directly visualize molecular events of double-Holliday junction resolution in synchronized populations of cells.

Researchers have identified dozens of proteins that bind and process these junctions. Hunter and then-postdoctoral fellow Shangming Tang (now an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Virginia) used a technique called ""real-time genetics"" to investigate the function of those proteins. With this method, they made cells degrade one or more specific proteins within the junction-associated structures. They could then analyze the DNA from these cells, to see whether the junctions were resolved and if they formed crossovers. In this way, they built up a picture in which a network of proteins function together to ensure that crossovers are formed.

""This strategy allowed us to answer a question that previously wasn't possible,"" Hunter said.

They identified key proteins such as cohesin that prevent an enzyme called the STR complex (or Bloom complex in humans) from inappropriately dismantling the junctions before they can form crossovers.

""They protect the double Holliday junction,"" Hunter said. ""That is a key discovery.""

This years-long research project in yeast is broadly relevant for human reproduction because the process has changed very little during evolution. Failure to protect double-Holliday junctions may be linked to fertility problems in humans.

In addition to Tang, the postdoc, seven undergraduates in the UC Davis College of Biological Sciences contributed to this work, including Jennifer Koo, Mohammad Pourhosseinzadeh, Emerald Nguyen, Natalie Liu, Christopher Ma, Hanyu Lu and Monica Lee.

Additional authors on the paper include Sara Hariri, Regina Bohn and John E. McCarthy, all members of the Hunter lab.

Hunter's research is funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. His work has also received funding from the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, the American Cancer Society, the Concern Foundation for Cancer Research, and the Damon Runyon Cancer Foundation.

Hunter's research on crossover and homologous recombination uses advanced scientific facilities at the university's Proteomics Core Facility, MCB Light Microscopy Imaging Facility, Genome Center, Mouse Biology Program, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center.

After the formation of the Solar System, it took a maximum of three million years for the chemical composition of the Earth's precursor to be completed. This is shown by a new study by the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern. At this time, however, there were hardly any elements necessary for life such as water or carbon compounds on the young planet. Only a later planetary collision probably brought water to Earth, paving the way for life.

Earth is so far the only known planet on which life exists -- with liquid water and a stable atmosphere. However, the conditions were not conducive to life when it formed. The gas-dust cloud from which all the planets in the Solar System formed was rich in volatile elements essential for life, such as hydrogen, carbon and sulphur. However, in the inner Solar System -- the part closest to the Sun, where the four rocky planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars and the asteroid belt are located today -- these volatile elements could hardly exist: Due to the high temperature of the Sun, they did not condense and initially remained largely in the gas phase. As these gaseous substances were not incorporated into the solid rocky materials from which the planets were formed, the early precursor of the Earth, the so-called proto-Earth, also contained very little of these vital substances. Only celestial bodies that formed further away from the Sun in cooler regions were able to incorporate these components. When and how the Earth became a life-friendly planet is still not fully understood.

In a new study, researchers from the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern have now been able to show for the first time that the chemical composition of the early Earth was complete no later than three million years after the formation of the Solar System -- and in a way that initially made the emergence of life impossible. Their results, recently published in the journal Science Advances, suggest that life on Earth was only made possible by a later event. Dr. Pascal Kruttasch is first author of the study, which was part of his dissertation at the Institute of Geological Sciences and was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Kruttasch is now an SNSF Postdoc Mobility Fellow at Imperial College London.

Using a precise clock to measure the history of the Earth's formation

The research team used a combination of isotope and element data from meteorites and terrestrial rocks to reconstruct the process of the Earth's formation. Using model calculations, the researchers were able to narrow down in time how the chemical composition of the Earth developed in comparison to other planetary building blocks.

Kruttasch explains: ""A high-precision time measurement system based on the radioactive decay of manganese-53 was used to determine the precise age. This isotope was present in the early Solar System and decayed to chromium-53 with a half-life of around 3.8 million years."" This method allowed ages to be determined with an accuracy of less than one million years for materials that are several billion years old. ""These measurements were only possible because the University of Bern has internationally recognized expertise and infrastructure for the analysis of extraterrestrial materials and is a leader in the field of isotope geochemistry,"" says co-author Klaus Mezger, Professor Emeritus of Geochemistry at the Institute of Geological Sciences at the University of Bern.

Life on Earth thanks to a cosmic coincidence?

Using model calculations, the research team was able to show that the chemical signature of the proto-Earth, i.e. the unique pattern of chemical substances of which it is composed, was already complete less than three million years after the formation of the Solar System. Their study thus provides empirical data on the time of formation of the original material of the young Earth. ""Our Solar System formed around 4,568 million years ago. Considering that it only took up to 3 million years to determine the chemical properties of the Earth, this is surprisingly fast,"" says first author Kruttasch.

The results of the study thus support the assumption that a later collision with another planet -- Theia -- brought the decisive turning point and made the Earth a life-friendly planet. Theia probably formed further out in the Solar System, where volatile substances such as water accumulated. ""Thanks to our results, we know that the proto-Earth was initially a dry rocky planet. It can therefore be assumed that it was only the collision with Theia that brought volatile elements to Earth and ultimately made life possible there,"" says Kruttasch.

Life-friendliness in the universe cannot be taken for granted

The new study contributes significantly to our understanding of the processes in the early phase of the Solar System and provides clues as to when and how planets on which life is possible can form. ""The Earth does not owe its current life-friendliness to a continuous development, but probably to a chance event -- the late impact of a foreign, water-rich body. This makes it clear that life-friendliness in the universe is anything but a matter of course,"" says Mezger.

The next step would be to investigate the collision event between proto-Earth and Theia in more detail. ""So far, this collision event is insufficiently understood. Models are needed that can fully explain not only the physical properties of the Earth and Moon, but also their chemical composition and isotope signatures,"" concludes Kruttasch.

They were the first generation of Americans to grow up with ultra-processed foods all around them - products typically loaded with extra fat, salt, sugar and flavorings. They were children and young adults at a time when such products, designed to maximize their appeal, proliferated.

Now, a study shows, 21% of women and 10% of men in Generation X and the tail end of the Baby Boom generation, now in their 50s and early 60s, meet criteria for addiction to these ultra-processed foods.

That rate is far higher than it is among adults who grew up just a decade or two earlier, and only encountered ultra-processed foods in adulthood. Among adults age 65 to 80, just 12% of women and 4% of men meet criteria for ultra-processed food addiction.

The study, published in the journal Addiction by a team from the University of Michigan, is based on nationally representative data from more than 2,000 older Americans surveyed by the U-M National Poll on Healthy Aging.

The poll is based at the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation and supported by Michigan Medicine, U-M's academic medical center. The new paper builds on a previous poll report by diving deeper into generational differences and correlations with health.

Measuring food addiction in an under-studied group

The researchers used the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0), a standardized tool adapted from the criteria used to diagnose substance use disorders. The scale asks about 13 experiences with ultraprocessed foods and drinks that define addiction, such as strong cravings, repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down, withdrawal symptoms, and avoiding social activities because of fear of overeating.

In this case, the ""substance"" is not alcohol or nicotine, but highly rewarding ultra-processed foods such as sweets, fast food, and sugary beverages. By applying clinical addiction criteria to ultra-processed foods, the study highlights the ways in which such foods can ""hook"" people.

""We hope this study fills a gap in knowledge about addiction to ultra-processed foods among older adults, as measured by a well-studied and standardized scale,"" said Lucy K. Loch, a graduate student in the U-M Department of Psychology. ""Today's older adults were in a key developmental period when our nation's food environment changed. With other research showing clear links between consumption of these foods and risk of chronic disease and premature death, it's important to study addiction to ultra-processed foods in this age group.""

Differences by gender

Unlike traditional substance use disorders -- which historically have been more common in older men -- ultra-processed food addiction shows the opposite pattern: higher prevalence in older women.

One explanation may be the aggressive marketing of ""diet"" ultra-processed food to women in the 1980s.

Low-fat cookies, microwaveable meals, and other carbohydrate-heavy products were promoted as weight-control solutions, but their engineered nutrient profiles may have reinforced addictive eating patterns.

Women now aged 50 to 64 may have been exposed to ultraprocessed foods during a sensitive developmental window, which may help explain the poll's findings for this age group, said senior author Ashley Gearhardt, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at U-M and member of IHPI. Gearhardt leads the U-M Food and Addiction Science & Treatment Lab.

""The percentages we see in these data far outpace the percentages of older adults with problematic use of other addictive substances, such as alcohol and tobacco,"" said Gearhardt. ""We also see a clear association with health and social isolation, with much higher risks of ultra-processed food addiction in those who call their mental or physical health status fair or poor, or say they sometimes or often feel isolated from others.""

Key findings related to overweight, health status and social isolation

The researchers suggest that individuals who perceive themselves as overweight may be particularly vulnerable to ""health-washed"" ultra-processed foods - those marketed as low-fat, low-calorie, high-protein or high-fiber, but still formulated to amplify their appeal and maximize craving.

""These products are sold as health foods - which can be especially problematic for those trying to reduce the number of calories they consume,"" Gearhardt said. ""This especially affects women, because of the societal pressure around weight.""

Looking Ahead

The generation of older adults now in their 50s and early 60s is the first to live most of their lifespan in a food environment dominated by ultra-processed foods, Geahardt noted.

""These findings raise urgent questions about whether there are critical developmental windows when exposure to ultra-processed foods is especially risky for addiction vulnerability,"" she said. ""Children and adolescents today consume even higher proportions of calories from ultra-processed foods than today's middle-aged adults did in their youth. If current trends continue, future generations may show even higher rates of ultra-processed food addiction later in life.""

She added, ""Just as with other substances, intervening early may be essential to reducing long-term addiction risk across the lifespan.""

The study was funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (DGE-2241144) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health (5R01DA055027).

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects over half a billion people worldwide. Current pharmacologic treatments offer limited efficacy and carry substantial risks, warranting the development of safe and effective alternatives. This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of VER-01 in CLBP. It enrolled 820 adults with CLBP (VER-01, n = 394; placebo, n = 426) and included a double-blind 12-week treatment phase (phase A), a 6-month open-label extension (phase B), followed by either a 6-month continuation (phase C) or randomized withdrawal (phase D). The primary endpoint of phase A was a change in mean numeric rating scale (NRS) pain intensity, with a change in total neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI) score as a key secondary endpoint in participants with a neuropathic pain component (PainDETECT > 18). The primary endpoint for phase D was time to treatment failure. The study met its primary endpoint in phase A, with a mean pain reduction of −1.9 NRS points in the VER-01 group (mean difference (MD) versus placebo = −0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.9 to −0.3; P < 0.001). Pain further decreased to −2.9 NRS points in phase B, with effects sustained through phase C. The study also met its key secondary endpoint of phase A, with a mean NPSI decrease of −14.4 (standard error, 3.3) points from baseline in the VER-01 arm (MD versus placebo = −7.3, 95% CI = −13.2 to −1.3; P = 0.017). Although phase D did not meet its primary endpoint (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.44–1.27; P = 0.288), pain increased significantly more with placebo upon withdrawal (MD = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.0–1.0; P = 0.034). In phase A, the incidence of adverse events—mostly mild to moderate and transient—was higher with VER-01 than with placebo (83.3% versus 67.3%; P < 0.001). VER-01 was well-tolerated, with no signs of dependence or withdrawal. VER-01 shows potential as a new, safe and effective treatment for CLBP. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04940741.

With over half a billion prevalent cases in 2020, low back pain is globally the leading cause for work loss, disability and reduced quality of life across all ages and in both sexes1,2. Low back pain is a mixed pain condition with nociceptive, nociplastic and neuropathic pain characteristics3. When pain persists for more than 3 months, it is defined as chronic low back pain (CLBP). CLBP is often associated with severe impairments in sleep quality and physical function, which further contribute to the overall disease burden4,5. The treatment of CLBP involves a multimodal treatment approach combining pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, the latter including physical activity, exercise and physiotherapy6,7,8,9,10.

Pharmacological treatment options include the short-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, NSAIDs are not suitable for long-term treatment due to severe side effects, including gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding and an increased risk for cardiovascular events11,12. For patients requiring long-term analgesic treatment, opioids are frequently used, despite severe side effects and safety concerns. Approximately 20% of patients on long-term therapy experience opioid abuse, dependence, tolerance development and withdrawal symptoms13. The widespread use of opioids for CLBP combined with their high risk for dependence, misuse and fatal overdoses has substantially contributed to the global opioid epidemic, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide14,15. Accordingly, several clinical practice guidelines now advise against the use of opioids6,7, and there is widespread consensus among healthcare professionals, patient organizations and regulators on the urgent need to develop new nonaddictive analgesics for the short- and long-term treatment of CLBP with a superior safety profile. The limitations of existing treatments and the stagnation in the development of new analgesics have fueled growing public and scientific interest in the use of cannabis-based medicines for the management of chronic pain. However, the quality of evidence supporting the clinical use of cannabis-based products remains low, primarily due to small sample sizes, short treatment durations, inconsistent dosing regimens, heterogeneous outcome measures and variability across cannabis-based preparations16,17,18,19.

As naturally occurring botanical substances, cannabis plants exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Variability in the botanical raw material and manufacturing processes contributes to a substantial variety of product compositions, including levels of bioactive constituents20,21. Consequently, findings obtained with one cannabis extract cannot be extrapolated to others without appropriate comparative data. To ensure reproducible results, it is therefore essential to adequately characterize the investigational product and establish consistency across batches.

The investigational product VER-01 was comprehensively characterized using chromatographic and spectrometric methods to quantify cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, carotenes, phytosterols, vitamins and fats, and chromatographic fingerprinting confirmed batch-to-batch consistency across multiple lots of VER-01. By providing a large-scale, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of adequate duration using a chemically well-defined, full-spectrum cannabis extract in CLBP, this study addresses a critical gap in the clinical research of cannabis-based pharmacotherapy in chronic pain.

Between 7 July 2021 and 30 June 2023, 1,157 patients were assessed for eligibility and 820 participants were randomly assigned to VER-01 (n = 394) or placebo (n = 426; Fig. 1). A total of 525 participants continued to phase B, 155 continued to phase C and 116 participants were randomly assigned to VER-01 (n = 52) or placebo (n = 64) in phase D (Figs. 1 and 2). A total of 815 participants were included in the efficacy analysis of phase A, whereas 116 participants were included in that of phase D. The last visit of the study was on 26 March 2024.

The efficacy, safety and tolerability analyses included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of the study medication during the respective study phase.

Overall, the two groups in phase A were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics (Table 1). A total of 180 participants (22.0%) had a neuropathic pain component, and 193 (23.5%) were suffering from severe pain (numeric rating scale (NRS) ≥ 7) at baseline. A total of 461 participants (56.6%) were female, with a mean age of 52 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 29 kg m−2, showing no notable differences between the two groups. Baseline characteristics of participants with a neuropathic pain component were consistent across both treatment groups and matched those of all participants. Additionally, the demographics and baseline characteristics of participants in phases B, C and D were similar to those in phase A (Extended Data Tables 1–3). The most frequent concurrent diseases were hypertension (35.3%) and obesity (32.0%). In total, 99% of patients reported prior use of analgesics, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs being the most frequently reported medication (96.7%). The proportion of participants with at least two prior optimized analgesic therapies was balanced between arms, with 95.4% in the VER-01 arm and 94.8% in the placebo arm.

Pain intensity at baseline was moderate to severe in both groups, with a mean NRS pain intensity of 6.1 (s.d. = 1.2) for VER-01 and 6.0 (s.d. = 1.2) for placebo.

The study met its primary endpoint in phase A. Mean pain intensity significantly decreased from baseline by −1.9 (s.e. = 0.2) NRS points in the VER-01 arm compared to −1.4 (s.e. = 0.2) in the placebo arm. VER-01 demonstrated a greater pain reduction compared to placebo with a mean difference (MD) of −0.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.9 to −0.3; P < 0.001). The difference between VER-01 and placebo was significantly in favor of VER-01 in every single study week of the 12-week treatment phase, showing consistent improvement over time (Fig. 3a). Sensitivity analyses using both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) imputation yielded similar results to the primary analysis and remained statistically significant (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Post hoc analysis revealed no statistical interaction between treatment and sex (Supplementary Table 4).

The difference between VER-01 and placebo was even more pronounced in participants with a neuropathic pain component (MD = −1.5, 95% CI = −2.2 to −0.9; P < 0.001). Moreover, post hoc analyses revealed particularly pronounced effects of VER-01 in participants with severe pain (MD = −1.0, 95% CI = −1.8 to −0.1; P = 0.011).

The study also met its key secondary endpoint in phase A, with significant improvements in neuropathic symptoms (as measured by the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)) among participants with a PainDETECT score >18 at baseline. The mean NPSI total scores at baseline were comparable between groups, with 47.1 (s.d. = 17.2) for VER-01 and 48.7 (s.d. = 16.4) for placebo. The mean NPSI total score decreased by −14.4 (s.e. = 3.3) points from baseline in the VER-01 arm compared to −7.2 (s.e. = 2.8) in the placebo arm, with an MD of −7.3 (95% CI = −13.2 to −1.3; P = 0.017). The difference between VER-01 and placebo was significantly in favor of VER-01 for every single visit of the treatment phase, showing consistent improvement over time (Fig. 3b). Compared to placebo, VER-01 reduced superficial spontaneous pain (MD = −1.3, 95% CI = −2.4 to −0.3; P = 0.015), deep spontaneous pain (MD = −1.2, 95% CI = −2.2 to −0.3; P = 0.001), evoked pain (MD = −1.14, 95% CI = −1.9 to −0.4; P = 0.003) and abnormal sensations (MD = −1.29, 95% CI = −2.2 to −0.4; P = 0.006).

The results of the primary and key secondary endpoints were further supported by all secondary efficacy endpoints (Table 2). The rate of participants with a ≥30% pain reduction was significantly higher for VER-01 compared to placebo (54.1% versus 39.5%), resulting in a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 6.8 (95% CI = 4.42–15.05; P < 0.001). Similarly, the rate of participants with a ≥50% pain reduction (32.2% versus 22.8%; P = 0.010) and a ≥2-point pain reduction (46.9% versus 35.6%; P = 0.001) was significantly higher in the VER-01 arm. Moreover, participants in the VER-01 arm took only about half the amount of rescue medication compared to participants in the placebo arm (mean (s.d.) = 10.5 (14.2) versus 18.3 (53.8) ibuprofen tablets; P < 0.001).

Additionally, participants in the VER-01 group reported significant improvements in both sleep quality and physical function. Sleep quality improved by −2.2 NRS points in the VER-01 arm compared to −1.5 in the placebo arm, with an MD of −0.7 NRS points (95% CI, −1.0 to −0.3; P < 0.001). Change from baseline (CFB) in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) total score was also significantly in favor of VER-01, with −3.1 (4.0) versus −2.0 (4.1) points (MD = −1.1, 95% CI = −1.8 to −1.1; P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed that 51.7% of participants in the VER-01 arm achieved an improvement of the RMDQ score by at least 30% from baseline compared to 42.2% in the placebo arm (P = 0.019).

Improvements in pain intensity, sleep quality and physical function were associated with elevated quality of life and a positive global impression of change. The physical health component summary (PCS) score of the short-form 36 (SF-36) improved by 5.9 points in the VER-01 arm compared to 3.7 in the placebo arm, with an MD of 2.1 (95% CI = 1.0–3.2; P < 0.001). In total, 45.1% of participants in the VER-01 group reported an improvement in symptoms on the patient global impression of change (PGIC) scale compared to 23.4% in the placebo group, resulting in an NNTB of 4.6 (95% CI = 3.43–6.99; P < 0.001).

Participants experienced further reductions in NRS pain intensity during the 6-month treatment period of phase B, with a decrease of 3 points compared to the phase A baseline (s.d. = 2.1; Fig. 3a). The percentage of participants experiencing a ≥30% reduction in pain further increased to 73.9%, while the percentage for those achieving a ≥50% pain reduction increased to 51.8%. In addition, participants reported further improvements in physical function, sleep quality and quality of life (Extended Data Table 4). Participants who completed phase B and participated in phase C were able to maintain their pain reduction over an additional 6-month period (Supplementary Fig. 1). There were no signs of diminishing efficacy or dose escalation over time (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Tables 5–8).

Time to treatment failure did not differ significantly between VER-01 and placebo in phase D (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.44–1.27; P = 0.288), with median times of 22 days for VER-01 and 11 days for placebo. However, following withdrawal, participants receiving placebo experienced a significant pain increase from the phase D baseline compared to VER-01 (MD = 0.5, s.d. = 0.24; P = 0.034; Fig. 3d).

In phase A, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 83.3% of participants in the VER-01 group, compared to 67.3% in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) was comparable between VER-01 and placebo (6.2% versus 6.8%; P = 0.699; Table 3). The most common TEAEs (≥10% of participants in the VER-01 arm) were dizziness, headache, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, nausea, COVID-19, dry mouth and somnolence (Table 3). Rates of headache (VER-01 = 15.9% versus placebo = 12.5%; P = 0.160), nasopharyngitis (11.0% versus 14.8%; P = 0.107) and COVID-19 (11.0% versus 8.5%; P = 0.218) were similar between the groups, whereas dizziness (42.8% versus 5.2%), fatigue (15.1% versus 5.2%), nausea (16.4% versus 3.8%), dry mouth (13.1% versus 3.8%) and somnolence (11.8% versus 0.7%) were more frequent with VER-01 (P < 0.001 for all). Most TEAEs for VER-01 were of mild-to-moderate intensity (94%). The incidence of drug-related TEAEs decreased over the course of the treatment period of phase A, converging toward a weekly incidence below 3% (Supplementary Table 8). Discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 17.3% of participants receiving VER-01, compared to 3.5% in the placebo (P < 0.001), most commonly due to dizziness, somnolence and nausea. Statistical comparisons of adverse event (AE) incidences were conducted post hoc.

No deaths occurred during the study, and no clinically important treatment-related changes were observed for VER-01 in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs or electrocardiograms (ECGs) when compared to placebo or throughout the study.

At the end of phase A, 68% of participants were satisfied with the tolerability of the treatment in the VER-01 arm compared to 79% in the placebo arm. Satisfaction with tolerability further increased during open-label, long-term treatment, reaching 83% at the end of phase B and 84% at the end of phase C.

No AEs indicative of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal, as classified under the respective standardized MedDRA queries, were reported (Supplementary Tables 5 and 9). Furthermore, there were no signs of drug abuse based on urine drug tests and the addiction behavior checklist (ABC), and no participant fulfilled the classification criteria for substance dependence according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). There were no withdrawal symptoms as measured with the cannabis withdrawal scale (CWS) after abrupt treatment discontinuation in phase D. The daily total intensity score and daily total functional impairment score of the CWS were comparable between VER-01 and placebo) Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). A pooled analysis of TEAEs for all study phases is provided in Supplementary Tables 5–7.

The results of the VER-CLBP-001 trial demonstrate that VER-01 provides meaningful pain reduction compared to the placebo, accompanied by distinct improvements in physical function and sleep quality, two key factors that contribute to participants perceiving the effects of VER-01 as clinically meaningful. Additionally, participants in the VER-01 arm required substantially lower rescue medication use less rescue medication. These results are of high clinical relevance, as substantiated by a significantly higher proportion of participants randomized to VER-01 achieving well-recognized thresholds of meaningful pain relief, including a ≥30% and ≥50% pain reduction, as well as a ≥2-point decrease on the 11-point NRS22,23.

Notably, the NNTB for achieving a ≥30% pain response was 6.8, substantially below the widely accepted clinical relevance threshold of NNTB ≤10 in pain research and below the NNTB = 9 achieved with opioids in CLBP24,25,26. Moreover, significantly more participants in the VER-01 group reported a meaningful improvement in symptoms on the PGIC scale compared to the placebo group, an important indicator of the clinical relevance of treatment effects as recognized by the European Medicines Agency guideline on pain27.

Importantly, prolonged treatment with VER-01 was associated with further reductions in pain intensity, as well as continued improvements in physical function, sleep quality and health-related quality of life. Notably, the treatment effect was even more pronounced in participants with a neuropathic pain component and those with severe pain at baseline.

VER-01 was generally well-tolerated, particularly during long-term use. AEs, including those leading to early discontinuation in the VER-01 arm, were predominantly mild to moderate, with an overall intensity comparable to placebo. Most AEs associated with VER-01 were observed during the initial titration phase, were self-limiting and declined markedly within the first few days of treatment, suggesting a rapid onset of sustained tolerability. With 17%, the rate of AE-related discontinuations was higher than with placebo but below those reported for opioids in comparable study designs, with early discontinuations mainly seen in the titration phase28,29,30. Nature and timing of AE-related discontinuations suggest that physicians should advise patients that transient sensations of dizziness, somnolence and nausea may occur in the early titration phase to support treatment adherence. The overall rate of SAEs was comparable to placebo, and there were no signs of dose escalation, abuse, dependence or withdrawal.

These results are particularly relevant given the substantial unmet medical need in CLBP, where many patients remain inadequately treated due to the inherent limitations of current pharmacological options, primarily NSAIDs and opioids. NSAIDs are unsuitable for long-term use due to severe gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks11,12, while opioids are associated with a high risk of addiction, tolerance development, withdrawal symptoms and have a major role in the global opioid crisis13,14,15,31. Against this background, VER-01 presents a promising new nonaddictive, safe and effective treatment option, particularly for long-term use.

Another important advantage of VER-01 over existing pharmacotherapies is its ability to significantly improve sleep quality and physical function. Chronic pain, particularly CLBP, is often associated with severe impairments in these domains, which not only diminish quality of life but also contribute to persistent pain and disease progression. Physical disability in CLBP is perpetuated by a vicious cycle of pain, stiffness and fear of movement, leading to progressive functional decline and reduced mobility32. Without effective intervention, this cycle reinforces long-term disability and further limits treatment success. Likewise, sleep disturbances are not merely a secondary symptom of pain but a key contributor to disease progression. Poor sleep exacerbates inflammation, reduces pain tolerance and leads to greater pain severity and prolonged pain duration. As a result, patients with disrupted sleep often experience greater disability, more persistent pain and a higher prevalence of comorbid depression33,34. Given these interdependent factors, addressing not only pain but also improving physical function and sleep quality is essential for the effective management of CLBP. Recent meta-analyses have shown that existing pharmacotherapies, including NSAIDs and opioids, have only a small and unlikely clinically relevant effect in these domains, highlighting a major gap in current treatment options35,36. By demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements not only in pain but also in physical function and sleep quality, VER-01 represents a promising therapeutic advance that directly targets the multifaceted burden of CLBP.

Notably, there remains a lack of rigorously designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of standardized cannabis-based products in well-defined pain conditions, with well-defined dosing regimens and sufficiently long treatment durations. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial addresses these gaps and contributes valuable evidence to the field, underscoring the importance of advancing the clinical understanding and therapeutic potential of full-spectrum cannabis extracts.

Some limitations of this study merit consideration. First, VER-01 was not directly compared with opioids; however, a dedicated follow-up study, evaluating VER-01 against standard opioid therapy, has already been conducted and will be published separately37. Second, a formal blinding questionnaire was not administered and prior cannabis experience was not recorded, but multiple indicators support successful blinding—the magnitude of the placebo response closely mirrors that observed in other blinded, randomized, controlled CLBP trials28,29, and both treatment arms exhibited a similar, rapid NRS pain decline during the titration period. Furthermore, the nature of AEs was similar between groups, and no instances of unintentional unblinding were reported. Another limitation is that cognitive function was not formally assessed. Although there were no patient reports indicative of impairment, future studies involving cannabinoids might consider incorporating specific cognitive assessments.

Finally, while the difference in time to treatment failure in phase D did not reach statistical significance, the observed trend strongly favors VER-01 with a hazard ratio of 0.75 (P = 0.288). The use of time to treatment failure as the primary endpoint to assess maintenance of efficacy represented a novel approach in CLBP, which led to uncertainty in estimating an appropriate sample size. However, the magnitude and direction of the effect, as well as the significantly larger pain increase among patients receiving placebo following withdrawal (MD = 0.5; P = 0.034), suggest that the lack of statistical significance in phase D reflects insufficient power rather than waning efficacy.

In conclusion, this phase 3 study provides robust evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of VER-01 in the treatment of CLBP. These findings highlight the importance of further research with VER-01 in other chronic pain conditions and suggest that VER-01 could play an important role in modern pain management.

This trial investigated the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of VER-01, following the recommendations of the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration pain guidelines27,38. The trial was divided into four phases (Fig. 2). Phase A had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with 1 week of run-in to assess baseline pain intensity, followed by 3 weeks of titration and 12 weeks of treatment. Phase B followed phase A and had a single-arm, open-label design with a 3-week titration period and a 6-month treatment period. All participants entering phase B underwent retitration, as blinding was maintained for phase A throughout the entire study. Participants completing phase B entered either phase C or D. Phase C had a single-arm, open-label design with a 6-month treatment period. Phase D had a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal design with 4 weeks of treatment followed by 2 weeks of washout. The trial was conducted at 66 outpatient sites and university-based hospitals in Germany and Austria in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization and applicable regulatory requirements. The trial was approved by ethics committees in each country (Supplementary Table 15), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. No compensation was offered for participation in the study, except for reimbursement of meals and travel expenses. The trial was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04940741) and EudraCT (2020-000107-36).

Patients were primarily recruited via notices in doctors' offices, adverts in magazines and online advertising. Additionally, investigators participating in the study recruited patients from their existing databases. This study enrolled individuals who were at least 18 years of age and diagnosed with CLBP (low back pain for at least 3 months), with or without a neuropathic pain component. Individuals were only included if no treatable specific somatic cause for their CLBP was identified (for example, herniated vertebral disk) based on a detailed medical history assessment and a clinical examination. The presence of a neuropathic pain component at baseline was confirmed using the painDETECT questionnaire with a cut-off score >18 (ref. 39). Eligible individuals must have had, on average, a pain score of at least 4 points on an 11-point NRS 1 month before enrollment and during the run-in period. Individuals were eligible if drug treatment was indicated and previous optimized treatments with nonopioid analgesics (for example, ibuprofen, diclofenac and metamizol) did not lead to sufficient pain relief or were unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance. Treatment was considered optimized when further dose escalation was medically inadvisable due to potential adverse effects or when it was unlikely that a higher dose would offer additional therapeutic benefit.

Participants were allowed to continue nondrug therapies for CLBP if these were maintained unchanged for at least 8 weeks before enrollment and if patients were willing to continue their therapy during phase A.

Participants were eligible for inclusion into phase B if they had successfully completed phase A. Participants completing phase B were eligible for inclusion in phase D if they had a clinically meaningful reduction in NRS pain scores (≥30%) at the end of phase B compared to baseline of phase A. Participants not meeting inclusion criteria for phase D were eligible for enrollment in phase C.

Participants were excluded if they had other painful comorbidities potentially interfering with their low back pain rating, a severe mental illness (for example, psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), or a history of alcohol, drug or medication abuse. Moreover, participants who had used cannabis-based medicinal products within 30 days before screening were excluded. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Note—Eligibility criteria.

The investigational product VER-01 is a standardized full-spectrum extract derived from the patented Cannabis sativa L. strain DKJ127. The botanical raw material of VER-01 consists of the unfragmented, dried C. sativa DKJ127 L. flowers. The full-spectrum extract of the botanical raw material is manufactured in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certified facility and standardized to 5% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

Each dose unit (119 µl) of the finished product VER-01 contains 50 µl of the full-spectrum extract, delivering 2.5 mg THC, 0.1 mg cannabigerol and 0.02 mg cannabidiol, with sesame oil as excipient.

Moreover, VER-01 contains a complex, well-characterized mixture of terpenes, flavonoids, carotenes, phytosterols and other bioactive compounds.

The placebo contained sesame oil, cannabis aroma and colorants to mimic the appearance and sensory characteristics of VER-01.

The study products were provided in 30 ml amber glass bottles and taken orally with a dosing syringe, following the European Pain Federation recommendations, which advocate for oral preparations in the management of chronic pain40.

The study included two randomizations, conducted at the beginning of phases A and D. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to VER-01 or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a neuropathic pain component. Participants, investigators and study site personnel were masked to treatment assignment. VER-01 and the matching placebo were dispensed in identical amber glass bottles.

Randomization took place in blocks of four, using a computer-generated randomization list. The size of the randomization blocks was not disclosed to the investigators.

At the screening visit, participants were provided with an eDiary and instructed on its use. Most assessments were recorded daily in the eDiary, while others were recorded on paper at the trial site and subsequently transferred to the electronic data capture system by site personnel. At visit A2, eligible participants were randomized. Participants were advised to take the study drug either consistently with or without food. The participants' individual optimal dose (both VER-01 and placebo) was determined during a 3-week titration period, following a written titration scheme. Provided that the study product was well-tolerated, the dose was increased every 3 days by one dose unit in the morning and one dose unit in the evening until the participant either experienced sufficient symptom relief or reached the maximum daily dose of 13 dose units. The morning and evening doses were adjusted independently.

Intake of analgesics other than rescue medication was prohibited during phase A, the last 3 weeks of phase B and phase D. The use of rescue medication (ibuprofen) was restricted to a maximum of 3 days per week and a daily dose of 2,400 mg. In case ibuprofen was contraindicated, paracetamol was offered at a maximum daily dose of 4,000 mg. Participants were not allowed to initiate a nondrug therapy during phase A, nor during the last 9 weeks preceding inclusion into phase D. If an ongoing nondrug therapy was already in place, it had to be continued unchanged throughout participation in phases A and D.

Participants used the eDiary to record their dosage, pain intensity (11-point NRS), sleep quality (11-point NRS) and use of rescue medication throughout all study phases. Additionally, participants used the eDiary to record potential withdrawal symptoms during phase D, using the CWS.

Phase A included six visits (Fig. 2)—screening (A1), randomization (A2), end of titration (A3) and three visits at 4-week intervals during the treatment phase (A4–A6). Phase B comprised four visits—one at the end of titration (B7) and three visits at 2-month intervals during the treatment phase (B8—B10). Phase C consisted of three visits at 2-month intervals during the treatment phase (C11–C13) and a follow-up visit (C14). Phase D involved two visits—one at the end of treatment (D11) and a follow-up visit (D12).

Safety assessments included AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical examinations, urine drug screens, pregnancy testing, 24-h ECG assessments (for a subset of 120 participants) and evaluation of substance dependence according to ICD-10 (F12.2) criteria. Investigators assessed the severity and causality of AEs, documenting onset, duration, seriousness and any actions or treatments taken.

A full schedule of assessments is provided in the attached protocol.

The primary endpoint in phase A was the CFB (week −1) to week 15 in the mean weekly pain intensity in the morning, measured on an 11-point NRS (0 = ‘no pain' and 10 = ‘worst pain imaginable'). The key secondary endpoint in phase A was the CFB in the NPSI total score at the end of phase A (visit A6) for participants with a neuropathic pain component. The NPSI includes ten items measuring the severity of spontaneous pain (four items), painful attacks (three items), provoked pain (two items) and abnormal sensations (one item)41. Each item was scored on an 11-point NRS. The total score ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (worst imaginable symptoms).

No primary endpoint was defined for the open-label study phases B and C. The primary endpoint of phase D was the time to treatment failure, defined as an increase in the 7-day mean of NRS morning pain intensity by ≥20% and ≥1 point compared to the phase D baseline week 44.

Across all study phases, the proportion of participants achieving ≥30% and ≥50% pain reduction was evaluated, reflecting outcomes widely considered clinically meaningful22,23,42.

Additional diary-based secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in all study phases included change in mean pain intensity (11-point NRS), intake of rescue medication, sleep quality on an 11-point NRS (0 = ‘not impacted'; 10 = ‘completely impacted') and the proportion of participants with ≥30% and ≥50% sleep quality improvement.

Visit-based secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in all study phases included CFB in NPSI total scores, PGIC on a seven-point Likert scale using the question ‘How is your low back pain in comparison to before participation in the study?' (0 = ‘very much better' to 6 = ‘very much worse') and quality of life evaluated with the short-form health survey 36v2 (SF-36)43,44. The SF-36 contains 36 questions about physical and mental well-being and was evaluated based on eight domain scores (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health), which were summarized to form two higher-ordered component summary measures (PCS and the mental health component summary). The scores ranged from 0 (maximum disability) to 100 (no disability).

The following visit-based secondary efficacy endpoints were additionally assessed in study phase A: the degree of disability was evaluated with the RMDQ at baseline and end of treatment45. The RMDQ is a 24-item questionnaire that assesses the impact of low back pain on functional activities, with scores ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicate greater disability. In addition, sleep quality was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS), which consists of 12 items that assess perceived initiation and maintenance of sleep, respiratory problems during sleep, sleep duration, perceived adequacy of sleep and daytime somnolence46. The evaluation of the MOS-SS was based on two sleep problem indices. Higher sleep scores indicate a clinically favorable outcome.

Safety was assessed based on the incidence of AEs, including their seriousness, severity and relationship to the study drug. Additionally, patients' satisfaction with tolerability was evaluated on a visit-by-visit basis using a five-point Likert scale. Substance dependence and abuse potential were measured visit-based with the ABC, a 20-item checklist used to monitor signs of addiction47. An ABC sum score of 3 or more indicates inappropriate drug use. Withdrawal symptoms were recorded daily in the eDiary with the CWS during treatment in phase D and during washout in phases C and D. The CWS consists of 19 items representing potential withdrawal symptoms associated with cannabis withdrawal. Each item is rated on a 0–10 scale, where 0 indicates ‘not at all' and 10 indicates ‘extremely'48.

To demonstrate the superiority of VER-01 over placebo for the primary endpoint in phase A, a total of 732 participants had to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The sample size calculation was based on an assumed treatment difference of 0.6 NRS points, an s.d. of 2.5 points, a two-sided significance level of 5% and 90% statistical power. For the key secondary endpoint of phase A, 180 participants with a neuropathic pain component had to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to show superiority of VER-01 versus placebo. This calculation was based on an assumed treatment difference of 10.5 NPSI points, an s.d. of 25.0, a two-sided significance level of 5% and 80% statistical power. Based on a proportion of 22% of participants with a neuropathic pain component, these assumptions resulted in a total sample size of 808 participants for phase A. The enrollment was stopped after 808 participants were randomized. Eligible participants who were already in the run-in phase were still allowed to be randomized.

Demographic data and other phase A baseline characteristics were summarized by treatment group and overall, separately for each study phase, based on the defined analysis sets.

The primary endpoint of phase A was tested by an analysis of covariance model, with treatment as the main effect and with baseline characteristics (presence of a neuropathic pain component; NRS morning pain intensity, age, sex and country) as covariates. The analysis was based on imputed data if intercurrent events prevented the collection of data or if data collected after the occurrence of intercurrent events would have distorted the interpretation of the results. Depending on the type of intercurrent event, data were imputed assuming missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). If data were MAR, these were imputed using a multiple imputation (MI) model based on available data from similar participants in the same treatment group. If data were MNAR (for example, early discontinuation due to AEs or loss of efficacy), data were imputed under the conservative approach of ‘jump to reference'.

This approach was considered conservative because it assumes that participants discontinuing VER-01 would experience outcomes similar to those in the placebo arm, regardless of any prior treatment benefit. Evidence from enriched-enrollment trials49,50,51 suggests that analgesic effects achieved before treatment discontinuation typically persist for several weeks, making a pain rebound above placebo unlikely. Additionally, participants discontinuing active treatment likely continue to benefit from nonspecific trial effects—such as positive expectations, enhanced clinical monitoring and behavioral adjustments—that are equally present in the control group. Finally, the nature of AEs prompting discontinuation was presumed to be mild to moderate and transient, making a lasting pain outcome worse than placebo unlikely.

MI based on the MNAR assumption was performed using the suggested placebo MI algorithm in ref. 52. In general, a two-step MI approach was followed. In the first step, an MCMC imputation model was calculated on 100 imputations to transform an arbitrary missing data pattern into a monotone missing pattern. In a second MI step, a monotone regression model was calculated on these 100 imputations. Parameter estimates were combined according to Rubin's rule. BOCF as well as LOCF imputations were performed as a supportive analysis.

The key secondary endpoint was evaluated similarly to the primary endpoint of phase A using an analysis of covariance model, with treatment as the main effect and baseline characteristics (NPSI total score, age, sex and country) as covariates. The same imputation strategies were applied as for the primary endpoint. Safety was assessed based on AE incidence with post hoc comparisons performed using a two-sided chi-squared test.

To collect efficacy and safety data for at least 300 participants over 6 months, 500 participants were planned to be included in phase B. In addition, 150 participants were planned to be included in phase C to collect long-term efficacy and safety data for at least 100 participants over 12 months.

For the sample size calculation of phase D, a treatment failure rate of 25% was assumed for VER-01 and 55% for placebo, building on ref. 53. For the log-rank test comparing the two survival curves with regard to time to treatment failure, a sample size of 78 (39 per treatment group) was required to achieve 80% statistical power under a two-sided significance level of 5%.

The primary endpoint of phase D was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the main effect and baseline characteristics (presence of a neuropathic pain component, NRS pain intensity at week 43, age and sex) as covariates. Events indicating treatment failure (such as overdosage of rescue medication or study discontinuation due to intolerability, lack of efficacy or noncompliance) were classified as treatment failure events. Data from participants with intercurrent events not indicating treatment failure were considered missing and imputed under the MAR assumption. Discontinuation of the study for reasons not indicating treatment failure led to censoring in time-to-event analyses.

The analysis sets for phases A and D included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication in the respective phase, with participants assigned to treatment groups as randomized (full analysis sets) or as treated (safety analysis sets). The safety analysis sets for phases B and C included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication in the respective phase. No independent data monitoring committee was used. All statistical analyses were conducted by an independent clinical research organization with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Clinical practice guidelines recommend defined weight loss goals for the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in those individuals with increased risk, such as prediabetes. However, achieving prediabetes remission, that is, reaching normal glucose regulation according to American Diabetes Association criteria, is more efficient in preventing T2D than solely reaching weight loss goals. Here we present a post hoc analysis of the large, multicenter, randomized, controlled Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS), demonstrating that prediabetes remission is achievable without weight loss or even weight gain, and that it also protects against incident T2D. The underlying mechanisms include improved insulin sensitivity, β-cell function and increments in β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity. Weight gain was similar in those achieving prediabetes remission (responders) compared with nonresponders; however, adipose tissue was differentially redistributed in responders and nonresponders when compared against each other—while nonresponders increased visceral adipose tissue mass, responders increased adipose tissue in subcutaneous depots. The findings were reproduced in the US Diabetes Prevention Program. These data uncover essential pathways for prediabetes remission without weight loss and emphasize the need to include glycemic targets in current clinical practice guidelines to improve T2D prevention.

Globally, more than 460 million people live with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and many go through comorbidities such as neuropathy, chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular (CV) disease, making T2D one of the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide. Indeed, the increase in global mortality burden until 2050 is projected to be mostly due to neoplasms, T2D and kidney diseases1. Moreover, the current data suggest that T2D incidence will continue to rise, with most cases attributable to diet quality2. Additionally, the highest total number of affected people live in middle-income and low-income countries, where current guideline-based treatments are not as easily available as in high-income countries. Therefore, prevention must still be regarded as a major pillar in achieving the WHO's global noncommunicable disease goals and in equitably reducing the major burden of T2D3. Prediabetes is the most prominent risk factor of T2D with a yearly progression rate of 5–10% and a lifetime progression risk of 74%4,5, and an independent risk factor for vascular diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases4,6,7.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), prediabetes is diagnosed when glucose regulation is impaired and/or HbA1c elevated while criteria of T2D are not met8,9. The U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Outcome Study (DPPOS) has demonstrated that reversal of impaired glucose regulation to normal at least once during a lifestyle intervention (LI) was effective in reducing the risk of T2D and microvascular disease10,11. In the Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS)12, we extended these findings by establishing the concept of prediabetes remission13,14. Accordingly, weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes is reached, once the normal glucose regulation (NGR; that is, fasting glucose < 5.6 mmol l−1 (100 mg dl−1), 2 h glucose < 7.8 mmol l−1 (140 mg dl−1) and HbA1c < 39 mmol mol−1 (5.7%)) is re-established. Weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission (>5% of initial body weight) was explained by improved insulin sensitivity and reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume. At long-term follow-up, participants reaching weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission had a 73% reduced risk of developing T2D compared to those who only met the weight loss goal (but not prediabetes remission) and also had reduced signs of kidney and small vessel damage13, which may be due to reduced glycemic exposure over time as has previously been indicated10. A comparable concept to prediabetes remission has successfully been established in people with T2D in the DIRECT trial, where substantial weight loss led to a return to nondiabetic glucose levels in up to 85% of participants, although the risk of redeveloping T2D was high15,16. In general, part of weight loss targeted LIs is physical exercise, which has been linked with reduced inflammation17,18 and has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity independently of body weight change19. In individuals with T2D, it has also been demonstrated that physical exercise can improve glycemia without a substantial weight loss effect20. However, neither DIRECT nor DPP reported on the preventive outcomes of patients who did not reduce body weight but achieved remission.

Here, we provide evidence that non-weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes protects from T2D development for up to 10 years after the LI started, and that it is characterized by increased subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) compared to nonremission, where VAT increases. Moreover, we show that non-weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes is mediated by an improvement in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

Our data provide new support for the importance of implementing glycemic targets into current treatment guidelines to improve T2D prevention14, and show that the sole assessment of weight trajectories without body fat distribution is not adequately informative for the pursuit of treatment success.

We analyzed data from the ongoing multicenter LI study PLIS that recruited individuals with prediabetes in study centers throughout Germany within the framework of the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.), where participants received the intervention for 12 months and were followed up for up to 9 years with metabolic phenotyping including oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) for glucose metabolism and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of body fat distribution before and after the intervention and during follow-up (see Methods for details). Of the 1,105 individuals originally included in PLIS, 234 (21.2%) did not lose or even gained weight during the year of the intervention. Of these, 51 returned to NGR, that is, were designated ‘responders' (R; 21.8%), while 183 (78.2%) were ‘nonresponders' (NR). Baseline characteristics for both groups are given in Extended Data Table 1. Overall, there were more women in both groups and R tended to have more women than NR (60.1% in NR versus 74.5% in R, P = 0.085). As has previously been reported for prediabetes remission11,13, R were younger (median = 54.4 ± 17.6 years) than NR (59.4 ± 15.5 years, P = 0.013), had lower fasting and 2 h glucose and slightly higher insulin sensitivity. Intervention intensity was not different between groups (Extended Data Table 1).

At first, we investigated whether weight trajectories during the 1-year intervention period were different between R and NR. However, BMI increased similarly in both groups (29.6 ± 2.1 kg m−2 to 30.6 ± 2.1 kg m−2 in R versus 30.5 ± 0.8 kg m−2 to 31.3 ± 0.9 kg m−2 in NR, P group over time = 0.24; Extended Data Fig. 1a). This was similar for body weight (84.0 ± 6.2 kg to 86.8 ± 6.5 kg in R versus 88.4 ± 2.9 kg to 90.6 ± 2.9 kg in NR, P group over time = 0.45), lean mass (56.2 ± 4.4 kg to 56.2 ± 4.7 kg in R versus 59.6 ± 2.7 kg to 59.5 ± 2.3 kg in NR, P group over time = 0.93; Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) and fat mass (30.7 ± 4.1 kg to 32.5 ± 4.5 kg in R versus 31.7 ± 2.0 kg to 32.5 ± 1.9 kg in NR, P group over time = 0.34; Extended Data Fig. 1d). Maximal aerobic capacity did not differ between groups (18 ± 2.2 ml min kg−1 to 17.6 ± 2.5 ml min kg−1 in R versus 18.5 ± 1.6 ml min kg−1 to 18.4 ± 1.9 ml min kg−1 in NR, P group over time = 0.65; Extended Data Fig. 1e). Additionally, adherence to dietary advice based on the evaluation of food diaries was not different between groups, similarly neither habitual physical activity (HPA) score nor daily distance walked (in a subgroup) or lean body mass differed between groups during the intervention and during follow-up, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Taken together, these data show that prediabetes remission without weight loss compared to nonremission was independent of weight trajectories, overall body composition and physical fitness.

Next, we explored the underlying determinants of improved glucose regulation in R versus NR. Glucose concentrations during the OGTT were lower in R and per definition decreased over time in R only (Fig. 1a). Also, consecutive insulin concentrations during the OGTT were higher in NR than in R before, during and after the intervention, but increased in R between 30 and 60 min during the second half of the intervention (Fig. 1b).

a, Time course of glucose (R, n = 51; NR, n = 183) concentrations during the OGTT over the course of the LI. b, Insulin (R, n = 51; NR, n = 183) concentrations during the OGTT over the course of the LI. Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals in all panels. P values directly above the x axes indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. The R (defined by NGR, that is, prediabetes remission, after 12 months of LI) group and the NR (that is, not reaching NGR) group are depicted in blue and orange, respectively. FDR-corrected group × time P values are 0.0008 for all comparisons. Dashed lines in a represent ADA criteria-based cutoff values for prediabetes for fasting glucose (5.6 mmol l−1) and 2 h OGTT glucose (7.8 mmol l−1). In b, the lower dashed line shows the insulin concentrations at 60 min during the OGTT at baseline and the upper dashed line shows the 60 min peak at 12 months to visualize the change in insulin peak concentrations during the intervention.

To better understand the increase of insulin concentrations in R, we calculated OGTT-derived indexes for insulin sensitivity, secretion and β-cell function. We found that throughout the LI, insulin sensitivity did not change in NR but increased in R. The oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) index increased from 336.45 ± 15.41 ml min−1 m−2 to 358.23 ± 18.88 ml min−1 m−2 in R, whereas it remained unchanged (299.42 ± 8.67 ml min−1 m−2 to 297.42 ± 9.09 ml min−1 m−2) in NR, P group over time: 0.0035 (Fig. 2a). Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity revealed the same development with a numeric increase from 8.94 ± 1.35 a.u. to 9.36 ± 1.47 a.u., P = 0.096 in R, but did not increase in NR (6.82 ± 0.55 a.u. to 6.39 ± 0.53 a.u. in NR, P group over time = 0.00041, Fig. 2b). An index of hepatic insulin resistance did not show differences between groups (Fig. 2c). Also, there was no indication of differences in muscle or adipose tissue insulin resistance (Fig. 2d,e). However, insulin secretion and β-cell function increased in R but not in NR. The C-peptide area under the curve (AUC)0–30 min/glucose AUC0–30 min, an index of insulin secretion, increased from 159.5 ± 17.13 pmol mmol−1 to 169.96 ± 19.3 pmol mmol−1 in R, but remained constant (157.89 ± 7.81 pmol mmol−1 to 161.81 ± 8.15 pmol mmol−1) in NR (P group over time = 0.043; Fig. 2f). The Adaptation Index, a marker of β-cell function, increased from 5.16 × 104 ± 3,833.80 a.u. to 5.78 × 104 ± 5,145.06 a.u. in R and remained unchanged (4.61 × 104 ± 2,192.89 a.u. to 4.74 × 104 ± 2,554.91 a.u.) in NR (P group over time = 0.025; Fig. 2g). An overview of the changes in the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion for the two groups is given in Fig. 2h. The hyperbola shows that while R were able to increase insulin sensitivity and secretion at the same time, NR did not improve insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. Change of hepatic insulin clearance was not different between groups (3.91 ± 0.36 a.u to 3.68 ± 0.4 a.u in R versus 3.39 ± 0.17 a.u to 3.31 ± 0.16 a.u in NR, P group over time = 0.49; Fig. 2i) and, thus, cannot explain the increase in insulin concentrations observed in R. With the increase in insulin secretion and β-cell function alongside improved insulin sensitivity, remission mechanisms without weight loss differ from weight-loss-associated prediabetes remission, where the increase in insulin secretion has not been observed previously13.

The R (defined by NGR, that is, prediabetes remission, after 12 months of LI) group and the NR (that is, not reaching NGR) group are depicted in blue and orange, respectively. Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals in a–g. In h and i, the base of the arrows depicts medians at baseline and the respective tip after 1 year of LI. Error bars depict s.e.m. P values directly above the x axes in a–g and i indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. P values directly above the colored bars indicate the difference between baseline and 12 months for the R and the NR group as post hoc corrected comparisons derived from the respective mixed effects models. FDR-corrected group × time P = 0.013 (a), P = 0.002 (b), P = 0.89 (c), P = 0.47 (d), P = 0.47 (e), P = 0.10 (f), P = 0.081 (g) and P = 0.62 (i).

Because insulin sensitivity and secretion are linked with ectopic adipose tissue deposition21,22,23, we then determined lipid accumulation in SCAT, VAT and ectopic lipid depots based on the MRI and 1H-spectroscopy data. Intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) was slightly higher in NR versus R (Extended Data Table 1) but remained constant in both groups during the LI (5.08 ± 1.71% to 5.9 ± 1.74% in R versus 7.65 ± 1.14% to 8.13 ± 1.18% in NR, P group over time = 0.74; Fig. 3a), suggesting no critical contribution of changes in IHL for nonweight-loss remission. However, while VAT did not increase in R despite weight gain, it increased along with weight gain in NR (4.31 ± 0.69 l to 4.24 ± 0.69 l in R versus 4.99 ± 0.32 l to 5.41 ± 0.36 l in NR, P group over time = 0.031; Fig. 3b). In contrast, SCAT increased more in R versus NR (14.41 ± 2.39 l to 15.7 ± 2.06 l in R versus 14.97 ± 1.06 l to 14.66 ± 0.98 l in NR, P group over time = 0.035) showing that with weight gain, R predominantly stored additional energy in SCAT but NR in VAT (Fig. 3c). This is reflected in a substantial increase in SCAT/VAT ratio in R, whereas the ratio tended to decrease in NR (4.01 ± 0.67 to 4.94 ± 0.93 in R versus 3.42 ± 0.25 to 3.14 ± 0.26 in NR, P group over time < 0.0001; Fig. 3d). Change in intramuscular fat was not different between groups (5.85 ± 1.24% to 6.15 ± 1.49% in R versus 6.4 ± 1.45% to 6.76 ± 1.49% in NR, P group over time = 0.83; Fig. 3e). These data highlight that lipid deposition during weight gain is most likely a crucial factor for improvements in glucose regulation during non-weight-loss prediabetes remission.

To further investigate whether the genetic background is a key driver of ectopic lipid deposition during weight gain, we calculated a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from a subset of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Methods) that have been described to be associated with VAT24. However, there were no differences in the PRS between R and NR with or without adjustments for covariates (Fig. 3f).

Similar to previously published data on weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission, there was no association between the change in IHL and the proportion of remission (Fig. 4a,b). However, lower VAT increase or even reductions in VAT were linked with higher remission success (P = 0.024; Fig. 4c,d). According to the changes in SCAT and VAT, a higher SCAT/VAT ratio after the LI was associated with higher frequency of remission, again suggesting that the distribution of adipose tissue gained may determine prediabetes remission (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4e). Finally, there was a trend toward higher remission rates with weight gain (Fig. 4f).

VAT is associated with increased low-grade inflammation and weight-loss-associated prediabetes remission13. Thus, we measured biomarkers of inflammation suggested to contribute to insulin resistance. However, there were no substantial differences in individual trajectories of inflammatory markers between R and NR (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Thus, low-grade inflammation, at least at the circulation level, may not explain improved insulin sensitivity during prediabetes remission.

Because hormonal factors derived from adipose tissue are also linked with insulin sensitivity, we measured the adipokines leptin and adiponectin. Leptin levels were not different between groups and did not develop differently (37.25 ± 11.81 ng ml−1 to 43.63 ± 11.68 ng ml−1 in R versus 40.68 ± 6.24 ng ml−1 to 47.26 ± 6.49 ng ml−1 in NR). Adiponectin levels, however, were not different at baseline (3096.48 ± 535.75 ng ml−1 in R, 2412.30 ± 207.49 ng ml−1 in NR, P = 0.094), but were substantially higher after the intervention in R versus NR (3371.57 ± 596.55 ng ml−1 in R, 2337.20 ± 217.24 ng ml−1 in NR, P = 0.0040, P group over time = 0.088; Extended Data Fig. 2), suggesting that increases in SCAT may chaperone improved insulin sensitivity by increased adiponectin secretion, at least in part.

To further understand the improvement in insulin secretion and β-cell function in R, we assessed lipid content within triglyceride-containing VLDL particles, because a reduction in VLDL1 palmitate has been shown to be associated with improved β-cell secretory capacity during the remission of T2D25. Despite higher levels in total and specific lipid species-bound palmitate in NR as well as triglyceride levels, there was no difference in the trajectories during LI between R and NR (Extended Data Fig. 3a–l), suggesting that hepatic palmitate export may not have major impact on the insulin secretion phenotype during prediabetes remission.

We then assessed concentrations of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon to investigate whether incretin responses during the OGTT or sensitivity (see below) may explain improved insulin secretion in R. As expected, in both groups GLP-1 concentrations increased between 0 and 30 min, and then decreased at 120 min (Fig. 5a). While there was no substantial difference in the trajectories over time between groups (before, P = 0.13; after, P = 0.14), the GLP-1AUC substantially increased in NR (who maintained that their glucose levels in the prediabetic range or advanced to overt T2D) but remained stable in R despite reduction of glucose levels to normal (P = 0.78; Fig. 5a).

Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals. P values directly above the x axes indicate change in R (defined by NGR, that i,s prediabetes remission, after 12 months of LI) versus NR (that is, not reaching NGR) over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. Indicators above the time points indicate between-group difference at the respective time point derived from post hoc comparisons of the respective mixed effects models. ***P < 0.0001; FDR-corrected group × time P values: baseline—P = 0.29, 12 months—P = 0.29, AUC—P = 0.0008 (all to a); baseline—P = 0.63, 12 months—P = 0.38, AUC—P = 0.45 (all to b); baseline—P = 0.38, 12 months—P = 0.0079, AUC—P = 0.0012 (all to c). NS, nonsignificant.

GIP followed similar trajectories during the OGTT but remained elevated at 120 min in both groups (Fig. 5b). Neither group trajectories during the OGTT before or after nor GIPAUC differed between R and NR, rendering GIP unlikely to be involved in improved β-cell function during nonweight-loss prediabetes remission (Fig. 5b).

However, glucagon was lower in R and remained unchanged during the LI, whereas in NR glucagon showed an additional increase after the intervention (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, reduction in glucagon concentrations between 0 and 30 min during the OGTT remained stable in NR, but increased substantially in R (Fig. 5c), implying improved glucagonostatic and insulinotropic (considering improved insulin secretion) effects of GLP-1. Therefore, we then calculated the insulin secretion rate based on a previously published algorithm26,27,28 and plotted it against GLP-1 secretion as a measure of β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity. Indeed, these calculations display that β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity exhibited marked improvements in R, but not in NR (insulin secretion rate AUC—3,749 ± 401.1 to 4360 ± 382.5 in R and 4,381 ± 164.2 to 4,326 ± 170.1 in NR; GLP-1 AUC—122.1 ± 10.3 to 115.4 ± 13.3 in R and 142.5 ± 5.12 to 152.2 ± 5.96 in NR; P group over time = 0.0050; Extended Data Fig. 4).

Because of the recent data showing that prediabetes remission with weight loss reduces the risk for future T2D development13, we here investigated if remission of prediabetes despite the absence of weight loss or even with weight gain is also protective from future T2D development. Indeed, more NR than R developed T2D leading to a relative risk (RR) reduction of 71% in R over the period of up to 10 years (RR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09–0.91, P = 0.02; Fig. 6a,b) and thus prediabetes remission without weight loss was comparably protective for T2D development as prediabetes remission with weight loss (73%)13.

P value is derived from log-rank tests. b, Sankey plot of glycemic categories (that is, T2D, prediabetes and NGR) over time. P value is derived from two-sided Fisher's exact test.

To exclude any potential effect that may be specific to our cohort and to enhance the generalizability of the results, we validated our findings in repository data from DPP. We also identified 494 individuals who did not lose or even gain body weight after 12 months of the intervention. Baseline characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 3. Similar to PLIS, R and NR increased BMI comparably, and NR increased VAT while R did not (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Additionally, R showed improved insulin sensitivity as well as insulin secretion (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c), even after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. Finally, individuals with prediabetes remission in DPP at 1 year without weight loss also had an RR reduction for future T2D of 73% (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.66, P < 0.0001) during a median follow-up time of 4.11 (IQR: 1.44, 13.48) years. These data reproduce the findings that prediabetes remission without weight loss is characterized by improved insulin sensitivity as well as improved insulin secretion and that excess lipid deposition into VAT may preclude persons from nonweight-loss prediabetes remission.

Moreover, recent data indicate that the 1 h glucose OGTT value may better predict the development of T2D than the 2 h OGTT value29. We, therefore, performed the same analysis by using the proposed 1 h cutoff of 155 mg dl−1 to identify participants as having prediabetes or NGR, but this change in criteria for prediabetes did not change our findings regarding glucose and insulin metabolism during prediabetes remission (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Our data show that remission of prediabetes without weight loss is a genuine and reproducible response to an LI in a substantial proportion of participants (up to 22%) and that the response is highly effective in preventing T2D. Individuals going into remission without losing body weight are characterized by increased SCAT/VAT ratio, indicating that the site of fat deposition during an LI determines the probability of prediabetes remission. Elegant studies have shown that physical exercise reduces glycemia with no or only marginal effects on body weight20,30. The studies in refs. 31,32 have shown that exercise without a weight loss effect can specifically reduce VAT. Additionally, diet composition has a role in VAT accumulation—diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to protect against VAT gain compared to those rich in saturated fats, even during overfeeding and weight gain33. Thus, physical exercise and dietary habits may have contributed to lower glycemia and to the observed SCAT and VAT distribution phenotype.

Moreover, non-weight-loss-associated prediabetes remission was characterized by a combination of higher insulin sensitivity and improved insulin secretion, which contrasts this response from weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission in PLIS and DPP where remission was characterized by improved insulin sensitivity but not secretion and T2D remission in DIRECT, which was accompanied by improved β-cell function but not insulin sensitivity13,21,34. Notably, prediabetes remission without weight loss was protective from T2D development with an RR reduction of >70%, and thus to a comparable degree as weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission in the previous study13. Taken together, these data show that distinct physiological mechanisms underlie non-weight-loss-induced remission of prediabetes and that it is essential to differentiate between weight-loss and non-weight-loss strata, when investigating the mechanisms that can mediate prediabetes remission. Moreover, our data suggest that weight loss, as recommended in current guidelines, should be complemented by remission to NGR to prevent T2D in those people with prediabetes. This is in line with recent efforts delineating the clinical heterogeneity of obesity in projection for cardiometabolic diseases, specifically when cardiometabolic risk is discordant with the risk that is to be expected when obesity is classically defined solely by the BMI35. Furthermore, new statements and definitions of expert commissions for the diagnosis and management of obesity highlight the importance of body fat distribution and function beyond adiposity and underscore the clinical manifestation of organ dysfunction for the diagnosis of clinical obesity36,37.

While body weight trajectories were similar between groups, fat accumulation in SCAT was mainly observed in R and accumulation in VAT was observed in NR. The details in ref. 38 showed that large amounts of SCAT in combination with little visceral adiposity are associated with high insulin sensitivity during a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp. Exercise can favorably influence SCAT composition, even without weight loss39, and SCAT of regularly exercising individuals is more expandable than that of sedentary people with obesity40. The importance of exercise for improving insulin sensitivity has previously been demonstrated41; however, lean body mass and VO2 max, a marker of maximum aerobic capacity, were not different between R and NR. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that subtle differences in physical exercise (volume) may have impacted insulin sensitivity. Although we did not observe a difference in the PRS, the genetic basis of unfavorable body fat distribution and T2D risk has previously been reported42,43,44. Interestingly, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of oral glucose-lowering medications that activate the transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, led to a redistribution of fat mass from VAT to SCAT depots. TZDs act as insulin sensitizers at least in part by this mechanism45,46. They have also been shown to increase body weight and to improve insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, similar to our observation with nonweight-loss prediabetes remission45,47.

This trend toward a favorable adipose tissue composition tracks closely with systemic adiponectin concentrations. Adiponectin is released by adipose tissue and is associated with increased systemic insulin sensitivity48. This finding is in line with recent findings of a gradual decrease of adiponectin levels from metabolically healthy lean to metabolically healthy obese to metabolically unhealthy obese persons49. Also, in the data presented here, adiponectin levels were higher in R after the intervention, which may contribute to their increased insulin sensitivity.

In R, but not NR, insulin secretion and β-cell function increased during LI. Palmitate, partly a product of hepatic de novo lipogenesis, has a particularly detrimental role in reducing β-cell function, most likely by inducing β-cell dedifferentiation50. Hepatic palmitate secretion has been shown to be modifiable by LI and reduced VLDL1 palmitate export from the liver has been shown to be linked with T2D remission in the DIRECT trial as well as remission maintenance after weight-loss-dependent remission25. In our study, in the setting of non-weight-loss prediabetes remission, VLDL1 palmitate export did not change between R and NR, implying that hepatic VLDL1 palmitate export may not be responsible for the lack of increase in β-cell function in the NR. However, we did not assess VLDL-production rates, previously demonstrated to be important for T2D remission25.

We then assessed the incretin system to explain the improvement in insulin secretion observed in R, but not in NR. Both GLP-1 and GIP enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion51. GLP-1 secretion after glucose ingestion is only minimally reduced in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) as well as in T2D52,53. Exogenous application of GLP-1 in pharmacologically relevant doses largely maintains its effectiveness in IGT as well as in T2D54. GIP levels after glucose ingestion are in the normal range in IGT and may be elevated in T2D53,55. However, its effectiveness in augmenting insulin secretion is reduced56. In our cohort, GLP-1 and GIP time courses during OGTT were not different between groups. GLP-1AUC remained stable in R despite reduced glucose levels and increased insulin levels (Fig. 2). This may reflect improved GLP-1 sensitivity in R, potentially contributing to improved β-cell function by its improved insulinotropic effect that has been shown to be more pronounced during normoglycemic conditions57. Indeed, an index of β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity showed increased sensitivity in R, but not in NR. Because GLP-1 has a glucagonostatic effect58, improved GLP-1 sensitivity may be supported by the finding that R showed improved glucagon suppression during the OGTT. However, we cannot exclude that this could also be a consequence of the improvements in glucose regulation restoring the glucosuppressive effect on glucagon that may also be influenced by diet59.

Prediabetes remission without weight loss reduced the risk of subsequent T2D by 71% in our study. Previous studies of people with weight-loss-induced prediabetes remission showed similar risk reductions (73%)13,60, which is comparable to T2D risk reduction induced by pharmacological interventions61. In a post hoc analysis from the PROactive trial, weight gain with pioglitazone, a TZD, which leads to weight gain with a redistribution from VAT to SCAT and improvements in insulin sensitivity62,63, was associated with improved CV outcomes (excluding heart failure)64. Interestingly, recent data from our group show that prediabetes remission, in contrast to multimodal LIs targeting mainly weight loss, is also associated with reduced CV outcomes65,66.

Together, these data indicate that there is a weight-independent component of the glycemic status, which is related to body fat distribution. Indeed, individuals reaching both prediabetes remission and the guideline-recommended weight loss target of 7% are 76% less likely to develop T2D8, compared to the group that only met the weight loss target60. These data highlight the importance of incorporating glycemic targets into practice guidelines in addition to weight loss targets. Remission of prediabetes is the most effective way to prevent future T2D cases, and our current data indicate that this is partially independent of weight loss. In fact, sustainable weight loss is rarely achievable with >90% of weight loss recidivism and the probability of obtaining normal body weight is very low with less than 1 per 1,000 for men and less than 1 per 600 for women in individuals with severe obesity67,68. Therefore, from a clinical perspective, primary treatment goals should focus on achieving metabolic health rather than weight loss alone. Bringing prediabetic hyperglycemia back to normoglycemia seems to be an important contribution and indicator for metabolic health69.

This study is limited by the surrogate parameters derived from the OGTT for estimation of insulin sensitivity and secretion/β-cell function. Additionally, we cannot rule out confounders that were not assessed, such as genetic predisposition (beyond the investigated SNPs) and environmental factors. This study is additionally limited by the lack of a priori powering due to the post hoc nature of this analysis. To strengthen the validity of the data, we have therefore included data from the DPPOS cohort that replicate and support our current findings and interpretations. Additionally, the post hoc group stratification may lead to residual confounding effects, that is, the stratification into remission and nonremission leads to baseline differences, for example, in glucose levels, as has also been observed in studies investigating T2D remission mechanisms70 and in previous analyses from DPPOS10,11, which may affect the likelihood of remission at the individual level. Nonetheless, we show that for individuals who do achieve remission, the risk of future T2D development is substantially reduced—even in the absence of weight loss. This finding underscores the importance of incorporating remission as a core element of modern T2D prevention strategies, regardless of baseline. To minimize confounding of our results by baseline misclassification, we included fasting as well as postchallenge glucose and HbA1c into our definition of remission, whereby test–retest reliability has been shown to be up to 98.6%71. While spontaneous remission from prediabetes to normoglycemia might be observable even without LI72, our findings are not likely to be influenced by an erroneous classification.

We conclude that the protective effect of LI in individuals with prediabetes is not solely dependent on weight loss, as none of the participants included in the present analysis lost weight. Non-weight-loss prediabetes remission is characterized by a ‘TZD-like' body fat distribution. Current guideline recommendations involve multimodal LI with a focus on weight loss targets of 5–10%. In light of the current data, we recommend achieving metabolic health by incorporating glycemic targets to reach NGR (prediabetes remission) in addition to weight loss, thereby optimizing T2D risk reduction through a precision prevention approach. Specifically, LI needs to be tailored to the goal of prediabetes remission73.

Participants of the risk-stratified, randomized, controlled and multicenter PLIS were recruited between 1 March 2012 and 31 August 2016 to assess potential superiority of an intensified LI compared to conventional DPP-based LI in improving glucose tolerance in people with prediabetes at high risk for T2D development. Sex was determined through self-report. People with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose, IGT or both according to criteria from the ADA) between the ages of 18 and 75 years were included8. Participants with high IHL in addition to either high insulin resistance or low insulin secretion were stratified as high risk. After stratification, randomization of high-risk participants to receive either intensified LI or conventional LI and of low-risk participants to receive either conventional LI or a control intervention was performed. For this analysis, individuals from PLIS who did not experience weight loss over the 12-month period of those of the intensified LI, the conventional LI or the control intervention were included. Participants were classified as either R or NR. R were defined by return to normal fasting plasma glucose (that is, <5.6 mmol l−1), normal glucose tolerance (that is, 2 ­h post­load glucose <7.8 mmol l−1) and HbA1c less than 39 mmol mol−1 after 12 months of all three interventions. NR were defined by fasting plasma glucose, 2 h glucose or HbA1c higher than these thresholds after 12 months of all three interventions. Glucose regulation was assessed in the morning at 8 a.m. during an overnight fast through OGTT with blood sampling at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min using a 75 g glucose load (Accu-Check Dextro O.G.T.; Roche). Glucose concentrations were assessed using the glucose oxidase method in certified laboratories at each clinical study site. All insulin and C-peptide measurements were done at the Tübingen study site on an ADVIA Centaur XP system (Siemens Healthineers). Clinical chemistry parameters, including HbA1c, were assessed at the local routine diagnostic laboratories of the participating centers, and all of these were certified by the German accreditation council (DAkkS).

Volunteers participated in this study for a mean of 5.2 ± 2.8 years (max = 9.9 years). Adherence to the dietary intervention was assessed by evaluation of food diaries through the study counselors during the counseling sessions, where food diaries of 4 consecutive days were evaluated. The dietary goals were reduction of fat intake to <30% of total energy intake, reduction of saturated fat intake to <10% of total energy intake and increase of fiber intake to >15 g per 1,000 kcal total energy intake. Markers of physical activity and fitness were assessed by the VO2 max during ergometry, quantification of lean body mass and the HPA. The VO2 max was assessed as the maximal oxygen uptake during incremental physical exertion on an ergometer, lean body mass was estimated through bioelectric impedance analysis and the HPA based on the self-report that addressed the following main components: physical activity during work, physical activity during leisure time and sports during leisure time74. In a small subgroup of individuals, step counts were extracted to document daily distance walked (R/NR, n = 6/17). Further details of the intervention are provided elsewhere12. Of these measures, lean body mass and the HPA were continuously assessed. Follow-up is ongoing. Written informed consent was provided by each participant at inclusion. The study protocol is available online (https://www.dzdev.de/fileadmin/DZD/PDF/Papers/Forschung_KlinStud_Ethik_Studienprotokoll_PLIS_1.4.pdf) and approved by the ethics committee of the University Clinic of Tübingen (Tübingen, 55/2012; ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT01947595). Further details have been published previously12. Financial compensation for participants was granted exceptionally upon request, only if participants lived far away from the study center.

Repository data from the U.S. DPP study were analyzed to verify results from PLIS in a different population75,76. Participants were recruited from 23 clinical study centers in the United States between 31 July 1996 and 18 May 1999, and randomized to either LI or metformin or placebo groups. For the present analysis, data from LI and placebo group participants were used, who did not lose body weight during the first 12 ­months and had complete data on measurements of BMI, fasting and 30­-min insulin, and fasting, 30 ­min and 120-­min glucose during an OGTT.

Ethics approval for the study was provided by the institutional review board of each participating clinical center. Written informed consent was obtained from all DPP participants. The DPP study protocol is available online at https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/study/38.

This is a post hoc analysis of a prespecified endpoint in PLIS. Main outcomes are indexes of insulin secretion and sensitivity and distribution of body fat as main determinants of response or nonresponse to an LI.

The specifics of sampling and processing have been published elsewhere12. All measurements were taken from distinct participants. The following OGTT-based indexes for insulin sensitivity were calculated: OGIS index77, insulin sensitivity index78, the adipose tissue insulin resistance index79, muscle insulin sensitivity index80 and hepatic insulin resistance index81. To evaluate insulin secretion, we used C­-peptide AUC divided by glucose AUC during the first 30 min of the OGTT82. The Adaptation Index was calculated as (AUCc­pep0–30 divided by AUCgluc0–30) × OGIS to provide an integrated measure for insulin secretion adapted to underlying insulin resistance83. AUCc­pep0–120 divided by AUCins0–120 was calculated as a marker of hepatic insulin clearance84.

Insulin secretion rate was calculated by fitting C-peptide concentrations at each time point during the OGTT to an established model of C-peptide deconvolution26,27,28. An incremental area under the first 30 min of the curve resulting from this modeling was calculated using the trapezoidal rule85. An incremental AUC was obtained from GLP-1 measurements during the OGTT in a similar fashion. These values were plotted against each other to depict β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity, as previously described86. Insulin secretion and sensitivity were assessed from OGTT-based indexes in DPP in a similar fashion. Details have been previously published75,76.

The MRI was performed to measure muscle fat, subcutaneous and visceral fat compartments in PLIS. The applied methods are described in detail elsewhere12,87. VAT volume was determined from T1-weighted fast spin echo images that were assessed with a slice thickness of 10 mm (ref. 88). Segmentation of VAT was done between hip and thoracic diaphragm using an automatic fuzzy c-means algorithm and orthonormal snakes89. IHL was quantified in PLIS only. Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H­MRS) applying a single­voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode localization technique with short echo time in the posterior part of segment VII was applied for IHL assessment. The ratio of signal integrals of fat (methylene + methyl signal) and total signal (water + fat) was used to determine IHL content, which is expressed in percent. In one center, 1H-MRS was not available and IHL content was determined by a chemical-shift selective imaging technique that generates fat and water selective images as described elsewhere90. From these, manually determined regions of interest in liver segment 7 performed in fat and water selective images, respectively, were used for IHL-content assessment. To ensure comparability with MRS-guided assessments, IHL content was calculated by fat/(water + fat) × 100, including corrections for relaxation effects. Both techniques have been shown to yield comparable assessments of IHL content91. More details have been described previously92.

In DPP, VAT measurements were obtained by lumbar spine CT scans at L2, L3, L4 and L5. IHL and SCAT were not quantified in DPP. Only in PLIS, fat-selective MRI sequences were used to measure intramuscular fat fraction of musculus erector spinae and musculus spinalis thoracis. A region of interest avoiding macroscopic fat septae was manually drawn at the Th10/Th11 intervertebral level in a single axial slice90,92. Close proximity SCAT was used for reference (that is, 100%) and fat fractions were calculated12,87.

VLDL were isolated from plasma by ultracentrifugation applying an NaCl density gradient (ρ = 1.006 g ml−1) at 541,000g for 60 min at 4 °C on an Optima Max-XP ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Subsequently, 60 µl of the VLDL-containing fraction were used for lipid extraction and shotgun analysis as previously described93,94. Lipid extracts were resuspended in IPA/MeOH/CHCl3 (4:2:1; vol/vol/vol) with 7.5 mM ammonium acetate and then infused through the TriVersa NanoMate ion source (Advion Biosciences) into an Exploris 240 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer. All spectra were imported by LipidXplorer (1.2.8.1) into a MasterScan database. Lipid identification was carried out as described95.

Multianalyte profiling on the Luminex-100 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories), with a combination of Bio-Plex Pro Human Immunotherapy Panel 20-Plex, Bio-Plex Pro Huma Inflammation Panel, Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Panel and the 2-Plex Panel for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, was used to assess concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers in serum. Bio-Plex Multiplex Immunoassays (Bio-Rad Laboratories) are based on the xMAP Technology licensed from Luminex; all measurements were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocols. A detailed description of the methods is given elsewhere96. Serum concentrations of leptin (11-LEPHU-E01; Alpco) and high molecular weight adiponectin (80-ADPHU-E01; ALPCO) were determined using ELISA, following the manufacturer's instructions.

Plasma levels of total GIP, total GLP-1 and glucagon were measured as previously described using validated immunoassays97.

Individuals from PLIS were genotyped onto two different versions of the Illumina Global Screening Array chip (280 on GSA-MD-24v1 and 549 on GSA-MD-24v2). A previously described set of 205 SNPs for predicted VAT, including only genome-wide substantial variants described in ref. 24 were selected and subsequently restricted to 186 SNPs. Quality control was performed on all participants using the PLINK 1.9 software. SNPs exclusion criteria included missingness threshold of >5%, minor allele frequency <1% and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium with P < 0.05. The summary statistics were downloaded from the NHGRI–EBI GWAS on 8 October 2024 for study GCST008744 (refs. 24,98).

Linear mixed effects models with group (that is, R and NR), time point and the interaction group × time point as model terms adjusted for age, sex, BMI, risk stratification and intervention intensity as fixed effects and each individual as random effect were fitted to analyze longitudinal data. Additionally, the model evaluating insulin secretion included insulin sensitivity as fixed effect. All group × time P values were corrected for multiplicity using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. To avoid overreliance on significance testing and dichotomization, we report β coefficients for all models, including 95% confidence intervals in Extended Data Fig. 9. Diagnostic plots were plotted for each model to ensure normal distribution of residuals by visual inspection. For group-wise, cross-sectional comparisons, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed. Resulting P values were also corrected for multiplicity of comparisons (Benjamini–Hochberg). T2D incidence up to almost 9 years after intervention end was compared through risk ratios and Fisher's exact test using the epitools package, version 0.5-10.1. A Kaplan–Meier curve with log-rank test is also reported.

Statistical analyses were performed using RStudio (version 2024.12.0 + 467) with R (version 4.4.1). In the PLIS dataset, missing values for liver, subcutaneous, and visceral fat were imputed using the mouse package (version 3.16.0). In the DPP dataset, no imputation was performed.

Anthropometric characteristics in PLIS: BMI, R: n = 51; NR: n = 183 (a), body weight, R: n = 49; NR: n = 170 (b), lean mass, R: n = 49; NR: n = 170 (c), fat mass R: n = 49; NR: n = 171 (d) and maximal aerobic capacity, R: n = 17; NR: n = 47 (e) during the intervention. Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals. P values directly above the x axes indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. P values directly above the colored bars indicate the difference between baseline and 12 months for the responder group (blue) and the non-responder group (orange) as post-hoc corrected comparisons derived from the respective mixed effects models. Exact p-values: a: R p = 3.03 × 10−13; NR p < 2 × 10−16; b: R p = 6.67 × 10−13; NR p < 2 × 10−16.

Assessment of markers of diet adherence and physical activity during and after the lifestyle intervention (LI) in PLIS. a, Adherence to the diet recommendations assessed during diet counseling sessions. b, Daily distance walked inferred by pedometer data after 6 months of LI in a subgroup of individuals (R: n = 6; NR: n = 17). c–g, The habitual physical activity score during LI and at follow-up. h–l, Lean body mass during LI and at follow-up. Chi-squared test was used for a, all other p values are derived from two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Means of raw values are depicted and error bars indicate s.d. in b–l. N for each panel is depicted in the respective group bars.

Concentrations of circulating adiponectin, R: n = 43; NR: n = 169 (a) and R: n = 43; NR: n = 149 (b) before and after the intervention in PLIS. Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals. P values directly above the x axes indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. P values directly above the colored bars indicate the difference between baseline and 12 months for the responder group (blue) and the non-responder group (orange) and those directly above the panels comparing the group comparisons at each timepoint, all derived from post-hoc corrected comparisons from the respective mixed effects models.

Cholesterol ester palmitate (CE, a), diacylglycerol palmitate (DAG, b), lysophosphatidylcholine palmitate (LPC, c), lysophosphatidylethanolamine palmitate (LPE, d), lysophosphatidylglycerol palmitate (LPG, e), phosphatidylcholine palmitate (PC, f), phosphatidylcholine oxidized palmitate (PCO, g), phosphatidylethanolamine palmitate (PE, h), phosphatidylethanolamine oxidized palmitate (PEO, i), phosphatidylinositol palmitate (PI, j), triacylglycerol palmitate (TAG, k), combined very low-density lipoprotein palmitate (VLDL1, l). Means of raw values are depicted with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals. P values directly above the x axes indicate change in R versus NR over time (that is, interaction term of group and time) derived from mixed effects models. P values directly above the colored bars indicate the difference between baseline and 12 months for the responder group (blue) and the non-responder group (orange) as post-hoc corrected comparisons derived from the respective mixed effects models.

β-cell incretin sensitivity expressed as area under the curve of the insulin secretion rate during the first 30 min of the OGTT plotted against the area under the curve of GLP-1 secretion during the first 30 min of the OGTT83. The base of the arrows depicts medians at baseline and the respective tip after 1 year of LI. Error bars depict s.e.m.

Accurately solving the Schrödinger equation for intricate systems remains a prominent challenge in physical sciences. Here we present QiankunNet, a neural network quantum state (NNQS) framework that combines Transformer architectures with efficient autoregressive sampling to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation. At its core is a Transformer-based wave function ansatz that captures complex quantum correlations through attention mechanisms, effectively learning the structure of many-body states. The quantum state sampling employs layer-wise Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that naturally enforces electron number conservation while exploring orbital configurations. The framework incorporates physics-informed initialization using truncated configuration interaction solutions, providing principled starting points for variational optimization. Our systematic benchmarks demonstrate QiankunNet's versatility across different chemical systems. For molecular systems up to 30 spin orbitals, we achieved correlation energies reaching 99.9% of the full configuration interaction (FCI) benchmark, setting a new standard for neural network quantum states. Most notably, in treating the Fenton reaction mechanism, a fundamental process in biological oxidative stress, QiankunNet successfully handled a large CAS(46e,26o) active space, enabling accurate description of the complex electronic structure evolution during Fe(II) to Fe(III) oxidation.

Recently, the Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), giving rise to large language models (LLMs) with unprecedented capabilities1,2,3,4,5. Intrinsic versatility and adaptability of the Transformer architecture serve as the backbone of these LLMs, making it a powerful tool for addressing complex challenges, and its applications are extending far beyond language processing, permeating various domains and revolutionizing numerous fields. Particularly, deploying this architecture within the scientific field harbors the potential to propel us towards untapped frontiers of innovation and discovery. While the Transformer has demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks like image recognition6,7, protein representation and protein design8,9,10, and global weather forecasting11, and has shown promise in various quantum physics applications12,13,14, its potential for solving molecular Schrödinger equations through efficient autoregressive sampling and systematic application to complex chemical systems remains underexplored. Therefore, it is both fundamentally intriguing and practically important to explore the design of efficient Transformer-based architectures specifically tailored for solving the Schrödinger equation. Such architectures are expected to unlock new levels of understanding and advancements in quantum chemistry.

In principle, the electronic structure and properties of all materials can be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation to obtain the wave function. However, in practice, it is a significant challenge to find a general approach to reduce the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function and extract its essential features. Various methods have been developed to solve the Schrödinger equation for realistic systems. Considering the fermionic nature of electrons, Slater determinants are used to represent the electron systems, ensuring that the wave function obeys exchange antisymmetric symmetries. While the full configuration interaction (FCI) method provides a comprehensive approach to obtain the exact wavefunction, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space limits the size of feasible FCI simulations. To approximate the exact energy, several strategies have been devised, including perturbation theories15,16, the truncated configuration interaction which takes into account arbitrary linear combinations of excitations up to a certain order17, the coupled-cluster (CC) method which takes into account certain nonlinear combinations of excitations up to a certain order (e.g., CCSD, CCSD(T))18, the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm19,20 which uses the one-dimensional matrix product state wave function ansatz, or the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method21,22,23 which works for any wave function ansatz. However, these methods can fail in numerous cases, mostly due to the limited expressive power of the wave function ansatz.

In 2017, Carleo and Troyer proposed their seminal work on the neural network quantum state (NNQS) algorithm, which introduced a groundbreaking approach for tackling many-spin systems within the exponentially large Hilbert space24. The main idea behind NNQS is to parameterize the quantum wave function with a neural network and optimize its parameters stochastically using the VMC algorithm. They also demonstrated that the neural network ansatz, when dealing with many-body quantum states, is more expressive than the tensor network states25,26,27,28,29, and its computational cost typically scales polynomially30. Moreover, as a general feature of Monte Carlo methods, large-scale parallelization can provide notable performance advantages. The NNQS framework has evolved along two distinct paths: first quantization14,30,31, which works directly in continuous space, and second quantization12,13,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42, which operates in a discrete basis. While first quantization methods naturally incorporate the complete basis set limit, they face challenges in sampling efficiency, particularly for larger systems where Markov chain sampling can become ineffective. Second quantization methods, though better at enforcing symmetries and boundary conditions, encounter scalability limitations due to the rapid growth of computational costs with system size. Current implementations face two major challenges: the computational burden of energy evaluation, which scales as the fourth power of the number of spin orbitals, and the increasing complexity of neural network architectures required for larger systems32,33. Molecular systems present additional challenges due to their complex electronic correlation patterns. This complexity demands highly expressive models that can be efficiently scaled to capture intricate quantum effects while remaining computationally tractable. The development of such models, capable of balancing expressiveness with computational efficiency, remains a central challenge in the field.

In this work, we present QiankunNet (Qiankun meaning “heaven and earth” in Chinese), a NNQS framework that combines the expressivity of Transformer architectures with efficient autoregressive sampling. At the heart of our approach lies a Transformer-based wave function ansatz that captures complex quantum correlations through its attention mechanism, effectively learning the structure of many-body states while maintaining parameter efficiency independent of system size, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Building upon the autoregressive sampling approach introduced in the Neural Autoregressive Quantum States (NAQS) method by Barrett et al.33, we develop an efficient batched implementation that reformulates quantum state sampling as a tree-structured generation process. While NAQS demonstrated autoregressive sampling for quantum states, our implementation specifically leverages the Transformer architecture's parallel processing capabilities and introduces several key innovations: we adopt a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based autoregressive sampling approach that introduces a hybrid breadth-first/depth-first search (BFS/DFS) strategy. This provides more sophisticated control over the sampling process through a tunable parameter that allows adjustment of the balance between exploration breadth and depth. Specifically, our approach first uses BFS to accumulate a certain number of samples, then performs batch-wise DFS sampling. This strategy significantly reduces memory usage while enabling computation of larger and deeper quantum systems by managing the exponential growth of the sampling tree more efficiently. We also implement explicit multi-process parallelization for distributed sampling, going beyond the single-process GPU parallelization used in NAQS. This enables our method to partition unique sample generation across multiple processes, significantly improving scalability for large quantum systems. Moreover, our implementation incorporates key-value (KV) caching specifically designed for Transformer-based architectures. While NAQS uses MLP-based models that don't benefit from such caching, our Transformer-based approach achieves substantial speedups by avoiding redundant computations of attention keys and values during the autoregressive generation process. This approach eliminates the need for Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, allowing direct generation of uncorrelated electron configurations. The framework is further enhanced by our physics-informed initialization scheme that incorporates truncated configuration interaction solutions, providing a principled starting point for variational optimization and significantly accelerates convergence. The framework's efficiency stems from our parallel implementation of local energy evaluation, utilizing a compressed Hamiltonian representation that significantly reduces memory requirements and computational cost. The sampling implementation employs an efficient pruning mechanism based on electron number conservation, substantially reducing the sampling space while maintaining physical validity. This combination of architectural innovations and computational optimizations enables QiankunNet to achieve both high accuracy and robust convergence. Our systematic benchmarks demonstrate unprecedented accuracy across diverse chemical systems: for molecular systems up to 30 spin orbitals, we achieve correlation energies reaching 99.9% of the FCI benchmark; most notably, in treating the Fenton reaction mechanism, QiankunNet successfully handles a large CAS(46e,26o) active space, enabling accurate description of complex transition metal electronic structure. These advances, from weak intermolecular forces to strongly correlated transition metal systems, demonstrate QiankunNet's broad applicability and pave the way for accurate quantum chemical calculations of previously intractable large-scale molecular systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we first present the theoretical framework of QiankunNet, followed by detailed benchmarks on various molecular systems, and conclude with discussions on future applications and potential improvements.

a The decoder-only Transformer architecture for the electron wave function ansatz, where the Transformer generates the amplitude ∣ψ(x)∣ and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) generates the phase ϕ(x). The wave function is expressed as ψ(x) = ∣ψ(x)∣eiϕ(x). b Training workflow of the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization. Starting from physics-informed initialization, the model parameters are updated through gradient descent to minimize the energy expectation value. The process involves autoregressive sampling of electron configurations, local energy calculation, and parameter updates via backpropagation.

To validate the effectiveness of QiankunNet, we compute the ground state energies of several molecules with an atomic basis set and compare them to results of other methods, such as Hartree-Fock (HF) and coupled cluster with up to double excitations (CCSD). Using a finite basis set, we can express the molecular Hamiltonian in the second quantized form:

Through the Jordan-Wigner transformation, this electronic Hamiltonian can be mapped to a spin Hamiltonian:

where σi are Pauli string operators and wi are real coefficients.

We also report results from NNQS methods using other neural-network ansatz (NAQS and MADE). As demonstrated in Table 1, QiankunNet achieves chemical accuracy in correlation energies, recovering 99.9% of the FCI ground-truth values across a benchmark set of 16 molecules. The method demonstrates encouraging performance when computing full potential energy surfaces, as evidenced by the C2 and N2 calculations with STO-3G basis set (Fig. 2). Notably, QiankunNet captures the correct qualitative behavior in regions where standard CCSD and CCSD(T) methods show limitations, particularly at dissociation distances where multi-reference character becomes significant. While more advanced methods like DMRG would provide more rigorous benchmarks for strongly correlated systems, our comparison with CCSD and CCSD(T) illustrates QiankunNet's potential for handling challenging electronic structures. A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance with respect to its hyperparameters and pre-training strategies is provided in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S2).

Comparison of the energies obtained using QiankunNet and other traditional quantum chemistry approaches for a C2 and b N2, as a function of the nuclear separation with STO-3G basis set. QiankunNet outperforms all other approximation techniques. It agrees with full configuration interaction (FCI) results well even at structures where both coupled-cluster approaches (CCSD,CCSD(T)) failed due to the presence of strong correlations. FCI represents the exact solution within a given basis set. Source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

When comparing with other second-quantized NNQS approaches, the Transformer-based neural network adopted in QiankunNet can exhibit heightened accuracy. For example, the second quantized approaches, such as MADE method, cannot achieve the chemical accuracy for N2 system, while QiankunNet can achieve an accuracy two orders of magnitude higher. Another advanced second quantized method, NAQS, employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) augmented with hard-coded pre- and post-processing steps to maintain the autoregressive property. However, the complexity of NAQS's neural network scales with the number of spin orbitals, leading to a dramatic increase in computational demands and memory usage as the system size grows. For instance, for a C2H4O molecule with 38 spin orbitals, the GPU VRAM requirement soars to an unsustainable 454 GB, far surpassing the 80GB memory capacity of an A100 GPU. Conversely, QiankunNet incorporates a decoder-only Transformer, making the number of network parameters independent of the number of spin orbitals (our model can potentially be simultaneously used for systems with different numbers of spin orbitals), as a result, QiankunNet demonstrates a more favorable time scaling compared to NAQS, for systems with fewer than 24 spin orbitals, NAQS calculation is faster. However, when assessing a system with 30 spin orbitals, like Li2O, QiankunNet boasts a computational speed 10 times faster than NAQS, and the calculations with QiankunNet can be extended to chemical systems up to 92 spin-orbitals, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Beyond speed, our QiankunNet also exhibits higher accuracy. For instance, in the Li2O case, while NAQS captures 98.1% of the electron correlation energy, QiankunNet recovers an impressive 99.9% of the electron correlation energy. We also perform the calculation for the C2H4O molecule comprising 38 spin orbitals, and our method yields an energy of −151.1228 Ha, which is 2.32 mHa lower than the MADE approach (−151.12048 Ha)34. A detailed analysis of QiankunNet against other state-of-the-art Neural NNQS methods is presented in the Supplementary Information (Sec. S5, Tab. S2 and Fig. S1). We have also included results for the N2 molecule with bond length 2.118 Bohr in the cc-pVDZ basis set, which represents a significant computational challenge beyond the reach of conventional FCI methods. The N2/cc-pVDZ system (56 qubits, 14 electrons) contains 1.402 × 1012 configurations, making it intractable for FCI calculations. To our knowledge, no existing NNQS approaches have successfully tackled molecular systems of this scale in the full cc-pVDZ basis without approximations. Our method achieves a ground-state energy of −109.2788 Ha, which differs from the best DMRG result (−109.2821 Ha)43 by only 3.3 mHa. This represents the first demonstration of an NNQS method successfully handling a molecular system with over 1012 configurations, showcasing the method's capability beyond small, trivially-solvable systems. It is worth noting that our current calculation employs RHF orbitals as the single-particle basis. As demonstrated in quantum Monte Carlo studies44, using UHF orbitals typically leads to lower variational energies than using RHF orbitals. We expect that adopting UHF orbitals would further improve our energy and bring it even closer to the DMRG benchmark. However, even with RHF orbitals, our method achieves an accuracy within chemical precision (3.3 mHa), demonstrating the robustness of our approach across different orbital choices.

The measurements here refer to the wall-clock time during which these two methods perform calculations until convergence is achieved. All runtime measurements were obtained with exclusive access to computational resources to ensure accurate benchmarking. Experiments were conducted on one NVIDIA A100 GPU. Source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

Building upon these promising results, we now turn our attention to more complex reactions. The Fenton reaction, a fundamental process involving Fe(II) oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, plays a crucial role in biological oxidative stress and has significant implications in cellular damage mechanisms. Since its discovery in 189445, this reaction has been the subject of intense mechanistic debate46,47,48. While the mechanistic details remain controversial, here we focus on examining the electronic structure of its key step using our NNQS approach. Specifically, we study the homolytic dissociation of H2O2 catalyzed by aqueous Fe(II) at low pH, which generates OH• radicals and Fe(III) species:

We focus on the electronic structure of the reaction's key step: the homolytic bond dissociation in [Fe(H2O)5H2O2]2+. This octahedral complex, formed by substituting one water molecule in [Fe(H2O)6]2+ with hydrogen peroxide, serves as a model system for studying the aqueous ferrous ion's reactivity. The transition state geometry was optimized at the UB3LYP/def2-TZVP level of theory49. Our quantum simulation employs a CAS(46e,26o) active space with cc-pVTZ basis sets, where the active orbitals are selected using the automated AVAS (Automated Virtual Active Space) method49 (computational details are provided in Supplementary Information, Sec. S6, Tab. S3). This represents a significant expansion compared to previous studies 49 that employed a CAS(20e,13o) active space targeting only O2s+2p and Fe 3d electron shells. As shown in Fig. 4, our calculations reveal a higher transition state barrier (83 kcal/mol compared with 65 kcal/mol in previous work). The combination of a large basis set (cc-pVTZ) and extensive active space (46e,26o) enables us to accurately capture the electronic structure evolution during Fe-O bond cleavage. This success is particularly significant for transition metal chemistry, where the multi-reference character of electronic structures often challenges traditional methods. However, for a more complete description of this system, several additional factors need to be considered. While we use the relatively large cc-pVTZ basis set, even larger basis sets might be necessary for achieving higher accuracy in transition metal systems. Additionally, relativistic effects can significantly influence the electronic structure of transition metal complexes. Furthermore, given that this reaction occurs in solution, the inclusion of solvation effects is particularly important for obtaining quantitatively accurate energetics. These factors, while beyond the scope of our current study focusing on the electronic structure of the gas phase reaction, are crucial considerations for future investigations aiming at a comprehensive understanding of the Fenton reaction mechanism.

The blue curve represents our work using an expanded (46e,26o) active space, while the green dashed curve shows previous results from ref. 49 using a (20e, 13o) active space. The reaction pathway exhibits three distinct stages: initial formation of [Fe(H2O)5(H2O2)]2+ through H2O2 coordination to the octahedral [Fe(H2O)6]2+ complex (left molecular structure); transition state featuring O-O bond elongation (middle); and product state comprising an OH• radical and [Fe(OH)(H2O)5]2+ complex (right). Our larger active space calculations reveal a higher energy barrier (83 kcal/mol, compared with 65 kcal/mol) and more pronounced energy differences along the reaction pathway, particularly in the transition and product regions. Electronic structure calculations were performed incorporating Fe 3d and O 2s+2p shells with cc-pVTZ basis sets. Source data for the results are provided as a Source Data file.

In this study, we introduce QiankunNet, which adapts the Transformer architecture to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation. This marks a significant advancement in applying language model architectures to understand quantum electronic structures—the fundamental language of microscopic nature. Just as Transformer models have revolutionized NLP and protein structure prediction, we demonstrate their potential in capturing the intricate patterns of electron wave functions.

We acknowledge the pioneering work of Psiformer14 in applying attention mechanisms to electron–electron interactions. Through first-quantization approaches and complete variational treatment of basis sets, Psiformer achieved impressive absolute energies. Our approach complements this development by incorporating active space methods, allowing us to focus on chemically relevant orbitals and directly apply physical and chemical insights. This proves particularly advantageous when dealing with complex electronic structures and weak interactions. QiankunNet's distinctive feature lies in its decoder-only Transformer architecture combined with MCTS autoregressive sampling. Unlike traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods that require sample rejection and suffer from correlation issues, our autoregressive approach generates independent samples directly. The network learns during both sampling and inference phases, enhancing efficiency through parallel batch processing. This design makes QiankunNet particularly well-suited for GPU acceleration and large-scale applications.

This study establishes a fundamental connection between language modeling architectures and quantum electronic structure calculations. By adapting Transformer models to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation, we demonstrate their capability in capturing complex quantum mechanical phenomena. The success of neural network wavefunctions in ab initio calculations, exemplified by approaches like Psiformer and QiankunNet, suggests a promising direction for quantum chemistry. These methods combine high accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency, offering new possibilities for electronic structure calculations of complex molecular systems. The integration of physical insights through active space methods and direct sampling techniques further enhances their practical utility. We anticipate that such neural network-based approaches will become increasingly important tools in quantum chemistry, complementing existing methods in tackling challenging molecular systems.

In the study of quantum systems, we encounter complex structures characterized by N interacting components, each represented by discrete quantum variables \(\left\vert {{{\bf{x}}}}\right\rangle=\{{x}_{1},{x}_{2},...{x}_{N}\}\). These variables might represent various physical quantities such as spin state or particle occupation numbers. The challenge lies in describing the many-body wave function, which establishes a sophisticated mapping between the configuration space and a vast landscape of complex numbers.

where each configuration is represented by an occupation number vector \(\left\vert {{{\bf{x}}}}\right\rangle=\{{x}_{1},{x}_{2},...,{x}_{N}\}\), with xi ∈ {0, 1} indicating whether the i-th spin orbital is occupied or not. This mapping encodes both magnitude and phase information of the quantum state, essentially serving as a transformation engine that converts a given many-body configuration x into its corresponding quantum mechanical description Ψ(x). By leveraging artificial neural networks, we aim to construct an efficient approximation of the wave function's behavior. This neural network approach effectively creates a trainable computational framework that learns to replicate the wave function's response to different input configurations. Among the various neural architectures available in modern machine learning, we focus our investigation on the Transformer framework, particularly in its application to quantum many-body systems. The Transformer architecture implements a sophisticated attention-based structure: an embedding layer that maps the physical configurations into a high-dimensional representation space, followed by multiple self-attention layers that capture the intricate correlations between quantum variables. The architecture is particularly well-suited for quantum systems due to its ability to model long-range interactions and complex quantum correlations through its multi-head attention mechanism. The connection between NLP and quantum chemistry represents a substantive interdisciplinary bridge rather than a superficial analogy. By establishing a formal mathematical isomorphism between configuration strings in quantum systems and sentences in language models, we address the shared challenge of exponential complexity that has long hindered progress in both fields. Specifically, the Hilbert space dimension of 2N for N spin orbitals parallels the exponential growth of possible sentences in natural language, creating a compelling theoretical foundation for methodological transfer. In our implementation, Transformer architectures represent quantum wave functions with quantum bitstrings serving as inputs to predict the wave function. Particularly noteworthy is how the autoregressive property of Transformers enables efficient modeling of conditional probabilities in quantum states, mirroring their function in language prediction.

Our QiankunNet consists of two complementary sub-networks: the amplitude sub-network and the phase sub-network. This dual-network architecture effectively captures both the magnitude and phase information necessary to fully describe a quantum state:

where the amplitude sub-network is constructed using a Transformer decoder to represent the probability ∣Ψ(x)∣2, while the phase sub-network ϕ(x) employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as shown in Fig. 1a. The Transformer architecture1,5 is built from layers, each containing a self-attention component composed of multiple independent attention heads. These heads operate in parallel, each with its own set of parameters, allowing the network to simultaneously learn different types of correlations. Within each head, the attention mechanism works by computing how relevant each input position is to every other position, creating a rich network of relationships within the quantum state configuration. The processing of quantum states through our Transformer network follows a carefully designed sequence of steps. The initial state of the decoder is calculated using the input token vector and the position embedding matrix. We prepare the input by adding a special marker (a zero bit) at the beginning of the binary configuration. This augmented input then undergoes an embedding process, where each binary value is transformed into a rich, high-dimensional representation that captures the quantum mechanical properties of the system. The network takes as input a token/qubit vector x = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} of length n, which is transformed into embeddings:

where e(xi) represents the dmodel-dimensional learnable embedding of token xi, P is the matrix of learnable position embeddings, and PE(0) contains the combined embeddings for the input sequence at the initial layer. Position information plays a crucial role in quantum states, so we incorporate learned positional encodings for each site in the configuration. These encodings help the network understand the spatial relationships between different components of the quantum system. The embedded and position-encoded information then flows through multiple identical Transformer layers. Each layer in our architecture processes the quantum state information through several stages. The masked multi-head attention mechanism allows the network to learn complex correlations while maintaining the autoregressive property—ensuring that each position only influences those that come after it. For each decoder layer l = 1, 2, …, L, the following operations are performed: The masked multi-head self-attention mechanism computes:

where \(Q=P{E}^{(l-1)}{W}_{Q}^{(l)}\), \(K=P{E}^{(l-1)}{W}_{K}^{(l)}\), and \(V=P{E}^{(l-1)}{W}_{V}^{(l)}\) are the queries, keys, and values linearly transformed from the positionally encoded embeddings PE(l−1), M is the mask ensuring autoregressive property, and dk is the dimension of the keys. Residual connections and layer normalization are applied:

where Sublayer(l)(PE(l−1)) represents the output of the masked multi-head self-attention sublayer for layer l. Position-wise feed-forward networks with GeLU activation function process the information:

where \({W}_{1}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}\times {d}_{{{{\rm{ff}}}}}}\) and \({W}_{2}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{ff}}}}}\times {d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}}\) are weight matrices, \({b}_{1}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{ff}}}}}}\) and \({b}_{2}^{(l)}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}}\) are bias vectors, and GeLU is the Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation function. The output for the next layer is set as:

which serves as input to the next layer or as the final output if l = L. After processing through L layers, the Transformer decoder's final output undergoes linear transformation and softmax activation to produce the conditional probability distribution:

where \({W}_{{{{\rm{out}}}}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{d}_{{{{\rm{model}}}}}\times {d}_{{{{\rm{out}}}}}}\) is the projection weight matrix for the output layer, and dout is the dimension of the output space. The probability of a sequence x = (x1, x2, …, xn) can be factorized as a product of conditional probabilities:

expressing the joint probability P(x) of the sequence as the product of conditional probabilities of each element xi given its preceding elements. The complex probability amplitude Ψ(x) for sequence x is defined as:

Here, Ψ(x) combines the square root of probability P(x) with a complex phase factor eiϕ(x). The phase ϕ(x) is represented by a Multi-Layer Perceptron network that processes the input sequence x and outputs a real-valued phase, effectively encoding the complex quantum correlations present in the electronic wavefunction.

Monte Carlo sampling is used to generate samples {x1, x2, …, xN} for quantum states. A common choice is a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) black-box sampler. MCMC is a class of algorithms based on Markov chains for random sample generation, where the production of each state depends only on the previous state. A classic example of MCMC is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which uses an acceptance-rejection mechanism to decide whether to move to a new state.

It can be seen that a Markov chain that gradually approximates the target distribution \({p}_{\overrightarrow{\theta }}({{{\bf{x}}}})\) is constructed, so that the distribution of states on the chain eventually matches the target distribution. However, MCMC involves the sequential assessment of proposed configurations, while the computational cost increases in relation to both the desired quality of the sample collection and the overall quantity of samples. With a Metropolis sampling scheme, Choo et al.32 observed that the performance was highly dependent on the number of samples used, but this was constrained to a maximum batch size of Ns = 106. For VMC-based quantum chemistry, a more efficient scheme called autoregressive sampling can be introduced, which generates independent, uncorrelated samples directly from the target distribution. Rather than trying to model the distribution over every possible configuration of these discrete variables simultaneously, autoregressive sampling builds the distribution sequentially. It takes advantage of the fact that the probability of a specific configuration can be decomposed into the product of conditional probabilities. This approach allows for sampling one variable at a time, given the values of the previously sampled variables, thus reducing the complexity and computational burden significantly. Autoregressive sampling algorithm generates probability distributions p(x) of the special form

The autoregressive sampling scheme allows for the generation of exact samples without the need for a pre-thermalization step or the discarding of intermediate samples (which is necessary in Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to avoid autocorrelations). This makes autoregressive neural networks generally more efficient than MC sampling. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the generation of a single quantum state configuration uses QiankunNet's sequential autoregressive sampling scheme. The architecture shows how each orbital's occupation probability is computed conditionally based on previously sampled orbitals through the Transformer decoder layers. The probability distribution of the quantum states can be efficiently sampled by leveraging the factorization property ∣Ψ(x)∣2 = ∣Ψ(x1)∣2∣Ψ(x2∣x1)∣2∣Ψ(x3∣x1, x2)∣2 ⋯ ∣Ψ(xN∣x1, …, xN−1)∣2 and the masked attention mechanism that ensures the network output at position n only depends on positions m<n. We implement the sampling procedure by generating one bit at a time: we first compute ∣Ψ(x1)∣2 and sample the first bit x1, then using the sampled x1, we compute ∣Ψ(x2∣x1)∣2 and sample x2, followed by computing ∣Ψ(x3∣x1, x2)∣2 and sampling x3 using all previous bits, and so on until all N bits have been sampled. This sequential sampling strategy is essential for the VMC optimization of our neural quantum states, as it enables simultaneous sampling and network training: while generating configurations for energy estimation, the network parameters can be updated through gradient computation, effectively integrating the sampling and optimization processes into a unified workflow.

This approach consists of decoder layers that process sequential conditional probabilities, where each step computes the conditional probability of a quantum variable vk given its previous variables. The network includes a phase subnetwork that computes the phase ϕk, and all components contribute to the final wave function ∣ψk∣. The dashed arrows indicate the autoregressive sampling process, where each variable is sampled conditionally on previously generated variables. Green boxes represent input tokens \({v}_{k}^{i}\) at different positions in the sequence. Blue boxes denote the Transformer decoder layers and phase subnetwork components. Orange boxes show the sampling operations at each step. Red dashed boxes highlight the newly sampled variables at each step, while green solid boxes indicate previously sampled variables that serve as context for subsequent sampling. The summation symbol (∑) represents the aggregation of all contributions to compute the final wave function amplitude.

Moreover, our training employs a dynamic sample adjustment mechanism that monitors the number of unique quantum states generated during sampling and automatically adjusts the total sample size accordingly. Through this adaptive approach, the sampling process naturally adjusts to the complexity of different molecular systems and the convergence state of the model, ensuring efficient training without manual tuning of sampling parameters for each specific case. The sampling process naturally forms a Monte Carlo quaternary tree structure, where each layer corresponds to a spatial orbital. While our model represents each spin–orbital as a binary token (0 or 1), the MCTS algorithm groups spin-orbitals by spatial orbital for efficiency. Since each spatial orbital contains two spin-orbitals (spin-up and spin-down), this yields four possible combined states at each tree node: “00”, “01”, “10”, or “11”. This grouping reduces the tree depth from 2N to N levels for a system with N spatial orbitals, effectively building up the complete electronic configuration through a hierarchical sampling process. Figure 6 illustrates our batched autoregressive sampling implementation. Fig. 6a presents the algorithm for generating a single configuration, showing how orbital occupations are sampled sequentially with electron number constraints. Fig. 6b depicts the tree structure used for batch generation, where multiple samples are generated simultaneously using a combination of breadth-first search (BFS) for the first few orbitals followed by depth-first search (DFS) for the remaining orbitals. This hybrid approach balances exploration diversity with memory efficiency. In the initial phase, the system explores the first few orbital positions using BFS, assigning probability weights to possible orbital configurations. This ensures reasonable coverage of the sampling space, avoiding premature convergence to local optima. Subsequently, the system shifts to a DFS strategy for processing the remaining orbital positions, a key design primarily aimed at optimizing computational resources, especially memory usage. Through this depth-first approach, the system only needs to retain state information of the current sampling path in memory, rather than simultaneously storing complete states of all possible paths, significantly reducing memory requirements, as shown in Algorithm 2 within Supplementary Information. This memory-efficient design enables the model to handle larger-scale quantum systems without being strictly limited by hardware resources. This hybrid sampling strategy is not only more efficient in computational resource utilization but also maintains sampling diversity while guiding the sample distribution to converge to the minimum energy quantum state configuration, accurately characterizing the ground state properties of quantum many-body systems. A key feature of our MCTS sampling implementation is the incorporation of physical constraints through efficient pruning strategies. Since the total number of electrons Ne is conserved in quantum chemical systems, we can significantly reduce the sampling space by eliminating invalid branches of the sampling tree. This pruning mechanism ensures that we only sample physically meaningful configurations while significantly reducing the computational cost. This tree-like structure of our sampling procedure bears resemblance to the MCTS used in AlphaGo50, but with a crucial distinction: while AlphaGo's MCTS relies on extensive backtracking to explore the game tree and evaluate different strategies, our method employs pure forward autoregressive sampling without any backtracking. This fundamental difference arises from the distinct nature of quantum state sampling, where our goal is to efficiently generate physically valid electronic configurations that follow the wave function probability distribution, rather than exploring multiple strategic paths as in game-playing scenarios. The absence of backtracking in our approach not only simplifies the sampling process but also significantly enhances its computational efficiency while maintaining the ability to capture the quantum state's probability distribution accurately. This sampling strategy enables the simultaneous generation of multiple configuration samples, dramatically improving the efficiency of quantum Monte Carlo calculations. By generating independent samples directly, we eliminate both the correlation issues inherent in MCMC methods and the computational overhead of backtracking processes, while also enabling more accurate estimation of physical observables through larger sample batches. In Fig. 7, we showcase a comparison between the performance of MCMC sampling and the MCTS method for H2O system. From this comparison, it becomes evident that the computational time of the MCMC method increases as the number of samples grows, and the low acceptance probability associated with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm renders it inefficient for larger sample sizes. In contrast, the computational time of the MCTS method exhibits a nearly constant behavior, since it is primarily dependent on the number of unique samples. A computational efficiency improvement of several orders of magnitude is achieved compared to the MCMC method. Figure 7b illustrates that, with the same number of samples (e.g., 105), the MCTS method achieves chemical accuracy within 1500 steps, whereas the MCMC method fails to attain chemical accuracy even after an extensive number of steps.

a The autoregressive sampling (AS) algorithm generates one sample per run. Each node in (b) corresponds to a particular local sampling outcome, and the number on the edge pointing to each circle indicates the weight. Ns can be chosen to be any number (Ns = 1000 is used as an example). Each node has four possible states (unoccupied, spin-up, spin-down, or doubly occupied). The sampling proceeds layer by layer, with each layer corresponding to one orbital's occupation state. This sampling strategy combines Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) approaches. The tree is naturally pruned based on electron number conservation: branches that would lead to configurations with incorrect total electron numbers are eliminated (shown in gray dashed lines). This pruning significantly reduces the sampling space and ensures that only physically valid configurations are generated.

a The time comparison of H2O system for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) autoregressive sampling methods. In both cases, the QiankunNet is used for the wave function ansatz. b The convergence comparison of H2O between MCMC and MCTS sampling methods. Ns  = 105 is used as an example, where Ns denotes the number of samples used in the variational Monte Carlo calculation for estimating the energy expectation value.

The VMC algorithm then proceeds iteratively to optimize QiankunNet using energy as the loss function, as illustrated in Fig. 1b: at each step, we sample configurations from the current wave function ∣Ψ(x)∣2, compute the energy gradient using these samples, and update the network parameters using the AdamW optimizer, for more details, see Supplementary Information, Sec. S3 (Tab. S1). This process continues until we reach convergence, yielding a neural network representation of the ground state that minimizes the energy expectation value.

Collaborations with a higher proportion of unpublished researchers can yield papers that present groundbreaking ideas.Credit: Stígur Már Karlsson/Heimsmyndir via Getty

What characteristics drive scientific discovery? Experience is often seen as key, with success coming from years of knowledge building and collaboration. This is certainly true for most Nobel Prize laureates, who have an average age of 58.

However, research teams with high fractions of beginners — authors with no prior publication history — tend to be more disruptive and innovative, found a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 12 September1.

Actively integrating beginners into research groups could boost the disruptive and innovative qualities of the work by having fewer collaborators who are burdened by knowledge, the authors say. “Beginner scientists have less loyalty to prevailing assumptions, and they can take more intellectual freedom,” says co-author Raiyan Abdul Baten, a computational social scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa. 

Can creativity in science be learnt? These researchers think so

Can creativity in science be learnt? These researchers think so

This pattern was first noticed by researchers during a study of whether artificial intelligence can predict how innovative and disruptive a paper will be in its scientific domain2. In the new study, the team analysed more than 28 million articles from SciSciNet-v2, a data lake for the science of science research. These scientific papers spanned 146 fields and were published between 1971 and 2021.

Disruption scores were calculated by comparing how many citations a paper has garnered compared with the papers that it referenced. A disruptive paper that was cited more times than were the papers it referenced could, for example, disprove an established theory and offer an alternative hypothesis.

During the analysis, Baten and his colleagues noticed a link between a paper's disruptiveness and the number of beginner authors, which led them to partition data by authors' ‘career age' — defined as the number of years since their first publication. Beginner authors were those with no prior publications.

They were surprised to find that papers with a higher proportion of beginner authors tended to be more disruptive than were papers with more early-career or senior authors. Disruption scores were highest when beginners made up the entire team, but they were also high when beginners were paired with co-authors with track records of producing disruptive work. Papers with the highest ratio of beginner authors consistently showed a positive correlation between disruption and citation count.

“As the fraction of beginners increases in teams, the disruptivity and innovation go up,” says Baten. “Across team sizes, decades and disciplines, we found these results to be robust,” he adds.

What makes a good PhD student?

What makes a good PhD student?

Why do collaborations with more beginners tend to be more disruptive? The researchers speculate that these scientists offer new perspectives because they are less attached to previous theories and knowledge than are their more experienced colleagues. “Sometimes, it is difficult to unlearn the prevailing assumptions then adopt radically new ones,” says Baten. This could allow early-career scientists to be more receptive to new ideas and more likely to take risks by exploring experimental approaches, he says.

Too many papers, too little time.Credit: Hulton Archive/Stringer/Getty

The challenge of staying up to date with the scientific literature has become a burden for everyone from students to senior investigators. In fields such as public health, annual publication counts now exceed half a million articles — more than 1,300 papers every day. Experienced researchers and early-career scientists alike report anxiety about falling behind and emphasize the importance of building efficient reading habits. Some have noted that the pressure to keep up has left many scientists increasingly reliant on social media and recommendation systems to find papers, rather than systematic reading. 

What's clear is that the difficulty of keeping up with the literature is no longer a niche problem, but one that cuts across disciplines, methodologies and seniority levels. As researchers at different stages of our scientific journeys — a PhD student, a mid-career investigator and a senior group leader — we, too, have faced this challenge. Collectively, we have spent decades navigating the scientific literature, testing different ways to filter information and adapting to the accelerating pace of publication. 

Here, we offer five complementary strategies to help you filter the literature and stay up to date on your research field. These are the strategies that we have found to be the most effective, and we hope that they will help others, too, whatever their field or career stage.

One of the simplest and most reliable ways to stay current is through journal table of contents (ToC) alerts. This conventional method might seem outdated in the age of personalized algorithms, but subscribing to a carefully curated selection of journals remains a sound strategy. Often, ToC alerts highlight key articles and provide direct links to abstracts or full texts. Some can even filter by article type and have specific alerts for reviews, editorials, research articles or methods papers.

Bluesky's science takeover: 70% of Nature poll respondents use platform

Receiving a curated list of new papers from a handful of reputable journals provides a structured and predictable way to remain grounded in the core literature of your field. It's particularly helpful for recognizing recurring themes, spotting important reviews and following long-term shifts in editorial priorities — all without needing to actively search. We recommend subscribing to a blend of landmark and niche journals to capture both broad and field-specific research. 

You might miss important articles published in journals that fall outside your alert list. When browsing long tables of contents, especially under time pressure, it's easy to skim over titles that later prove relevant. Still, for many researchers, ToC alerts remain a first line of defence against information overload. 

Moving beyond broad overviews, use platforms such as PubMed and Google Scholar to create a personalized surveillance system that monitors the literature for the topics, authors or keywords that matter to you. Users can set up saved searches and automated alerts, which can be configured to arrive weekly or monthly by e-mail. 

Queries can incorporate Boolean operators (such as ‘AND', ‘OR' and ‘NOT') and be polished to reduce the number of irrelevant hits. This method is particularly useful for capturing articles that appear in lesser-known journals or are outside your usual reading scope. 

The same can be done for preprint servers such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, which allow users to set up RSS (really simple syndication) feeds or e-mail alerts on the basis of keywords, authors or subject areas. Including preprints in your alerts can give you early insight into emerging findings, methods and controversies because they frequently appear weeks or even months before peer-reviewed publication. 

That said, custom alerts require maintenance. Poorly constructed queries can return overwhelming — and often irrelevant — results. And even well-designed alerts can pile up in your inbox, adding to the very overload they're meant to reduce. Still, when used properly, search alerts across both peer-reviewed databases and preprint repositories can surface important literature with remarkable precision. 

Although many tools focus on topics or journals, an increasingly effective way to filter literature is to follow the researchers themselves. Professional networks such as ResearchGate and LinkedIn allow scientists to receive updates directly from the people and labs they care about. This person-centred approach can be particularly powerful for those who already know the key players in their field and want to monitor their scientific output in a more digestible, progressive format. For instance, ResearchGate can notify you when someone you follow uploads a new publication, preprint or data set. It also generates curated suggestions on the basis of your reading habits, recommendations and profile interests. These help to surface work that might otherwise be missed. Unlike static e-mail alerts, these feeds evolve as your network grows, offering a dynamic way to stay informed. 

This approach also has the advantage of reinforcing professional awareness. Associating papers with specific individuals or groups can help to contextualize findings, track thematic trajectories in laboratories and even identify potential collaborators or competitors. Some authors also post supplementary materials or tutorials that aren't always accessible through conventional journals, adding important context. 

Of course, not all researchers upload their work promptly, and some don't use these platforms at all. As with social media, the quality of your feed is only as strong as the network you build. Still, for those willing to invest the time, following the people behind the papers offers a valuable, filtered window into the scientific landscape. A good tip for getting started is to identify active users in your field and screen their followers and followings for inspiration. 

Researchers increasingly use social-media platforms such as X and Bluesky to share their latest publications, discuss preprints, highlight interesting studies and comment on scientific developments. Following the right accounts can provide a curated stream of relevant papers and ideas, often before they appear in journals or search alerts. These platforms also allow you to interact with researchers you might otherwise meet only at conferences — or perhaps be too shy to approach in person.

Researchers studying certain viruses must use personal protective equipment and follow strict procedures in biosafety facilities. Credit: Jean-Francois Monier/AFP via Getty

In an opinion piece published in The New York Times in March, two leading virologists argued that experiments on a coronavirus found in bats and similar to those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) had been conducted without sufficient safety measures. The experiments involved infecting human cells with the live bat virus to see how the virus behaved1.

Regulatory authorities in many countries where research on potentially dangerous viruses is conducted, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, would require such studies to be conducted in biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities. (There are four biosafety levels, with BSL-4 being the most stringent.) But for these experiments — which were approved by the equivalent authorities in China — the 25 researchers across 7 institutes and universities in China (including the Guangzhou National Laboratory and the Wuhan Institute of Virology) used BSL-2 procedures. They also used a negative pressure ventilation system designed to prevent microorganisms from spreading outside the laboratory.

In our view, this work and the discussion it has provoked highlights a broader and growing problem that the entire virology community needs to address. On the one hand, the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases is growing2,3 (see ‘A growing threat'), making investigations of potentially dangerous viruses more important. On the other hand, since the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in virology and science more broadly has declined and work on viruses has become more politicized.

To improve trust in science — and to ensure that essential work on viruses can continue — international, standardized and transparent biosafety guidance is urgently needed. Here, we lay out how such guidance might be developed.

Source: Ref. 6

Over the past 30–40 years, various protocols and procedures have been introduced to reduce the risk of viruses escaping from labs, or of people being infected by viruses used in research.

Today, researchers in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada and the United States, can work on certain ‘dangerous' viruses only if they use biosafety cabinets, personal protective equipment and strict standardized procedures for BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities. The use of negative pressure, which ensures that the air in a facility leaves through a filter that captures pathogens, and strict controls over access to the facility are also required.

Which viruses qualify as dangerous is decided by the government of each country, and is usually listed as an appendix to the regulations governing the work. In the United States, federal funding for research involving the enhancement of viruses that cause influenza, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — whether through the use of genetic manipulation or by harnessing natural evolutionary processes — was banned in 2014. The ban was lifted in 2017, but research is only permitted after a stringent review process and with the use of BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities4. These rules are likely to change again under the current US administration.

In China, national biosafety laws were updated in 2004 and 2020. These require investigators undertaking studies on potentially pathogenic living organisms to use BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities, among other strict precautions5. It is unclear exactly how these rules are enforced, however. They don't seem to have been applied to the experiments on the MERS-like coronavirus found in bats, which were approved by the Wuhan Institute of Virology institutional biosafety committee.

The level of detail included in regulations also varies. For example, Canada uses the Canadian Biosafety Standard, which lays out exactly how containment is to be achieved. The United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand have similar standards. Many other countries, however, do not provide such detailed information, although they might provide details of the containment levels necessary for certain pathogens.

This patchwork regulation has led to confusion in the field. And the lack of transparency has probably made it easier for people to spread misinformation and fake news around the handling of live viruses in research.

More than five years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the controversy about its origins shows no sign of abating. According to the lab-leak theory (now promoted by the administration of US President Donald Trump), research on bat viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to the accidental infection of lab personnel, which in turn sparked the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the institute is known to have been doing research on coronaviruses before the pandemic, there is no firm evidence that it possessed or conducted work on a SARS-CoV-2 precursor virus. Meanwhile, findings indicating that the pandemic resulted from a natural ‘spillover' event, the epicentre of which was the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, continue to accumulate. (A spillover event is the transmission of what is called a zoonotic virus from other animals to humans.)

In our experience, virologists are often reluctant to engage in discussions about work that involves the enhancement of live viruses — either genetically or through natural evolutionary processes — for fear of being caught in the crosshairs or of their own work being shut down, even if it is low risk. But now is not the time to lie low.

The number of outbreaks and deaths caused by viruses such as those that cause SARS, Ebola and mpox has been increasing. Data scientists predict that, if current trends continue, Nipah virus, Machupo virus, coronaviruses and filoviruses will, compared with 2020, cause 4 times as many spillover events and 12 times as many deaths by 2050 because of global travel, climate change, tropical deforestation, and wild-animal hunting and trade6,7.

And although virologists now have various ways of studying viruses that can spread between animals and humans, besides growing fully functional zoonotic viruses in the lab, experiments involving live viruses are key to testing antiviral drugs and vaccines. It's hard to imagine how it would have been possible for researchers to develop COVID-19 vaccines, for instance — estimated to have saved millions of lives since 2021 — without studies on live SARS-CoV-2 (and earlier work on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in animal models.

Given the crisis of mistrust in science and institutions, and an increasingly fractured geopolitical world, unified international guidelines are crucial for protecting essential research involving dangerous viruses.

Centralized, standardized guidelines would be analogous to the guidelines for research on human embryos produced by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) — an organization that includes investigators in more than 80 countries. They would be similar to national regulations for research on dangerous viruses, but on a global level. They could lay out what factors might make the use of a particular virus or approach high risk or what benefit-to-cost ratio might justify a research project being pursued or blocked, for example.

Some scenarios should not be allowed to happen. If an investigator is working on the H5N1 bird flu virus in a BSL-3 facility, for instance, they should take strict precautions to prevent viral strains that cause human seasonal flu from entering the facility, even though seasonal flu is not considered a dangerous virus. This is because strains of flu virus can exchange RNA fragments. Such exchange could make H5N1 more transmissible in humans.

Starting today, OpenAI is rolling out ChatGPT safety tools intended for parents to use with their teenagers. This worldwide update includes the ability for parents, as well as law enforcement, to receive notifications if a child—in this case, users between the ages of 13 and 18—engages in chatbot conversations about self harm or suicide.

These changes arrive as OpenAI is being sued by parents who allege ChatGPT played a role in the death of their child. The chatbot allegedly encouraged the suicidal teen to hide a noose in their room out of sight from family members, according to reporting from The New York Times.

As a whole, the content experience for teens using ChatGPT is altered with this update. ""Once parents and teens connect their accounts, the teen account will automatically get additional content protections,” reads OpenAI's blog post announcing the launch. “Including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent roleplay, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate.""

Under the new restrictions, if a teen using a ChatGPT account enters a prompt related to self-harm or suicidal ideation, the prompt is sent to a team of human reviewers who decide whether to trigger a potential parental notification.

""We will contact you as a parent in every way we can,” says Lauren Haber Jonas, OpenAI's head of youth well-being. Parents can opt to receive these alerts over text, email, and a notification from the ChatGPT app.

The warnings parents may receive in these situations are expected to arrive within hours of the conversation being flagged for review. In moments where every minute counts, this delay will likely be frustrating for parents who want more instant alerts about their child's safety. OpenAI is working to reduce the lag time for notifications.

The alert that could potentially be sent to parents by OpenAI will broadly state that the child may have written a prompt related to suicide or self harm. It may also include conversation strategies from mental health experts for the parents to use while talking with their child.

In a prelaunch demo, the example email's subject line shown to WIRED highlighted safety concerns but did not explicitly mention suicide. What the parental notifications also won't include are any direct quotes from the child's conversation—neither the prompts nor the outputs. Parents can follow up with the notification and request conversation time stamps.

""We want to give parents enough information to take action and have a conversation with their teens while still maintaining some amount of teen privacy,” says Jonas, “because the content can also include other sensitive information.""

Both the parent's and the teen's accounts have to be opted-in for these safety features to be activated. This means parents will need to send their teen an invitation to have their account monitored, and the teen is required to accept it. The account linkage can also be initiated by the teen.

OpenAI may contact law enforcement in situations where human moderators determine that a teen may be in danger and the parents are unable to be reached via notification. It's unclear what this coordination with law enforcement will look like, especially on a global scale.

Another major ChatGPT update rolling out as part of these changes is the new ability for parents to set time restrictions for their teens in ChatGPT. Rather than a certain amount of usage hours, however, ChatGPT access can be blocked during specific time periods, like from 8 pm to 10 am.

Altogether, the parental controls include multiple granular choices for guardians to make about their child's ChatGPT experience. In addition to the restriction of sensitive content and quiet hours, parents can opt their kid's data out of model training, turn off the bot's saved memories, and disable voice mode as well as image generation.

“Guardrails help, but they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them,” reads OpenAI's blog. WIRED's past testing of OpenAI's GPT-5 model showed that certain aspects of potential guardrails could be circumvented with basic commands in the custom instructions.

All of these updates also come after the death of another teen who was using a chatbot from Character.ai, a role-playing platform popular with young users. Following the death, Character.ai implemented parental controls to allow more visibility into teenage usage patterns. The visibility only goes so far; Character.ai's parental notifications do not include content-specific alerts, like those for suicidal ideation.

Other AI companies are likely to mimic OpenAI's approach to these types of teen safety tools. “We want users to be able to use our tools in the way that they want, within very broad bounds of safety,” wrote CEO Sam Altman in a blog post originally announcing the tools two weeks ago. Even if these attempts to protect teens prove successful, it's highly unlikely the same protections around suicidal ideation will be rolled out for adults due to OpenAI's concerns about user privacy.

Sunshine, the consumer AI startup founded by former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in 2018, has seen brighter days.

The small startup is shutting down, and its assets are being sold to a new entity incorporated by Mayer called Dazzle, according to an email viewed by WIRED. Mayer sent the email to Sunshine shareholders on September 17, informing them that Dazzle has officially incorporated and is ready to acquire Sunshine's holdings.

The deal requires approval from shareholders, including Sunshine cofounder Enrique Muñoz Torres, Norwest Venture Partners, Felicis Partners, Ron Conway's SV Angel, the PR firm Archetype Agency, and others. As of Sunday afternoon, 99 percent of shareholders had signed, according to sources close to the situation. Mayer is the company's largest shareholder and investor.

The email did not elaborate on what Dazzle's purpose will be, but sources tell WIRED that Mayer is eyeing a new kind of AI personal assistant. Sunshine's roughly 15 employees are expecting to find new roles at Dazzle, sources say.

“After careful consideration, Sunshine's management, and 99.99% of its shareholders, determined the strongest path forward for the company was to sell to Dazzle AI, a new company already incorporated and with committed funding,” Mayer said through a spokesperson. “As Sunshine's largest investor, shareholder, and CEO, Marissa is proud of what the team built and looks forward to carrying that momentum into new opportunities around Dazzle.”

Mayer founded Sunshine, originally called Lumi Labs, in 2018 after her five-year turnaround attempt at Yahoo. Prior to becoming CEO of Yahoo, Mayer had a storied career at Google, where she was employee number 20. Mayer designed the interface for Google Search and helped develop Google Maps and Google AdWords.

The idea for Sunshine's first product, an app for managing contacts, stemmed from Mayer's own experience tapping into her deep network of Silicon Valley luminaries as she was trying to launch her company. That app, Sunshine Contacts, launched in 2020. By that point, the startup had raised $20 million in venture capital funding, in addition to Mayer's personal contributions.

Early on, the Sunshine app was plagued by complaints that it potentially violated user privacy. The app, which used AI to identify and merge duplicate people in your phone's contacts list, was also pulling in information from Whitepages to automatically add home addresses to contacts.

In 2024, Sunshine launched a photo sharing app called Shine. Like Sunshine Contacts, Shine was widely viewed as a flop.

Tile trackers, used to locate everything from lost keys to stolen pets, are used by more than 88 million people worldwide, according to Tile's parent company, Life360. But researchers who examined the tracking technology have found design flaws that would let stalkers—or potentially the manufacturer itself—track the location of Tile users and their devices, contrary to claims the company has made about the security and privacy of its devices.

The researchers—Akshaya Kumar, Anna Raymaker, and Michael Specter of Georgia Institute of Technology—found that each tag broadcasts an unencrypted MAC address and unique ID that can be picked up by other Bluetooth devices or radio-frequency antennas in a tag's vicinity to track the movements of the tag and its owner. The location of a tag, its MAC address, and unique ID also get sent unencrypted to Tile's servers, where the researchers believe this information is stored in cleartext, giving Tile the ability to track the location of tags and their owners, even though the company claims it does not have this capability.

The researchers say this would give Tile the ability to conduct “mass surveillance” on its users and potentially provide that information to law enforcement and others.

The researchers also found that Tile's anti-stalking protection can be easily undermined if a stalker enables an anti-theft feature that Tile offers with its tags. Additionally, someone could falsely frame a Tile owner for stalking by recording the unencrypted broadcasts their Tile device makes and replaying these broadcasts in the vicinity of another Tile user, making it seem like the former is stalking the latter.

The researchers reported their findings to Tile's parent company, Life360, last November, but they say the company stopped communicating with them in February. WIRED sent Life360 an email asking for a response to the issues raised by the researchers, but a spokesperson sent a reply that did not explicitly address the problems. The email said only that the company had “made a number of improvements” since receiving the researchers' report, without specifying what those were.

Tile sells stand-alone tags, but its tracking technology is also embedded in laptops, headphones, smartwatches, and other products made by companies like Dell, Bose, and Fitbit. The researchers reverse engineered Tile's protocol and Android mobile app used with the Tile Mate, the company's most popular tracker tag. They say their findings may not apply to other models of Tile tags or the Tile technology used in products made by third parties.

Tile trackers operate similarly to tracking tags made by Apple, Google, and Samsung. But Tile's system differs in important ways. Like the others, Tile tags are battery-powered and use Bluetooth to broadcast their location to a user's phone. Users can slip a tag into a briefcase, luggage, or vehicle, or attach it to keys, a phone, laptop, or even a pet collar to track the location of these items.

Each Tile tag broadcasts the tag's MAC address and a unique ID, which changes periodically. If an item paired with the tag goes missing the owner, using their Tile app, can instruct the tag to emit a sound to locate it. For items farther away, the system relies on the network of phones belonging to other Tile users. These also pick up the broadcast of any Tile device near them. And since 2021, Ring cameras, Echo devices, and Tile tags have been integrated into Amazon's Sidewalk network, meaning Ring and Echo devices can pick up the location of Tile tags as well.

Each time these devices pick up the broadcast from a Tile tag, the location, MAC address, and unique ID of that tag get sent to a Tile server where it's stored in a database, the researchers found. The owner of a lost tag and item can then use their Tile app to query the database for their latest location. The problem, according to the researchers, lies in how Tile has implemented this system.

Tile claims that user information transmitted across its network can't be seen by anyone. “You are the only one with the ability to see your Tile location and your device location,” the company states in its privacy policy. But the researchers found that the MAC address and unique ID that a Tile tag broadcasts is not encrypted, allowing someone in the vicinity of a tag with a Tile app on their phone or a radio frequency antenna to intercept this information as its transmitted and track the location of the tag and associated item or its owner.

Other tag makers replace the MAC address with a rotating unique ID and only transmit the ID. By changing the ID periodically, someone recording broadcasts from a tag cannot easily link multiple broadcasts to the same tag to track the movement of that tag and associated item or owner.

But because Tile's system transmits both the MAC address and the unique ID, and does not encrypt this transmission, someone can intercept this information. Tile's unique ID also rotates—it changes every 15 minutes if the tag is near the owner's phone or once in 24 hours if not—but because the MAC address is static and does not change, it can be used to track a tag regardless of the changing ID. Even if Tile chose to not transmit the MAC address, the researchers say, the way Tile generates the changing ID is not secure and can still be used to track a tag.

“An attacker only needs to record one message from the device … to fingerprint it for the rest of its lifetime,” says Kumar, who says this creates a risk of systemic surveillance for anyone whose tag is caught up in a scan.

Law enforcement could potentially use this to identify anyone in an area that has a Tile tag or Tile-enabled device. And because this location information seems likely to be stored unencrypted on Tile's server, researchers say, Tile could also track the location of tags or share this information with any third party.

“These issues transform Tile's infrastructure into a global tracking network,” the researchers claim in a paper they wrote about their findings.

When an Apple, Google, or Samsung tag gets detected in a scan, the report that gets sent to the company servers containing the tag's ID and location information is end-to-end encrypted so that no one can intercept the broadcasts as they're transmitted, and the companies themselves cannot see the location information to track the movement of the tags. Only a tag owner can see this information because a key on their phone decrypts the location data on the company's server that is associated with their tag ID.

“They have designed their system intentionally such that they aren't able to recover your location or the location of where your items are,” says Specter. “Because they don't want to be in the business of knowing where all people are at all times.”

In a study published last year, researchers measuring the misuse of Bluetooth location trackers—including devices from Apple, Tile, Samsung, and Chipolo—found that more than 40 percent of stalking victims had been tracked with Bluetooth tags hidden in their cars, purses, or backpacks.

To address this, makers of location-tracking technology have implemented solutions to alert users when a tracking device they don't own appears to be moving with them. But the researchers say that Tile's implementation is flawed in ways that both undermine its effectiveness and make it susceptible to being used to track the movement of other users.

Unlike other trackers—which conduct a continuous scan for trackers in a user's vicinity that they don't own and automatically alert the user to the presence of these trackers—Tile's so-called Scan and Secure system has to be manually initiated by a user through the Tile app. The scan lasts only 10 minutes, and the user has to be moving around an area while the scan is in progress to detect tags that are moving with them. Users have to also remember to re-initiate scans periodically to detect any rogue devices that might be traveling with them since their last scan.

Tile's app performs six Bluetooth scans during the 10 minutes and extracts the MAC address and unique ID from each broadcast it detects. The app then checks these addresses against a database to determine if they are paired with the phone of the person doing the scan. Any address or ID that is not paired with their phone is designated “unknown.” The app produces a report of these tags for the person to view. It also sends a message to the Tile server with all the MAC addresses and unique IDs detected during the six scans, and the number of times they appeared.

But the researchers found that the Scan and Secure feature is undermined by another feature Tile offers for preventing theft. The researchers say this anti-theft mode is unique to Tile, and the problems it presents for Tile users may be the reason.

The aim of anti-theft is to prevent would-be thieves from running a scan using a Tile mobile application to see if there is a Tile tag paired with an item they plan to steal. But when a tag owner enables anti-theft to make their tag invisible to would-be thieves, those tags also won't be visible to someone running a scan to determine if they are being stalked with a rogue tag. This means a stalker could hide their stalking tag by putting it in anti-theft mode. A scan will still detect the tag and send its MAC address, unique ID, and location to Tile's servers, but the tag won't be included in the scan results that are displayed to the user who initiated the scan, effectively making potential stalking victims blind to rogue devices that may be following them.

Kumar says other makers of location trackers avoid this by not even offering anti-theft mode for their products.

“They never say, ‘Here's a tag that can prevent your devices from being stolen.' They say it helps recover lost devices. Anti-theft is just not a feature,” she says. “That's a compromise that these companies are willing to make in order to have stronger anti-stalking properties.”

The researchers also say that the anti-theft mode isn't foolproof because a user with a modified Tile app can easily circumvent it to collect and display all MAC addresses and unique IDs recorded during a scan, regardless of whether any of those tags are using anti-theft mode.

Tile believes it solves the anti-theft abuse problem by requiring that anyone who enables anti-theft mode for their tag provide a government-issued ID and live photo of their face to Tile before anti-theft mode will be enabled. Users of this mode also have to consent to a $1 million fine if they are convicted of using Tile for stalking—though the researchers point out that it's unclear if this is enforceable.

Tile states in its terms that the identity information users provide will be shared with law enforcement if Tile believes someone has abused the feature for stalking. But the company is inconsistent about whether law enforcement needs a warrant to get this information. In a FAQ the company says it will “work with law enforcement through a properly issued court order to identify the owner of a suspicious Tile.” But in the terms for its anti-theft mode, users agree that their “personal information can and will be shared with law enforcement at our discretion, even without a subpoena” to aid investigations of suspected stalkers.

Lastly, the researchers say someone can abuse the Scan and Secure feature to frame someone else for stalking by executing a replay attack to impersonate their Tile tag. Using a radio-frequency antenna to collect the unencrypted broadcasts from another user's tag, an attacker can extract the MAC address and unique ID from these broadcasts, and transmit that in another location. If a user conducts an anti-stalking scan in that location, they would see this MAC address and unique ID in the scan, and this information and the location of where it was scanned would be sent to Tile's server, making it appear as if that tag was near the person who did the scan. There is no way to determine, the researchers say, if a MAC address and unique ID was emitted by a legitimate Tile device or someone maliciously replaying that information.

The researchers say many of the problems they found could be addressed simply by Tile encrypting the broadcasts from its tags, and they don't understand why the company apparently hasn't followed the example of its competitors.

Microplastics could be a factor in driving up cases of osteoporosis worldwide, according to recently published research. The study reveals that when these tiny plastic particles enter the body, they disrupt the functioning of bone marrow stem cells, which are essential for maintaining and repairing bone tissue.

Throughout your life, your bones are replenished. Osteoporosis is a condition where this process goes wrong, with the breakdown of bone outstripping the rate at which it is replaced. This leads to bones weakening over time and becoming more likely to fracture. The condition has many risk factors—age, sex, medications, diet, smoking and drinking, and genetics are all known to influence it—with the disease developing slowly over time. Often people don't realize they have the condition until they break a bone.

This new analysis, published in the journal Osteoporosis International, adds exposure to microplastics as a potential new risk factor. The research reviewed 62 scientific articles that had run various laboratory and animal tests on the possible effects of micro- and nanoplastics on bone. Analysis of lab experiments showed that microplastics stimulate the formation of osteoclasts, cells created by stem cells in the bone marrow that degrade bone tissue to promote resorption, the process in which the body breaks down and eliminates old or damaged bone.

The study also found that, in relation to bones, plastic particles can reduce the viability of cells, induce premature cellular aging, modify gene expression, and trigger inflammatory responses. The combination of these effects generates an imbalance in which osteoclasts destroy more bone tissue than is regenerated, causing an accelerated weakening of bone structure.

When then looking at animal studies, the researchers found that the accumulation of microplastics in the body decreases the white blood cell count—which is suggestive of alterations in bone marrow function. In addition, these animal studies suggested that the impact of microplastics on osteoclasts may be associated with deterioration of bone microstructure and the formation of irregular structures of cells, increasing the risk of bone fragility, deformities, and fractures.

“In this study, the adverse effects observed culminated, worryingly, in the interruption of the animals' skeletal growth,” said coauthor Rodrigo Bueno de Oliveira in a press release. “The potential impact of microplastics on bones is the subject of scientific studies and isn't negligible.”

Oliveira, who is the coordinator of the Laboratory for Evaluation of Mineral and Bone Disorders in Nephrology at the State University of Campinas in Brazil, is now working with his team to further prove in practice the relationship between exposure to microplastics and bone deterioration. This research will begin by evaluating the effects of microplastic particles on rodents' femurs.

“Although osteometabolic diseases are relatively well understood, there's a gap in our knowledge regarding the influence of microplastics on the development of these diseases. Therefore, one of our goals is to generate evidence suggesting that microplastics could be a potential controllable environmental cause to explain, for example, the increase in the projected number of bone fractures,” Oliveira said.

Microplastics and nanoplastics are small fragments of plastic—some so small that they're invisible to the naked eye—that become detached from everyday objects when sunlight, wind, rain, seawater, or abrasion degrade them. The main difference between the two lies in their size: microplastics measure from 1 micrometer (one-thousandth of a millimeter) to 5 millimeters, while nanoplastics are smaller than 1 micrometer. These particles have been detected all over the world in natural environments, as well as throughout the human body and in meat, water, and various agricultural products.

Studies have started to show that this type of plastic contamination can damage health. Experts argue that this means the world urgently needs to reduce its use of plastics. Every year more than 500 million tons of the material are produced worldwide, but only 9 percent is recycled, with much of the remainder spreading into the environment and degrading.

Coffee is a fast-ticking clock. And the end of this stopwatch is nothing you want. Fresh coffee is all about aroma and intensity—the delicate notes of toffee or nectarine that make each bean distinct. Old coffee loses all of this. It tastes instead acrid and flabby, like a cup of wet cardboard.

But freshness is a difficult target. I drink coffee about like a horse takes to water, but I buy it just as impulsively. I am also constantly testing out coffee to find the Best Coffee Subscriptions, and to give each brand a fair shake, I always drink those fresh in the optimal tasting window. Which means the rando special bag I bought for myself last Thursday often has to wait. And sometimes I can't manage to brew all my coffee within a few weeks of its roast date.

That's where freezing comes in.

So, should you freeze coffee beans? Or is freezing just a new way to mess up coffee beans—by introducing frosty moisture, or tainting it with the smell of the frozen chicken and peas in your icebox? The answer, according to coffee experts and chemists alike, is that you're probably better off freezing coffee than letting warm air do its slow work. But this is only true if you do it correctly.

What's more, frozen beans can in fact lead to better flavor on light-roast coffee in particular, according to at least one study—because it helps you get more consistent coffee grounds and therefore better flavor. More on that later.

Here's a quick rundown on how to keep your coffee fresh without also ruining it, and why frozen coffee sometimes trumps fresh.

Believe it or not, there's such a thing as coffee that's too fresh. You probably don't want to brew coffee the day after it's roasted. For light roasts in particular, most roasters tend to recommend you wait five to seven days after the roast date before brewing, in order to allow your coffee to off-gas a bit and become a little easier to extract. This is especially important when it comes to espresso, where extraction is a volatile and finicky process.

But, alas, if you just leave the coffee in its bag, on the counter, it may start to go stale beginning a couple weeks later. You know that nice smell of fresh coffee beans? Those lovely aromatic compounds are exiting the beans, and dispersing into the air: That's why you can smell them. Eventually, they'll diminish. At the same time, oxygen is sneaking in to do its grim work, turning your beans to stale rust.

Depending how it's stored, coffee can begin to degrade anywhere from two weeks to a month after roast date (i.e., the optimal window may just be a week or two for each bag).

You can extend this a bit by storing the coffee in an airtight container. One that I particularly like (and that we recommend in our Gifts for Coffee Lovers guide) is the vacuum-sealed Fellow Atmos. This can keep your beans fresher for longer on your counter and also keep them from taking on bad aromas in your freezer.

If you know you're not going to get through a bag of beans, the best time to freeze is not when your beans are already starting to go stale. Rather, do so just before the optimal flavor window.

The science on the staying power of frozen coffee is somewhat thin, notes Christopher Hendon, a materials chemist at University of Oregon, whose research into coffee extraction and flavor has earned him the nickname “Dr. Coffee.” But there's reason to believe freezing slows the staling process but doesn't halt it.

“My inclination is to think that if you freeze something, all the kinetic processes slow down a lot, and so you'd expect it to stale less quickly,” Hendon told WIRED in August. But those volatile compounds? Gases both exiting and entering the bean? Those processes will still continue, albeit more slowly. So this is why you might freeze coffee early, to give it a chance to get to optimal flavor even while frozen.

But if your coffee is already starting to go stale? It'll still get a little more stale in the freezer. Just a bit more slowly.

There are a few main principles to properly freezing your beans.

The key to avoiding moisture and bad aromas is to store it correctly, so that the coffee isn't ruined by volatile temperatures, frost, or terrible terrible aromas from whatever you've got stored in your fridge. People with sensitive palates, for example coffee expert James Hoffmann, tend to be quite sensitive to any freezer aroma contamination—and coffee does love to take on flavors.

So, don't just stick your coffee bag straight into the freezer and use it like a coffee bag. It'll frost over. It'll taste weird. To avoid all this, recommend Hoffmann and others, you'll want to use airtight or vacuum-sealed storage to keep your coffee safe from tasting like meat. Using vacuum sealer bags or even zipper bags can feel wasteful over time. And so an Atmos in the freezer is one good reusable solution.

Note that the back of the freezer is likely to have more stable temperatures than the front and thus be less likely to expose the coffee to the chance of freezing and unfreezing over and over.

Ideally, you also want to avoid opening and closing your cleverly vacuum-sealed bag, then putting it back in the freezer. The reason is simple: You'll let in moist air from the outside, then this will freeze in your freezer bag. You'll get ice and moisture. And too much moisture will change your coffee in some unknown way. (Note that Hendon is less worried about a small bit of moisture, since his research shows it reduces static and thus helps your coffee grind better.)

One option is to use ziplock bags inside a container, such as the Atmos. Another, less wasteful option is a reusable zipper bag, like silicone Stasher bags, which have the added benefit of not being made out of plastic. This will also let you seal up your coffee in small doses, so you can pull out smaller quantities at a time without adulterating them.

The clock didn't stop ticking. It's just ticking slower. Carbon dioxide and other volatile aromatic compounds will still leave your coffee beans over time, even if you've effectively sealed it up. Your coffee will degrade unless it's much, much colder than your home freezer will ever get—getting stale in a matter of three to six months but probably getting some other version of freezer burn long before that.

Here's a funny conundrum. Coffee from fresh beans is always better, of course. Except when it isn't. Sometimes it's possible for frozen coffee to taste better because of a quirk of physics called “glass transition.”

Under most circumstances, light-roast coffee beans are difficult to grind evenly. Unlike dark-roast beans, which crumble easily, lighter-roast beans are denser. They break up into bigger pieces. They resist a grinder. And so they often don't grind as evenly or easily, if you don't have an excellent grinder that's designed well for light roast. (See WIRED's guide to the best coffee grinders.)

But freezing light-roast beans can make them grind more evenly, according to a study by Dr. Hendon at the University of Oregon, published in Nature in 2016.

“Our current understanding is that coffee, solid coffee—as in, like, coffee beans—undergoes what's known as a glass transition, which is a solid-to-solid phase transition,” Hendon told me this August by way of explanation. “The mechanical properties of the coffee itself are affected in some meaningful way: In this case, coffee goes from being maybe sort of spongy to being more brittle.”

Which is to say, frozen light-roast coffee breaks easier, and it breaks more evenly. I encourage you to look at the pretty graphs in Hendon's article. But I also tested this myself using a device called the DiFluid Omni particle size analyzer and also WIRED's favorite coffee grinder, the Baratza Encore ESP.

Starting with a bag of fresh (and delicious) light-roast Ethiopian Halo beans from Portland's Heart Coffee, I froze one ziplock bag of beans and ground it with the Encore ESP—then put the coffee grounds through particle-size analysis, collating the results across a number of samples and tests. I then used the same grinder setting on unfrozen beans.

The results weren't dramatic, but they did back up Hendon's study: The frozen beans ground up a bit more consistently. The standard deviation on the frozen beans was about 8 percent smaller than with the unfrozen beans. In particular, freezing beans seemed to reduce the share of larger coffee grounds above 600 microns. This is fairly anecdotal confirmation, of course—but it did line up with Hendon's study.

It also amounts to a surprising argument for freezing beans, especially if you have a hard time brewing your beans within their optimal flavor window otherwise. Because in coffee, better grind is better flavor.

It's not fun to talk about, but there's only one thing certain in life. You need to have a plan for your digital legacy, just like you make a plan for your physical assets; otherwise, your accounts, services, and logins will rot away in a data center before they're inevitably erased by a data retention policy.

Some services recognize how important digital legacy is. Apple and Facebook have legacy contacts that can gain access to your accounts, and the American Bar Association is still grappling with the legalities of accessing online accounts when someone passes away. Most online services don't.

Recognition of digital legacy is still spotty, and without dedicated legacy contacts, accessing the deceased's online accounts often involves court orders or legal documentation (and plenty of time). Digital legacy doesn't need to have so many hurdles, though. Password managers have digital legacy features built in that can unlock your digital life in the event of an emergency.

There's a lot that goes into your digital legacy, from your online banking login to any digital assets you own, but even a seemingly straightforward online life can quickly snowball into a mess. Does the Netflix account just keep draining the checking account until you can break in and change the payment option? Are photos that have been uploaded to the cloud now lost in a data center, never to be recovered? Add some passkeys, maybe some social sign-on features, and you have a complex web of data that's almost impossible to untangle.

So-called digital executors exist, operating in the same way as the executor of the will, just for digital assets. It's a good idea to set up a digital executor to ensure your digital assets are handled properly, but that doesn't help in the immediate aftermath of someone passing away. The probate process can take at least a few months, and sometimes several years.

Password managers like Bitwarden offer a shortcut. You can transfer access to a trusted relative, spouse, or even your closest friend, along with a rundown of what to do with your accounts.

The legality of this is a little murky, with the American Bar Association noting that accessing someone else's account, even with their username and password, isn't legal if it violates the platform's terms of service. The law regarding digital assets varies from state to state, so it's still a good idea to consult an attorney for long-term access.

Here's the advice NordPass gave: “For anyone thinking about digital legacy, the best step is to set up Emergency Access in advance, clearly communicate the use cases of the credentials with your trusted contacts, and follow the terms of service of respective platforms.”

Immediate access is still important, not only in the event of death but also in the event of incapacitation. If you, for whatever reason, can't access your online accounts, you can transfer those accounts easily using an emergency contact feature available in a password manager.

There are some excellent password managers, and most of them have some way to unlock your account in the event of an emergency. They go about it in different ways, however. Here are the three I recommend for most people. (Read more in our Best Password Managers guide.)

Proton

Proton (Free)

Proton (Pass Plus, Yearly)

Proton (Pass Family, Yearly)

Proton recently added an emergency access feature, and it's not just restricted to Proton Pass. Unlike most password managers, Proton Pass is just one app available in the Proton suite. Proton also makes our favorite VPN, and it offers an encrypted crypto wallet, cloud storage, and even a calendar.

Emergency access isn't restricted to one app with Proton. Rather, it's access to your entire account, so if you have multiple Proton apps, you can pass them along. It's not hard to see where this could be useful, especially if you have a lot of data stored in Proton Drive or money in your crypto wallet.

Although Proton's emergency access is bound to your overall Proton account, you need to set it up through Proton Pass or another Proton app. For Proton Pass, open the app in your browser at account.proton.me. Once you're in, select the cog icon next to your name in the bottom left corner and choose Account.

This will open a new tab. In the new window, select Recovery from the menu on the left and scroll down to the Emergency Access section. Choose Add Emergency Contact and enter the email address you want to share access with. They'll need a Proton account to accept the invitation. Emergency access is only available for paid Proton members, though you can share access with someone who has a free Proton account.

One of the upsides of Proton compared to 1Password and NordPass (my other two recommendations) is the wait-time setting. When you add an emergency contact, they can request access to your Proton account at any time. After the wait time has passed without a response, however, Proton will automatically give your emergency contacts access. The default time is seven days, but you can set it for as long as 30 days, as well as remove the wait time completely.



1Password (Single, Yearly)

1Password (Family, Yearly)

1Password doesn't have a dedicated digital legacy feature, and if you understand how its security architecture is designed, it's easy to see why. 1Password has a true zero-knowledge security architecture. Even if 1Password wanted to, and even in the event of a catastrophic emergency, it can't decrypt someone's vault. That's great for security but bad for passing along your passwords.

Instead, 1Password offers an emergency kit, which you can generate and download from my.1password.com. On a device where you're signed into 1Password, go to that address, select your name in the upper right corner, and choose Manage Account. On the next page, select Save Emergency Kit.

Your 1Password Emergency Kit is a PDF that includes instructions for logging in, along with your email address, secret key, and a space for you to write (or type) your master password. It also includes a QR code for easy setup, automatically copying your details over, short of your master password.

The Emergency Kit is useful for account recovery, but it's also one of the more secure options for digital legacy. You can print off a physical copy of your Emergency Kit before wiping any trace of it digitally. I recommend including it as part of your will or trust and storing it somewhere secure, like a safe-deposit box.

Unfortunately, you need to jump through these hoops with 1Password due to how it works. And whoever ends up with your Emergency Kit will have full access to your account, while Proton Pass and NordPass (my next recommendation) provide read-only access. If you use 1Password's Families plan, however, it's easy to share vault access with the family members on your account—and you don't even need to contemplate death to do it.

NordVPN

Shop at
        

NordPass (Free)

NordPass (Premium, Yearly)

NordPass (Family, Yearly)

NordPass introduced its emergency access feature a few years ago, and it's simple. You can send invites to one (or more) trusted contacts. They don't get access to your vault immediately. Instead, they can request access at any time. In the event you don't deny one of these requests within seven days, Nord automatically unlocks the account for the contact that requested access.

Setting it up is easy. Once you have the NordPass extension installed, open it and select the cog icon near the top left of the window. That will open your settings view in a new tab. All the way at the bottom of the page, you'll find the Emergency Access setting under the Other category. Like with Proton Pass, your trusted contact will need a NordPass account to see and accept the invitation.

That's it. Once they accept the invitation, your contact can request access at any time, which you can accept or deny within that seven-day window before your vault is unlocked. Regardless of the situation, if someone gets emergency access to your account, they can only view what's inside. NordPass locks them out of editing, deleting, sharing, or doing anything else inside your vault.

The obvious downside with NordPass is that you can't change the amount of time before access is handed over to your emergency contacts. If you, for whatever reason, can't deny the request within seven days, NordPass unlocks your vault. You can dream up some scenarios where that could become a problem, but it shouldn't, especially considering you can revoke access for your emergency contacts at any time.

Proton Pass, 1Password, and NordPass are my personal favorite password managers, which is why I recommend them over options like Keeper, which also has a digital legacy feature. I also recommend them because they come with additional storage space. 1Password includes 1 GB, NordPass includes 3 GB, and Proton Pass comes with a whopping 10 GB—and that doesn't include any storage through Proton Drive.

Storing your logins is important, but you can also store a lot of important documents in your password manager. That's certainly more secure than throwing them in a shared Google Drive folder. If you want to do a digital inventory, here are a few things you should store in your password manager alongside your logins.

Vehicle information. You can wrap all of your vehicle information up into a single entry in your password manager. Scan your license and title, add insurance and vehicle information, and maybe loop in personal property tax receipts. NordPass, 1Password, and Proton Pass all allow you to add attachments to entries, as well as notes.

Software licenses. Most software today is sold with a software-as-a-service model, so accessing someone's login is most important. If you have perpetual software licenses, though, you'll probably want to add them to your vault as an encrypted note.

Non-account secrets. This is probably the most practical thing to store in your password manager in the event you need to transfer access. There are a ton of secrets you need to remember that aren't tied to an online account. I'm talking about gate codes, PINs, and patterns for your devices, recovery codes, lock combinations; the list goes on. Store them in your vault as encrypted notes.

2FA/MFA details. A lot of password managers allow you to store 2FA codes, including Proton Pass and 1Password (though not NordPass). It's not the best idea for security, but in the context of digital legacy, you should store some information about accounts that have 2FA enabled. Add a note to logins that have 2FA enabled, along with recovery information for those accounts.

Death isn't fun to think about, no, but setting up your digital legacy is only becoming more important. Today, precious little exists only in the physical world; nearly everything is tied to an online account or service in some way. Dealing with who owns your digital assets is something you can define in a will or trust. But that doesn't always account for the unexpected.

Emergency access is important if you pass away, but it's also important if you can't get access to your account for any reason, especially in the aftermath of an emergency.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","A New Era: Nvidia and Intel's Alliance for AI PCs and Cloud AI","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/a-new-era-nvidia-and-intels-alliance-for-ai-pcs-and-cloud-ai-179936.html","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 12:02:19 GMT","

The technology landscape is no stranger to strategic alliances, but few carry the potential to redefine an entire industry as profoundly as the newly announced collaboration between Nvidia and Intel.

This historic collaboration, centered on AI-powered consumer PCs and cloud infrastructure, will send ripples through the market, challenging established dynamics and accelerating the arrival of a truly intelligent computing era. To understand its magnitude, we can draw parallels to a past titan's intervention: Bill Gates' investment in Apple.

Let's talk about this critical partnership, and we'll close with my Product of the Week, an AI PC from HP.

In 1997, a struggling Apple received a much-needed lifeline in the form of a $150 million investment from Microsoft, then led by Bill Gates. This wasn't merely a financial transaction; it symbolized a truce in the fiercely competitive operating system wars and, crucially, provided Apple with the confidence and resources to innovate.

Microsoft's support, including a commitment to develop Office for Mac, played a pivotal role in revitalizing Apple's brand and significantly boosting its valuation. While it didn't directly impact Intel's valuation, it solidified the Wintel duopoly's dominance in the PC market. The Gates-Apple investment was about saving a competitor, preserving a diverse ecosystem, and ultimately, ensuring a broader market for Microsoft's software.

An Nvidia-Intel partnership, however, is fundamentally different. It isn't about saving a struggling giant but about fusing two powerhouses to create a new, unstoppable force in the burgeoning AI landscape.

Intel, with its long-standing dominance in CPUs and vast manufacturing capabilities, gains Nvidia's unparalleled expertise in GPUs and AI acceleration. Conversely, Nvidia gains access to Intel's colossal market reach, CPU architecture, and deep relationships with PC manufacturers.

This isn't a bailout; it's a strategic alliance aimed at conquering the next frontier of computing.

The core of this powerful alliance lies in the complementary strengths of Nvidia and Intel. Intel, a titan of CPU development, has historically excelled in general-purpose computing, providing the brains for countless PCs and servers. Its x86 architecture is the bedrock of modern computing, and its manufacturing prowess enables mass production at scale. However, when it comes to the specialized demands of AI, CPUs often fall short.

This is where Nvidia steps in. Renowned for its graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia has transformed these once-specialized gaming chips into the workhorses of AI. GPUs, with their highly parallel architectures, are exceptionally well-suited for the massive matrix multiplications and parallel computations required for training and inferencing machine-learning models.

Nvidia's CUDA platform has become the de facto standard for GPU programming in AI, creating a vibrant ecosystem of developers and applications and solidifying its dominance in the AI chip market.

The combination of these two entities is transformative for AI PCs. Imagine a future where every consumer PC seamlessly integrates Intel's powerful CPUs for general tasks and Nvidia's dedicated GPUs for AI workloads. This would enable on-device AI capabilities far beyond what is currently possible, leading to:

This hybrid approach, which leverages the strengths of both the CPU and GPU, will unlock the full potential of AI at the edge, reducing latency, enhancing privacy, and enabling a new class of intelligent applications.

This collaboration also extends beyond the PC, revolutionizing cloud AI as Intel builds custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms. These platforms, combined with flagship GPUs such as the A100 and H100, deliver unparalleled performance for training and deploying large-scale AI models.

Such a formidable partnership is already sending shockwaves through the AI desktop market.

AMD, Intel's primary CPU competitor and a growing player in GPUs, now faces an intensified challenge. While AMD has made strides with its Ryzen processors and Radeon GPUs, a combined Nvidia-Intel entity represents an unprecedented level of integration and market share. To compete effectively, AMD will likely need to redouble its efforts in AI-specific hardware and software, potentially focusing on niche markets or doubling down on its open ecosystem approach.

Emerging Chinese silicon vendors such as Huawei (with Ascend) and other domestic chip manufacturers, while making significant progress, will also find themselves in an even more competitive environment. This alliance will accelerate the pace of innovation in the Western market, potentially widening the technology gap in AI hardware.

These vendors would need to continue their aggressive investment in R&D and forge their own strategic alliances to keep pace, as they aim to compete globally in the semiconductor market.

The overall AI desktop market is likely to experience a rapid acceleration in the adoption of AI-enabled features. Other peripheral and software companies would need to adapt quickly, either by integrating with the new Nvidia-Intel ecosystem or by developing alternative solutions.

The implications of this partnership extend far beyond consumer PCs and cloud servers. Both Nvidia and Intel have made significant inroads into the automotive and robotic industries, areas where AI is paramount.

Nvidia's Drive platform is a leading solution for autonomous vehicles, providing the compute power for perception, planning, and control. While Intel has divested its ADAS unit, Mobileye, this collaboration remains a powerful force. It allows Intel to focus on providing best-in-class, automotive-grade CPUs and manufacturing services to power Nvidia's comprehensive autonomous driving stack, creating a formidable hardware foundation for the future of transportation.

In robotics, this partnership may have a similarly focused impact. With Intel having spun out its RealSense computer vision business, a collaboration might center on pairing Intel's powerful core processors with Nvidia's Jetson platform.

This combination creates a standardized CPU+GPU compute stack for robotics, enabling robots to handle general-purpose tasks efficiently with Intel silicon while dedicating Nvidia's hardware to complex AI, machine learning, and perception workloads powered by third-party sensors. The result would be a more robust and scalable platform for developing intelligent machines.

This push towards hybrid AI — where AI workloads are intelligently distributed between the cloud and the edge – could become a hallmark of the Nvidia-Intel partnership. For instance, a smart factory robot might perform basic object recognition and manipulation locally, while sending complex anomaly detection data to the cloud for deeper analysis and model retraining.

This distributed intelligence would optimize performance, reduce latency, and enhance the resilience of AI systems across various industries.

Nvidia and Intel's newly announced collaboration marks a monumental shift in the technology landscape, echoing historic turning points like Bill Gates' strategic aid to Apple — but with even broader implications. This isn't about preserving a competitor; it's about forging a dominant new force at the center of the AI revolution.

By combining Intel's CPU expertise and manufacturing scale with Nvidia's unparalleled leadership in GPUs and AI, the alliance is poised to redefine consumer PCs, accelerate cloud AI, intensify competition for AMD and emerging Chinese chipmakers, and revolutionize industries such as automotive and robotics through advanced hybrid AI solutions.

This union doesn't just advance technology; it lays the foundation for a future where intelligence is seamlessly embedded into every device and every interaction, fundamentally reshaping how we live, work, and connect.



The term “AI PC” is everywhere this year, but what it means for the average user can often feel vague. Is it just a faster processor? A special key on the keyboard?

My Product of the Week, the HP EliteBook 6 G1q, provides a clear and compelling answer, showcasing how the right combination of hardware and software makes a truly intelligent PC for today's world.



The HP EliteBook 6 G1q combines a Snapdragon X Elite processor, built-in 5G, and HP's AI-driven software to deliver true AI PC performance with exceptional battery life. (Image created with AI. Rendered by Artlist.io.)

At the heart of this laptop is the powerful and efficient Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. While this chip includes a neural processing unit (NPU) for on-device AI tasks, its true genius lies in its integration with the Qualcomm 5G modem. This combination is what makes the EliteBook 6 an ideal AI PC for the way AI actually works right now.

Most powerful AI tools, such as Microsoft's Copilot and Google's Gemini (which I typically use), are cloud-based. The NPU can handle small tasks, but the heavy lifting happens on a server. The EliteBook's always-on 5G connection ensures you have a fast, secure, and seamless link to these powerful cloud services wherever you are, without having to hunt for Wi-Fi. It bridges the gap between on-device potential and cloud-based reality.

However, great hardware is only half the story. HP stands out from its competitors with its aggressive and practical use of AI software. Where others might simply offer the new chip, HP builds a suite of intelligent features around it.

Corvus Robotics' innovative storage tracking system uses fully autonomous drones to take warehouse inventory control to new heights.

The Corvus One Autonomous Inventory Management System provides warehouse managers with a bird's-eye view, enabling them to oversee up-to-the-minute reports on product locations and resolve discrepancies in real time. The deployments follow four years of challenging development.

Jackie Wu, co-founder and CEO of Corvus Robotics, developed his autonomous drone idea by observing warehousing operations in 10 countries. He found inventory scattered on massive pallets and sky-high metal shelves. Some of these facilities approached the size of five football fields, with storage bins stretching four stories high.

Wu noticed that they all have one thing in common: people with barcode scanners or paper and pencils climb around product stockpiles, updating printouts from previous inventory logs. It is a very slow process fraught with inaccuracies.

In 2017, Wu applied his graduate school training in robotics to address the pain points in warehouse management, making them more efficient and less costly to operate. He teamed up with co-founder Mohammed Kabir to develop the Boston-based company that currently has 20 employees. Research and development took several years for the company to reach its first real deployments in 2022.

Corvus' fully autonomous micro aerial vehicles need no human operators to fly them. The technology Corvus created enables the robotic drones to fly unattended within huge warehouses day or night, even in total darkness.

AI-based programming controls their ability to follow prescribed flight paths, adapt to navigational barriers, and respond to changes in the layout. They silently zip around corridors, vertically scale elevated storage shelves, record barcoded data, and deliver all surveillance results to the computer system.

Corvus uses computer vision, AI, and aerial robotics, which it designed from scratch to deploy a solution that tracks inventory. Wu claims it is 10 times faster and much cheaper than other warehousing management platforms.

“The platform is an AI model for autonomy that sits on site, in a computer, and on each of the drones,” Wu told TechNewsWorld. “The drones create a new digital model of the warehouse world, akin to a digital twin, every time they fly. They're also trained to recognize the differences in inventory and barcode labels for every single site on the next flight.”

Using drones commercially indoors is a relatively recent development. For many years, the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for business applications struggled to gain traction. Only recently has the technology for autonomous indoor navigation matured enough to support practical commercial use.

Early UAV deployments primarily focused on outdoor applications, including filmmaking, agriculture, and infrastructure inspection. Around 2010, innovative companies started combining logistics expertise with industrial drone technology to overcome the challenges of autonomous indoor flight. Stumbling points included unreliable GPS signals indoors, poor computer vision due to inadequate interior lighting, and the nascent state of AI sensor technology.

Success came as developers replaced GPS navigation with a combination of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, visual sensors, and complex algorithms to map and navigate warehouses. Industry reports show a steep upward trajectory for the adoption of inventory drones.

One report valued the drone-based warehouse inventory market at over $1.2 billion in 2024, with projections to reach nearly $10 billion by 2033. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%.

“I like the Corvus Robotics drones because they are out of sight and out of mind. They're doing things that there's really not a lot of value to an individual, but to the business it's priceless,” said Bill Monk, vice president of distribution for GNC.

Using the Corvus One System means GNC does not have to pull material handling equipment and laborers from other tasks to perform audits. Drones count pallets and cases, batch scan multiple SKUs in the same location, and provide a volumetric analysis of the slot's storage capacity, he explained.

According to Wu, “robotics” and “autonomous drones” are not terms for the same technology. Robotics is considered a discipline. Drones or micro vehicles are a sub-discipline.

Drones operate in 3D space, whereas robots move on the ground. Flying an autonomous drone in 3D requires more complexity, but many of the sensors and computer vision functionality are broadly interchangeable, he clarified.

Despite differences in the size and scope of warehouse deployments, Corvus uses the same system platform for every site. Wu noted that installation processes are not as complex as those for other inside surveillance and computerized inventory solutions.

“It depends on the size of the facility, but installation takes only one or two weeks. This is not like a nine-month setup where you have to install all this infrastructure, fix it to the ceiling, and put up racking and other support items. It's pretty quick,” Wu explained. “In smaller business locations, we send one or two deployment engineers who set it up in a day.”

The computer software, which can reside in on-site or remote offices, processes data from drone flights to provide visual data and detailed textual reports. Corvus provides software and drone maintenance as needed, offering warehouse personnel a hands-off solution.

Wu noted that anyone in the warehouse — authorized workers, supervisors, and the floor manager — can access the warehouse management system's (WMS) dashboard to search for an item or view the warehouse inventory in its entirety. Warehouse operators can compare data from previous drone flights to track discrepancies, confirm updated inventory reports, and track misplaced product storage.

“Instead of walking the floor and looking for every location, they can directly click into the software and look at the pictures,” said Wu.

Made-to-order programming puts all the decisions in the warehouse company's hands, he added. Different customers have different shifts and different comfort levels. So customers can have us program inventory flyovers within a single or multiple time frames.

“Being able to run inventory checks 24/7 without operator assistance has been a game changer,” said Austin Feagins, senior director of transformation and solution design at Staci Americas. His company provides third-party logistics and warehousing services for businesses.

“The lights-out capability in the Corvus One system allows our inventory teams to correct discrepancies off-shift and pre-shift before production starts each day, limiting fulfillment delays and production impacts,” he explained.

Feagins wants the 24/7 inventory surveillance option installed in his company's five U.S. buildings this year.

Corvus' R&D stages evolved into a continuous cycle of refining the technology to make it work. Over the past few years, the company has overcome numerous technical challenges, learning that no single solution exists to address all of them.

“There's not been one magic unlock that just solved everything. It's been a lot of lead bullets overcoming issues again and again, more banal issues, more surprising issues, and just kind of trusting in the strength of our engineering team to resolve them,” Wu said.

His company relied on open-source software whenever possible. However, much of the platform evolved around in-house coding, particularly in how they integrate software and hardware to achieve their unique autonomy in drone flying.

According to Wu, Corvus' approach has developed a unique robot-as-a-service subscription-based model that is unmatched by competitors' solutions. The cost factor is a key part of that success.

Prices vary depending on the facility's size and the number of flights. He described other solutions as partially autonomous or lower-tech, where users push a drone around or put up expensive setups beyond what Corvus charges.

“The interesting thing is that the customer makes ROI in month one because it is cheaper than what they are currently paying to do this job,” he concluded.

Starbucks CTO Deb Hall Lefevre has resigned, according to a report from Reuters, as the Seattle-based company navigates layoffs and various tech-related changes. 

Hall Lefevre resigned without a permanent replacement, according to a memo sent to staff last week that was seen by Reuters. 

Ningyu Chen, who was senior vice president of global experience technology, is now interim chief technology officer. Chen is based in Atlanta, according to his LinkedIn profile. 

Starbucks last week announced plans to lay off around 900 non-retail employees and close underperforming stores mainly in the U.S. and Canada. Starbucks previously cut 1,100 corporate workers in February.

Under the leadership of CEO Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who joined the company last year, Starbucks is making a bevy of technology tweaks as it tries to curb slumping sales. 

That includes a new algorithm for order sequencing; an overhaul of mobile ordering; sunsetting its pickup-only stores; a new AI assistant and point-of-sale system for baristas; and a new AI-powered inventory tracking system.

Hall Lefevre, who was also an executive vice president, joined Starbucks in 2022. She previously spent more than 16 years at McDonald's, where she was a corporate vice president and CIO, leading the fast food giant's technology and digital commerce strategy. She was also EVP and CTO at Circle K Stores.

Reuters reported that Starbucks' IT division is increasingly relying on an outside contractor based in India.

The Pacific Northwest — a hub for the fusion energy sector — has kicked off its annual Seattle Fusion Week. 

Three years ago Scott Hsu, then the fusion lead for the U.S. Department of Energy, told the event's attendees “the Seattle area has all the right ingredients to lead fusion into the future.”

The future hasn't yet arrived as local physicists and engineers are still laboring to recreate the atom-smashing reactions that power the sun. If any companies succeed in doing this in a cost-effective manner, it would unlock an abundant source of safe, clean energy — the so-called “Holy Grail” of renewable power.

While serious technical and financial hurdles remain, efforts keep nudging the sector closer toward its goals.  

Helion Energy this summer started construction in Central Washington on what it hopes will be the world's first commercial fusion power plant. Zap Energy has hit new milestones with its fusion reactors and energy-capturing technologies. Avalanche Energy is exploring neutron production and building a test facility for the sector. General Fusion had layoffs earlier this year, but is making progress with its demo device. 

Here's a round up of Pacific Northwest companies working to harness fusion power, startups that aim to support the sector, and notable research institutions — most of whom are participating in Seattle Fusion Week, which is hosted by CleanTech Alliance.

Helion's initial 50 megawatt facility, dubbed Orion, will be located near the Columbia River. If all goes to plan — and much remains uncertain — the reactor's electricity is earmarked for Microsoft data centers, and Helion has a separate deal to power Nucor steel. 

The company recently signed a lease for 166,500 square feet of new space in Everett, the Puget Sound Business Journal reports. The city is home to Helion's HQ and its seventh fusion prototype, a reactor called Polaris. 

Zap has built and is doing experiments with two fusion reactors (FuZE-Q and FuZE-3) and built its Century system, which includes key technologies for making and capturing power, namely liquid metal walls that absorb and transfer the heat produced by fusion, electrodes and energy-releasing capacitors.

In February, Zap hit a milestone for its DOE funding by operating the Century platform continuously for three hours, producing a series of 1,080 plasma shots without failure.

Avalanche is taking a different track with its desktop-sized energy fusion device and working multiple angles for revenue generation. 

That includes using its fusion machine for producing neutrons for commercial sale, and it has a Pentagon contract from the Defense Innovation Unit to develop technology for space propulsion and power generation. This summer, Avalanche landed a $10 million grant from the state to launch FusionWERX, a commercial-scale testing facility for fusion technologies in Eastern Washington.

In May, General Fusion's CEO made a public plea for more funding and shared news of layoffs (The Globe and Mail put the number at a quarter of the company's workforce). The company is building a prototype reactor in B.C. that will be half the size of its intended commercial device.

General Fusion has made multiple pivots over the years, including significant technology changes and a canceled demonstration project in the United Kingdom. 

In addition to the four Pacific Northwest companies working to build energy-producing fusion devices, three other ventures are offering supporting technologies and services.

AI coding tools are redefining software development and speeding up code generation. They are also creating new management hurdles.

Actual AI wants to help. 

The Seattle startup announced a $3.2 million seed round led by AlleyCorp to help build out its autonomous agent product designed to help engineering managers adapt to the AI era of development.

While AI coding tools can streamline some software tasks, they are also adding new ones — such as more manual review, coordination tasks, and maintenance challenges, according to Actual AI. Some studies show how AI tools are actually slowing down developers and creating more vulnerabilities.

The company's agent can automate recurring management duties: triaging issues, generating sprint summaries, routing code reviews, and enforcing architectural consistency. 

It's also designed to help reduce reliance on senior engineers and up-skill junior developers. 

“We're building an engineering manager agent that actually brings guardrails to AI-powered software development,” said CEO John Kennedy.

Actual AI is targeting organizations with 50 to 500 developers. It has 32 active pilots and some early revenue. 

“Every engineering manager now manages teams comprised of dozens of developers along with just as many AI agents,” Kenneth Auchenberg, partner at AlleyCorp, said in a statement. “Managers are outnumbered, and it's created bottlenecks that are killing productivity.”

The six-person company is led by Kennedy, a tech industry vet who worked at Amazon Web Services and Acquia. Co-founder and CTO Ethan Byrd is a former engineer at AWS, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

Actual AI competes with a number of developer productivity tools from startups and large corporations. Atlassian this month announced plans to acquire developer productivity insight platform DX for $1 billion.

Kennedy said his startup goes beyond traditional dashboards that provide metrics and instead acts on behalf of managers — automating the work itself rather than just reporting on it.

“A lot of engineering managers want to be player-coaches,” Kennedy said. “They want to be spending time with their engineers, up-leveling. They want to be helping with big, hard technical decisions. They want to be doing cool, fun stuff. They don't want to be doing mechanical admin work.”

Other backers include Irregular Expressions, G2C Ventures, and angel investors such as former Freshworks Americas president Bobby Jaffari and former Shelf Engine CTO Bede Jordan.

Actual AI was previously spotlighted in GeekWire's Startup Radar series.

You might have heard of “vibe coding.” Microsoft hopes “vibe working” will catch on next.

Much as non-developers can describe what types of programs to build, and let AI do the coding, Microsoft is bringing the concept to documents, spreadsheets and presentations with new features for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

The company describes “vibe working” as collaboration between people and AI agents inside its productivity apps. Instead of giving a one-time response, the updated Copilot AI tools generate, test, and refine content while users steer the direction, more like a dialogue.

Here's what the company announced Monday morning:

Microsoft says Office Agent in Copilot runs on AI models from Anthropic, maker of the Claude AI chatbot. That's part of a broader move by Microsoft to expand beyond models from OpenAI.

The company is racing to add AI features against Google, which is steadily adding generative AI to its Workspace apps, along with Apple, OpenAI, Anthropic, Canva, Notion, and many others developing agent-style AI systems for business, productivity, and design applications.

Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, which include the Office apps and Copilot for businesses, generated $87.8 billion in revenue in the 2025 fiscal year, ending in June, up 14% and second only to the company's server products and cloud services business.

The new features are rolling out in preview. Agent Mode is in Word and Excel on the web Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Personal or Family users, through Microsoft's Frontier program. Desktop versions and PowerPoint support will be released later. Office Agent is initially limited to Personal and Family users in the U.S., also through the Frontier program.

After nearly a decade of serving as a digital time capsule for moments from your life, Snapchat is now putting a price on its Memories features. The social media giant announced that free access to the feature will be limited to 5GB. If your memories exceed this limit, you'll need to subscribe to one of its new Memories Storage plans.

The company told TechCrunch in an email that the introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription. 

Snapchat explains that when it first launched Memories, it didn't expect it to grow to what it has today, as users have saved more than 1 trillion Memories on the platform.

“It's never easy to transition from receiving a service for free to paying for it, but we hope the value we provide with Memories is worth the cost,” Snapchat wrote in a blog post. “These changes will allow us to continue to invest in making Memories better for our entire community.”

Snapchat will provide 12 months of temporary Memories storage for any Memories that exceed the 5GB storage limit. The company notes that users can download Memories directly to their devices. If you're over the limit, but don't sign up for a plan, your oldest Snaps will be saved, while the most recent ones that are over the storage limit will be deleted. 

Snapchat says the change won't affect most users, as the vast majority have under 5GB of Memories. It will mainly impact those with “thousands of Snaps,” the company notes. 

Snapchat's decision to introduce paid storage for Memories allows it to address growing infrastructure costs and monetize users with high storage needs while keeping free access for most users.

Instagram has chosen India and South Korea to test a new interface that displays the app's Reels page first.

The company first showed off a similar design when it launched its first iPad app earlier this month. The new interface has Stories up top, like it did previously, but the DM button now lives on the navigation bar in the center, and the Reels tab will move to the second spot. You can swipe to navigate between these tabs.

The Following tab is now placed next to Reels, and gives you three feed options: “All” for recommended posts and reels from accounts you follow; “Friends” for posts and reels from mutuals; and “Latest” for the newest posts and reels.

Instagram said that while this redesign is being tested with a limited number of people, the company aims to roll it out globally.

Adding to its announcement last week that Instagram crossed 3 billion monthly users, Meta said on Monday that much of its growth is thanks to short videos, which are reshared across its various platforms 4.5 billion times. That is why it is more prominently featuring Reels and DMs in the app's interface.

Making democracy work isn't easy, as recent events have made clear. Some critics would argue that technology is making it worse. But one startup is hoping that AI could help bridge some differences instead of widen them.

“I had an a-ha moment one day when I realized people are asking AI to explain something like they're five years old,” Tomy Lorsch, co-founder and CEO of ComplexChaos, told TechCrunch. “What if we use it as a facilitator to help people understand each other and find common ground?”

He and co-founder Maya Ben Dror are developing tools to help people arrive at a consensus. One of their first test cases involved climate negotiations, but it really doesn't matter what the issue is. Their goal is to foster cooperation and shorten the time it takes for groups to come to agreement.

“Everyone is building software for collaboration like Slack, Google Docs, whatever,” Lorsch said. “Cooperation is a different piece.”

Facilitating cooperation isn't something that scales well, he said. Typically, trained facilitators will spend time with groups to help them arrive at a consensus, but that process can slow down when negotiations or preparations happen across time zones or even in different rooms.

Lorsch was buoyed by a recent LLM developed by Google called the Habermas Machine, which was developed explicitly with that goal in mind. “This is basically an AI that generates group consensus statements where people feel represented both by majority and minority point of view,” he said.

Lorsch and Ben Dror recently trialed their startup's tool to help young delegates from nine African nations prepare for climate-related negotiations at a United Nations campus in Bonn, Germany. The tool incorporates both Google's Habermas Machine and OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate questions, come up with goals for conversations, and help summarize long documents.

The goal, Ben Dror said, is to help the delegates arrive at consensus as a bloc before they begin negotiations with others. 

Ideally, the tool would help speed things during negotiations, too. When blocs, or delegates from groups of aligned countries, encounter new information in the process of a large negotiating session, they often need to regroup to process the new information. “Blocs are usually the reason why negotiations have to stop. The bloc has to come out, renegotiate, reposition, and then go back in. And that creates a lot of friction,” Ben Dror said. ComplexChaos hopes that its tool can help shorten that time.

In the trial with the delegates from African countries, ComplexChaos said that participants reported up to a 60% reduction in the time it took to coordinate, and that 91% of participants said that the AI tool helped them see perspectives they would have otherwise missed.

ComplexChaos is also pitching its cooperation tool to companies, including tech companies and large consultancies. “Strategic planning by AI is basically the same problem,” Lorsch said. “The annual strategic planning process of most companies takes about three months of the year with back and forth negotiations, multi-layer, across time zones, across teams, and so on and so forth.”

But Lorsch and Ben Dror are most enthusiastic when talking about climate negotiations. 

“If AI can shorten these processes, simplify them, then we'd be so much better off. Not just for climate, for anything sustainability, for any big challenge that we're facing,” Ben Dror said.

Posted:

Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer is closing the doors on her consumer software startup Sunshine, and is selling the company's assets to her new AI startup, Dazzle. The news was first reported by Wired, which cited an email sent to Sunshine's shareholders.

Dazzle is setting out to build an AI personal assistant, the report cited anonymous sources as saying, and added that all of Sunshine's employees will move to the new company.

Almost all of Sunshine's investors, who include Norwest Venture Partners, Felicis Partners, and SV Angel, have signed off on the deal, Wired cited the sources as saying. 

Originally founded in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management, dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” That product saw little adoption due to privacy concerns about privacy, and pretty much languished. In 2024, the service added event management and photo sharing — with a touch of AI, of course — but with little success. Both apps have been downloaded just over 1,000 times on the Google Play Store.

The company had raised about $20 million in 2020, and according to Meyer, was largely self-funded.

The social network Bluesky will begin verifying users' ages in the state of Ohio to comply with new regulations, starting on Monday, September 29. The company — which offers an open and decentralized competitor to X and Threads — says it will enable the Kids Web Services' (KWS) age verification solution in the state. This is the same solution that Bluesky is already using in South Dakota and Wyoming to comply with similar laws.

Bluesky announced the move in Ohio on Sunday via its Bluesky Safety account, and in an update to last month's blog post about the matter.

The changes come as a number of U.S. states are rolling out their own age verification laws to protect children from online risks, given the lack of federal guidance. The Ohio law, meant to protect kids from pornography, will require users in Ohio to upload a copy of their government-issued photo ID or other personal identification before accessing adult content. This includes the type of adult content that can be found on social networks.

KWS will provide the technical infrastructure that allows Bluesky to verify users' ages by offering multiple ways for them to do so beyond only uploading a government-issued identity document. According to its website, KWS also lets users verify by facial scans, payment cards, and more. 

Unfortunately for U.S. users, these age assurance laws aren't all written the same. 

One law that rolled out in Mississippi, which used poorly written and overly broad language, led Bluesky to suspend services in the state. The startup explained at the time that, as a small team, they didn't have the resources to make the substantial technical changes needed to comply. This left the state open to larger competitors, like Meta, which continues to dominate the social networking market. 

These legal requirements could ultimately hurt smaller startups like Bluesky, which are still working to gain traction under tech giant Meta's shadow. Having to verify their age may deter potential new users and divert the team's attention from other areas where it could innovate, like features, protocols, and other underlying technology. 

The addition of an age verification for users in Ohio comes shortly after some Bluesky users began pushing back against updates to the company's moderation services and terms. Bluesky recently committed to more aggressively punishing those who violate the site's guidelines, including rules against harassment and toxic content.

1. Bi-facial solar panels: can take in sunlight from either end2. Mounting bi-facials vertically so they can take in sunlight from both directions.I've been hearing experiments about these for a few years now. There's three main benefits to the vertical arrangement that could, given certain situations, make it more economically valuable:1. In places with high-albedo snowy winters, this arrangement can boost winter production, which if you have snow, tends to be the energy-heavy time of year.2. Keeps panels cooler. Panels lose efficiency when they get hot, and by having them vertical, they can run cooler. Losses in less direct sunlight are somewhat offset by efficiency gains from cooler operations.3. More power during shoulder periods (anti-duck-curve). Especially in places like California that have high solar penetration, prices for excess energy are minimal during peak solar activity. Vertical arrangements give more power in the morning and evening, which is when traditional fields are just ramping up or ramping down. Thus, even if you're making less power overall, you can be making more valuable power by having more production during these ramp-up/ramp-down periods.Unclear how much of an effect these counter-acting forces actually add, but I understand solar developers are looking into these arrangements.

I'm not sure how true that is of course but it does make you think a bit. The optimal place where to put solar panels increasingly is becoming ""wherever you can afford to"". If vertical space is what you have, why not use it?People in apartments don't have access to roofs. But they might have balconies. Balcony railings can fit a few solar panels usually.You can buy solar panels for use on balconies in the supermarket in Germany. They only generate a few hundred watt. But that can add up to close to something like a kwh per day if you get a lot of sun on your balcony. At 40 cents per kwh. That's 12 or so euros per month. I pay about 70 per month currently. And I can get a couple of balcony panels for something like 200-300 euros. And I might get some money back on those even. The idea with balcony solar is that it might offset part of what your fridge uses. You simply plug it into a wall socket and your fridge takes that power instead of from the grid. All safe and approved equipment, the inverter cuts the power if there is no grid power.I haven't done this (my balcony faces east and only gets a few hours of sun in the early morning). But it's easy to see how this could work.

So, not price parity but also only about a factor of 2 or so. On the other hand, Ali Express panels are about half that UK price at a 10 panel quantity, with unknown shipping.I'm kind of eyeing the concrete block wall in the back garden currently covered by a hedge.

My current strategy for small installations when you have an equator facing wall or fence is slap the panels on it and be done with it.

It turns out these enable a very high specific-power PV cell that adds another even more attractive production curve behind what is happening in vertical bi-facials. See e.g.:https://ee.stanford.edu/frederick-nitta-koosha-nassiri-nazif...https://www.arinna.xyz/

Whole industries are going to pop up to take advantage of the intermittent very cheap electricity.  Also there will be a competitive balance between the cost of storage and the ""cost"" of non-optimally aligned solar panels.

Also: ""Specifically, [Dave] is using bifacial solar panels– panels that have cells on both sides. In his preferred orientation, one side faces South, while the other faces North. [Dave] is in the Northern Hemisphere, so those of you Down Under would have to do the opposite, pointing one face North and the other South.""Isn't that the same thing? Is one of the sides specifically meant to face the sun? Maybe I'm just not as knowledgeable about solar panels, but what sunlight is being harnessed by the backside of the sun facing panel? Are they catching reflected light, otherwise, they are directly in shadow.

But it's usually more common to orient them east-west, so they have peaks in the mornings and in the afternoon/evening, which combines well with other solar panels that are mounted south-facing, or might even just match your electricity consumption pattern better.

reply

77% of the 'normal orientation' per year,  but the graph and 131% value is for a day in winter (January 15 this year). At least that's my read.

This is also in January, when the sun in Ohio is very low in the southern sky. So north/south oriented panels are much more ideal.

reply

I had the same reaction. I noticed the top comment reading ""some of us live in the southern hemisphere"" so maybe this was a quick edit and not thought through?Unless one of the sides of the panel is meant to face north, but that doesn't sound likely

The reason i say this is that in some parts of the world capitalist things like building renewables to make or save money is politicised as a left or right wing issue with people arbitrarily for or against purely on that bucketing.The politicisation is stupid and doesn't even align well to any traditional left/right political divide other than ‘at one point in history they fell on one side or the other of the issue' so now they are stuck there. It's interesting with the perspective of someone who's experienced a different countries right/left wing politics which have completely different views on various issues. As in there's often no reason for such things to be in either side honestly. In fact for certain things that never got politicised in the USA such as battery storage the red states are leading the world in grid connected battery installation rates since it's so profitable and the topic has avoided being bucketed into a left/right category all the while blocking offshore wind farm installation which has been bucketed as such.Anyway due to this politicisation you cannot just post ‘this renewable initiative doesn't work' without honest analysis to back it up. This would need to include the massive drop in solar power and battery prices that have occurred recently.

Two powerful Atlantic storms are threatening the East Coast with dangerous surf conditions this week, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Category 4 Hurricane Humberto is swirling over the central Atlantic and hammering the beaches of the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda with high surf and life-threatening rip currents, the NHC reported early Monday morning. Forecasters expect these conditions to begin affecting much of the East Coast today.

As Humberto tracks northwest toward the U.S., Tropical Storm Imelda is gaining strength roughly 300 miles (483 kilometers) off the coast of South Florida. This system will likely reach hurricane status by 2:00 p.m. ET Tuesday, the NHC reports. Forecasters expect Imelda to bring tropical storm conditions to the Bahamas and Cuba through Tuesday, creating a risk of flash flooding and mudslides. Large swaths of the Southeast Coast are also at risk of flash flooding as heavy rainfall reaches the U.S.

The NHC doesn't expect either of these storms to make landfall, but their combined impact could produce dangerous marine conditions and rip currents along the east coasts of Florida and Georgia today. The National Weather Service has issued gale-force wind, hurricane, and tropical storm warnings from Florida to Massachusetts, as these conditions are likely to rapidly spread northward.

That said, Humberto will play a key role in preventing Imelda from directly hitting the East Coast. Imelda's northward track is currently being steered by a subtropical ridge, but by Tuesday, forecasters expect Humberto to weaken that ridge and cause the tropical storm to veer east away from the U.S.

The NHC expects Imelda to dump 1 to 2 inches of rain—with local maximum totals up to 4 inches—through Tuesday across northeast Florida, coastal South Carolina, and coastal sections of southeast North Carolina. This could result in isolated flash and urban flooding.

“This storm is deadly serious. Not just serious. Deadly serious,” South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a news conference, according to NBC News. McMaster said authorities were prepositioning search and rescue crews over the weekend. In North Carolina, Governor Josh Stein declared a state of emergency before Imelda even formed.

This storm is likely to produce another 2 to 4 inches of rain in eastern Cuba and 4 to 8 inches in the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday, raising the risk of flash flooding and mudslides, according to the NHC. As Imelda approaches Bermuda, 2 to 4 inches of rain could fall between Wednesday and Thursday.

So far this season, every Atlantic hurricane—Erin, Gabrielle, and Humberto—has reached “major” strength, but none of them have made landfall in the U.S. Whether Imelda continues this trend remains to be seen, but it's clear that it will be impactful for the Southeast.

We'll be waiting until next year for the first round of PCs sporting Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip, plus whatever Intel and AMD have in store for lightweight laptops. As a hint of what to expect, in stepped a company nobody had ever heard of, offering a laptop few people wanted. Humain (no, not that AI wearable company that bricked its wonky AI Pin and sold itself to HP for peanuts), a Saudi Arabian company, debuted a laptop at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), that looks like every other clamshell notebook, save for one small detail. Instead of the Copilot key that's become standardized on Windows machines, it features an “Humain” AI key.

Humain's laptop is a Windows machine at its heart, powered by the Snapdragon X2 Elite chip. But the AI key brings up an extra layer of UI called Humain One. Through the interface, you can call up an AI chatbot, an AI image generator, and a few more semi-interesting capabilities. There's a special chatbot for homework help, document summaries, or a “Story Generator.” The AI will create a narrative using the average third-grade reading level.

It's nothing we haven't seen before, most obviously from Microsoft's own Copilot AI, which is built into the company's 365 apps and desktop. Humain usurped Copilot's new laptop with the promise that at least some of the AI processes are being handled on-device. The notebook is otherwise packing solid-sounding specs, from an OLED display designed by Samsung, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. No, the company didn't have any word about how much the machine will cost, or when, or where it will be available. There's no word if it will come to the U.S., either. The only question remaining is, would you want it to?

I spent all of Snapdragon Summit barely able to take in the epic sights of Maui through the haze of big tech AI hype. Qualcomm's new slogan, “AI is the new UI,” ran like a river through every new announcement and demo. Qualcomm wanted to imply that on-device AI will be able to look into your fridge and suggest meals (Samsung's fridges already do that). You can use an AI app called Collov AI to remodel rooms in your house with new furniture, though it currently doesn't have any hookup to major furniture retailers to see how products you can actually buy might look in your abode. It's nothing I haven't seen before; only now these features are supposedly running on the device, versus in the cloud.

Qualcomm's explanation for how this works suggests that the new Snapdragon X2 Elite chip for PCs has such strong AI processing capabilities, but if a laptop or mini-PC using it ever gets overwhelmed, it can bring in the big guns—the major datacenters with such massive cloud compute they could suck the power grid dry. On-device AI should be the goal for every company. AI models are getting better at being contained. The Snapdragon X2 Elite's redesigned NPU—or neural processing engine built for low-key or background AI tasks—now sports 80 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) versus the 45 TOPS on the original Snapdragon X platform.

What that translates to is still vague. Collov AI, the home decoration app, was tasking the NPU at just 10%. The GPU, or graphics processing unit, was taking the brunt of the rest of the AI image generation. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, though I have yet to see a demo that can truly tax the NPU.

I ran multiple benchmark tests on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme platform, all done on non-commercial test machines with 48GB of RAM and 1TB SSD under the hood. I was standing in front of many Qualcomm reps ready to slap my hand if I tried jumping for any non-synthetic benchmark. From what I could see, the chip does have more power behind it than previous Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm chips. The problem is that when you try and benchmark for AI performance, even if the chip does well, it's too difficult to determine what that translates to when you're using the device as a daily driver.

The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme's GPU was especially impressive. The laptops managed to hit a score of 5,648 and an average of 41 fps in 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light test and 23,586 in the Solar Bay benchmark. It all suggests that laptops with the Snapdragon X2 Extreme chip will be great for graphics tasks, but the issue will be the number of apps and drivers that are compatible with Qualcomm's ARM-based chip. Apps like Maxon's ZBrush should have an ARM version by early 2026, but good luck trying to get any gaming done on these machines.

These tests can only offer a perspective of what users could potentially expect from actual products. I couldn't possibly say how much the X2 Elite Extreme laptops will cost in this age of tariffs. Recent rumors suggested TSMC, which manufactures these chips, is going to pass tariff costs for 3nm process CPUs onto Qualcomm and fellow chipmaker MediaTek.

“It's [TSMC's] choice to try to figure out what to do with the pricing structure,” said Alex Katouzian, Qualcomm's head of compute and mobile. “What we constantly think about is, ‘How do I get the most efficient design, meaning performance per millimeter square?'”

                reading time 3 minutes
      

After a vague gesture in early May this year that his administration would be including foreign-made films in its proxy war on the global economy, U.S. President Donald Trump has once again returned to the idea—and again has done so without offering any feasible reason as to why or how the U.S. government would put tariffs on the global film industry.

In between taking potshots at NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and reiterating other, similarly absurd tariff threats (including threatening any country that does not make furniture in the United States), this morning President Trump took to his platform of choice, Truth Social, to once again threaten an imposition of a 100% tariff “on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.”

“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby,'” the President said in his post, before taking a customary potshot at one of his favorite targets, California Governor Gavin Newsom.

Just as was the case in May, Trump's “announcement” includes no details on just how such a tariff would be imposed and collected and continues to raise questions as to how such a tariff would be legally feasible. There's also little understanding as to why Trump has picked now to rethreaten the imposition, beyond the President's penchant for flip-flopping back and forth on his myriad social media demands.

The President's belief that the U.S. movie industry is losing out to considerable tax incentives offered by foreign film industries remains largely true. Filming hubs in states like California and Georgia have seen major movie studios decamp in favor of shooting in countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, all of which offer both high incentives for foreign productions and the promise of reduced labor costs in comparison to working in the states.

Earlier this year, Marvel Studios left behind production from its longtime home in Atlanta, Georgia, to film projects primarily in the UK going forward, starting with Fantastic Four: First Steps but continuing with films like Avengers: Doomsday and Spider-Man: Brand New Day with Sony. This summer, Governor Newsom announced an increase on the cap for California's film and TV tax credit from $330 million to $750 million, citing similarly competitive credits offered in other U.S. states and around the world.

But that also doesn't really take into account that movies film outside of the U.S. simply because they have chosen to shoot in, and set stories in or inspired by, locations that are not the United States. Trump's vague demands do not make it clear if the tariff applies to films made by U.S. studios or simply any film project that films internationally full stop—and as was the case in May, it also fails to make any mention of the TV industry, which likewise faces similar circumstances.

With little indication as to how the Trump administration would act upon the President's demand, there's little knowing just how the film industry is going to react to Trump's renewed threat. Previously, the White House offered a somewhat reconciliatory statement after his remarks in May, simply saying that the administration was still in the process of exploring decisions as to how it could be “Making Hollywood Great Again,” followed by months of silence on the matter until now.

Whatever happens, it would appear that the administration's lack of follow-through up to this point is not quite rattling the movie industry as it almost did the first time he made the threat. CNN reports that as of this morning, only Netflix opened down on the U.S. stock exchange in the wake of Trump's comments (by 1%), while other movie industry-affiliated companies, such as Disney and AMC, opened higher.

The Federal Trade Commission took Amazon to court early last week. Only two days after the trial started, Amazon caved in to sign a $2.5 billion settlement.

At the heart of the lawsuit was the Amazon Prime subscription program. The FTC claimed that Amazon tricked millions of customers into signing up for a Prime membership using deceptive design techniques and then made the cancellation process onerously difficult.

The $2.5 billion settlement is made up of a $1 billion civil penalty paid to the government, the largest ever involving an FTC rule violation, and $1.5 billion in refunds to affected consumers, the second-highest restitution award ever obtained by the FTC.

“Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again,” FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a press release.

“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin told Gizmodo.

The FTC estimates that roughly 35 million consumers were impacted by this scheme. Chances are, you could be one of the 35 million, and you could be eligible to benefit from the refunds totaling a record-breaking $1.5 billion.

For starters, you have to be a customer in the United States who signed up for an Amazon Prime membership or unsuccessfully tried to cancel an existing Prime subscription some time between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025.

But even then, you had to have signed up via what the FTC calls a “challenged enrollment flow,” aka a misleading enrollment page. According to the FTC, you are eligible for a claims payout if you signed up for a Prime membership via the shipping option selection page (that is, if you clicked to have free shipping without realizing that meant registering for a Prime membership), Prime Video, or any versions of the Universal Prime Decision Page or Amazon's single page checkout.

The first set of payouts will be made automatically within 90 days of the FTC order. If you signed up for an Amazon Prime membership using the challenged enrollment flow and used no more than three Prime benefits within any 12-month period of your enrollment, then you will be automatically qualified for a payout. Prime benefits do include free, expedited shipping unless the transaction at hand would have already included that speed of shipping for free without a Prime membership.

Once the first round of automatic claims payouts is done, Amazon will send out a claims form within 30 days to other eligible customers. This second wave will include people who tried to cancel Prime unsuccessfully and those who signed up via a challenged enrollment flow but used up to 10 Prime benefits over any 12-month period. Once you receive the form, you will have up to 180 days to submit it back to Amazon via email, pre-paid mail, or a settlement website, which Amazon has yet to establish. Once you submit your claim, Amazon will have only 30 days to review and issue your refund.

Amazon is required to refund affected customers the total amount of Amazon Prime membership fees paid during their entire subscription period, but the refunds will be capped at $51 per customer. A standard Prime membership currently costs $14.99 a month or $139 annually.

If by the end of the two waves of claims payouts, Amazon has paid less than $1 billion in funds, then the tech giant is required to send more automatic payouts until the threshold is reached. For example, if necessary, Amazon will start issuing automatic refunds to customers who fit all other automatic payout requirements but used up to four Prime benefits in a 12-month period and failed to submit a claim in time.

President Donald Trump seems to have gone off the QAnon deep end. In a post on his Truth Social account published over the weekend, Trump shared an AI-generated video of himself announcing the arrival of “medbeds,” a speculative technology that can supposedly heal all injuries.

Trump's post, since deleted, was published Friday. The video featured a fictionalized Fox News segment that included the fake Trump proclaiming that every American would soon receive their own medbed card, providing them access to newly opened hospitals with the technology (though the post was deleted, other people preserved the video itself). Some people, particularly QAnon adherents, believe that medbeds exist but have been kept away from the public at the behest of the rich and powerful.

Trump tonight appears to have pushed the false ""medbed"" conspiracy theory, which has spread in the far-right internet over the years. https://t.co/L1MBPIU4ON pic.twitter.com/wWBQPDFbnb

— Alex Kaplan (@AlKapDC) September 28, 2025



“These facilities are safe, modern, and designed to restore every citizen to full health,” AI Trump stated.

The medbed conspiracy theory dates back several years, though it's an extension of similar beliefs that have long circulated among some alternative medicine and New Age proponents. The premise is simple enough: there are beds or devices outfitted with technology that can effectively cure every ailment known to humans. The world's elite, however, have purportedly buried this technology, which may or may not have been made with the help of aliens, or are only using it for themselves.

Gizmodo reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response prior to publication.

Some people and businesses even claim to sell medbeds, though these appear to be nothing more than gussied-up motel rooms or grossly expensive at-home “generators.” At least one medbed-related company, Tesla BioHealing, has since changed its advertising to avoid the explicit mention of medbeds; the company had previously received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration in 2023 over how it falsely marketed its products as medical treatments. Its “quantum healing” generator currently sells for $11,000. Other scammers will instead sell medbed cards that will supposedly grant people future access to these beds once available.

Trump is hardly one to shy away from conspiratorial trends.

In recent days on his Truth Social account, for instance, he continued to push for several policy changes advocated by the anti-vaccination movement, such as breaking apart the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine; he also shared a video supportive of the “great replacement theory” (the far-right, white nationalist belief that the world's elites are planning to eradicate white people). Those posts, incidentally, remain up. Trump also infamously popularized the conspiracy belief that former President Barack Obama was secretly born in Kenya.

Still, it's not clear why Trump would even want to share the medbed post, especially since it promised his followers something he couldn't possibly deliver on.

The quiet deference to Nvidia's CEO reveals how much power the company still holds over AI's most ambitious companies.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new report claims that before Amazon or Google reveals anything about their latest artificial intelligence chips, they first notify Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The practice, touted by sources in The Information's recent report on Nvidia's internal dealmaking, reflects the quiet reality of the AI hardware market: Nvidia is still the dominant supplier of training compute, and its customers are trying not to get cut off.

According to the report, Amazon and Google each provide advance notice to Huang before unveiling updates to their custom silicon. The reason, sources say, is that Nvidia is still deeply embedded in their cloud operations and neither wants to surprise the person who effectively controls their AI infrastructure supply. Nvidia accounts for the overwhelming majority of the accelerators used to train large language models, and its GPUs also handle a growing share of inference tasks in the public cloud.

This deference comes as Nvidia is pouring billions into customers, suppliers, and competitors alike in a bid to tighten its grip on the market. In September alone, Nvidia signed a deal to buy up to $6.3 billion worth of unused GPU capacity from CoreWeave over the next seven years. It also invested $700 million in British data center startup Nscale and spent more than $900 million to acquire the CEO and key engineers of networking startup Enfabrica while licensing its chip technology. That followed news of a $5 billion investment in Intel to support joint chip development and a letter of intent with OpenAI to back a 10-gigawatt GPU data center buildout that could cost up to $100 billion.

The scale and timing of those investments show how aggressively Nvidia is trying to preempt the rise of non-GPU accelerators. Companies like Amazon, Google, and OpenAI are all pursuing in-house silicon efforts designed to reduce dependency on Nvidia hardware and improve performance or cost at scale. But even with years of effort and tens of billions of dollars behind them, their platforms are still heavily reliant on Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem, software tooling, and manufacturing pipeline.

According to The Information, Nvidia's dominance has created a dynamic where it acts like a financial backstop to the entire AI supply chain. The company can now fund suppliers, rent out capacity, and underwrite long-term purchases to support continued demand for its hardware. That makes it harder for any individual customer to walk away, even as they build competing products.

For now, the biggest names in cloud computing are still briefing Jensen Huang before revealing their next chips. That sort of dynamic may not last forever, but it says a lot about where the power still sits today.

Can competing chip makers strike back before the X2's arrival in 2026?

Last week, Qualcomm announced its upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme chips for laptops and compact desktops at its yearly summit in Maui. Some specs were revealed (the top-end Extreme model will pack 18 cores and a top clock speed of 5 GHz on two cores), and the company made lofty promises of up to 31% better performance while sipping 43% less power than its first-gen Snapdragon X silicon. But it didn't showcase any benchmark numbers or back up those claims – until now.

We were at the event and able to run some tests ourselves on the company's slim reference design laptop. The conditions were controlled in the sense that the systems were set up by Qualcomm, with the benchmarks pre-installed, and we couldn't install any software ourselves.

Basically, we could click a benchmark and watch it run ourselves to retrieve numbers, and a couple of stations were set up showcasing typical results that were retrieved earlier. The results we saw were in the range of the results Qualcomm's slide deck results, below.

 




This is obviously far from an ideal way to judge performance. But numbers taken from reference systems should generally be taken with a few grains of salt anyway, because the performance of final retail devices will vary based on a system's cooling, as well as how the chip is configured to run for a given chassis or form factor.

So keep in mind that these are very early numbers that came from only the top-end chip tested in a reference design, and may be competing against chips that will no longer be the latest and greatest when Snapdragon X2 systems ship, which Qualcomm says will be in the first half of next year.

 




As for the reference system used for testing, it's a slim 16-inch laptop that Qualcomm says is equipped with 1TB of storage, and the chip packs 48GB of LPDDR5X-9523 RAM on a wide 192-bit bus. Doubtlessly, that helps boost the scores in several of the benchmarks below – especially graphics performance. But we'll likely have to wait quite a while to see how that impacts battery life over the more typical 128-bit bus of the non-extreme X2 Elite SoCs.

All that said, though, it's hard to argue that these numbers are anything but impressive.

For CPU testing, Qualcomm used Geekbench 6.5. In single-core, the X2 Elite Extreme achieved a single-core score of 4,080, beating the previous-gen Snapdragon X Elite (X1E-84-100, the top-end consumer chip) by 39%. Qualcomm also shows it beating the AMD Ryzen 9 HX 370 (2,881), Intel Core Ultra 9 288V (2,919), Intel Core Ultra 9 285H (3,026), and Apple M4 (3,872, tested in an actively cooled MacBook Pro).

In multi-core testing, the Extreme earned a score of 23,491, beating the old X Elite at 15,637 — a 50% increase. Qualcomm says this is up to twice as fast as the Core Ultra 9 288V (11,406). Here, the Core Ultra 9 285H took second place at 17,680.

Note that the new X2 Elite Extreme now supports Arm Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) instructions, which accelerate matrix operations commonly found in AI and HPC-class workloads. However, this extension isn't commonly used in standard desktop applications. The new Geekbench 6.5 features newly added support for SME, which contributes to some of these large performance gains in this benchmark.

Qualcomm measured the GPU with 3DMark Solar Bay ray tracing benchmark, which uses the Vulkan 1.1 graphics API (except on macOS, where it uses Apple's Metal). This is generally not a test we see run on integrated graphics. So, Qualcomm is likely either attempting to make a statement about its chip's gaming abilities or cherry-picking a test where it looks particularly impressive (my money is on a bit of both). Regardless, the X2 Elite Extreme earned a score of 90.06, 80% faster than last generation, and, per Qualcomm's testing, up to 61% faster than competitors (the AMD Ryzen 9 AI HX 370 scored 55.92). Intel's Core Ultra 9 288V was the closest competitor.

For NPU testing, Qualcomm used Procyon AI Computer Vision, where the Hexagon silicon earned a score of 4,151, 78% faster than the X1E-84-100. Qualcomm also says this score is as much as 5.7 times faster than the NPU in the Core Ultra 9 285H, and also beat the rest of the field.

Qualcomm ran a second AI test using Geekbench AI 1.5, with the Extreme earning a score of 88,615. While that's far faster than the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 did not run the test.

In short, the X2 Elite Extreme looks technically capable of beating pretty much every mobile chip currently on the market, often by a significant margin. But again, keep in mind that these benchmarks were chosen by Qualcomm, running in their own custom-designed chassis. So it's fair to assume that we are seeing best-case results.

Timing will also be important. Qualcomm has only stated that we should see X2 Extreme devices in the first half of 2026, which is a fairly wide window and as far as eight months in the future. Depending on when they arrive on shelves, they may be competing with improved next-gen designs from Apple, Intel, and AMD, which, at the very least, are likely to make these current comparisons look a little less impressive.

Price will also be a serious consideration, as Qualcomm representatives told us that we should expect X2 Elite Extreme should arrive at a price tier higher than the range we saw last year with the launch of its first-gen Snapdragon X chips. In short, X2 Extreme systems will probably sell for significantly more than $1,000. The lesser X2 Elite chips will almost certainly be more popular. But then again, if the company can maintain an impressive performance lead over its next-gen competition, there will always be those willing to pay extra for the best performance possible.

CraftGPT is hewn from 1020x260x1656 Redstone blocks in the game.

A developer and enthusiast Minecrafter has showcased a project dubbed CraftGPT on GitHub. In an amazing feat of Minecraft Redstone engineering, Sammyuri — famed for building a 1Hz CPU inside the game — has built a small language model that runs on a computer inside Minecraft, trained on the TinyChat dataset. The CraftGPT project is hewn from 1,020 x 260 x 1,656 blocks in the game (439 million in total), and functions as advertised, but a major usability drawback is that you will have to “wait a couple [of] hours for the response to be generated.”

The video above shows the colossal in-game computer that was built to run CraftGPT. Sammyuri explains that the game's Distant Horizons mod was needed to capture this ‘fly-by' footage of the computer build.

Naturally, even with such an impressive Redstone project, CraftGPT isn't going to replace more traditional methods of getting an LLM up and running on your PC. Sammyuri asks users/testers to temper their expectations. “The model is very prone to going off-topic, producing responses that are not grammatically correct, or simply outputting garbage,” admits the project developer.

So, how did Sammyuri use Redstone to put this project together? Redstone provides electronic components within the Minecraft environment. The video shows the in-game CraftGPT contraption being put together component-by-component. It has tokenizers, matrix multipliers, and so on. Sammyuri explains that the small language model used was created without command blocks or data packs in Minecraft. Moreover, “the model has 5,087,280 parameters, trained in Python on the TinyChat dataset of basic English conversations,” says the developer.

AI-wranglers may also be interested to know that the 5-million parameter CraftGPT “has an embedding dimension of 240, vocabulary of 1920 tokens, and consists of 6 layers. The context window size is 64 tokens, which is enough for (very) short conversations.” Sammyuri adds that “Most weights were quantized to 8 bits, although the embedding and LayerNorm weights are stored at 18 and 24 bits respectively.”

CraftGPT is admittedly not in any way a rival to the chatbot sites and apps you may use day to day. We already mentioned some limitations of chat quality, depth, and even accuracy. But probably by far its largest wrinkle is performance-related.

A Minecraft Redstone constructed processor or computer might be a modern marvel, but it pales in comparison to real hardware. Thus, the CraftGPT chat experience is severely hampered by response time. Typically, the system will need about two hours to answer a simple prompt, says Sammyuri. This is even with the tick rate increased to about 40,000x speed using MCHPRS (the Minecraft High Performance Redstone Server).

“[Yantar] is the tool Russia is using to somehow . . . keep us awake""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new FT investigation has revealed how a Russian ""military spy ship"" has been tracked surveilling and mapping undersea cables along Europe's Atlantic coastline, possibly with nefarious purposes that could involve intercepting communications from NATO allies.

Undersea cables have become a hot-button topic of global infrastructure ever since a series of high-profile incidents that involved the cutting of cables relied upon by nations for global connectivity. Famously, a cable connecting Finland and Sweden to Europe was severed last year, an act of sabotage recently pinned on the crew of a Russian 'shadow fleet' tanker charged with the act.

FT's report claims that the Yantar sailed from Russia's Kola Peninsula in November of 2024, disguised as a civilian craft. The report claims the vessel is a ""military spy ship"" decked out with ""a full armoury of surveillance equipment."" Its purpose? ""...a mission to map and potentially intercept the undersea cables on which NATO allies rely for internet access, energy, military communications, and financial transactions.""

The report cites radar data from European Space Agency satellites, which purportedly show the ship lurking over undersea cables in the Irish Sea in November of last year, ""at a point in the voyage when the ship was seeking to hide its activities."" The report claims the ship was also spotted over cables between Norway and Svalbard, a strategically notable location in the Arctic.

FT alleges Russia held back the capabilities of Yantar following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, perhaps because of sanctions or fear of escalating tensions. The report says the Yantar's activities fall under the purview of Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodnikh Issledovanii (GUGI), which operates some 50 submarines, submersibles, and other crafts. According to the report, Yantar is just one of ""several"" vehicles that have spent months in UK waters conducting sustained surveillance around critical infrastructure like undersea cables, reflecting a broader heightened scene of activity in geopolitical affairs.

The report contains detailed maps documenting the Yantar's journey, including the aforementioned foray into the Irish Sea and stints in the English Channel as recently as this year. As the report notes, a country like the UK relies heavily on undersea conduits for data and raw materials like gas, with 99% of its digital communications and three-quarters of its gas supply funnelled along the sea floor. There are also more sensitive cables, like a US-UK network for tracking enemy submarines, the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System.

The report claims Yantar can drop ""submersibles with manipulator arms"" which can intercept information from them or even plant explosives. It's even possible Russia could interfere with timing signals sent along cables by interfering with the frequency of signals passing through, possibly disrupting high-frequency trading markets and other ""time-sensitive industries.""

The report details some of the history of the secretive GUGI outfit, and notes that Yantar has become a more conspicuous presence on the seas as its role has evolved. The report notes the Royal Navy is seeking funding for defensive sensors and underwater drones dubbed the ""Atlantic Bastion"" to protect undersea cables and its vital Trident nuclear submarines. Military experts cited in the report say that some countries have fallen behind the curve when it comes to deep-sea defense, citing ""heightened concerns"" that Russia may target cables to disrupt life in Western nations, notably in countries offering help and security to Ukraine.

California nurses with doctorates do not have the right to call themselves doctors, a federal court ruled, upholding a state law that regulates what titles health professionals can use in advertisements.

In a September 19 decision, the US District Court for the Central District of California rejected claims by nurses with Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degrees that the state violated their free speech rights by banning them from using the title “Dr” in the healthcare setting.

The use of “Dr” by nonphysicians in clinical settings is “inherently misleading” commercial speech and is not protected by the First Amendment, District Judge Jesus G. Bernal wrote in his ruling.

Pacific Legal Fund attorney Donna Matias, who represented the nurses, said the plaintiffs were disappointed that the court “failed to grapple with relevant Supreme Court precedent that protects First Amendment rights.”

“Instead of reining in the state's power to censor professionals who accurately describe their credentials, the decision emboldens it,” Matias said in an email to Medscape Medical News. “The First Amendment does not allow the government to silence truthful speech simply because some listeners may be confused — especially when disclosure can address any concerns short of a total ban.”The defendants in the case, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and California Medical Board President Kristina Lawson, did not return messages seeking comment.

The California Medical Association (CMA), welcomed the decision, saying it upholds the state's “well-established prohibition against nonphysicians using the title ‘Dr' in healthcare settings.” The CMA filed a joint amicus brief with the American Medical Association (AMA) in the case in support of the defendants.

“This decision protects patients by providing clarity and transparency about the level of training and education of the person providing their care,” CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, MD, said in a statement. “Allowing patients to make informed decisions is foundational to our health care system.”

Under California's Business and Professions Code Section 2052, anyone who refers to themselves as a doctor in words or in advertisements without having a valid certificate as a physician is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to sanctions.

Three California DNPs sued the state over the law in June 2023. Two of the plaintiff nurses said they've used the title “Dr” in the past on embroidered clinician jackets, clinical documents, nameplates, and on social media.

Before learning about the law, plaintiff Jacqueline Palmer testified she introduced herself to patients as “Dr” but always added she was a nurse practitioner. A third plaintiff intended to use the title when he opened his esthetics clinic but put the opening and its website on hold after he learned about the law, according to court documents.

In their complaint, the nurses contended the state law unconstitutionally criminalizes the use of “Dr” and that the measure does not serve a compelling state interest. They argued their use of “Dr” is not misleading and that the state law “regulates more extensively than necessary.”

Attorneys for the state asked the court to throw out the suit, arguing the law is a legitimate regulation of commercial speech because the plaintiffs' use of “Dr” is “inherently misleading” and that the law advances a substantial governmental interest.

In his ruling, Bernal wrote the harms cited by the state over DNPs calling themselves doctors are “real” and that evidence shows such titles by DNPs can confuse patients. Bernal cited an AMA survey that found 39% of patients believe a DNP is a physician.

“The Court finds that it is reasonable to infer that some consumers will assume that plaintiffs are licensed physicians or surgeons if they use ‘Dr' or ‘doctor' in healthcare settings and in advertising materials promoting medical services, even if plaintiffs also identify themselves as DNPs,” Bernal wrote.

Bernal noted that while the use of “Dr” in the healthcare setting is not a traditional form of advertising, the “specific product” plaintiffs seek to advertise is the expertise, knowledge, and quality of services such professional titles convey to patients and colleagues. The nurses have an economic motive for engaging in this kind of speech, which is “to solicit and retain a patient base and improve their professional brand,” Bernal said.

The California Nurses Association declined to comment on the ruling. The American Nurses Association did not return messages seeking comment.

Lorie A. Brown, RN, JD, Indianapolis-based attorney who represents nurses and health providers, said she was surprised by the ruling. If a nurse obtains a DNP, it's reasonable that they should be able to refer to themselves as “Dr,” she said, adding that other professionals with doctorates do not face the same scrutiny.

“The person that gets the doctorate, the DNP or the EdD or the PhD, it's the degree,” she said. “So, I guess Dr Jill Biden can still use her [EdD] title, but yet nurses who have the same level of degree can't use the title, I think that's unfair. All of your hard work and education, you can't even use the title that you earn, at least in California.”Brown said the ruling could have broader implications outside of California, including other courts citing the ruling when title disagreements arise among nurses and physicians. The ruling could also lead to other states enacting similar statutes, she said, adding that California is often seen as a leader in legislation.

More than 90% of patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) reported being misdiagnosed with psychiatric illnesses by nonpsychiatrist physicians, with a vast majority being told they were fabricating symptoms.

“The accurate diagnosis of chronic pain disorders benefits from a multidisciplinary approach, involving pain specialists, rheumatologists, neurologists, and qualified mental health professionals,” the authors of the study wrote.

“Addressing underlying causes and improving strategies to recognize EDS more accurately can substantially improve outcomes for patients who are affected by these complex disorders,” they added.

This study was led by Chanbin Lee, Brown University in Providence, and Pradeep Chopra, MD, Center for Complex Conditions in Pawtucket, both in Rhode Island. It was published online on May 29, 2025, in Children.

Patients may not have accurately recalled earlier misdiagnoses as hypermobile EDS because they are often diagnosed years after the onset of symptoms. Researchers did not have information on prior psychiatric evaluations of the patients. All patients were recruited from only one specialty center that typically drew complex cases.

This study did not receive any external funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A prospective cohort study found that a high intake of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) was associated with an increased risk for overall colorectal cancer (CRC) and right-sided colon cancer.

""In summary, the evidence presented in this study does show a significant association between high UPF intake and increased risk of CRC among women in the NOWAC study,"" the authors wrote, adding that ""the results suggest a statistically significant association between high UPF intake and increased risk of cancer in the right side of the colon."" They further suggested, ""longitudinal studies investigating the relationship between a high UPF intake, UPF subgroups, and CRC risk are needed to determine causality.""

This study was led by Rie Mols, Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway. It was published online on September 16, 2025, in the British Journal of Nutrition.

Self-reported food frequency questionnaires provided less detailed information than 24-hour recalls or food diaries. Social desirability bias could have influenced the questionnaire data. The NOVA classification system used in the study was heterogeneous and imprecise. Only baseline dietary data were used, not accounting for potential dietary changes over time. The study's findings may have limited generalisability as it included only women and used nutritional data from a single country.

This study did not receive any specific grant funding from any funding agency, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

One third of pharmacies in the UK have reported patient concerns about vaccines, while one quarter said patients have raised concerns about paracetamol. 

The findings come from a snap survey by the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), carried out the day after US President Donald Trump made unsubstantiated claims linking childhood vaccines and paracetamol use in pregnancy to autism.

“President Trump's comments break longstanding international consensus around treatments which strong medical evidence suggests are very safe, highly effective and used by millions of people over many years,” said Olivier Picard, chair of the NPA, in a press release. 

“People have every right to question medicines but it is vitally important that patients get their medical advice from trusted and well-evidenced sources, such as pharmacists and doctors who have seen the clinical research underpinning treatments,” he added. 

The survey covered 500 pharmacies serving around 2.5 million patients.

It found that 32% of pharmacies reported patients were less likely to get themselves or their children vaccinated following Trump's comments. Meanwhile, 24% said patients questioned the safety of paracetamol.

Three in five pharmacies expressed concern that the US debate could put patient safety in the UK at risk.

The NHS said there is no credible evidence to support Trump's claims about paracetamol and autism. It also repeated that vaccines do not cause autism. 

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed that paracetamol remained “the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed.”

“Autism charities, including Autistica and the National Autistic Society, have jointly stated that studies suggesting a link are weak, poorly designed, and do not provide reliable evidence. High-quality, well-controlled studies indicate there is no link between paracetamol in pregnancy and autism,” said Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, in a statement. 

Pharmacies are advising pregnant women to continue using paracetamol for pain relief or fever, and urging parents to vaccinate their children to prevent serious illness.

In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of updating labels for acetaminophen (paracetamol) following President Trump's remarks.

In a press statement, the agency cited two large cohort studies — the Nurses' Health Study II and the Boston Birth Cohort — which found associations between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and autism. However, the FDA stressed that these studies do not prove causation and that contrary evidence also exists.

The agency emphasised that acetaminophen remains the only over-the-counter drug approved for reducing fever during pregnancy. It warned that untreated high fever in pregnancy can itself pose risks to foetal development.

“Even with this body of evidence, the choice still belongs with parents. The precautionary principle may lead many to avoid using acetaminophen during pregnancy, especially since most low-grade fevers don't require treatment. It remains reasonable, however, for pregnant women to use acetaminophen in certain scenarios,” said FDA commissioner Marty Makary, MD.

Trump's comments have drawn widespread criticism from health agencies and medical groups.

On 24 September, the World Health Organization released a statement refuting his claims. The UK's National Autistic Society also launched a campaign, Truth. It Matters, which gathered 10,000 signatures in its first 24 hours online.

A 55-year-old married Arab woman presented with a rapidly enlarging, painful mass in her right breast and had previously noted a small, stable mass in the same breast for 10 years. Examination revealed a firm, tender 5-cm mass in the lower lateral quadrant of the right breast, with dimpling of the overlying skin and nipple retraction, raising concern for malignancy.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was initiated but discontinued early after severe liver inflammation (transaminitis), and a sharp rise in hepatitis B virus levels confirmed reactivation of chronic hepatitis B virus infection.

Antiviral therapy with entecavir was initiated, after which the patient developed rectal bleeding, leading to a diagnosis of mid-rectal invasive adenocarcinoma.

The case report by Ahmad Al‑Bitar, MD, Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic, and colleagues highlighted how coexisting conditions can complicate both diagnosis and therapy.

The patient presented with a 10-year history of a right breast mass that had recently enlarged and become painful. Apart from poorly controlled hypertension, no other medical condition was reported.

Medication, family, social, drug, allergy, and travel histories were unremarkable.

On admission, vital signs were within the normal limits. Physical examination identified a 5-cm firm, tender lesion in the lower lateral quadrant of the right breast with overlying skin dimpling and nipple retraction, features suggestive of malignancy. Routine laboratory test results were unremarkable at baseline.

Diagnostic mammography demonstrated a lobulated mass with ill-defined contours and spiculated edges, and a subsequent full-body CT scan described a heterogeneous solid-cystic mass measuring 5 cm × 4 cm behind the nipple with associated skin thickening. Several axillary nodules were present, the largest measuring 11 mm on the right side, and no distant metastases were detected at that time.

Core biopsy confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma that was triple-negative: oestrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and HER2-negative. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation.

A planned six-cycle neoadjuvant regimen was initiated with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin plus pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and early cycles were well tolerated, apart from mild fatigue and nausea.

The neoadjuvant course was halted after the fourth cycle because of a severe adverse event, with routine monitoring before the fifth cycle showing alanine aminotransferase of 236 U/L (reference, 0-45 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase of 210 U/L (reference, 0-37 U/L).

Concurrently, the hepatitis B virus DNA level rose to 5 × 107 copies per mL, and the patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, confirming reactivation. Chemotherapy was stopped immediately, and entecavir was commenced without delay.

Entecavir 0.5 mg once daily normalised alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase within 4 weeks, and hepatitis B virus DNA became undetectable; antiviral therapy was continued long term. A liver biopsy performed during this period showed portal inflammation and septal fibrosis without evidence of metastatic disease.

After chemotherapy cessation, the patient developed abdominal pain and haematochezia, prompting urgent colonoscopy, which identified a large circumferential mass in the mid-rectum, 12 cm from the anal verge, impeding further scope advancement. Biopsy confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma, and staging CT described an 8-cm lesion without distant metastases.

Given the two distinct primary cancers, a multidisciplinary team pursued dual resection: a right modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and concurrent resection of the rectal mass with a protective colostomy. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and no surgical complications were reported.

“While the rarity of synchronous primary malignancies and hepatitis B virus reactivation in cancer is recognised, this case presents several unique aspects; to our knowledge, it is among the few, if not the first, documented cases of synchronous triple-negative breast cancer and rectal adenocarcinoma in a patient with a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation who subsequently experienced severe chemotherapy-induced hepatitis B virus reactivation specifically in the context of pembrolizumab as part of neoadjuvant therapy; the successful multidisciplinary management — particularly prompt recognition and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation — highlights a key clinical lesson for the evolving landscape of precision oncology,” the authors wrote.

Antiviral treatment with remdesivir and/or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within 3 days of hospital admission was associated with a significant reduction in mortality among patients hospitalised with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron era, with the greatest benefit seen among unvaccinated patients without prior infection.

""The effect of treatment was greater in those without previous immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting this group should be prioritized for treatment,"" the investigators reported.

This study was led by John Karlsson Valik, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on September 21, 2025, in Clinical Microbiology and Infection.

Baseline differences were observed between treated and untreated patients in the unweighted sample, which might have biased the results towards the null. Unmeasured indication bias could not be excluded. Pooling both drugs in the primary analysis may have concealed drug-specific effects, and this study was underpowered to evaluate nirmatrelvir/ritonavir alone or to directly compare the two agents.

This study received support from the Swedish Research Council and the EuCare Project funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme. One author reported receiving a CIMED project grant 2024-2026 from Region Stockholm and participating in Midsize Market EACS Ad Board, Warzaw 2023.

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a biomarker released in response to tubular injury, may serve as a noninvasive tool for measuring kidney injury.

A new systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that urinary NGAL is significantly elevated in patients with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) compared with healthy control individuals, and that NGAL levels are higher in SRNS than in SSNS. If validated, urinary NGAL could help identify steroid resistance early and guide management in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.

“This may help personalize therapy and help monitor cyclosporine toxicity,” said corresponding author Sagad O.O. Mohamed, MBBS, Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan.

Investigators screened 155 studies (2010-2023) using PRISMA guidelines and a comprehensive, multi-database search. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria; all evaluated pediatric patients from seven countries, and several included healthy control individuals. Patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome were classified as SSNS and SRNS.

Using a random effects model, the authors estimated a standardized mean difference (SMD). SRNS showed markedly higher urinary NGAL levels than SSNS (SMD = 1.889; 95% CI, 0.819-2.959; P < .001). Several studies used reported receiver operating characteristic performance, with area under the curve values generally indicating moderate-to-strong discrimination for distinguishing SRNS from SSNS using urinary NGAL or NGAL/creatine ratios.

The findings support urinary NGAL's diagnostic accuracy, biological plausibility, and cross-population relevance, strengthening the case for its inclusion in clinical assessment protocols. It is theorized that NGAL could enable more personalized treatment strategies, minimize unnecessary steroid exposure, and improve outcomes in pediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome.

Early differentiation between SSNS and SRNS is crucial because SRNS is associated with poorer long-term outcomes.

Mohamed noted that all included patients were aged 1-18 years, and therefore the findings may not be applicable to adults. Even so, the robust results indicate that high urinary NGAL could flag SRNS, prompting biopsy or earlier use of immunosuppressants and thereby avoiding steroid toxicity. NGAL may also help monitor tubular injury and be combined with estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine to fine-tune treatment in SSNS and SRNS.

“It's a step toward precision medicine. NGAL's ability to predict steroid resistance enables tailored therapy,” Mohamed told Medscape Medical News.

Trends were consistent across diverse pediatric cohorts drawn from studies conducted in India, Egypt, Europe, and North America. However, the authors stressed that future studies need to establish standardized cutoff thresholds for urinary NGAL and to assess its performance across diverse clinical settings. There is a possibility that sampling during various disease phases or in patients receiving concurrent therapies may confound biomarker interpretation.

They added that future work should investigate NGAL alongside other emerging biomarkers (eg, kidney injury molecule-1) to build diagnostic panels that improve specificity and better capture disease heterogeneity. Longitudinal studies are warranted to define NGAL's utility for predicting relapse, remission, and treatment response, including kinetics during immunosuppressive therapy and its relationship with histopathologic progression. Urinary NGAL may also help predict nephrotoxicity and resistance profiles in vulnerable pediatric populations where therapeutic precision is critical.

Commenting on the review, Gebhard Wagener, MD, professor of anesthesiology, College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University in New York City, said he was not surprised by the finding, as elevated urinary NGAL is consistent with tubular injury that portends a poorer prognosis.

“Urinary NGAL is an excellent marker of renal injury and is highly sensitive and specific. Serum creatinine — the current standard to define acute kidney injury — is a marker of function, not injury, and usually rises slowly, often when it is too late to intervene,” said Wagener, who was not involved in the study. “Serum creatinine will increase in many conditions that are not necessarily associated with injury, and using serum creatinine as a marker to define acute kidney injury has hindered progress in treating it. This study exemplifies how better a marker for renal injury can advance treatment and allow early and targeted intervention.”

The study was published online in BMC Nephrology.

Mohamed and Wagener reported having no relevant financial disclosures.

A deep learning algorithm that only uses data from mammogram images along with age may predict major cardiac events as accurately as traditional cardiovascular risk calculators, new data suggest. 

The findings were published online in Heart.

The algorithm was developed by researchers at The George Institute for Global Health in collaboration with the University of New South Wales and University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia.

Lead author Jennifer Barraclough, PhD, a research fellow at The George Institute, said using information from a screening process already widely used by women means this model could help predict cardiovascular risk for women in diverse communities globally. 

“We hope this technology will one day provide greater and more equitable access to screening in rural areas,” she said in a press release.

Barraclough and colleagues designed and validated the model, called DeepSurv, using routine mammograms from 49,196 women in metropolitan and rural areas of Victoria, Australia, linked to individual hospital and death records. Median follow-up was 8.8 years. They then compared the model to traditional models that rely on multiple data points based on known cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

The new model had a concordance index of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.71-0.73), with similar performance to current models, including the New Zealand PREDICT tool and the American Heart Association PREVENT equations that incorporate age and clinical variables.

To date, researchers have developed algorithms based on breast arterial calcification from mammographic data, but they have limitations, particularly in predicting cardiovascular risk in older women, according to the paper. 

“This is the first deep learning model incorporating all breast characteristics/architecture from routine screening mammograms, as opposed to breast arterial calcification alone,” the authors wrote.

For their model, Barraclough and colleagues used the first available set of right and left breast digital mammographic images and, whenever possible, used image data for mammograms performed on two different occasions. In 9% of cases, only one set of mammographic images was available before the first cardiovascular event and was therefore used in isolation. They then used an image encoder to extract features from the mammogram data, which were combined in a neural-network-based model to predict risk for major adverse cardiac events over 10 years.

“Being able to use multiple features of a mammogram with just age and not knowing anything else about the patient to be able to predict risk is definitely innovative,” Rupa Sanghani, MD, director of the Rush Heart Center for Women at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, told Medscape Medical News.

Sanghani noted additional cardiovascular risk models are much needed for women. 

“We know that heart disease is underestimated in women. And we know that women don't come in as much as they should to be seen,” she said, though the rates of mammogram screening are relatively high.

“Your chances of dying from breast cancer are about 1 in 8 whereas your chances of dying from heart disease are 1 in 3,” Sanghani added.

The model has potential for use in the US, Sanghani said, but she noted it's still in the early stages and the paper doesn't list all the components on the mammogram used in the model.

“Mammography is increasingly being looked at as a tool to predict heart disease risk in women, which may allow for earlier detection of heart disease. I think this is a great example of how artificial intelligence could be used in healthcare, but we still need research on cost, implementation, outcomes, and whether it truly changes their care,” Sanghani said.

In an accompanying editorial, Gemma A. Figtree, MBBS, an interventional cardiologist with the Kolling Institute of Medical Research, and Stuart M Grieve, MBBS, a radiologist with the Charles Perkins Centre, both at the University of Sydney, wrote that using mammography data “represents little direct cost and perhaps avoids the risk of ‘losing the moment' of a woman's interaction with the health system at breast screening.”

They highlight substantial “underappreciation of heart disease as a threat to women by both women and the health system” as well as frustration of the “suboptimal performance of traditional risk factor algorithms.”

They noted that more than 67% of women in the US and the UK get screened for breast cancer.

“Mammography may therefore represent a ‘touch point' for raising awareness about cardiovascular risk and disease in women,” Figtree and Grieve wrote.

Barraclough and Sanghani reported no relevant conflicts of interest. Figtree reported receiving grants from National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) and multiple pharmaceutical companies and holding several patents related to cardiovascular disease. Grieve reported serving as company lead and founder of iCoreLabs.

Serine serves as a metabolic nexus in tumors, coordinating one-carbon metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, and redox regulation. In recent years, targeting the serine metabolic pathway, particularly the rate-limiting enzyme PHGDH, has attracted considerable attention as a promising anticancer strategy. Nevertheless, tumor cells preserve serine homeostasis through the coordinated regulation of endogenous synthesis and exogenous uptake, which often limits the efficacy of single-enzyme inhibition approaches. Notably, the function of serine transporters (SerTs) is intimately linked to their nanoscale spatial organization on the plasma membrane. However, owing to the lack of highly specific probes and ultra-resolution imaging techniques, the mechanisms underlying their assembly and functional relevance remain largely unexplored.Researchers from Wuhan University of Science and Technology and the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences have jointly published a paper in Research entitled ""Mechanistic Insight into Serine Flux Regulation through Nanoscale Organization of Glucose and Serine Transporters by Substrate Probe-based dSTORM Imaging."" The study developed a small-molecule substrate-based fluorescent probe (Ser-probe) derived from the structure of serine. This chemical probe not only exhibits high binding specificity and a one-to-one binding ratio with serine transporters (SerTs), but also possesses an extremely small molecular size. Compared with traditional biological probes such as antibodies, it offers significant advantages in terms of compactness, enabling highly efficient labeling of densely distributed target proteins on the cell surface. Leveraging the superior labeling performance of this probe combined with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), the researchers achieved super-resolution imaging and quantitative analysis of multiple serine transporters (SerTs). The work systematically revealed the nanoscale clustering behavior and regulatory mechanisms of SerTs in breast cancer cells.

Through precise chemical modification of the serine molecule, the research team preserved its transporter-binding moiety and conjugated it with a fluorophore, thereby successfully synthesizing Ser-probe. This probe exhibits high affinity and specificity. Competitive experiment demonstrated that its binding can be completely inhibited by free serine, which confirms its ability to specifically label SerTs under physiological conditions. The development of this probe provides a novel tool for super-resolution imaging of membrane transporters.Using dSTORM imaging, it was observed that from normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) to low-malignant MCF7 cells and highly malignant MDA-MB-231 cells, the point density on the cell membrane, average cluster area, and cluster coverage of SerTs all increased significantly. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the average cluster area of SerTs reached twice that of MCF10A cells, and the cluster coverage increased by 4.6-fold. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that cells with stronger SerT clustering exhibited higher uptake capacity of fluorescently labeled serine, indicating a positive correlation between the clustering tendency of these transporters and their transport function.

By employing dual-color dSTORM imaging, the study revealed significant colocalization of SerTs with glucose transporters (GluTs) on the plasma membrane, which was particularly pronounced in MCF7 cells with high PHGDH expression. The colocalization coverage reached 4.23%, markedly higher than the 1.41% observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings suggest that cells with strong endogenous serine synthesis capacity are more prefer to forming SerT/GluT functional microdomains, thereby coordinately regulating glucose uptake and serine metabolism.Cholesterol depletion (MβCD treatment) or glycosidase digestion (PNGase F treatment) significantly disrupted the clustered assembly and colocalization of SerTs and GluTs, indicating that lipid raft microdomains and glycoprotein cross-linking networks constitute the physical basis for maintaining the stability of these transporter nanoclusters. This finding provides potential targets for the intervention of membrane protein assembly.Glucose deprivation markedly weakened the clustering capacity of GluTs, reducing the SerT/GluT colocalization coverage from 4.23% to 0.71%. The PHGDH inhibitor CBR-5884 induced enhanced clustering at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations its cytotoxic effects led to cluster disassembly. Combined interventions (inhibitor in combination with low glucose or free sialic acid) synergistically disrupted the protein cluster structures and significantly enhanced the anticancer effect. Cell viability decreased from 92.55% under single-drug treatment to 87.71% with inhibitor in combination with low glucose, or 78.84% with inhibitor in combination with free sialic acid.

This study is the first to reveal a direct connection between the spatial organization of SerTs and their function at the nanoscale. It breaks the conventional paradigm of metabolic research, which has been largely limited to enzyme activity and expression levels of key proteins, and offers a new perspective for investigating the role of nutrient transporters in the regulation of tumor metabolism.Developed the substrate probe applicable to super-resolution imaging of SerTs;Revealed the regulatory axis of ""transporter nanocluster distribution-metabolic function-drug response"";Established a model of the synergistic role of lipid raft and glycosylation in membrane protein assembly.The clustering pattern of SerTs may serve as a biomarker of tumor metabolic state;Combined targeting of metabolic enzymes and transporter assembly (e.g., PHGDH inhibitors with sialic acid) can enhance therapeutic efficacy;Provides a new strategy for developing therapies aimed at regulating the spatial organization of membrane proteins.

The first detailed analysis of unplanned births that occurred outside the hospital setting in Austria has shown that, although such deliveries are rare, they pose challenges for emergency teams that attend, especially if babies are born prematurely.

In a study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress today (Monday), the researchers found that between 2017 and 2024 there were 173 unplanned, out-of-hospital births in the Styria region of Austria, of which 16 (9%) were premature (less than 37 weeks' gestation). The most premature was born at 26 weeks' gestation, weighing 845g, and four babies (25%) died around the time of birth.

Now, the team plan to identify regional differences in the rest of Austria, evaluating the preparedness of emergency teams, and assessing outcomes for both mothers and newborns.

Ms Helena Leonhartsberger, a medical student and research team member in the neonatology department at the Medical University of Graz, Austria, who also volunteers as a paramedic with the Austrian Red Cross, told the congress: ""Our study is the first to document the frequency of out-of-hospital, unplanned, premature deliveries and the associated complications. We concluded that standardised emergency protocols and early involvement of specialised neonatal transport teams are crucial for improving outcomes.

Most emergency physicians are not specialised in paediatrics or, more specifically, in neonatology. Although these scenarios are rare, emergency teams must be adequately trained and prepared to handle them. Furthermore, appropriate equipment for treating newborns, particularly premature or critically ill neonates, should be available on all emergency vehicles.""

Ms. Helena Leonhartsberger, Medical University of Graz

""We also plan to use these findings to improve training for emergency personnel and to recommend what neonatal emergency equipment should be made available and standardised on all Austrian emergency vehicles, ensuring consistent care nationwide.""

Ms Leonhartsberger decided to research this topic after she attended an out-of-hospital birth as a paramedic during her first year of training.

""I was unprepared for the situation, but fortunately, everything went well,"" she said. ""This led me to study pre-hospital deliveries of premature infants, aiming to explore how emergency teams can be better prepared for such high-risk situations and improve outcomes for these vulnerable patients.""

The study, which was led by Professor Bernhard Schwaberger, deputy head of the clinical department of neonatology at the Medical University of Graz, found that the median age of babies born prematurely out of hospital was 35 weeks' gestation, with a median birth weight of 2390g.

Among the four babies that died, no resuscitation was attempted in two. One premature baby underwent successful pre-hospital resuscitation and intubation. Of the 12 surviving preterm infants, one required initial bag-mask ventilation and subsequent nasotracheal intubation by a neonatal intensive care team, and another received oxygen via face mask. Ten babies were able to breathe spontaneously.

The researchers found that the temperatures of the babies were recorded in only six of the 13 babies that were admitted to hospital, and the median temperature was 34.8°C; the lowest recorded temperature was 31.5°C.

Ms Leonhartsberger said: ""Admission temperature is a key prognostic factor, yet this was not documented for all the babies, and when it was, the babies were often found to be hypothermic.

""Our findings underscore the need for national preparedness, not only through standardised protocols but also through ongoing training and appropriate equipment on all emergency vehicles. They also highlight the importance of public awareness, reinforcing that, while planned home births may be safe under ideal conditions, complications can arise quickly and unpredictably. The research supports the broader goal of improving maternal and neonatal outcomes by ensuring that every birth, regardless of location, receives the highest standard of emergency care.""

A strength of the study is the detailed analysis of premature births outside of hospitals. The main limitation is the small number of cases and the fact that it focuses on one region of Austria so the finding may not reflect the situation in other areas. This is why the researchers now plan to analyse data in other regions.

Dr Felix Lorang is a member of the EUSEM abstract selection committee. He is head of the emergency department at SRH Zentralklinikum Suhl, Thuringia, Germany, and was not involved with the research. He said: ""Premature deliveries always require careful medical supervision in hospital and will be performed by a highly trained and diverse team of experienced professionals to reduce any serious risk to both mother and baby. When these premature births take place out of the hospital setting in the unprepared environment of a household or an ambulance with a smaller team they present an even more significant challenge. Even though they are rare, they require preparation and the training that is part of the so-called HALO procedures: High-Acuity Low Occurrence.

""Helena Leonhartsberger's study shows, for the first time, the incidence of such births in one region in Austria, and how there were variations in how these births were managed. For instance, temperature management is a very important factor for the efficacy of further treatments. In this highly stressful setting, unfortunately only six out of the 13 babies admitted to hospital had their temperatures recorded, despite the importance of this intervention. It is crucial to identify the incidence and management of premature, unplanned, out-of-hospital deliveries, not just in other areas of Austria but also in other countries. This will enable planning to ensure that all emergency medical services adhere to agreed protocols, and that they have swift access to specialist neonatal equipment for treating and transporting premature babies to hospital.""

The review demonstrates that vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are both safe and effective in protecting groups who are most at risk for serious illness, including older adults and infants. 

RSV is a common virus that causes coughs and colds but can also lead to life-threatening lung infections like pneumonia. Children under the age of two months are at the highest risk of severe RSV infection and death, with older adults also vulnerable to severe disease. 

An international group of researchers analysed 14 clinical trials with over 100 000 participants, including older adults, pregnant people , women of childbearing age, and children. Trials were conducted across a wide range of countries, spanning all continents. 

Results showed strong evidence that the RSV prefusion vaccines in older adults reduce RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease such as pneumonia and bronchitis by 77% and RSV-associated acute respiratory disease (e.g. a cold) by 67%.

Vaccination of pregnant people with an RSV F protein-based vaccine reduced the risk of their children needing medical care for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease by 54%, reduced the babies' chance of severe RSV-related disease by 74%, and lowered the risk of hospitalisation by 54%.

""From our review of clinical trials, we found high-certainty evidence that RSV vaccines protect older adults and strong evidence they benefit infants when mothers are vaccinated during pregnancy,"" said Dr. KM Saif-Ur-Rahman, lead author and Senior Research Methodologist at Evidence Synthesis Ireland and Cochrane Ireland, University of Galway, Ireland.

That is encouraging news for two of the groups most at risk.""

Dr. KM Saif-Ur-Rahman, University of Galway

The review found little to no difference in serious side effects across all age groups between groups who are vaccinated and groups who are not vaccinated. 

The findings of this review are based on clinical trial data, as real-world evidence on effectiveness and safety was not yet available at the time of publication. 

""It's important to be clear that our review is based on evidence from randomised trials, the strongest evidence available,"" said Kate Olsson, author and ECDC vaccine expert. ""Post authorisation, real-world studies are ongoing and data from those studies will continue to add to what we know about the safety and effectiveness of these RSV vaccines."" 

The systematic review is planned to be complemented by two additional analyses on the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of different RSV vaccines following search updates. ECDC plans to publish the first update with new data in the coming weeks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Fathers who smoked as teens may accelerate their children's biological aging","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250929/Fathers-who-smoked-as-teens-may-accelerate-their-childrens-biological-aging.aspx","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:10:00 GMT","

People whose fathers smoked during puberty seem to age faster than expected, according to research presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The researchers found signs of faster biological aging, compared to chronological age, in people whose fathers began smoking at age 15 or younger. They say smoking during puberty may create damage in boys' developing sperm cells that can be passed on to their children.

The researchers call for stronger efforts to prevent tobacco use in teenagers, not only to benefit the current generation but also future generations.

The study was presented by Dr Juan Pablo López-Cervantes from the University of Bergen, Norway. He said: ""Our research group has previously shown that smoking during puberty may harm not only the person who smokes, but also their future children. In this new study, we wanted to explore whether parental smoking in puberty may also influence the biological ageing of their future children.""

The researchers did this using a well-established measure of biological aging known as epigenetic clocks. As we age, extra molecules accumulate on the DNA in our cells. This does not alter the DNA code, but it does influence how our genes behave. These so-called epigenetic changes are not only a sign of ageing, they are also linked to diseases of older age such as cancer and dementia.

The research included a group of 892 people, ranging in chronological age from 7 to 50 years and with an average age of 28, who were taking part in the RHINESSA study and provided blood samples for testing. Their blood samples were analysed for epigenetic changes, then researchers applied three different scores of biological aging. They were also asked a series of questions, including whether they or their parents had ever smoked and at what age.

The researchers found that people whose fathers began smoking during puberty were around nine months to a year older than their chronological age on average. When researchers took into account whether the people themselves had ever smoked, this gap between biological and chronological age was greater (14 to 15 months).

In people whose fathers began smoking later in life, researchers found only a small increase in biological age. They found no clear pattern in biological ageing in people whose mothers smoked before pregnancy.

This accelerated biological ageing is important as it has been linked to a higher risk of diseases such as cancer, arthritis and dementia in previous research. Our results suggest that boys who smoke during puberty may be unknowingly creating harm for the children they go on to have.""

Dr. Juan Pablo López-Cervantes, University of Bergen

""This research does not fully explain why smoking in puberty is linked to faster aging, but we think that when fathers start smoking during puberty, it may alter the epigenetic material of their sperm cells, and that these changes may be passed on to the next generation.

""Although this research is still in its early days, we believe our findings are important for young boys who smoke or consume other types of nicotine products. Stronger efforts to prevent tobacco use in adolescence should be a priority for policy makers. Such efforts could benefit not only the current generations but also those in the future.""

Dr Stamatoula Tsikrika is Chair of the European Respiratory Society's expert group on tobacco, smoking control and health education, based at Sotiria Hospital in Athens, Greece, and was not involved in the research. She said: ""We all know that smoking causes diseases such as asthma, COPD and cancer. What we're starting to learn is that the damage caused by smoking can persist across generations. This study suggests that boys who start smoking at 15 or younger can pass the damage on to any children they have many years later.

""Although rates of smoking in teenagers seem to be declining, rates of vaping are generally increasing, and we don't yet know the long-term impact of vaping on children and teenagers. This research is another reminder that we need to protect children and teenagers from nicotine addiction, smoking and vaping.""

New research reveals just how much greener plant-based kibble is compared to meat-based dog food, from saving football fields of farmland to the carbon cost of long-haul flights.

Study: Environmental impact of feeding plant-based vs. meat-based dry dog foods in the United Kingdom. Image credit: Nina Buday/Shutterstock.com 

Dry dog foods in the United Kingdom may be classified as plant-based or animal-based. Each has a different environmental impact. A recent paper in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems breaks down, for the first time, the environmental costs of each type of dog food.

Plant-based foods have multiple health and environmental benefits when used as a main or sole part of the diet. Compared with animal-based foods, they generate far fewer greenhouse gases, cause less deforestation, and put less strain on soil fertility and biodiversity. They also reduce pressure on freshwater supplies and contribute less to soil and air pollution.

In 2018, the global dog population was about 471 million. While dogs are natural omnivores, meat-heavy diets drive significant greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, making up an estimated 2.5% to 8% of China's total emissions. In Brazil, dog food was estimated to produce 3% to 25% of the country's carbon dioxide emissions. Commercial dog food production produces threefold higher emissions than feeding dogs on human leftover food.

Prior research suggests that pet food production uses up 41 to 58 million hectares of farmland, or twice as much land as the entire area of the UK. Most of this comes from animal-based pet food manufacturing. According to human food supply chain statistics, plant protein production requires much less resource than animal meat production, but direct comparisons for pet food in the UK are lacking.

In the current study, the researchers looked specifically at 31 complete dry dog foods for adult dogs. They focused on the following parameters:

In each case, lifecycle assessments were carried out, which are systematic assessments of the impact of each stage of the manufactured product's life on the environment, from raw material extraction through processing, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste disposal. 

Plant- and animal-based pet foods had similar proportions of protein, fat, and fiber, except for veterinary food, which had less protein but more fat, by design, as these were all renal diets. The top ingredients included grains like corn and white rice, poultry fat, sunflower oil, and wheat gluten. Other grains, raw chicken meat, meat and bone meal, pea, potato, and textured vegetable protein were relatively common.

Plant-based diets were the most environmentally friendly for all types of dog food. Poultry-based and veterinary diets ranked next in sustainability, while red meat, unsurprisingly, placed the heaviest burden on the environment.

For plant-based diets, land use was below 3 square meters per 1,000 kcal, similar to poultry. Veterinary diets were a little higher at ~13 square meters. In contrast, lamb- and beef-based dog food used over 100 square meters of land per 1,000 kcal.

Lamb meals required ~93 square meters per 1,000 kcal, meat and bone meal was 47 square meters, and beef liver approximately half of that. Plant-based foods included mainly soy, at 1.7-1.8 square meters per 1,000 kcal, depending on the formulation.

Similar trends were seen with greenhouse gas production, where plant-based, poultry-based, and veterinary foods had comparably low emissions. Lamb produced ~4.6 times and beef ~11 times higher emissions than plant-based foods at ~13 and 32 kg CO2eq, respectively, vs ~2.8 kg CO2eq for plant-based foods. Meat and bone meal and raw beef liver had the highest emissions.

The same picture was obtained with acidifying and eutrophying emissions. Beef-based foods produced up to ~14 times, and lamb-based foods ~3-5 times higher emissions than plant-based foods. Lamb-based dog food used the most freshwater (irrigation, livestock production, industrial use) at ~684 L/1,000 kcal, while beef used ~575 L/1,000 kcal. Conversely, plant-based food used ~250 L/1,000 kcal. Poultry (~383 L) and veterinary diets (~501 L) were intermediate but still considerably higher than plant-based.

Overall, a Labrador retriever, eating about 280g of food a day, would use up approximately 350,000 square meters of land (about 52-57 football fields) if fed on lamb- or beef-based food for the nine years of its adult life, vs 1.4 and 2.7 football fields with plant-based or veterinary foods, respectively.  The greenhouse gas emissions would correspond to those of a Boeing 747 passenger taking 2.8 round-trips between New York and London, for a plant-based diet. With a veterinary or poultry-based diet, it would be nearer about five round-trips, soaring to 31 with lamb-based foods.

For multiple reasons, feeding dogs on animal byproducts did not make animal-based pet foods more sustainable.

The environmental cost of plant-based dog food is only a fraction of that of animal-based pet food. “Higher inclusion of plant-based ingredients in pet feed provides a major opportunity for pet food companies to mitigate the environmental footprint of companion animal food.”

However, the study assessed only environmental metrics; the authors note that nutritional bioavailability was outside its scope. They also highlight that while poultry and veterinary foods had a lower impact than beef or lamb, in some measures, their impacts overlapped with plant-based diets, meaning they were not always significantly different. Nonetheless, they remain substantially less sustainable than plant-based alternatives.

Using animal by-products does not close the sustainability gap, and circular food system approaches may be needed to reduce the sector's overall impact.

Real-world data confirm that nirsevimab provides powerful protection for infants, reducing RSV hospital stays and easing the strain on families and healthcare systems.



Research letter: Nirsevimab Administration and RSV Hospitalization in the 2024-2025 Season. Image Credit: Bonn_A  / Shutterstock

In a recent Research Letter published in the JAMA Network Open, a group of researchers estimated whether nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, lowers respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated hospitalization among United States (US) infants during the 2024-2025 season using an extensive electronic health record (EHR) cohort.

One virus fills winter pediatric wards: RSV is among the leading reasons infants land in the hospital, especially those born prematurely, with complex conditions, or from communities facing socioeconomic disadvantage. Public health agencies in the US recommend passive immunization of most infants with nirsevimab, but families still ask: does it truly translate to fewer hospital stays where we live? Real-world data matter because drug supply, maternal vaccination, and clinic access vary by place and season. Clinicians need precise numbers to guide counseling, and parents need confidence when choosing prevention before the first cough. Further research is required in order to examine outcomes across diverse health systems and subgroups.

The investigators performed a retrospective cohort analysis using the Epic Systems Cosmos dataset, an EHR aggregation platform that spans more than 300 million patients across over 1,700 hospitals and 40,000 clinics in all 50 states, as well as in Canada, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. The study included babies born between February 1, 2024, and January 31, 2025, ensuring at least two months of exposure to the 2024-2025 RSV season, which typically occurs from October 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. Infants aged 8 to 19 months were excluded due to data granularity issues. The exposure was receipt of nirsevimab, the primary outcome was RSV-associated hospitalization, identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) algorithms.

The analysis excluded infants with missing maternal linkage, maternal RSV vaccination 14-280 days pre-delivery, with this exclusion consistent with CDC recommendations, prior nirsevimab before April 1, 2024, RSV hospitalization before April 1, 2024, death without hospitalization, or no well-child visits after September 30, 2025, to limit loss to follow-up. Group comparisons used two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables and Pearson χ² tests for categorical variables. Daily hospitalization rates were modeled with generalized additive models (GAMs). Time-to-event analyses employed multistate Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) models to transition infants from untreated to treated on the nirsevimab date, with adjustments for chronologic age, gestational age, Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and complex chronic conditions (CCC: cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic). Analyses were performed in R (R Project for Statistical Computing) version 4.5.0.

Among 798,470 eligible births, 409,723 infants met inclusion criteria after exclusions for missing maternal information (n=256,494), maternal RSV vaccination (n=75,107), death (n=472), prior nirsevimab (n=11,946), prior RSV hospitalization (n=73), and lack of well-child follow-up after September 30, 2025 (n=44,655). The median (interquartile range) age at analysis was 8 (5-10) months, and 51.1% of the participants were male. Overall, 194,422 infants (47.5%) received nirsevimab, while 215,301 did not. Baseline table comparisons revealed small but statistically significant differences in several characteristics, including a slightly younger age among treated infants and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular and neurologic complex chronic conditions in the treated group. The median gestational age was similar at 39 weeks across groups. The median SVI was 67 (IQR, 38–87), with some missing values.

Nirsevimab receipt was associated with a markedly lower crude rate of RSV-associated hospitalization. Specifically, 850 of 194,422 treated infants (0.4%) were hospitalized compared with 2,535 of 215,301 untreated infants (1.2%), P<.001. Modeled daily hospitalization rates peaked at an estimated 2.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.42-3.38) per 100,000 among treated infants versus 13.84 (95% CI, 13.16-14.53) per 100,000 among untreated infants during the season.

Time-to-event analyses yielded consistent effect estimates. In unadjusted Cox PH models, the hazard ratio (HR) for RSV-associated hospitalization after nirsevimab treatment was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.26-0.32). After adjusting for chronologic age, gestational age, SVI, and CCC categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic), the HR was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.21-0.26), indicating an approximately 77% lower instantaneous risk of hospitalization following treatment. Multistate modeling that transitioned infants from untreated to treated on the administration date supported the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome.

Secondary utilization outcomes followed the same direction. Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions attributed to RSV occurred in 324 treated infants (0.2%) versus 765 untreated infants (0.4%), P<.001. Intubation was rare but less frequent among treated infants (49 vs. 90, both <0.1%, P = 0.004). The seasonal figure further illustrates the rising cumulative coverage of nirsevimab across autumn and winter, alongside consistently lower modeled hospitalization rates in the treated cohort.

The researchers noted potential biases that could attenuate the observed effectiveness, including the incomplete capture of maternal RSV vaccination status and the possible receipt of nirsevimab outside contributing health systems, which would misclassify exposure and bias the results toward the null. Restricting to infants with documented well-child care during the season aimed to reduce loss to follow-up. Overall, the large sample and consistency with prior season estimates strengthen confidence in generalizability.

In a large, multi-system EHR cohort from the 2024-2025 RSV season, nirsevimab was associated with substantially fewer RSV-related hospitalizations in US infants, with adjusted HRs near 0.23 and lower ICU use. For families, this translates to fewer frightening hospital stays and less disruption to work and caregiving. For clinicians and health systems, it supports ongoing efforts to offer nirsevimab early in the season and equitably across communities, including infants with complex chronic conditions.

Real-time monitoring of key biomarkers is a critical prerequisite for early disease diagnosis and personalized therapy. Early detection of liver function impairment particularly relies on the measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). However, conventional methods, including electrochemical, colorimetric, and fluorescence-based assays, often suffer from operational complexity, high cost, and limited sensitivity, making them inadequate for ""rapid, real-time, and low-cost"" detection needs in clinical intraoperative monitoring or home-based health management. Therefore, the development of a novel, convenient, and highly sensitive ALT detection strategy holds significant clinical value and application potential.

Recently, the research team led by Prof. Hanyang Li at Harbin Engineering University has integrated functionalized liquid crystal (LC) microcavities with whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) laser technology to establish a novel real-time biosensing platform (Figure 1), enabling highly sensitive detection of ALT.

The team introduced stearic acid as a functional molecule within the LC microcavities. Leveraging its pH-responsive properties, the system can generate a pronounced optical response to pH variations induced by the ALT-catalyzed enzymatic reaction. These pH changes alter interfacial anchoring conditions, driving reversible transitions of LC molecules between radial and bipolar configurations. The resulting molecular orientation changes directly modulate the effective refractive index of the microcavity, thereby inducing a measurable redshift in the WGM laser resonance wavelength. This mechanism allows for real-time, label-free optical sensing of ALT enzymatic activity.

The normal reference range for ALT is typically 0-40 U/L, with critical thresholds at 40, 80, and 200 U/L being particularly relevant for early liver injury diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrated a highly linear correlation between ALT concentration (0-240 U/L) and reaction completion time, achieving a sensitivity of 0.67 s/(U/L). Based on both the reaction completion time and spectral peak dynamics, the platform enables graded evaluation of mild (40-80 U/L), moderate (80-200 U/L), and severe (>200 U/L) liver injury, providing a quantitative framework for more refined liver function assessment.

To further validate the clinical applicability of the proposed ALT biosensing approach, in vivo tests were conducted using mouse serum. The results showed excellent agreement with commercial ALT assay kits, further demonstrating the platform's practicality and potential for clinical translation.

A comprehensive review reveals how roselle's bioactive compounds may combat inflammation across multiple diseases, but scientists caution that rigorous human trials are still essential.



Applicability of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. Extract With Anti-Inflammatory Potential in Human Health: A Review. Image Credit: Background Photo / Shutterstock

In a recent review in the journal Food Science & Nutrition, researchers synthesized evidence from recent studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of the e plant, focusing on its bioactive compounds and therapeutic potential.

They concluded that roselle shows anti-inflammatory potential relevant to atherosclerosis, intestinal dysfunction, and degenerative diseases, based largely on preclinical and limited clinical evidence, demonstrating promising but preliminary potential across these indications.

Gut microbes actively reshape hibiscus compounds: During digestion, intestinal bacteria transform roselle's polyphenols into smaller metabolites like hydroxyphenylpropionic acids – these newly formed molecules are likely the real drivers behind its gut health benefits.

Research on medicinal plants has gained global momentum due to their potential to provide natural therapeutic agents. Among these, Hibiscus sabdariffa L., commonly known as roselle, has been widely cultivated in tropical regions and is valued both as a delicacy and as a medicinal resource.

Roselle calyxes are rich in anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and organic acids (including hibiscus acid), contributing to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihyperlipidemic, and neuroprotective effects.

Leaves also provide proteins, minerals, vitamins, and polyphenols, such as chlorogenic acid, quercetin, and kaempferol, that support antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.

These compounds act through multiple mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a key mediator of inflammation. Growing evidence associates roselle with benefits for conditions ranging from cardiovascular health to neurodegenerative diseases, but its mechanisms remain complex and multifaceted.

To better understand these therapeutic properties, researchers compiled research from 2019 to 2024. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25 articles were retrieved, forming the basis for analysis of roselle's anti-inflammatory and broader health-promoting activities.

Most of the evidence summarized is preclinical, with a small number of human studies; therefore, efficacy claims should be considered preliminary.

The calyx offers more than vibrant color: While leaves provide useful nutrients, the deep red calyxes are the powerhouse for anthocyanins like delphinidin-3-glucoside, directly linked to fighting vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis models.

Across the reviewed studies, roselle demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Protocatechuic acid, a key bioactive compound, has been shown to protect against septic lung injury in mice by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, suggesting its potential in preclinical sepsis models.

Other studies highlighted the role of hibiscus in modulating gut health, as supplementation in mice increased butyrate synthesis, reduced inflammatory cells, and prevented the formation of aberrant crypt foci, indicating its potential to counter intestinal inflammation and early precancerous changes. The gut microbiota have been shown to biotransform roselle compounds into active metabolites, thereby further enhancing these protective effects.

Roselle extracts also influenced metabolic health. In obese rats, hibiscus calyx extract suppressed fat cell formation by downregulating adipogenic genes, helping prevent obesity-related insulin resistance in rodent models.

Similar protective effects were reported in studies exploring hibiscus-based nutraceutical blends, which enhanced antioxidant defenses and improved nutrient quality. For instance, turmeric-fortified hibiscus drinks provided higher iron, zinc, and vitamin C content, as well as enhanced antioxidant capacity, thereby strengthening both their nutritional and antioxidant potential.

Research further supported hibiscus's role in combating oxidative stress in skin cells, where hibiscus acid reduced cellular aging markers in skin cell assays. Additionally, delphinidin-3-glucoside from hibiscus calyxes has been shown to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation in rabbit models of atherosclerosis, providing experimental support for its cardiovascular protective effects.

Wound healing needed the right recipe: The study testing roselle on wounds used a gel containing 15% leaf extract – this specific concentration hinted at possible benefits, even though the overall results weren't statistically clear-cut.

Several studies emphasized roselle's neuroprotective and anticancer properties. Preparations combining hibiscus with olive leaf extract protected brain cells from oxidative stress, suggesting potential applications in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, hibiscus administration improved memory and reduced neuroinflammation and amyloid plaque buildup, supporting its potential as a plant-based neuroprotective agent in experimental contexts.

Anticancer effects were also reported in both breast and oral cancer models. Hibiscus extracts inhibited proliferation and triggered apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines, with evidence suggesting estrogen receptor pathways played a role.

Gossypetin, another hibiscus compound, has been shown to suppress tumor growth in oral squamous cell carcinoma by blocking migration, invasion, and cell cycle progression, while inducing apoptosis.

On the other hand, the evidence for hibiscus in wound healing was less conclusive. Although roselle leaf extract gel (15% concentration) showed some potential at higher concentrations, no statistically significant differences were found in healing outcomes compared with controls, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

Combining plants boosted brain protection: Research found a preparation mixing hibiscus flower extracts with olive leaf extracts offered significant defense for brain cells against oxidative damage, suggesting potential for blended natural therapies.

Research on roselle highlights its therapeutic potential, largely attributed to its rich content of organic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and other polyphenols, which possess potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.

Clinical and experimental evidence shows that hibiscus extracts can reduce inflammatory markers (such as TNF-α and hs-CRP), protect against oxidative stress, and improve metabolic outcomes. Key compounds, including protocatechuic acid and delphinidin-3-glucoside, have been shown to have protective roles in conditions such as septic lung injury, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration.

Additional benefits were observed in oncology research, where hibiscus-derived compounds inhibited tumor growth, and in gastrointestinal studies, where extracts improved gut health by enhancing butyrate production and modulating microbiota-derived metabolites.

The review's strengths lie in its synthesis of recent evidence across diverse health domains, reinforcing hibiscus's broad pharmacological relevance. However, limitations include the small number of high-quality clinical studies, reliance on preclinical models, and gaps in specific areas such as wound healing, where evidence remains inconclusive.

In conclusion, roselle exhibits strong anti-inflammatory and disease-modulating potential; however, further well-designed randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm its effectiveness, refine dosages, and explore under-researched therapeutic applications.

A new mouse study reveals that carefully selected probiotics can lower blood sugar, body fat, and cholesterol levels while reshaping gut metabolism, suggesting a promising strategy for future diabetes prevention.

In a recent study published in the journal Metabolites, researchers developed a precision probiotic cocktail to improve blood glucose homeostasis. Hyperglycemia is approaching epidemic prevalence worldwide, with about a third of the United States population estimated to have poor glucose homeostasis. Chronic hyperglycemia may lead to life-threatening conditions, such as neuropathy, cancer, nephropathy, retinopathy, diabetic ketoacidosis, and cardiovascular disease. It is also associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and reductions in quality of life and lifespan.

Probiotics are promising interventions for complications associated with hyperglycemia. A recent meta-analysis found significant improvements in the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin with probiotic supplementation. However, there is a need for strain-specific probiotic combinations selected based on their high glucose-consumption capacity and optimized for glucose lowering.

In the present study, researchers developed a precision probiotic cocktail to enhance gut microbial glucose consumption, thereby improving weight loss and blood glucose control. Twelve gut microbial strains were tested for *in vitro* glucose consumption. These included Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, L. paracasei, L. salivarius, L. reuteri, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. longum, B. animalis, and Nissle 1917.

A glucometer was used to measure glucose consumption by each strain after 24 hours of incubation in the Gifu anaerobic medium (GAM) and de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) broths. Glucose depletion in the MRS broth was significantly higher for samples inoculated with B. bifidum and Lactobacillus strains than for the uninoculated blank, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, and L. reuteri consumed nearly all available glucose.

Glucose depletion in the GAM was significantly greater in all inoculated samples compared to the blank. Consistently, L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius, and L. reuteri showed the highest glucose depletion. Building on these results, six male C57BL/6J mice per group were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks, and L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius, and L. reuteri were selected for *in vivo* testing as a precision probiotic cocktail. Mice were gavaged with 5 × 10^8 CFU/100 μL of each strain in phosphate-buffered saline every other day, or saline alone (controls).

From week 2 of HFD feeding onward, mice that received the probiotic cocktail consistently had lower fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels than controls. FBG was measured weekly after a 6-hour fast using a handheld glucometer. Notably, controls showed significantly higher FBG at week 8 compared to baseline. In addition, the probiotic group consistently had significantly lower body weights at weeks 1 and 8 than the control group. The magnitude of differences in weight gain between groups increased over weeks 3 and 8, indicating continued benefits.

While both groups demonstrated weight gain, controls had the most significant increase from baseline. After eight weeks, terminal adiposity was nearly one-third lower in the probiotic group than in controls. Body fat percentage was quantified at week 8 by EchoMRI. The probiotic group had approximately 50% lower circulating insulin levels than the control group. The probiotic cocktail also had significantly lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides compared to the controls.



Schematic overview of our novel approach to develop precision probiotics for blood glucose control. Bacterial strains (n = 12) were tested in vitro to identify strains with the greatest glucose consumption capabilities. The top three strains were combined to produce the probiotic cocktail. The efficacy of the cocktail was then tested in vivo on C57BL/6J male mice on a high-fat diet who received oral gavages of the probiotics (n = 6) or vehicle PBS (n = 6) every other day for eight weeks. Body weight and blood glucose concentration were measured weekly. Terminal body composition was measured at eight weeks. Terminal serum and liver samples were harvested for metabolomic analysis. Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis. Created in BioRender. Patterson, J. (2025). Accessed on 3 July 2025. https://BioRender.com/bjkw2oe. 

HDL levels were not significantly different between groups, although the TC/HDL ratio was significantly lower in the probiotic group. Further, terminal fasting serum samples were subject to untargeted metabolomics. This revealed significant differences in the concentrations of 62 metabolites between groups.

These included metabolites associated with adenosine triphosphate formation (D-ribose-1-phosphate), vitamin C metabolism products (L-threonic acid), energy-producing substrates (D-mannose, pyruvic acid, and D-glucose), and carnitine derivatives (O-propanoylcarnitine, 3-dehydrocarnitine, and 2-ethylacryloylcarnitine). A metabolic pathway analysis of serum samples from both groups revealed various energy production pathways.

Furthermore, liver samples were collected to assess the effects on tissue metabolites. L-threonic acid and oxoglutaric acid (an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle) exhibited increased liver abundance in the probiotic group relative to controls. In addition, L-lysine, aminoadipic acid, N6-acetyl-L-lysine, and methylmalonic acid were significantly elevated in the probiotic group, while creatinine was reduced.

The liver metabolic pathway analysis also identified various amino acid metabolism and energy production pathways. Finally, terminal fecal samples were subject to 16S rRNA sequencing. Faith's phylogenetic α-diversity quantifications indicated significant changes in the probiotic group. There was a substantial upregulation of Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 609-strain and a decrease in Odoribacter in the probiotic group.

The study presented a precision probiotic cocktail that significantly reduced elevations in body weight and FBG in HFD-fed mice compared to controls. The cocktail significantly improved circulating insulin, VLDL/LDL, and TC levels. Metabolomic analyses revealed host metabolic adaptations for energy-producing pathways.

Findings are preclinical in a high-fat-diet mouse model with small, male-only cohorts; human efficacy requires larger clinical trials. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of precision probiotics in enhancing gut microbial glucose consumption and reducing glucose availability to the host.

People who have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may suffer worse symptoms if they live in areas with higher levels of air pollution, according to a multi-national study presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Patients with OSA often snore loudly, their breathing starts and stops during the night, and they may wake up several times. Not only does this cause excessive sleepiness, but it can also increase the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. OSA is very common, but many people do not realize they have the condition.

The research was presented by Martino Pengo, Associate Professor from the University of Milano-Bicocca and clinician at Istituto Auxologico Italiano IRCCS, Milan, Italy. He told the Congress: ""We know that OSA is more common in people who are older or overweight, but there's growing concern that air pollution also might make the condition worse. However, previous studies, mostly focused on just one country, have produced mixed results. We wanted to look at this on a larger scale, across several European cities, to better understand if and how air pollution affects OSA.""

The study included data on 19,325 patients with OSA from 25 different cities in 14 countries [2]. All patients are taking part in a larger research project called the European Sleep Apnoea Database. As well as providing data on their age, sex, BMI and whether they smoke, all patients took part in a sleep study to measure the quality of their sleep and confirm a diagnosis of OSA, including recording pauses in breathing and drops in the level of oxygen in the blood.

Researchers combined this patient data with records of PM10 concentration in the air where each patient lives, taken from the Europe-wide Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. PM10 concentration is the amount of tiny particles, 10 micrometers or smaller, released into the air by vehicle exhausts and industrial processes, for example.

The analysis revealed that, overall, for every one unit increase in PM10, there was a modest but measurable increase in the patients' apnea hypopnea index (AHI). AHI is the number of apneas (when breathing stops) and hypopneas (when breathing is reduced) per hour during sleep. For example, among patients with low AHI (less than five) the average PM10 in the area where they live was relatively low (around 16 micrograms per cubic meter of air). In contrast, in patients with high AHI (five or more) the average PM10 was also higher (around 19 micrograms per cubic meter of air).

Researchers also found differences between the strength of the link between air pollution and OSA in different cities around Europe: for instance, in cities like Lisbon (Portugal), Paris (France), and Athens (Greece) the association was particularly strong.

We confirmed a statistically significant positive association between average long-term exposure to air pollution, specifically fine particles known as PM10, and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Even after we took account for other factors that we know have an effect on OSA, we still found an average increase in the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep of 0.41 for every one unit increase in PM10. This effect may seem small for an individual, but across entire populations it can shift many people into higher-severity categories, making it meaningful from a public health perspective.""

Martino Pengo, Associate Professor, University of Milano-Bicocca 

""One of the most interesting findings was that the link between air pollution and OSA severity wasn't the same in every European location. In some cities, the impact was stronger; in others, it was weaker or even absent. These regional differences might be due to things like local climate, the type of pollution or even how healthcare systems detect OSA.""

The researchers say they want to understand why the effects vary between cities and whether some people are more affected by pollution than others. They also hope to explore whether reducing pollution can improve sleep apnea symptoms.

Professor Sophia Schiza is Head of the European Respiratory Society's expert group on sleep disordered breathing, based at the University of Crete, Greece, and was not involved in the research. She said: ""Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition. People who have OSA may know that they snore or wake up often in the night, and they may also feel sleepy during the day. There are also serious health risks associated with this condition. For people with OSA, especially those living in cities with high levels of air pollution, this study is important as it suggests pollution could be making their condition worse.

""For doctors caring for people with OSA, this research highlights the need to consider environmental factors like air quality alongside other risk factors. This study strengthens the connection between environmental health and sleep medicine. It reminds us that tackling air pollution isn't just good for the planet, it's also vital for our lungs and our sleep quality too.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Resuscitation Care Units improve efficiency, documentation and reimbursement costs for hospitals","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250929/Resuscitation-Care-Units-improve-efficiency-documentation-and-reimbursement-costs-for-hospitals.aspx","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:25:00 GMT","

Resuscitation Care Units (RCUs) provide intensive, comprehensive and immediate medical care for critically ill patients with life-threatening conditions, such as cardiac arrest, requiring specialized monitoring and rapid intervention from a multidisciplinary team. Many studies have shown that creating these special high-acuity areas in an emergency department, can save lives and improve patient outcomes. However, questions about financial sustainability have slowed adoption of these units.

A new study by researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and UMass Chan Medical School has found these dedicated units not only benefitted patients, but resulted in improved efficiency, documentation and reimbursement costs for the hospital.

""For patients, RCUs mean that the sickest people in the emergency department receive faster, more focused care from specially trained teams. For the health system, it means this approach can pay for itself, because the billing better matches the real work being done; which makes it more likely that hospitals will be willing to adopt these units, which in turn can improve emergency care for everyone,"" explains corresponding author Michael Sherman, MD, MA, FACEP, assistant professor of emergency medicine & critical care medicine at the school.

The researchers performed a retrospective review of approximately 75,000 emergency visits at

UMass Memorial Medical Center, a busy urban hospital. They compared the 35 weeks before and after the institution opened a nine-bed RCU in July 2019. They reviewed the billing codes (which reflect the intensity of care) and revenue from those visits and then compared the patterns with a nearby hospital in the same system that didn't have an RCU. This novel study showed a strong association with RCU's and improved ED efficiency and coding, representing more accurate reimbursement for these units and demonstrating the fiscal sustainability of the model.

According to the researchers, RCU's are known to decrease the need for ICU admission, shorten hospital and intensive care unit stays and cut direct costs by preventing illness from worsening. ""By centralizing care for the sickest patients, RCUs help doctors and nurses deliver antibiotics, fluids and other lifesaving treatments faster, while freeing ICU beds for patients who need longer-term care,"" adds Sherman who also is an emergency & critical care physician at Boston Medical Center.

Beyond money and coding, the study suggests that changing how emergency departments are organized can improve care and efficiency. ""It shows that small changes in workflow (like staffing ratios and dedicated space) can have a big impact without building a whole new department or building,"" says Sherman.

These finding appear online in the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine.

In the largest trial of its kind, scientists discovered that boosting testosterone did not affect men's choices in trust, risk, or fairness games, undermining years of smaller, attention-grabbing studies.

Study: Investigating the effects of single-dose intranasal testosterone on economic preferences in a large randomized trial of men. Image credit: Zerbor/Shutterstock.com

Some research suggests that testosterone shapes economic preferences. A recent study published in PNAS sought to validate this theory in a randomized controlled trial.

Testosterone, often referred to as the male sex hormone, plays a key role in male secondary sexual development, such as increased muscle mass and strength, deepening of the voice, and body hair growth. Beyond physical effects, higher testosterone levels have been linked both intuitively and in some studies of ultimatum and other economic games to more aggressive, dominant, and mate-seeking behaviors.  

Economic preferences are often studied using economic games, each catering to a different type of preference. The dictator, ultimatum, and trust games help assess social preferences. In contrast, risk preferences are evaluated by choosing between a lottery and a safe option, or various lotteries with differing odds and outcomes. Competitiveness may be measured by choosing between a piece-rate vs a tournament scheme.

The choices made in these games correlate with educational and career options, to some extent, indicating their predictive potential in the real world.

Earlier studies have reported correlations between testosterone levels and men's economic preferences, including altruism, fairness, or risk-taking. Most of this evidence comes from observational research or small intervention trials, often conducted without pre-registered analysis plans. Despite these limitations, such findings have attracted considerable attention and become widely cited.  

However, not only is the evidence often conflicting, but it is also at a significant risk of selective reporting bias. The lack of pre-registered analyses also contributes to the use of unduly lax analytic standards, such as studying too many outcomes or defining the outcome variables.

The study included 1,000 participants, all men, thus making it at least ten times the size of any previous experiment. The men were randomized to get either one 11 mg dose of intranasal testosterone or a placebo, after which they were given various tasks to complete. The peak testosterone level was measured after half an hour.

This was then compared with the participants' choices in several economic games and related tasks, which were designed to assess the effect of testosterone on their economic preferences.

Earlier studies and some robustness analyses in this paper suggested that participants who believed they had received testosterone sometimes made lower offers in the ultimatum game. Still, the evidence was weak and much smaller in magnitude than prior reports.

The tasks used included:

The participants were assessed for nine outcomes on the economic preference tasks:

The salivary testosterone assay showed an increase in testosterone in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. However, testosterone did not lead to any change in the offers in the ultimatum game. Testosterone did not increase trustworthiness or reduce trust in the trust game, nor did it increase risk-taking behavior.

Testosterone was not correlated with generosity, economic risk-taking, or rejection of unfairness in the ultimatum game. It was also not associated with competitiveness. Thus, analysis comparing the testosterone and placebo groups after treatment showed no difference in any outcome.

Salivary testosterone levels did not appear to correlate with the economic preferences. Neither did salivary testosterone interact with cortisol levels at baseline or after testosterone administration, contradicting prior research.

This questions the long-held idea, due mainly to specific older papers, that short-term changes in testosterone levels drive male economic preferences. However, more exhaustive research is required to test the effects of different dosages and routes of administration.

Earlier work indicated that testosterone's effects on the brain occur within 30 to 60 minutes of administration, suggesting that the 30-minute interval used here is consistent with peak serum effects. Previous pharmacokinetic studies also show increases within 15 to 30 minutes in serum, and while longer delays (e.g., several hours) have been proposed as potentially relevant, the evidence is weak.

Testosterone effects may be more powerful during developmental windows such as fetal life or puberty, as these hormones shape brain and cognitive development. Direct evidence for this is lacking, and indirect evidence is controversial in its reliability and validity. One recent study looked at birth testosterone levels and did not find it associated with economic preferences in later life.

“We thus find strong evidence against the hypothesis that single-dose intranasal testosterone administration has important effects on economic preferences or behavior in men.” This is further supported by the fact that baseline salivary testosterone levels do not correlate with any of the pre-registered outcomes.

Multiple high-impact articles suggested that testosterone did, in fact, affect economic choices, but the current study was unable to replicate this in any outcome despite its large sample size. The authors emphasize that their trial should be seen as a heavily powered conceptual replication of prior work and that null findings were robust across preregistered, robustness, and exploratory analysis.

Future research should focus on ethical ways to assess the developmental and long-term impact of giving testosterone to men. Sex-specific differences should also be sought. Above all, pre-registered large studies should be carried out to avoid false positives and minimize bias.

New research reveals that reducing air pollution not only improves children's eyesight but could also play a crucial role in tackling the soaring rates of myopia worldwide.

Study: Benefits of clean air for school children's vision health. Image credit: Wallenrock/Shutterstock.com

A recent PNAS Nexus study used a large sample of school-aged children to investigate the potential benefits of cleaner air for vision and to identify the primary factors influencing visual acuity.

Myopia or short-sightedness has become a significant global public health concern, with prevalence rates reaching 80-90% in school-leavers in East Asia. Well-known risk factors of myopia include intensive screen use, having myopic parents, and other behavioral habits that lower exposure to natural light.

Recent research has shown that children in regions with worse air quality are more likely to have poorer visual health. Air pollution may increase oxidative stress and exacerbate ocular surface inflammation. This suggests that myopia risk may be increased with chronic pollution exposure. However, the direct evidence linking cleaner air and better visual acuity is limited, and the problem is being able to satisfactorily account for confounding influences from other factors that also affect vision.

Traditional regression models like logistic or linear regression have difficulty making sense of the complex patterns in large health datasets. This problem is solved by automated machine learning (AutoML), which does not require any prior specification of the relationships between variables and can automatically model nonlinear influences and interactions.

This study used an explainable AutoML framework to identify the primary drivers of childhood myopia, evaluate age- and severity-specific variations in risk factor profiles, and quantify the benefits of cleaner air. The sample comprised approximately 30,000 primary, middle, and high school students from Tianjin, China, recruited from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023, in Tianjin, China.

School nurses or trained healthcare professionals conducted myopia screening. Each eye's uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was measured at 5m, and noncycloplegic autorefractions were also used to determine spherical equivalent refraction, which was part of the myopia diagnosis. Several confounders were considered, and data were collected on academic pressure and schooling characteristics, familial myopia history, lifestyle factors, and environmental factors, including air quality.

The average age of the participants was 10.4 years, and 51.9% were male at birth. Most of the sample (84.7%) came from urban areas, with an average prevalence of myopia of 53.2%. Approximately 11.0% of all students slept with lights on, and there was heterogeneity in sleep duration by grade. For example, 4.0% of junior high-school students slept ≥9 hours, while 9.8% of primary school students slept ≥10.

Parental myopia prevalence was 64.5% with one myopic parent. About 79% of the students consumed 4–6 grams of salt per day, and about 82% consumed desserts ≤3 times per week. Median exposure values to 2-year average air pollutants were 33.6 μg m−3 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 38.6 μg m−3 for PM2.5.

Thirty machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict UCVA in the given sample, including parental myopia, school type, nighttime light, NO₂ levels, and PM₂.₅ levels, in order of importance. Attendance at primary school was generally associated with higher UCVA, whereas middle and high school attendance was associated with negative UCVA outcomes.

Similarly, coherent patterns were seen for environmental factors. Greener surroundings were linked to better UCVA; conversely, poorer UCVA was seen in areas with heavier pollution. A key point is that the factors influencing myopia often interact, sometimes offsetting and sometimes amplifying individual impacts. Studying a single factor in isolation can misrepresent its true weight. Other important contributors included sex, sleep duration, homework burden, and sports participation, highlighting that daily behaviors also shaped UCVA outcomes.

On average, primary school children exhibited better vision than senior students. Demographic/genetic influences explained about 81.0% of the total UCVA variation among children with high myopia. In children with less severe myopia, about 12% and 14% of UCVA variation were explained by environmental factors and behavioral habits, respectively. A trend was noted whereby high myopia prevalence increased with age. NO2 was a more influential predictor in less severe myopia. These findings suggest that demographic factors are most important in high myopia, while differences in pollution exposure have a stronger impact on less severe myopia.

Clean air scenarios were created to quantify the potential benefits of improving air quality on UCVA. A marked improvement was noted in UCVA outcomes, with reductions in both NO2 and PM2.5. The average UCVA of the whole population improved by approximately 0.04 units, relative to the current baseline condition. Primary school students benefited the most, with their average UCVA improving by about 0.09 units, roughly double the overall population average; hence, younger students would benefit more from cleaner air.

This study uses an explainable machine learning tool to demonstrate the significant association between air pollution and decreased UCVA, particularly among younger school-age participants. This implies that expanding green spaces, enhancing air quality around schools, and fostering healthy lifestyle practices may safeguard children's visual health.

The authors highlight practical intervention strategies to reduce daily exposure, such as air purifiers in classrooms and establishing clean-air zones near schools.

This study's findings were limited by using self-reported data on lifestyle habits, which can introduce bias. The reliance on a single city may also limit the generalizability of the findings. Ambient air quality was used as a proxy for individual exposure; however, indoor exposures can be very challenging to measure accurately. Future research could conduct more in-depth causal analysis to assess the effectiveness of targeted strategies in managing myopia risk.

Hypnosis can significantly improve patients' tolerance of masks to help them breathe when they are suffering from acute respiratory failure, according to a pilot study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress today (Monday).

People who come to hospital with breathing problems are often given non-invasive ventilation (NIV) via a mask and tubes connected to a machine in order increase the amount of oxygen in their blood and lower carbon dioxide levels. However, some patients are unable to tolerate a tight-fitting mask over their mouth and nose and have to be sedated or given anti-anxiety medication.

Dr Tobi Hamza, a resident emergency medicine doctor at the Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital (HMIMV) in Rabat, Morocco, told the Congress: ""We decided to conduct this study in response to the significant anxiety, discomfort, and poor tolerance often observed in patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation, particularly those with acute respiratory distress. Given the increasing interest in non-pharmacological techniques to improve patient comfort and compliance, we wanted to explore whether medical hypnosis could improve NIV tolerance and outcomes.""

Acute respiratory failure is a medical emergency and occurs when the lungs are unable to take in enough oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. There are a number of causes, including heart failure, lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia, infections and injuries to the chest or ribs.

Between December 2023 and May 2024, Dr Hamza and colleagues recruited 20 patients who came into the HMIMV emergency department with acute respiratory distress to a prospective pilot study. They randomised them into two groups: ten patients received the standard care of NIV and anti-anxiety medication if needed – the control group; a further ten patients received a hypnosis session and NIV.

The hypnosis session consisted of a calming induction phase using voice guidance, breathing synchronisation and visual imagery; a deepening phase to reduce anxiety and enhance dissociation from physical discomfort; and a therapeutic suggestion phase, aiming to promote feelings of safety, trust in the treatment and cooperation with the mask. A doctor trained in medical hypnosis conducted all the sessions.""

Dr. Tobi Hamza, Resident Emergency Medicine Doctor, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital (HMIMV) 

The researchers assessed how well the patients tolerated the masks using a comfort score with a scale from 0 to 10, by assessing changes in oxygen, carbon dioxide and acidity levels (pH) in the arterial blood after one and four hours, any requirement for sedation and anti-anxiety medication, and whether or not NIV had to be discontinued [2].

""Our most significant result was a substantial improvement in NIV tolerance in the hypnosis group,"" said Dr Hamza. ""Eight out of ten patients, 80%, in the hypnosis group successfully completed non-invasive ventilation sessions without requiring sedation or switching to invasive ventilation, compared to only five out of ten, 50%, in the control group.

""We also observed a reduction in agitation and respiratory distress scores, shorter duration of emergency room stay, and reduced need for anti-anxiety medication. Clinical efficacy was improved too. After four hours, we saw greater reductions in carbon dioxide in the blood and the acidity levels returned to normal. We were positively surprised by the magnitude of the difference. It confirmed that hypnosis could be a powerful complementary tool in emergency respiratory care, improving NIV tolerance, reducing patient distress and potentially improving outcomes. For clinicians it offers a low-cost, non-invasive, drug-free adjunct to support respiratory care.""

Patients in the hypnosis group gave a higher comfort score: 7.5 out of ten, compared to 4.3 in the control group.

""To our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective studies evaluating hypnosis as a supportive technique during NIV in emergency settings. While hypnosis has been explored in pain, procedural anxiety and chronic disease management, its application in acute respiratory distress with NIV is still very novel. Although it was a small study, the findings suggest a substantial clinical benefit and we are conducting a larger, multi-centre study to validate our findings and explore the long-term impact of hypnosis on outcomes, such as hospital stay, intubation rate and mortality,"" he concluded.

A strength of the study is its prospective design in a real-world emergency department with an emergency doctor trained in hypnosis. Limitations include that it was a single-centre study, it was difficult to obtain consent for hypnosis, especially when it would jeopardise immediate vital prognoses or patients were confused, and patients were excluded from the study if they presented as an extreme emergency; a doctor trained in hypnosis administered it to patients, which might limit the generalisability of the findings until more staff are trained in the technique; and the doctors and patients were not 'blinded' to which patients received which treatment.

Dr Felix Lorang is a member of the EUSEM abstract selection committee. He is head of the emergency department at SRH Zentralklinikum Suhl, Thuringia, Germany, and was not involved with the research. He said: ""We do know that in the setting of non-invasive ventilation, verbal guidance is of utmost importance to ensure therapy adherence, especially in emergency settings. Hypnosis is a step further in intensifying the interaction, and this study suggests that hypnosis not only can help patients to tolerate non-invasive ventilation more easily and make them comfortable, but also can improve the clinical efficacy of the ventilation. This deserves further investigation in larger groups of patients.""

In tissue biopsies, cancer cells are frequently observed to have nuclei (the cell's genetic information storage) larger than normal. Until now, this was considered a sign that the cancer was worsening, but the exact cause and effect had not been elucidated. In this study, the KAIST research team found that cancer cell nuclear hypertrophy is not a cause of malignancy but a temporary response to replication stress, and that it can, in fact, suppress metastasis. This discovery is expected to lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer and metastasis inhibition.

KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the September 26th that a research team led by Professor Joon Kim of the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, in collaboration with the research teams of Professor Ji Hun Kim and Professor You-Me Kim, discovered the molecular reason why the nucleus enlarges in cancer cells. This achievement provides an important clue for understanding nuclear hypertrophy, a phenomenon frequently observed in pathological examinations but whose direct cause and relationship with cancer development were unclear.

The research team confirmed that DNA replication stress (the burden and error signal that occurs when a cell copies its DNA), which is common in cancer cells, causes the 'actin' protein inside the nucleus to aggregate (polymerize), which is the direct cause of the nuclear enlargement.

This result suggests that the change in cancer cell nuclear size may not simply be a ""trait evolved by the cancer cell for its benefit."" Rather, it suggests that it is a temporary, makeshift response to stress, and that it may impose constraints on the cancer cell's potential for metastasis.

Therefore, future research needs to explore whether changes in nuclear size can become a target for cancer treatment or a clue related to the suppression of metastasis. That is, nuclear hypertrophy may be a temporary response to replication stress and should not necessarily be seen as indicating the malignancy of the cancer.

This conclusion was substantiated through: (1) Gene Function Screening (inhibiting thousands of genes sequentially to find the key genes involved in nuclear size regulation); (2) Transcriptome Analysis (confirming which gene programs are activated when the nucleus enlarges); (3) 3D Genome Structure Analysis (Hi-C), which revealed that nuclear hypertrophy is not just a size change but is connected to changes in DNA folding and gene arrangement; and (4) Mouse Xenograft Models (confirming that cancer cells with enlarged nuclei actually have reduced motility and metastatic ability).

We confirmed that DNA replication stress disrupts the nuclear size balance, explaining the underlying mechanism of long-standing pathological observations. The possibility of utilizing nuclear structural changes as a new indicator for cancer diagnosis and metastasis prediction has now opened up.""

Dr. Changgon Kim (currently a Hematology and Oncology specialist at Korea University Anam Hospital) and Saemyeong Hong, a PhD candidate from the KAIST Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering, participated as co-first authors in this study. The results were published online in the international journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America) on September 9th.

ByMichael Lewis,

Contributor.

Many supporters of the U.S. Men's National Team would like nothing more than to place Christian Pulisic in bubble wrap until June 12, 2026.

That's when the Americans will kick off their latest World Cup adventure, against an opponent to be determined in Los Angeles, at the tournament's draw in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 5.

Of course, keeping Pulisic in bubble wrap can't and won't happen.

Until then, the 27-year-old forward needs to excel for club and country, fill the net with goals, hone his talent and write another chapter in his incredible career.

Which he certainly has done for A.C. Milan, lately.

Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you should know Pulisic has started the Serie A season red hot, hot, hot.

Since the Italian Serie A season kicked off last month, the Hershey, Pa. native has scored six goals and added two assists across seven matches.

Heck, he also has recorded four goals and two assists in three appearances over nine days.

It started with two goals and an assist in a virtuoso performance in a 3-0 away victory over Udinese on Sept. 20 and was given a 10-for-10 rating by Soccerway.com. He followed that up with a goal against Lecce in another 3-0 home win in a Coppa Italia encounter on Sept. 23.

And then came Sunday, Sept. 28, when the 5-foot-10, 161-lb. Pulisic tallied a goal and an assist in Milan's 2-1 home triumph over Napoli.

Milan (4-1-0, 12 points) won its fourth successive Serie A match, taking over first place via goal differential past the defending champions (4-1-0, 12), plus six to plus five, respectively.

“We feel incredible, honestly, just the spirit of the team, and the way we fought also after the red card, we really gave everything, and it's a special feeling now for us,” Pulisic said on CBS SportsGolazo.

“It sends a message for sure. We're a good team, we're a strong team, we can score goals, but we can also defend like this, and we have a good spirit. I think it shows a lot for sure.”

In fact, he has taken over the early Golden Boot lead with his four goals. Four players are tied for second place with three apiece - Nico Paz (Como), Riccardo Orsolini (Bologna), Kevin De Bruyne (Napoli) and Marcus Thuram (Inter).

Yes, it's early, but still, not too shabby for any player, let alone an American.

There is no argument that Pulisic is a generational player.

Let's put it into perspective.

In life, a generation usually is measured by 20 or 25 years.

In soccer, it is more like seven to 12 years because international careers don't always last longer than that.

For example, Landon Donovan (2002-2014) and Clint Dempsey (2004-2017) were attacking dynamos during their prime years. Having two lethal offensive weapons on the same pitch made the Americans a lethal and respected force in the world.

They lead all USMNT players with 57 goals apiece. Pulisic is fifth with 31, behind Jozy Altidore (42) and Eric Wynalda (34). Donovan also is the all-time assist leader (58) With a couple of stellar performance, Pulisic could tie or even pass Wynalda, assuming he is called in for the USA's next two friendlies, against Ecuador in Austin, Texas (Oct. 10) and Australia in Commerce City, Colo (Oct. 14). There are also friendlies scheduled against Paraguay in Chester, Pa. (Nov. 15) and Uruguay in Tampa, Fla. (Nov. 18).

Speaking of prime years, Pulisic is in his prime at the age of 27. According to statistics, most strikers and attacking midfielders excel between the ages of 25 and 30. The average age of a World Cup scoring champion is a little more than 25. Of course, there are exceptions.

This is his time.

If the USMNT is to be successful at next year's World Cup, the Americans will need superior performances by several players. At the top of the list is one Christian Pulisic.

Of course, in a competition such as the World Cup, no team can be a one-man show, except for such super-talented players as Pele, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi.

These players showed that they can bend steel with their bare feet.

Pulisic isn't in their class, but few Americans should be complaining. There is no one else on the team in his class.

Never have the USMNT players been put under the microscope prior to a World Cup, because this competition is at home, co-host by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

Soccer officials in this country - U.S. Soccer, Major League Soccer, and even the lower divisions - hope that the USMNT will impress and go deep in the tournament and boost the sport's influence in this country. Failing to get out of the group stage would be embarrassing; South Africa (2010) is the only country to pull off that rare, abysmal feat. A Round of 32 appearance is a must; a quarterfinal match would be acceptable.

As for Pulisic not playing during the summer friendlies and Concacaf Gold Cup and the kerfuffle that started in a he-said, he-said situation with U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino, and a soap opera ensued in which former USMNT stars voiced their opinion, should be in the past.

This is a time to look ahead and enjoy what feats Christian Pulisic can perform with his feet (and sometimes with his head) for club and country.

Let's face it, Pulisic has become an indispensable player not on just one team, but two.

If he keeps a decent pace and remains healthy, U.S. soccer supporters could be in line for a memorable time come next summer.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens discuss England's midfield dilemma as Thomas Tuchel faces a selection headache. (2:34)

Global footballers' union FIFPRO is still waiting for talks with FIFA over match scheduling at the 2026 World Cup after voicing concerns over excessive heat during this summer's Club World Cup in the United States.

FIFPRO has published a 51-page report titled ""Overworked and Under-Protected -- The Player Health and Performance Impact"" covering the 2024-25 season, focusing on the impact of workload, rest and the effects of playing the month-long Club World Cup in June and July.

The study showed that Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester City and eventual Club World Cup winners Chelsea all had less than the recommended 28-day summer rest period -- Chelsea and Madrid had just 20 days each -- while PSG had just seven days of pre-season re-training, despite 28 days being the recommended minimum.

With several games at the Club World Cup delayed or impacted by excessive heat or severe weather conditions, FIFPRO called on FIFA to reconsider scheduled kick-off times and venues for games at next summer's 48-team World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

But FIFPRO general secretary Alex Phillips said that the players' organisation is still waiting for FIFA to schedule talks to address the issue.

""We have informal discussions [with FIFA] on a regular basis on different levels, technical level, be that medical or any other department,"" Phillips told reporters. ""But nothing major or specific with regards to the World Cup next year.

""We have multiple concerns and that's just one tournament of many and the vast majority of players around the world, their bread and butter is national leagues and national competitions.

""But yes, it is a concern [that talks haven't happened yet]. So we will proceed as we did with the Club World Cup and provide the science and the data to FIFA well in advance of the tournament.

""We are doing the same with others, not just FIFA. We're doing the same, for example, with the Women's Asian Cup which is happening in Australia next March.

""Same principle. Well in advance, we say to them, 'look, you've scheduled matches at 1:00 p.m, you do realise that in Australia they don't play matches at 1:00 p.m. in March or in the summer?' to try and help them to either reschedule the matches or if not, at least implement better protocols and mitigating measures as happened in the Club World Cup in the middle of the tournament too late.

""If the governing bodies are not providing relevant statistics and facts with regards to the health of the players, we will do it. It's our job.""

Phillips' comments were echoed by Alex Bielefeld, FIFPRO's director of policy and strategic relations, who said that excessive heat had a direct impact on the players at the Club World Cup.

""The regulations and policies were not up to speed with a warming planet in the match locations,"" he said. ""We also would see that we had certain problems during the Cup World Cup with scheduling where it didn't necessarily take into account player performance and player health and safety requirements in terms of extreme heat.

""We had kick-off times in locations in around 12 o'clock that were in extreme heat conditions.

""This is still something that we have to address ahead of the World Cup.

""I think the Club World Cup was probably a wake-up call in this regard, but it was also a bad example in terms of how we have not properly prepared and taking things into consideration and had to improvise ad hoc to actually deal with the circumstances that impacted both player performance and the player experience during the tournament.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Chelsea won the Fifa Club World Cup which left many clubs with no proper rest in between seasons

Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan travelled more than 100,000 miles last season - and veteran Luka Modric played more games than anyone else in the world, according to a new Fifpro report into players' welfare.

It also found players at the Fifa Club World Cup - which took place in June and July - did not get a safe amount of off-season or pre-season days.

Football players are caught in a ""perfect storm of how not to treat a human"", says the international players' union.

Fifpro has launched its fifth annual report on the issue, looking at how much players played and travelled in 2024-25.

Alex Phillips, the secretary general, said: ""Last year, the Ballon d'Or winner [Rodri] got injured and missed nearly a season. 

""This season, the Ballon d'Or winner [Ousmane Dembele] is out again with a muscle injury. 

""How long will this keep happening until even the club owners realise it's bad for business? 

""We're looking at the player health issue but even the people owning clubs and leagues are starting to take note and realise the system isn't working for anyone.""

The research paper looked into seven sections, including risks to players' health because of calendar congestion and long international travel, the short spell in between seasons, the heat - and how young footballers are playing more than ever.

Among its findings were that Modric, who turned 40 this summer, played more games than any other player in 2024-25, including friendlies - 76 for Real Madrid and Croatia.

Europe-based Ryan had to travel 169,000km (105,000 miles) in the season for Australia duty.

And Lamine Yamal has played 130 games by the age of 18, which is far more than most of his peers ever managed.

The study found the Club World Cup dramatically added to some players' workload too.

Darren Burgess, a high-performance consultant for Fifpro, said: ""It's a perfect storm of how not to treat a human - a large number of games and less than the recommended off-season days to go into a large number of games.

""The cycle goes on.""

BBC Sport has a look at some of Fifpro's findings.

Including internationals and friendly matches, 10 players featured 69 times or more last season - with Modric, now at AC Milan, leading the way with 76.

""It must be noted that all 10 players on the list played at the 2025 Fifa Club World Cup and by far surpassed the recommended maximum limit of 55 match appearances per season,"" said the Fifpro report.

Four of the top 10 were Paris St-Germain players, with the top two both Real Madrid players - Modric and Federico Valverde.

It also found that Uruguay's Valverde made the most 'back-to-back' appearances - which it counts as matches within five days or 120 hours - 58.

Bayern Munich and South Korea defender Kim Min-jae had a run of 20 games in 73 days.

Fifpro say it ""dramatically increased his risk of injury"" - and indeed it emerged he suffered an Achilles injury in October, before being sidelined in May.

The players with the most matchday squad appearances were youngsters - Tottenham's Archie Gray and Real's Arda Guler.

Gray, now 19, was at least a substitute on 80 different occasions in 2024-25 for Tottenham and England Under-21s, including friendlies. He played in 63 of them.

Nottingham Forest and New Zealand striker Chris Wood, speaking on a Fifpro video call about the issue, says one or two seasons of 60-odd games is one thing.

""When you are heading into year three, four or five of 60 games, that is when you could see problems arise,"" he said.

It is an issue his Forest head coach, Ange Postecoglou, also has strong feelings on. 

Speaking about the topic to journalists before the Sunderland game, he said: ""It's not just the volume of games - players just don't get a break any more. 

""You can cope with a workload of 50-55 games a year, excluding internationals, but you need to give the players a minimum of a month off every year and I don't think they are getting that.""

League One footballer Ben Waine had to travel almost 100,000 miles last season

Former Brighton keeper Ryan travelled more than any other player in the world - with a distance of more than 100,000 miles - with more than 217 hours spent travelling (the equivalent of nine days of the year). 

The Australian started last season in Italy with Roma, before moving to French side Lens in January. Ryan moved to Spain to join Levante this summer.

Just behind him on the list was New Zealand's Marko Stamenic, who was on loan at Olympiacos from Forest - and now plays for Swansea.

And third was another New Zealander Ben Waine, who was on loan at Mansfield Town from Plymouth Argyle.

The 24-year-old, who is now at Port Vale, travelled 157,000km (97,000 miles).

Cameroon goalkeeper Andre Onana, who was at Manchester United, had 33 different international cross-border trips, crossing 69 time zones.

He travelled 67,000km for Cameroon and 60,000km with United including the Europa League and pre-season tours.

The report also highlights the case of Chelsea and Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo.

In the space of 14 days in October, the report noted, ""he played a total of 360 minutes across two continents and three countries, with an average recovery time of 110.8 hours, while flying more than half the length of the equator"".

""Sometimes you can be on a plane three hours after finishing a game with Forest for 30 hours of travel,"" Wood added.

""It's not perfect sitting on a plane. It doesn't give your body enough time to recover from the extreme workload of a game.""

Top European club and national team players have about three weeks between seasons, says the report.

It compared this to several other sports leagues.

Basketball's NBA has between 14 and 23 weeks off depending on whether teams reached the play-offs.

Aussie rules' Australian Football League and baseball's MLB both had a minimum of 14 weeks too.

High-performance expert Burgess, who has worked for Arsenal and Liverpool, said it shows ""how far football has to come compared to other sports"". 

""The priority [in those other sports] has been placed on player performance and well-being. 

""It illustrates it can happen if you get the right people at the table. You can get to a better point.""

The Fifpro report said players should have a 28-day off-season, and another 28-day pre-season.

It says none of the teams in the Club World Cup met those targets - including winners Chelsea, who had just finished their domestic season met those.

Austrian club Salzburg resumed training eight days after their exit to prepare for Champions League qualifiers.

Tunisian side Esperance had 10 days off and Benfica had 14 days before they started training for their domestic super cups.

Treble winners and beaten Club World Cup finalists Paris St-Germain had 22 days off but then only seven days of a pre-season.

Winners Chelsea had 20 days off and 13 days of pre-season.

Lamine Yamal played 130 times for Barcelona and Spain before turning 18 in July.

Fifpro highlights that other players who played for both teams had much fewer appearances at that age - including legend Andres Iniesta (40), one-time wonderkid Ansu Fati (45) and current team-mates Pedri (49) and Gavi (60).

Lamine Yamal is a bit of an exception because he is already such a talent - finishing second in the 2025 Ballon d'Or.

But there is a pattern.

None of the seven winners of the Golden Boy (award for best player aged under 21) from 2010 to 2016 had played 2,000 minutes before turning 18.

But seven of the next eight did. And the past four years produced the four highest figures - led by Lamine Yamal's 8,158 minutes.

Burgess called the issue ""alarming"".

""Players until the age of 24 and 25 are still growing and maturing,"" he said. 

""To expose them to excessive load is to expose them to a greater injury risk. 

""We're seeing those players eventually break down. It's unknown territory. ""

Forest striker Wood says the threat of striking is ""a potential thing"" but ""we don't ever want to get to that point"".

Fifpro has been campaigning for a less demanding football calendar for many years, while watching player workload rise.

But the body does not feel it is all doom and gloom.

Director Alexander Bielefeld said: ""When we started with this five years ago there was a lot of pushback and people saying it was a non-issue. 

""If we look at the media landscape and discourse now I don't think anyone disputes this is an issue. On that scale we've moved. 

""We're not at the stage where people want to give up part of their competitions or see players miss the competitions. We haven't been able to implement these safeguards. 

""There are legal cases ongoing and a significant shift in the discourse. We need urgent action but we're in a very different space to two or three years ago.""

Postecoglou also says more and more games can cut fans' enjoyment of the game.

""I just don't think there's a same sense of excitement if we keep creating tournaments or games,"" he said.

""We used to look forward to games but now there are times, particularly in the off-season when everyone wants to go on holiday when there are games on everyone goes, 'I'll just head down to the beach instead'.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Global Soccer Union Says Players Need More Rest Time","https://frontofficesports.com/global-soccer-union-says-players-need-more-rest-time/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:09:12 GMT","

FIFPro released an annual report showing the quick turnaround time between seasons.

The global soccer players union FIFPro released its annual workload report Monday that says the international calendar is too burdensome.

FIFPro has continuously opposed soccer organizers, particularly FIFA, for expanding the international match schedule in recent years. The UEFA Champions League grew last year, as will next year's World Cup.

One focal point of FIFPro's criticism in the report is the Club World Cup, which FIFA significantly revamped this summer. The tournament grew from seven to 32 teams and boasted a prize purse of $1 billion. The money courted several of Europe's biggest clubs including Manchester City, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Chelsea, who took home at least $100 million for winning the tournament.

FIFPro says players haven't been getting enough rest time between seasons or preparation time in preseason before jumping back into match play. The union cites a recent study that recommended players receive at least four weeks off between seasons and another minimum of four weeks for preseason training.

The new report tracked the percentage of players in the top five European leagues who competed in the UEFA European Championship and CONMEBOL Copa América in the summer of 2024 who received 28 days of either off-season or preseason. The report found 14% of Euro and 9% of Copa players got four weeks off, while 15% of Euro players and just 4% of Copa players got four weeks of preseason.

Those numbers went down for the biggest tournament of this summer, the Club World Cup. The report found that none of the participating teams gave their players 28 days off before the preseason began. None of the top European clubs—PSG, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, or Borussia Dortmund—gave their players 28 days in either category. All of these clubs gave their players between 19 and 25 days off, and between 7 and 23 days of preseason training. (Tournament finalists PSG and Chelsea had seven and 13 days of preseason, respectively, the report found.)

The report said the turnaround time between international and club play can be under 48 hours, which FIFPro says especially isn't enough time for top players whose national team duties are on a different continent than their club.

FIFPro directly called out the heat problem at the Club World Cup, saying four matches should have been canceled or rescheduled. Players and managers complained about the temperature and mid-day kickoffs as the U.S. endured a heatwave this summer in several cities that will also host World Cup matches next year.

The players union has long criticized FIFA in particular for adding games to the international calendar, and even last year made a complaint saying FIFA is violating EU competition law by acting as both organizer and regulator. FIFA is far from the only organizer staging summer tournaments—the 2024 Summer Olympics and CONCACAF Gold Cup this year are two other recent examples—but its total makeover of the Club World Cup added significant additional workload to the international calendar. FIFA is also expanding the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams and 64 to 104 matches next summer.

FIFA has blamed the clubs, domestic leagues, and confederations for overloading the calendar, and held that any changes it's made have received full approval. 

FIFA held a meeting this summer with players unions in New York, after which it announced it had reached a “consensus” about player welfare, including a 21-day offseason and 72 hours between matches. FIFPro was notably not invited to the meeting.

Verizon wants to help you score tickets to the FIFA World Cup.

Demand is expected to be high for the soccer competition to be held in the United States, Mexico and Canada – more than 4.5 million people have already signed up through the FIFA World Cup Visa Presale Draw. The 2026 World Cup begins in Mexico City on June 11 and ends at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 19.

Some lucky Verizon customers have the chance to win freebies because the telecom giant is giving away ""thousands of free tickets to the games"" starting Thursday, Oct. 2, the company announced in a news release on Monday, Sept. 29.

The tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis in the My Verizon app in the Verizon Access section, where the cellular and broadband provider gives away tickets to concerts and other events – and has even handed out NFL tickets in the past. One note: you must be a Verizon customer.

""Our customers are very passionate about soccer and we're passionate about giving our customers the most incredible access to the things they love,"" Verizon Chief Marketing Officer Leslie Berland told USA TODAY.

Coming in November: A sweepstakes giving hundreds of customers the chance to win ""Golden Tickets"" granting them on-field pitchside viewing access during the tournament. ""So there are about 200 people who get (Golden Tickets with) free tickets to the match ... (and) we bring them down to the pitch to watch part of the game,"" Berland said.

Winners will also get to experience meet and greet sessions with stars such as David Beckham, former USMNT goalkeeper and NBC Sports analyst Tim Howard, current USWNT players (and sisters) Alyssa and Gisele Thompson (Alyssa plays for Chelsea in the Women's Super League; Gisele for Angel City FC of the NWSL), Hirving ""Chucky"" Lozano (San Diego FC), and former Argentine and Manchester City star Sergio ""Kun"" Agüero.

“For me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that's on or off the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament,"" said Beckham in the news release. The soccer legend will be featured in Verizon's World Cup marketing campaign proclaiming that ""no one gets you closer"" to the action than Verizon. 

Verizon customers will want to begin checking the Verizon myAccess section of the My Verizon app starting Thursday, Oct. 2, at 9 a.m. ET. Between now and the tournament, additional free World Cup ticket drops will announced in the app and at Verizon.com/Access and on Verizon's social handles, the company says. Hint: follow the company's accounts on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X and Facebook.

More information about the Golden Tickets giveaway will be forthcoming, but chances to win will come through social media, retail and other mediums, according to Berland.

A new report from the global football player union highlights concerns over player load and heat. 

A FIFPRO report on the 2024-25 football season highlights concerns over the amount of football players in the men's game are playing. Key findings cover several areas of concern, perhaps most notably continued calendar congestion and extreme heat.

The 32-team Club World Cup put an enormous strain on the players, with some, such as Achraf Hakimi, having their seasons stretch over almost an entire year as a result.

The report notes that Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich all had their offseasons and preseasons for the current campaign severely shortened because of the competition. Without improved safeguarding and better load management, there is concern that the participation of many players at the 2026 World Cup is at risk.

The FIFPRO report says that the consensus of medical experts is that competition regulations should include a minimum of four weeks between seasons, a minimum of two days between appearances to allow for adequate recovery and that the increased burden of travel should be considered when scheduling fixtures.

“You've got the perfect storm of how not to treat a human,"" FIFPRO consultant Dr. Darren Burgess told journalists in a media call to present the report. 

""You've got players playing a largue number of games followed by fewer than the recommended off-season days and preseason days followed by a large number of games again. The cycle keeps repeating.""

“This leads to injury at worst and at best reduced capacity to perform.""

One of the other major concerns in the report was heat, which was highlighted for the first time five years after FIFPRO started delivering these annual reports.

""This year, with the impact at the Club World Cup, and the pathway towards the World Cup in the US, it felt necessary to include it in the report this year,"" FIFPRO Director of Policy & Strategic Relations Alexander Bielefeld said.

""The risk to player health is clearly rising.""

Using the Club World Cup as a case study, the report found that four games in the US reached a temperature above 28C (82F), which under FIFPRO guidelines meant they should have been cancelled. A further 17 games saw temperatures that were close to the cancellation threshold.

""This is an issue that affects a lot of different playing markets in the context of a warming planet. The Club World Cup was a wake-up call in this regard and a bad example of how to properly deal with the circumstances.""

On one occasion, Borussia Dortmund had their substitutes sit inside because temperatures outside were too high.

""The harder and longer athletes play, the greater their heat exposure, increasing risks from fatigue and dizziness to heat stroke and long-term illnesses,"" Manal Azzi, an occupational health and safety expert for the International Labor Organization, told FIFPRO.

According to the FIFPRO report, six of the 16 host cities for the World Cup face conditions classified as ""extreme risk"" for heat-related illness, which is a concern for players and fans. With 48 teams involved across three countries with three varied climates, increased fatigue is a serious risk.

This matter is made more complicated by US President Donald Trump recently saying he would move matches from host cities he deemed too dangerous, explaining that San Francisco and Seattle were cities ""run by radical left lunatics.""

With FIFPRO currently engaged in legal action against FIFA for the congested nature of the calendar and voices from the playing group growing even louder, there is hope that tangible change is on the way. The players' union believes that years of accumulated data gives more weight to their arguments, and that there is a real sense in the game that no one disputes that load management is an issue.

""There is a significant shift in the discourse,"" Bielefeld said. ""This is not sufficient. We need urgent action, but we are in a very different space than we were two-three years ago.""

""We will keep fighting for the best possible outcome on this issue and many other issues,"" Alexander Phillips, FIFPRO's secretary general said.

""But they all boil down to the same issue which is that the system is not working.""

In the meantime, football's schedule rolls on and the World Cup looms large. With 48 teams and 104 games it will be the biggest edition of the competition ever. Fans can only hope that next summer, the best players in the world will be fit and healthy enough to take part.

Players which competed in the FIFA Club World Cup after their domestic league season are among hundreds at the top of men's football who lack adequate offseason or preseason periods, increasing risks to player health and performance, according to the annual FIFPRO Player Workload Monitoring Report published in collaboration with Football Benchmark.

Maheta Molango, FIFPRO board member, said: ""This report gives you the factual evidence of what is happening in football. Players are either getting injured or not being able to perform at their best because they are pushed to their limit.""

Chelsea, the FIFA Club World Cup winners, and runners-up Paris Saint-Germain were the hardest hit by the calendar crunch: after having their holiday period reduced to barely three weeks, Chelsea players had just 13 days for preseason, while PSG players got only seven days.

These findings underscore the urgent need for common-sense player safeguards like those in a recently-published Consensus Study on Minimum Player Workload Safeguards, in which high-performance experts agreed players should receive 28 days offseason and a further 28 days preseason.

The 2024/25 season report, entitled 'Overworked and Underprotected: The Player Health and Performance Impact' uses data from 1,500 men's football players tracked on FIFPRO's Player Workload Monitoring platform, benchmarking their rest and recovery against recommendations from 70 medical and performance experts working for clubs and national teams. The report also looks at recovery time in other sports and, for the first time, incorporates extreme heat as a growing factor for performance, health, and competition planning. 

Many other players at the top of the game are also short on rest and recovery: only 14 percent of the 2024 UEFA European Championship participants in the sample had the recommended 28 days of offseason rest before last season, dropping to just nine percent for Copa America participants who play in Europe's top five leagues. Post-tournament preparation was equally inadequate: only 15 percent had sufficient preseason after the EURO, and just four percent after the Copa America.

Dr. Darren Burgess, chair of FIFPRO's High-Performance Advisory Network, said football should follow other sports in guaranteeing offseason breaks to protect players from injury and burnout. NBA and Australia's AFL players get 14 weeks off, while Major League Baseball players have 15 weeks.

""If you don't have enough off-season, you don't give your body enough time mentally and physically to freshen up,"" Dr. Burgess said. “Plus, not having 28 days as a minimum of preseason prevents players doing rigorous preparation for the season ahead. It leads at worst to injury, and at best reduced capacity to perform. In other sports, the priority has been placed on player performance and player well-being, and the offseason break is a substantial part of that.""

While many players in football's pyramid lack competitive games, those at the elite level are often overburdened: the health risks for players become disproportionate to elite sports' inherent risks when they face sustained periods of two games per week, according to scientific research. The following were among players who experienced extreme fixture congestion with more than 50 games last season, many of which were with less than five days of recovery time:

Recovery time after international windows is often less than 48 hours – a smaller break than experts recommend – even for South Americans facing long-haul travel back to European and U.S. clubs. Argentina's Enzo Fernandez exemplified this burden, accumulating 195 hours of travel during 29 journeys spanning 149,010 kilometres last season.

Chris Wood, the New Zealand captain who is a member of the FIFPRO Global Player Council, said: ""For us as players it's vitally important that we have the recovery period to allow the body to adapt and go again. We need to make sure that we are looking after our body in the long term. It's key we look at the minimum rest process and especially the preseason.""

The consensus study identified specific workload safeguard needs for academy players under 18, with more research required for those under 21. However, evidence shows little caution: Lamine Yamal played 130 games before his 18th birthday in July, while Archie Gray, who turned 19 in March, appeared in 80 squad selections for Tottenham and England's Under-21 team last season.

Dr. Burgess emphasised that younger players need age-appropriate training loads, clear match exposure limits, and protected rest periods: ""Growth plates, tendons, and ligaments remain vulnerable during these years, and excessive high-speed running or short recovery windows can lead to long-term structural damage,” he said. “The psychological toll should also not be underestimated.""

So North American soccer fans will be able to experience the action on their home turf — and perhaps even without the pain of trying to purchase the tickets for themselves.

Naturally, the carrier has signed on soccer legend David Beckham to help promote all this free stuff.

Thousands of free tickets will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis in the My Verizon app via the Verizon Access rewards program. The first ticket drop starts this Thursday (October 2) at 9.00 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT.

New tickets will be dropped hourly, with the final one taking place at 7 p.m. ET / 4 p.m. PT. Following this, Verizon will have daily ticket drops at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT from October 3 to 13. All those games are scheduled for June 13-16, and will take place in locations across the U.S.

 




November will also see the launch of new sweepstakes, giving customers the chance to win hundreds of ""Golden Tickets"" that come with pitchside access. Plus, there will be additional giveaways at various points leading up to the tournament, which officially starts in Mexico City on June 11.

Various all-star players will also be on the road with Verizon in the run-up to the World Cup, offering meet-and-greets and surprise events along the way. Those players include Tim Howard, Alyssa and Giselle Thompson, Chucky Lozano and Sergio (Kun) Agüero.

Winning the Champions League secures a place among Europe's elite. But reaching the summit of the World Cup requires a different kind of genius, one that balances tactics, character, and the weight of national expectation.

Only a select group of coaches have managed to lift both trophies. Their journeys reveal contrasting challenges—navigating club soccer's marathon of matches and thriving in the short, high-stakes burst of a global tournament.

From legendary tacticians to unexpected innovators, these managers bridged two demanding worlds. Their success offers a rare glimpse into how adaptability and vision can shape the most enduring legacies.

Only two managers in history have achieved the spectacular feat of winning both the UEFA Champions League (or the European Cup) at the club level and the FIFA World Cup with a national team. These two legendary figures are the Italian Marcello Lippi and the Spaniard Vicente del Bosque.

Marcello Lippi was the first manager to complete this prestigious double, accomplishing the wins a decade apart. His European triumph came during a dominant period for Italian soccer in the mid-1990s. He led Juventus to victory in the 1996 Champions League final, defeating Ajax in a penalty shootout in Rome. 

His Juventus team was a powerhouse, though he also suffered three subsequent consecutive final defeats (1997, 1998, 2003). His greatest moment, however, arrived when he took charge of the national team. 

In the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, he guided the Italy national team through a tournament defined by resilience and unity, culminating in a dramatic final victory over France, again decided by penalties. This victory secured his place as a national hero and the first coach to claim both major trophies.

Vicente del Bosque joined Lippi in this exclusive club four years later, achieving a remarkable run of success for both club and country. His initial European glory came during his tenure at Real Madrid at the beginning of the Galácticos era. 

He won the Champions League twice with the club, first in 2000 against Valencia and again in 2002 against Bayer Leverkusen, a final famously decided by Zinedine Zidane's spectacular volley. 

His second major title came when he managed the Spain national team. Inheriting a talented squad from Luis Aragones, he led Spain to victory in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, defeating the Netherlands in the final. 

This win cemented Spain's “Golden Generation” and helped him achieve a unique status: he is currently the only coach in history to have won the World Cup, the European Championship (2012), the Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup/Club World Cup.

The fact that only two men have successfully managed to win both the Champions League and the World Cup highlights the extreme difficulty of mastering two fundamentally different managerial disciplines in soccer.

This exclusivity stems from the inherent contradiction between the demands of the club game and the international tournament format. The Champions League demands a manager to be a master long-term project leader. 

Success requires sustained high performance across a grueling nine-month schedule, the ability to command a squad built from players across the globe, and the constant tactical evolution needed to outsmart the world's richest and best-organized club teams. 

A club coach has continuous access to his players, facilitating the implementation of complex systems, but must also manage massive transfer budgets and player turnover. Lippi's success with Juventus and Del Bosque's wins with Real Madrid were achieved through multi-year projects of dominance.

The FIFA World Cup, conversely, requires a manager to be a brilliant short-term specialist and motivational leader. The competition is a ruthless, single-elimination sprint over four weeks. 

The coach has minimal preparation time—gathering players who spend most of the year as rivals—and must simplify tactics for immediate effectiveness. There is no transfer market to fix weaknesses, and one bad match is often terminal.

The challenge here is less about sustained technical complexity and more about generating intense emotional unity and momentum. Del Bosque excelled at this, stepping in to manage the existing talent and philosophy of the Spanish team's “Golden Generation” to win in 2010.

Furthermore, the opportunity itself is incredibly scarce. To win the UCL, a coach needs to be at one of a dozen mega-rich European clubs, a job that is annual. To win the World Cup, a coach must be appointed to one of the eight nations historically capable of lifting the trophy—a job that only comes around every four years. 

Lippi (Italy) and Del Bosque (Spain) had the perfect, yet highly rare, career trajectory: they achieved continental club dominance, which then earned them the opportunity to lead their respective elite national teams at precisely the moment a world-class generation of players peaked. This convergence of elite timing, tactical duality and managerial stature is why the list of winners remains so short.

South Africa have dropped from top of Group C to second in the table after fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in a qualifier in March

South Africa's hopes of qualifying for the 2026 Fifa World Cup have suffered a major blow after they were sanctioned for fielding an ineligible player.

Teboho Mokoena played in the 2-0 win over Lesotho in March despite the 28-year-old midfielder being due to serve a suspension after accumulating two yellow cards.

A Fifa disciplinary committee has ruled that South Africa breached competition rules, and has imposed a 3-0 forfeit.

The country's football association (Safa) has been fined 10,000 Swiss Francs ($12,500, £9,340), while Mokoena has been issued with a warning.

The decision has blown Group C of African World Cup qualifying wide open, with South Africa dropping from top of the table to second place, behind Benin on goal difference.

Only the group winners are assured of reaching next year's tournament in north and central America.

It also gives renewed hope to Nigeria and Rwanda of reaching the finals, with both of those sides now three points below Benin and South Africa.

Benin travel to Rwanda and Nigeria in the final two round of qualifiers between 10 and 14 October, while South Africa face an away game against Zimbabwe before hosting Rwanda.

Safa has 10 days to appeal Fifa's decision.

South Africa did have a three-point lead at the top of Group C before the decision by Fifa's disciplinary committee, but now Benin are top on goal difference - with Bafana Bafana dropping to second place as Lesotho gain three points

ZURICH (AP) — South Africa was stripped of a win in 2026 World Cup qualifying by FIFA on Monday and lost top spot in its group for fielding an ineligible player.

FIFA's disciplinary ruling overturned a South Africa win against Lesotho in March, left Benin top with two rounds to go and gave Nigeria fresh hope of advancing to the finals tournament.

Only the group winner on Oct. 14 will advance direct to the World Cup being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. South Africa has not played at a World Cup since hosting the 2010 edition.

Ahead of decisive qualifying games resuming next week, FIFA said its disciplinary judges ordered South Africa to forfeit as a 3-0 loss what had been a 2-0 victory over Lesotho.

South Africa selected Teboho Mokoena for the game in Polokwane when the midfielder should have served a one-game ban for getting yellow cards in two previous qualifying games.

The administrative error is embarrassing for South Africa as its top soccer official, Patrice Motsepe, is a FIFA vice president as the elected leader of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Motsepe also owns the Mamelodi Sundowns club that Mokoena plays for. 

FIFA said the South African soccer federation can appeal against forfeiting the game. FIFA also fined the federation 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,500) and Mokoena was formally warned.

Without the three points, plus a negative five-goal swing in its goal difference, South Africa drops below new group leader Benin. The teams are tied on points, both three clear of Nigeria and Rwanda, but Benin's goal difference is one better than South Africa. 

South Africa completes the qualifying group against Zimbabwe on Oct. 10 and at home to Rwanda four days later. Zimbabwe's “home” game is being played in South Africa, at Durban, because it does not have a national stadium that meets CAF standards.

Mokoena was picked last week in the preliminary squad for those games by coach Hugo Broos. 

Benin plays at Rwanda on Oct. 10 and then goes to Nigeria, which aims to qualify for its seventh World Cup and first since 2018 in Russia. Nigeria also has to play Lesotho.

The runner-up in the group could advance to a four-team African playoffs bracket in November. That will decide which African team advances to the inter-continental playoffs in March at venues to be agreed in north America.

 Teboho Mokoena is a player of South Africa whose case caused his country this setback

South Africa's hopes of securing early control in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign has suffered a major setback after FIFA's Disciplinary Committee confirmed sanctions against the South African Football Association (SAFA) for fielding an ineligible player.

The ruling on Monday, September 29, 2025, stems from South Africa's match against Lesotho on March 21, 2025, in which midfielder Teboho Mokoena featured, despite being ineligible under FIFA regulations. FIFA ruled that the appearance breached both Article 19 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code and Article 14 of the 2026 World Cup Preliminary Competition Regulations.As a consequence, FIFA has awarded the match as a 3-0 victory to Lesotho, with South Africa losing the three points they had earned on the pitch. The decision means South Africa now drops three points in Group C, tightening an already competitive qualifying race.UDS players snubbed in awards ceremony despite winning University Games In addition to the forfeiture, SAFA has been fined approximately $11,000, while Mokoena himself has been issued with a warning. 

FIFA stressed that all parties were informed of the decision and that SAFA has ten days to request a detailed, motivated judgment, which could be appealed before the FIFA Appeal Committee.For Coach Hugo Broos and his side, the ruling is a bitter blow. South Africa had been building momentum, but the deduction not only dents their points tally but also shifts the pressure onto their remaining fixtures.  FKA/AEWatch the latest episode of Sports Check with Boxer Jacob Dickson below:

Late, late drama was the order of a hugely entertaining weekend in the Premier League. Arsenal snatched all three points at Newcastle thanks to Gabriel's 96th-minute header, while former Gunner Eddie Nketiah also struck at the death to hand Liverpool their first defeat of the season and continue Crystal Palace's incredible start.

The last-gasp goals mean that neutrals should be able to look forward to a closer-run title race than was first expected, while there was also a lot of schadenfreude on offer for those with a particular dislike for some of the league's other big clubs that have fallen on hard times.

Chelsea were haunted yet again by their inability to finish matches with 11 men on the pitch, while Manchester United provided yet more humorous moments by conceding two cheap goals and missing a penalty to lose at Brentford, just the latest example of a club that further implodes almost every week.

An undefeated champion at the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals will walk away with a record $5,071,000, the richest payout in the event's history.

The prestigious season finale, held from 9-16 November at the Inalpi Arena in Turin, will feature an event record $15.5 million in total prize money. 

Last year, Jannik Sinner set a new benchmark when he stormed to the title without dropping a set, collecting $4,881,100 — then the largest prize awarded at the event. Now a Nitto ATP Finals champion could break $5 million in winnings for the first time.



Each match from the semi-finals onwards will be worth more than $1 million. The semi-final victors will add $1,183,500 to their tally, while the champion of the title match will take home $2,367,000 on top of what they earned earlier in the tournament. See the full distribution below.




An undefeated doubles team will secure $959,300. See below the full doubles prize money breakdown.

Carlos Alcaraz faced perhaps the sternest examination of his debut run at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships on Monday, but he emerged with flying colours to book his spot in the final.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings overcame a resilient Casper Ruud and his own fitness concerns to secure a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory at the ATP 500 event. Alcaraz, who displayed limited movement at times during the opening set, eventually rediscovered his sharpness to set up a title showdown with former Tokyo champion Taylor Fritz.

“I had a lot of chances in the first set,” said Alcaraz. “I had four break points if I'm not wrong. It's just about details, so I just tried to be more positive than the first set. I was a little bit mad with myself, so I just tried to play with joy again, putting a lot of positive thoughts in my mind.”

With his two-hour, eight-minute victory, Alcaraz notched his personal-best 66th win in a season. On Tuesday, the 22-year-old Spaniard will seek revenge against Fritz, who defeated him at the Laver Cup last week.

“I know he's playing great tennis lately,” Alcaraz said of Fritz, who also defeated Alexander Zverev in San Francisco. “Since the Laver Cup against me, against Zverev, and here in this tournament, he's feeling great and really comfortable on the court. Everything is different since San Francisco... But it's another challenge for me and I'm looking forward to it.”

Since tweaking his left ankle in his Tokyo opener against Sebastian Baez, Alcaraz had downplayed concerns and proved it with assertive wins. Yet against Ruud, who tested him relentlessly with heavy topspin and court-stretching angles, the Spaniard's discomfort was more apparent.

Facing break point in the seventh game, Ruud attacked with a deep approach into Alcaraz's backhand corner. Though he got the ball back at his opponent's feet, Alcaraz hesitated when stretching for that ball and chasing the ensuing drop volley — a moment of vulnerability that underscored his struggles in the first set.

Watch Alcaraz struggle to deal with Ruud on break point:

Alcaraz's aggressive, risk-heavy tactics in the first set yielded 15 unforced errors, but he recalibrated in the second, finding consistency on serve: He dropped just four of 24 points behind his delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to overwhelm Ruud and level the match.

From there, Alcaraz carried that momentum into the deciding set, where he showcased his freedom of movement and fearless shotmaking, silencing any injury doubts. To overcome Fritz in the final, however, the Spaniard will need another commanding serving performance against one of the Tour's most formidable servers.

Despite defeat, Ruud has risen two spots to 11th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin as the former finalist seeks to return to the Nitto ATP Finals.



Earlier on Monday, Fritz powered his way into the final by serving his way past countryman Jenson Brooksby 6-4, 6-3. Though outplayed at times from the baseline, Fritz compensated for 13 aces to secure his first hard-court final of 2025 and climb to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

“Honestly, just by botting,” Fritz said when asked how he was able to triumph. “I served insanely well: High percentage first serves and spots too. It felt like any game that I didn't hit three aces, he was really outplaying me from the baseline. I was able to hang in on my serve, and then capitalise on that scoreboard pressure. My serve got me through it.”

Jessica Pegula saved three match points in the second-set tiebreak to defeat Emma Raducanu in a China Open third-round thriller.

No. 5 seed Jessica Pegula fended off three match points in a knife-edge second-set tiebreak to defeat No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu 3-6, 7-6(9), 6-0 in 2 hours and 21 minutes to reach the China Open fourth round.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The result marks the first time Pegula has won from match point down since the 2024 Berlin final, in which she staved off five championship points to defeat Anna Kalinskaya 6-7(0), 6-4, 7-6(3). In her very next match, she lost from match point up to Raducanu 4-6, 7-6(6), 7-5 in the Eastbourne second round. Having turned the tables on the Briton, Pegula now leads their head-to-head 3-1.

It is the second time in as many weeks that Raducanu has lost from three match points up, and via an overtime second-set tiebreak, to a former Top 3 opponent. In the Seoul second round, she squandered a 5-2 second-set lead to fall to Barbora Krejcikova 4-6, 7-6(10), 6-1. Raducanu led 5-2 in both tiebreaks; she has now lost six of her past seven tiebreaks dating back to June.

""That was a crazy match,"" Pegula said in her on-court interview. ""That was really intense. But I got myself back into the tiebreak and just wanted keep pressure on. When she hit the double fault [leading 5-4], I knew I was still playing some good tennis. It was right there, it was really, really close. And to be honest, I think I got a little lucky on those two backhand winners [both down match point]. But I just tried to keep fighting for as long as I could.""

Pegula advances to the Beijing last 16 for a second straight year, and will face Marta Kostyuk there after The No. 23 seed defeated qualifier Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-4, 6-2. Pegula leads their head-to-head 3-1, including a 6-2, 6-3 victory in their most recent meeting in the Miami fourth round this March.

How Pegula pulled off the comeback: The first two sets were high-quality, filled with riveting exchanges that showcased both players' court-craft and athleticism. Raducanu was faster out of the blocks, saving break point in the first game by finishing one of the best rallies of the match with a forehand pass and leaping out to a 4-1 lead.

By contrast, Pegula double faulted en route to dropping serve in her first service game, and only started to click on her forehand side in the sixth game. It was too late to save the set, though -- Raducanu's own forehand was also on song, and winners from that wing sealed her first set point and paved the way to a break for 2-1 in the second set.

Next, it was Pegula's turn to win a spectacular exchange, defending valiantly with Raducanu at net and being rewarded with a volley error from the 22-year-old -- and, subsequently, an immediate break back. Neither player would drop serve for the rest of the set.

Despite Pegula's modesty in referring to her ""luck"" off that wing, the two backhands she produced to save the first two match points against her were truly spectacular. The first was a half-volley one-two punch down the line, redirecting all the pace from a hefty Raducanu return. On the second, a net cord gave Raducanu a forehand sitter to power away -- but, from far out of position, Pegula somehow redirected that down the line for a winner as well. The third match point was saved as Raducanu sent a forehand long -- one of three consecutive errors from that side with which she lost the set.

As in Seoul, the decider was a formality as Pegula went from strength to strength while Raducanu found herself out of further ideas.

Linda Noskova advances to China Open fourth round as Qinwen Zheng retires due to injury. Noskova won in three sets, marking her 10th career victory over a top-10 opponent. She faces Potapova next, seeking a quarterfinal spot in Beijing.

Linda Noskova reached the fourth round of the WTA China Open in Beijing on Monday after seventh-seeded local favorite Zheng Qinwen was forced to retire in the deciding set of their third-round matchup.

Noskova, seeded No. 26, started strong to take the first set 6-4. Zheng, playing her first match since Wimbledon following elbow surgery, responded by taking the second set 6-3.

In the final set, Noskova built a 3-0 lead before Zheng retired due to pain in her elbow, handing the Czech the victory.

Disappointment for Zheng 

The retirement marked a frustrating end for Zheng, who admitted she returned this week against the advice of her team to play in front of her home fans and is still not at full strength following her surgery.

""Because keep playing by a lot of repetition, I start to feel a bit more, which is normal,"" Zheng told the press after the match. ""I already expected that. I decided when the pain's going higher, for don't damage the area, I should stop. I kept thinking about it in the second set, so I keep pushing, pushing, until I say, like, OK, that's it.""

Zheng added that she will undergo some tests and is hopeful that she will get better with time. 

""I need to double-check with the MRI to see how is going after two matches, there is one three-set matches, how it's going inside with my elbow,"" Zheng said.

""I think it's still quite positive to keep playing tennis because that's how you break the barrier. At the same time I got be smart. I know already in the second set I couldn't push more. So right now I see, okay, maybe I can play first set, but to arrive to third set is too much for my elbow. I believe with time is going to be better.""

Career Milestones for Noskova

The win marked Noskova's 10th career victory over a top-10 ranked opponent and her fourth of 2025. She became the second-youngest Czech player since 1990 to score 10 career top-10 wins, behind only Nicole Vaidisova. It was also Noskova's 31st win of the season, a career-best total after finishing 2024 with 26 victories.

Potapova next in the last 16

The 20-year-old secured her first WTA tour-level win over Zheng in two meetings and will next face Anastasia Potapova for a place in the quarterfinals.

Potapova advanced with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Zeynep Sonmez. She holds a 1-0 career record against Noskova, rallying from a set down to defeat her in the opening round at Roland Garros earlier this year.

Lewis Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, has passed away, a few days after being admitted to hospital due to serious illness.

Lewis Hamilton has announced the passing of his dog, Roscoe, following a health battle.

Roscoe was recently admitted to hospital and placed in a coma after being treated for pneumonia, with Hamilton missing a Pirelli tyre test last week to be by his side.

On Monday, Hamilton took to social media to share an emotional post confirming that Roscoe had died in his arms on Sunday evening.

It comes five years after another of Hamilton's dogs, Coco, passed away.

“After four days on life support, fighting with every bit of strength he had, I had to make the hardest decision of my life and say goodbye to Roscoe,” wrote Hamilton. “He never stopped fighting, right until the very end.

“I feel so grateful and honoured to have shared my life with such a beautiful soul, an angel and true friend. Bringing Roscoe into my life was the best decision I ever made, and I will forever cherish the memories we created together.

“Although I lost Coco, I have never been faced with putting a dog to sleep before, though I know my mum and many close friends have. It is one of the most painful experiences and I feel a deep connection to everyone who has gone through the loss of a beloved pet.

“Although it was so hard, having him was one of the most beautiful parts of life, to love so deeply and to be loved in return.

“Thank you all for the love and support you've shown Roscoe over the years. It has been so special to witness and feel.”

Max Verstappen kept himself busy between the Azerbaijan and Singapore Grands Prix with a successful GT3 race weekend at the Nurburgring.

Max Verstappen added another note to his impressive motorsport CV by winning on his GT3 race debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife last weekend, as the Dutchman continues to explore endurance competition.

Alongside team mate Chris Lulham, who usually contests the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup for Verstappen.com Racing, the four-time F1 World Champion stormed to victory in the ninth round of the NLS (Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie).

Verstappen and Lulham took on the four-hour race in a Verstappen.com and Red Bull-liveried Ferrari 296 GT3, which was run by Swiss team Emil Frey Racing – the pair coming out on top in a field of 110 cars, of which 10 participated in the fastest category (SP9).

“It was great!” Verstappen beamed, after qualifying third and seizing the lead at the start of the race. “During my first two stints, the car was amazing.

“After Qualifying, I knew the car would be good on a dry track. Everything went well in terms of traffic, and we didn't make any big mistakes. To win my debut race here is amazing.”

As for what might come next in his growing endurance career, Verstappen added: “Of course, we really want to race the 24-hour race, here at the Nordschleife. If that's going to be next year, I don't know yet.

“We need more experience, so hopefully we can enter a few more NLS races next year.”

Verstappen will return to F1 duties at the upcoming Singapore Grand Prix, with the Red Bull racer aiming to further cut the gap to McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in the Drivers' Championship standings.

Lewis Hamilton has withdrawn from a Pirelli tyre test after his beloved dog, Roscoe, was taken ill.

Lewis Hamilton has shared an update with fans on the health of his much-loved dog, Roscoe, after withdrawing from a Pirelli tyre test due to the bulldog being admitted to hospital.

Hamilton had been set to participate in Pirelli's testing of 2026 tyres at the Mugello Circuit in Italy on Friday, but the seven-time World Champion was replaced by Ferrari reserve driver Zhou Guanyu.

In a social media post, Hamilton told his followers that Roscoe was in a coma after being treated for pneumonia.

“Please keep Roscoe in your thoughts. I want to keep you all updated,” Hamilton wrote on Friday.

“Roscoe caught pneumonia again and was struggling to breathe. He was admitted into hospital and sedated to calm him while they did checks on him and during the process his heart stopped.

“They managed to get a heartbeat back and now he's in a coma. We don't know whether he will wake from this. Tomorrow we'll try to wake him up. I'm by his side and want to thank you all for your prayers and support.”

Hamilton's post was met with well wishes from his followers, including former team mate George Russell who wrote: “Thinking of you mate.”

Roscoe – who has his own Instagram account followed by 1.3 million fans – has been a regular fixture by Hamilton's side since 2013, with the Briton's beloved dog joining him at many Grands Prix over the years.

Fans say they also spotted the pop star's dad and brother at the game.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift may be one of the busiest people on earth, but she still makes time for the important people in her life. 


Billboard has confirmed that the pop superstar was at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday (Sept. 28) to cheer on Travis Kelce, just hours after she was in a different time zone to watch Selena Gomez marry Benny Blanco. Though Swift kept a low profile while at Arrowhead Stadium, fans online say they spotted her dad, Scott, and brother, Austin, at the game as well.


	The day prior, the 14-time Grammy winner was reportedly one of many celebrities in attendance at one of the biggest weddings of the year. Gomez and Blanco tied the knot on Saturday (Sept. 27) in a private ceremony in California, as shared by the Rare Beauty founder on Instagram that day.

	











	Swift and Gomez have long been besties, so it's no surprise to fans that the former was there for the latter's big day. When the Only Murders in the Building actress first announced in December that she and the producer were getting married, the Eras Tour headliner joked in the comments, “yes I will be the flower girl.”


	It may not be long before the roles are reversed and Gomez is watching her friend walk down the aisle. In August, Swift announced that she and Kelce had gotten engaged, sharing photos of her new ring and the tight end down on one knee and writing on Instagram, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”


	“When bestie gets engaged,” Gomez wrote at the time.

	











	This weekend's Chiefs game — which ended in the Kansas City team defeating the Ravens 37-20 — marked the second match-up Swift has attended this season without being spotted by the usual horde of fans and cameras that used to flock to her on game days. She was also present at the Sept. 14 game against the Philadelphia Eagles.


	Swift is currently gearing up to release her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Oct. 3.

Taylor Swift knows what excellence requires and is not afraid to demand it. Even if the one she's insisting on it from is herself. In a jokey promo video posted on Monday morning (Sept. 28) to promote the upcoming Target-only The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd Is Your King “summertime spritz pink shimmer” disc due out on Friday (Oct. 3).

	Playing the role of director — which is not new for the award-winning singer — a suit-wearing Swift gives patient direction through a pink megaphone. “All right, we are still rolling, we're gonna try again. Okay? We're elegant, we're luxurious, we're in front of the most beautiful pink vinyl we've ever seen,” she says with enthusiasm before things turn grim in the clip captioned, “she's got 4 days left to rehearse for her big moment… [laughing crying emoji].”

	“What is going on with the posture?” Swift asks with growing exasperation at an unseen model. “It's giving ‘no girl,' not showgirl. What are we doing?,” Swift says as the camera spins to a scene of the singer in her glittery showgirl cover outfit standing in front of a giant version of the pink vinyl. To her director's consternation, cover model Taylor listlessly tosses handfuls of glitter as director Swift implores, “Elegance! Charm!… Not that,” as the unsteady model Swift wobbles on her heels and fails to impress.

	











	“She's got cat hair all over her,” the director seethes. “Is there a school we could very quickly send her to?”


	Swift announced the latest vinyl variant of her upcoming The Life of a Showgirl album last week, revealing that the store-exclusive variant will feature a collectible sleeve, a giant double-sided poster, an exclusive poem penned by Swift and special photos when it drops on Friday.

While out promoting her starring role in 'Kiss of the Spider Woman,"" the singer/actress weighed in on what's changed since the couple's split.

	Gil Kaufman



Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have said very little in public about their 2024 divorce. But in a new sit-down interview with CBS Sunday Morning‘s Lee Cowan over the weekend to promote her starring role in the upcoming remake of Kiss of the Spider Woman, Lopez opened up about how her fairy tale second chance and then subsequent second split with Affleck was actually a good thing.

	In fact, Lopez told Cowan that her divorce from Affleck was “the best thing that ever happened to me.” Lopez praised Affleck's independent, artist-led studio, Artist Equity, for helping to finance the musical drama that is slated to open on Oct. 10, describing how, “I told him [Affleck] that this was the role I was born to play and I wanted to do it and he was like, ‘Okay,' and he helped make it happen.” The Accountant 2 actor is one of the executive producers on the project that is the second big screen adaptation of Argentine author Manuel Puig's 1976 novel about the intimate conversations between two Argentine prisoners.


	Lopez called the filming of the movie a “refuge” from thinking about the chaos of her personal life at the time. “It was like the best and the worst of times in a way because it was every moment on set and every moment I was doing this role… I was so happy and then it was, like, back home it was not great and it was just like, ‘How do I reconcile this?,'” she said.

	











	She then added, seemingly of the couple's divorce, “it was the best thing that ever happened to me, because it changed me… it didn't change me… it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow. Become more self-aware. I'm a different person now than I was last year I think.” 


	Lopez and Affleck first dated in 2002 and got engaged before breaking up and then reconnecting in 2021, getting married the following year and divorcing last year. Speaking about the divorce in March of this year, Affleck told GQ that Lopez was “somebody I have a lot of respect for,” noting that, “I get wanting to divine or explore the kind of differences in perspective that we have in terms of how a person feels comfortable approaching the line between public and private life. But I really hope that whatever you use doesn't suggest that I have any negativity or judgment or anything regarding that.”


	At the time, he promised the magazine that there was “no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue” about the couple's split. “It's just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do.”

Tame Impala takes another bite from Deadbeat, by unleashing “Dracula”.


	Kevin Parker's psychedelic rock project channels the Prince of Darkness on this funky, electro-pop nugget, the third, wide release from their forthcoming fifth studio album after the epic “End of Summer” and “Loser.”


	Another cut, understood to be “Ethereal Connection,” was gifted to the world as an untitled b-side for the 12-inch of “End of Summer”, which was sold on the Aussie artist's website with a limited number of copies.

	Parker actually gave us a dose of “Dracula” earlier this month, using a snippet as the soundbed for a social post revealing the Deadbeat tracklist.


Deadbeat is slated for a global release Oct. 17th, Tame Impala's first through the Sony Music machine, by way of a new deal with Columbia Records, ending a career-long relationship with Modular Recordings and Universal Music.


	Parker will assemble his touring band for a raft of newly-announced pan-European and U.K. concerts next year, starting April 4 at Super Bock Arena in Porto, Portugal and wrapping up May 13 at 3Arena in Dublin, Ireland. The Deadbeat Tour starts in North America, opening with a show Oct. 27, 2025 at Brooklyn's Barclays Center.


	As previously reported, Deadbeat is inspired by the “bush doof” culture of Parker's native Western Australia rave scene.

	











	A message on the pre-order page for the Deadbeat vinyl reckons “Parker sculpts a collection of wickedly potent club-psych explorations as a vehicle for some of his most direct, brain-wormy songwriting to date, recasting Tame Impala as a kind of future primitive rave act in the process.”


Deadbeat will arrive more than half a decade after The Slow Rush, from February 2020, a record that went to No. 1 on Australia's ARIA Chart, and earned career peak positions on the Billboard 200 and Official U.K. Albums Chart UK, both at No. 3. Its predecessor, 2015's Currents, topped the Australian chart and crashed the top 5 in the U.S. (at No. 4) and in the U.K. (No. 3), where Parker and his Tame Impala bandmates collected the Brit Award for best international group.

Only four soundtracks have logged more weeks at No. 1 on the ARIA Chart.

	Lars Brandle



	It's another chart week, another chart double for KPop Demon Hunters (Republic/Universal) in Australia. 


	The soundtrack to the hit animated Netflix film is flying at the top of the ARIA leaderboard for a ninth non-consecutive week. Among soundtracks, ARIA reports, that effort equals the nine week run by the 1997 soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet.


	Since the ARIA Charts were first published in 1983, only four soundtracks have logged more weeks at the top, according to the charts compiler: the Australian cast recording of Jesus Christ Superstar (10 weeks in 1992); plus Titanic (1998), Moulin Rouge (2001) and A Star Is Born (2018), which each led for 11 weeks.

	Meanwhile, the top track from KPop Demon Hunters, “Golden,” reigns over the ARIA Singles Chart for a ninth consecutive week. That's closing in on the all-time mark for a hit from an animated film, currently set at 12 weeks by Pharrell Williams' 2014 single “Happy” from Despicable Me 2.

	











	Back with the ARIA Albums Chart, Ocean Alley's Love Balloon (via Community Music) lifts off for a No. 3 debut, the highest start for any new release on the current frame, published Friday, Sept. 26.




	Recorded in three stints over about three months, Love Balloon is Ocean Alley's fifth studio album, and first recorded with legendary American rock producer Nick DiDia (Bruce Springsteen, Rage Against The Machine).


	With that bright start, Love Balloon is the Sydney indie-rock outfit's third consecutive collection to hit No. 3, following 2020's Lonely Diamond and 2022's Low Altitude Living. Their breakthrough second album from 2018, Chiaroscuro, which housed the triple j Hottest 100 leader “Confidence,” reached No. 11 on the national survey.


Ocean Alley scores silverware as Love Balloon is crowned on the ARIA Top 20 Australian Albums chart, a feat they celebrated Saturday at London's Alexandra Palace, with a headline show for more than 8,000 fans. 


	Also debuting in the top tier is Cardi B‘s sophomore studio album, Am I The Drama? (Atlantic/Warner), new at No. 8. Drama is the followup to the Bronx rapper's 2018, Invasion Of Privacy, which peaked at No. 5.


	Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails bags a top 10 with the soundtrack to TRON: Ares (Interscope/Universal). It's new at No. 10 for the American industrial rock act's sixth top tier effort in Australia, a tally that includes a best of No. 2 for 1999's The Fragile. Daft Punk's soundtrack to TRON: Legacy reached No. 17 in 2011.


Lola Young just misses out on a top 10 berth with I'm Only F—ing Myself (Island/Universal), her third album. It's new at No. 12, for the British singer's first ARIA Albums Chart appearance.


	Further down the list, published late Friday, September 26th, Brisbane band Platonic Sex crack the top 40 with their debut album Face To The Flywire (Orchard). It's new at No. 31.

	Letting loose with a barrage of social media postings Monday morning on subjects ranging from furniture production in North Carolina, the NYC mayoral race and the NFL, Donald Trump is back to attacking Gavin Newsom and promising big tariffs on overseas movies — really big tariffs.


	“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby.' California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit,” Trump wrote Monday on his Truth Social platform. “Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

	











	If you are experiencing déjà vu reading those lines, yes that is almost exactly what the former Apprentice host said back in May.

	Calling runaway production a “national security threat,” Trump's threats of a “100% tariff” earlier this year came after reports that one of his “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, Jon Voight, was a devising a plan to save the entertainment industry. That plan, as of today, has yet to bear fruit.


	While Trump hasn't signed any Executive Order on his latest proposed tariffs as of yet, their implication would bring down a heavy domestic burden on films like newly minted DGA boss Christopher Nolan‘s The Odyssey and pal/Ambassador to Hollywood Mel Gibson‘s upcoming Passion of the Christ sequel — both of which are being filmed outside the US of A.  

	











	The Motion Picture Association today had no comment on Trump's latest post. A White House spokesperson also did not immediately respond to a request to elaborate on the president's latest post.

	After Trump posted his threat in May, industry representatives grappled with how to respond. Within 24 hours, the White House cautioned that the tariffs would be under review by the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump himself said he would host a gathering of Hollywood reps, but that hasn't happened yet. “I'm not looking to hurt the industry,” Trump told reporters.


	About a week later, after tariff talk died down, the studios, unions, Voight and Sylvester Stallone, another of the president's special ambassadors, penned a letter to Trump outlining proposals for expanded production incentives. The letter did not mention tariffs. There have been hopes ever since that movie tariffs would be on the back burner.


	Among studios, there also have been concerns that Trump would try to impose restrictions on any filming overseas, as generous incentives in the UK, Canada and Australia long have lured Hollywood studio tentpole production. Major Hollywood studios have come to depend on those overseas incentives as a way to try to reduce production costs.

	According to the MPA, the industry generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the world, with exports 3.1 times that of imports. The industry produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus.


	There also is the question of how tariffs would work on services, not actual goods. Trump's tariff authority overall is already facing a court challenge, with the Supreme Court reviewing it and hearing oral arguments in November. Movies actually are listed as an exception to presidential authority under the International Emergency Powers Act, which gives the president authority to address threats to national security and the economy.


	Trump's post also follows his attacks on Jimmy Kimmel and other late-night hosts. ABC pulled Kimmel's show following warnings from the president's FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, and announcements from major station groups that they would stop airing the late-night host's show. But Disney returned Kimmel to the air last week, with Nexstar and Sinclair following several days later. Trump blasted Kimmel's return, and threatened the network again.

They're leaving because other countries not only have incentives, but they also have universal healthcare and therefore producers don't have to pay as much in fringe benefits.

If he really wants movies back, Medicare for All!

Great news!

just like everything else he does this will surely work swimmingly and exactly as intended

Better off pushing for a national film and tv tax incentive. We need more opportunity for Americans who can't just go to Canada or UK for filming because they have families, if they're even hired to in the first place. The big name actors and producers need to push for domestic production and put pressure on the studios. Executives will continue only to protect the bottom line and seek the cheapest option.

How about we just pay 100% if the cost of movies?  Will that help?

You need a stick with that carrot.

Trump's executive orders have usurped Congress and turned our system of checks and balances on its head. And if the Supreme Court allows him to continue, he will undo our system of government beyond repair. We are already halfway there.

	J.K. Rowling has published her most fulsome comments yet on her rift with Harry Potter star Emma Watson.


	In a near-700-word post on X/Twitter, the Wizarding World author tore into Watson over her “ignorant” views on transgender rights and published the letter that shattered their relationship.


	Her intervention comes after Watson appeared on a podcast last week, during which the actress said she still has love for Rowling and is grateful for the creation of Hermione Granger, but is upset at the tone and nature of the debate around gender diversity.

					Emma Watson Reveals The ""Bone-Breakingly Painful"" Lesson She Learned About Hollywood After Wrapping 'Harry Potter'		
			








	Rowling said Watson is entitled to her views, but voiced irritation that the Little Women star and Daniel Radcliffe “continue to assume the role of de facto spokespeople for the world I created.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Rowling said the breaking point in their relationship happened in March 2022, when Watson presented a prize at the BAFTA Film Awards and opened her remarks by saying: “I'm here for all of the witches.”


	Rowling said Watson's comment came at a time when “death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak” amid the dispute over trans rights.


	What was not known at the time was that Watson privately wrote to Rowling soon after the BAFTA event to express her concern for the author, according to Rowling.


	“Emma asked someone to pass on a handwritten note from her to me, which contained the single sentence ‘I'm so sorry for what you're going through' (she has my phone number),” Rowling said.

	











	“Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”


	Rowling claimed that Watson's views on transgender rights come from a place of ignorance because her wealth means she does not use “mixed sex” hospital wards or changing rooms, and security guards tail her when she is in public spaces.

I'm seeing quite a bit of comment about this, so I want to make a couple of points.I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created. The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was twenty-one for what opinions I should… https://t.co/c0pz19P7jc


	“Like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is,” Rowling said. 


	“I wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous. I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women's rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges.”


	She continued: “The greatest irony here is that, had Emma not decided in her most recent interview to declare that she loves and treasures me – a change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was – I might never have been this honest.”


	“Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother. Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public – but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.”

JK for prime minister.

Rowling speaks of ignorance yet sees trans-women as predators looking to sneak into changing rooms to assault women.

All of the cowardly comments come from anonymous writers.

JK Rowling demonstrates more courage in a week than most people do in a lifetime.

There's nothing courageous about making sure the most marginalised segment of the population remains so.

Yeah, but what has her past pain and trauma to do with trans people? She never explained that. Just an old woman shouting at the clouds.

I've never read any of J.K. Rowling's books and, after her tirades, I have no motivation to do so.  Her personal attacks on Emma Watson sound very familiar to this American.  When the “other side” doesn't agree with my viewpoint, they resort to personal ambushes.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	The creator of AI actress Tilly Norwood has put out a statement following a fierce backlash in response to news over the weekend that talent agents were looking to sign the AI-generated character.


	Tilly Norwood is the creation of actress, comedian and technologist Eline Van der Velden, CEO of AI-focused production company Particle 6, who has also just launched AI talent studio Xicoia.


	“To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work – a piece of art. Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity,” Van der Velden wrote in a statement made available to Deadline and posted on social networks.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a new tool, a new paintbrush. Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories. I'm an actor myself, and nothing – certainly not an AI character – can take away the craft or joy of human performance,” she continued. 


RELATED: Eline Van Der Velden, Founder Of AI Indie Particle6, Launches AI Talent Studio Xicoia For “Hyperreal Digital Stars”


	“Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role, or shaping a performance. It takes time, skill, and iteration to bring such a character to life. She represents experimentation, not substitution. Much of my work has always been about holding up a mirror to society through satire, and this is no different.”

	











	Van der Velden soft-launched Norwood earlier this year, with accounts on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, ahead of officially announcing the creation of Xicoia last week.

A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)


	The character has been slowly building a following, but the revelation in a panel at the film industry-focused Zurich Summit over the weekend that talent agents were circling Norwood with the intention of signing the character as a client has sparked fierce debate.


Melissa Barrera, Kiersey Clemons and Toni Collette are among a raft of actors to have expressed their displeasure at the development on the social networks, with some even suggesting a boycott of agencies that work with AI talent. 


	Van der Velden suggested in her statement that AI characters should not be compared directly with human actors.“AI characters should be judged as part of their own genre, on their own merits… Each form of art has its place, and each can be valued for what it uniquely brings,” she wrote.


	“I hope we can welcome AI as part of the wider artistic family; one more way to express ourselves, alongside theatre, film, painting, music, and countless others. When we celebrate all forms of creativity, we open doors to new voices, new stories, and new ways of connecting with each other.”

Eline van der Velden is either disingenuous or painfully naive. Just how exactly does she THINK this very human-looking “piece of digital art” will be used? How her technology will be built upon? Why does “it” need an agent? OF COURSE IT WILL REPLACE HUMAN BEINGS.

This “actress” wasn't designed to look like a puppet or a cartoon. She was designed to look human. The design was intentional. It looks exactly like a human female. Eline is seriously trying to gloss over the fact that this creation is in no way going to disrupt the industry. Why pay actors when there's AI? Actor is unhappy? Replace with them with AI. Union issues? AI will solve the problem. No matter what the creators say, several aspects of AI were designed to eliminate humans.

I was at the conference, and I must confess that, apart from the scariness of the newest tech, I was appalled by the lack understanding for the impact that this will have by the people developing (and benefitting) from them. The presentations we characterized by constant “optimism” and statements like “Everyone loves this!”, “It's going to be okay!” – all smiles, no self-criticism. Specifically during the Tilly Norwood presentation, Van der Velden actually said “Now we have given her a soul!” with a big smile. It was unsettling.

AI has been coming for jobs for years.  Actors aren't special.

You're right; they shouldn't take ANYONE's job.

Boycott the agencies…. sure. And I still can't over the fact that Bob Dylan uses the electric guitar.

Hilarious that you use one of our greatest original human artists to make your idiotic point. This isn't about being anti-tech.

She's either being naive or lying through her teeth

Comcast is elevating Mike Cavanagh to Co-CEO, installing him alongside Brian Roberts in a shared setup to start in January.


	After joining the NBCUniversal parent in 2015 as CFO, Cavanagh was subsequently elevated to President. 


	Roberts, 66, is the son of the company's late founder, Ralph Roberts. He will continue as chairman of the board when the Co-CEO roles begin in January, with Cavanagh being added to the board.


	While having two co-equal CEOs remains unusual in corporate America, Netflix has been a notable example of the structure working out well. Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters have been Co-CEOs there since 2023, presiding over a period of share price growth and continued dominance in streaming despite initial skepticism about the dual arrangement.

	











	“Mike has proven himself to be a trusted and collaborative leader,”  Roberts said in a press release. “He is the ideal person to help lead Comcast as we manage the pivot we are making to drive growth across the company. Mike and I work seamlessly together, and I am thrilled to be partnering with him as Co-CEO and with the rest of our talented management team, for years to come.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Cavanagh had worked in financial services for two decades prior to joining Comcast. He was Co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's corporate and investment bank and also was the main company's CFO for six years, helping steer it through the financial crisis of the late 2000s.


	At Comcast, he took on oversight of NBCU after Jeff Shell left the company amid accusations of an improper relationship with a female colleague. Last year, Cavanagh also led the process of spinning off most of NBCU's cable network portfolio into a new stand-alone entity, Versant. Like its traditional media peers, Comcast is navigating through a period of cord-cutting, balancing declining but still revenue-producing video subscribers with growth in streaming.


	“Comcast is a special company with exceptional businesses and an incredible team. It is an honor to work with Brian and the entire Comcast NBCUniversal leadership team during this exciting and transformative time in our industry,” Cavanagh said.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: UK sales firm Architect has launched worldwide sales ahead of next month's AFM on Dogs of War, the latest creature horror set within writer-director Kiah Roache-Turner's wartime world.


Dogs of War, inspired by real events, plunges a crack squad of British commandos into a Nazi-infested forest, in the depths of winter on the Eastern Front during WWII. Tasked with delivering a vital secret weapon to their allies, the soldiers soon discover that what lurks in the forest is far more terrifying than their German foe. Forming an uneasy alliance with their sworn enemy, and joining forces with legendary sniper Lady Death, survival quickly becomes the only victory for the embattled soldiers. Above is first artwork from the project.

			Watch on Deadline		







	Producers are Blake Northfield and Michelle Krumm for Bronte Studios (Beast of War). Bronte will also handle ANZ and North American sales. Executive producers include Todd Brown, and Calum Gray and Max Pirkis for Architect.


	The film's visual effects team will be led by Model Farm (The Equalizer 3), tasked with bringing to life Dogs' beasts, and Resin (MaXXXine).


	The launch comes ahead of the worldwide release, led by Well Go in the U.S. on 10th October, of Roache-Turner's Beast of War.


	Roache-Turner's regular HODs return, including cinematographer Mark Wareham (Boy Swallows Universe), costume designer Tracey Rose Sparke, and production designer Esther Rosenberg. Double Academy Award nominee David Hirschfelder (Elizabeth) is the composer.


	Roache-Turner said: “With Dogs Of War, I wanted to explore a different corner of WWII storytelling, bringing together real historical figures and high-concept genre elements. I have always been fascinated with crack sniper Lady Death and her story which has become such a mythical part of WWII folklore. I know that her desperate fight to protect her country more than 80 years ago has a contemporary resonance that today's audiences will respond to.”

	











	“Kiah Roache-Turner is a part of the Bronte DNA. He's an extraordinary filmmaker and we're thrilled to be teaming up once again” added Northfield and Krumm. “This film is a bold, adrenaline-filled fusion of war story, myth, and survival horror that we believe audiences worldwide will connect with.”


	Architect's Gray said: “We've keenly tracked Kiah's evolution as a filmmaker and are delighted to represent Dogs of War for him and Bronte Studios. Kiah's creature work, on both Sting and Beast of War, is hugely impressive and he is an immersive world-builder in the truest sense. A genre director who cares about connecting audiences to real, authentic characters…but then delights in picking them off one by one!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Task finds its center as a show about fatherhood","https://www.avclub.com/task-recap-season-1-episode-4-all-roads","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 03:05:00 GMT","

After three weeks of enjoying Task but also struggling to wrap my mind around its big-picture structure, everything suddenly snapped into focus this week. This isn't a show about criminals vs. the law; it's a show about three fathers desperately trying to hold their metaphorical and literal families together. 

Most obviously, there's Mark Ruffalo's Agent Tom Brandis, the grieving father of Sara, Emily, and Ethan, who's also a metaphorical father to a task force of young agents. Then there's Tom Pelphrey's trash-collector-turned-burglar Robbie Prendergrast, who doesn't just have two kids of his own but imagines himself as the protective patriarch of an eclectic found family unit who will forge a new life together in Canada. And, finally, there's Jamie McShane's Perry, a national leader of the Dark Hearts motorcycle gang who sees chapter president Jayson as his surrogate son. 

Locking into Perry as the main POV character for the Dark Hearts side of the show makes a world of difference when it comes to Task feeling more balanced and less scattered. This is now much more clearly a show about a trio of men trying to cling to their old-school sense of authority and an ensemble of younger characters caught up in their detached, chaotic, and sometimes volatile wake. 

That theme really comes to the forefront in the show's first flashback to Robbie's brother Billy (Jack Kesy). Task has suggested Billy was a beloved figure among his friends and family, and here we finally get to see why. On a family day out at the lake, Billy is an absolute force of confidence, affirmation, and joy for those around him. He's the life of the party, but he also gives the sort of calm, sage advice you want from an older brother—telling Robbie it's better to let his marriage go rather than cling to a dying partnership. He's the sort of guy who knows just what to say and how to say it, giving his brother a bit of tough love advice while also softening the blow with a dick joke and a heartfelt compliment. 

We know, of course, that Billy's wisdom has its limits. He's still continuing to see Eryn rather than ending their affair—something we know will lead to his brutal death. Yet he's so charismatic and assured, you get why Robbie keeps trying to emulate him with wise platitudes, grand paternal gestures, and insane plans to smuggle his family off the grid. Robbie thinks that if he approaches the world with enough confidence, nothing will ever go wrong. By the end of this episode, however, his daughter Harper is terrified, his niece Maeve is furious at him, his best friend Cliff is dead, and he's been sort-of caught on film with sweet, kidnapped Sam. It turns out “fake it until you make it” isn't always such great advice after all. 

While Ruffalo takes a bit of a backseat after getting more of a showcase last week, we understand Tom's failings as a father through a peek into his daughter Emily's life. This week, she gets drunk with some co-workers and comes home throwing up, which isn't all that crazy on the scale of rebellious teen behavior. (She even finds a gem of a protector in the sweet, nerdy Leo.) But as we see during one of her therapy sessions, Emily is processing so much more than teens her age usually have to grapple with.

It's not just the impossible reality that her brother murdered their mom. It's the way Emily's experience as an adoptee colors her life too. Like so many adopted kids, Emily feels an immense social pressure to be “grateful” that her parents “gave her a second chance,” which leaves little room for the complex array of emotions kids so often feel towards their parents. Sara, for instance, was so upset with the way her parents handled Ethan's mental-health struggles that she didn't speak to her mom for a full two years before her death. But how would the world judge Emily if she were to draw such an intense boundary rather than emphasizing how “lucky” she feels to be adopted by a loving couple?

The more details we learn about the Brandis family tragedy, the more brutal it becomes. And poor Emily is carrying more than her fair share of the burden. While Tom has generally been quite sweet and supportive of his younger daughter these past few episodes, it's also clear he has no idea of the depth of her feelings or the complications of her lived experience either. He's so caught up in his own pain that he's not really making space for hers. Like Robbie trying to cheer up Harper with a sweet at-home father/daughter dance, Tom's various attempts to look after Emily have felt like a band-aid to a bullet hole.  

With Robbie as a manic dad and Tom as a passive one, that leaves Perry as the show's take on an abusive father figure. As Perry's investigation into the Dark Hearts' mole leads him to the truth about Billy's death, he uses violence to regain a sense of control over his “children.” He beats Jayson with a chain when he finds out why he actually killed Billy. And he shoves Eryn into a chair while trying to suss out whether she helped organize the burglaries as a way to get Jayson out of her life.  

Yet most horrifying of all is the way Perry's physical abuse is entangled with a sense of paternal protectiveness. He offers to help Eryn leave Jayson, if that's what she wants. And he's desperate to get the drugs back so that Jayson isn't killed by the Dark Hearts mother club. Like many an abusive parent, there are layers of emotional complexity to the way Perry operates. And the fallout of his abusive “parenting” style is carried on when Jayson runs Cliff off the road, beats him to a pulp, and—in a truly terrifying moment—suffocates him with a roll of plastic wrap. It's a brutal turning point for the halfway mark of the season. 

Given how much this episode manages to make Perry feel like a vital part of the show's thematic world, I'm hoping for something similarly transformative from the task-force side of the series. Right now, Lizzie, Aleah, and Grasso are there to help move the FBI plot forward and provide some lighter comedic moments. But they don't feel hugely thematically connected to everything else going on. Loosely, they're another set of “kids” for Tom to look after, but the show hasn't really emphasized that mentor/mentee relationship.  

In fact, now that the task-force trio is so tied up in the “who's the mole?” mystery, it's hard to know whether to invest in its scenes as slice-of-life character studies or red-herring clues. Aleah is a loner, Lizzie is longing for connection and purpose, and Grasso is an earnest people pleaser. But are those their genuine personalities or acts they're putting on? 

Personally, I've been confused about Grasso's religious background since episode two, where he explained that he grew up in a devout Catholic household but then asked why anyone would need a priest at a mass-casualty event. (Even if you don't like the religion yourself, you would surely understand the concept, right?) That car convo made it sound like Grasso had turned away from Catholicism altogether, but here we see him wearing a (non-crucifix) cross necklace as he refuses to sleep with Lizzie in her “marriage bed.” There's definitely something specific lingering in his religious background. But is that a thematic character beat or a clue that he's lying about his identity? Is the writing clunky or do we just not know the big picture yet? 

It's hard to say. Last week, I suspected Tom's boss Kathleen McGinty would turn out to be the mole, but this episode makes her overtly suspicious in a way that now makes me think it's not her (or at least not her working alone). We also get our biggest sabotage yet, as the burner phone the FBI plans to use to entrap Cliff somehow winds up in the hands of the Dark Hearts, who run Cliff off the road before kidnapping and murdering him. Aleah is the one who holds up the burner at the opening briefing, while Grasso is the one handling it at the park sting operation. Lizzie, meanwhile, apparently had her own statie vetting process before joining the task force, which casts suspicion on her too. 

If I had to vote, I'd say Grasso and Kathleen are working together in some capacity—either as the mole or potentially to flush out the mole. (They had a very pointed “we don't know each other” intro last week.) But, honestly, I'd much rather just get to know these characters as people rather than keep them opaque for the sake of mystery. Task is at its best when it's a character drama first and an FBI crime procedural second. “All Roads” helps bring the Dark Hearts side of the show into that character-driven place. Hopefully the task force can get the same treatment.

Before his death in August at the age of 87, actor Terence Stamp completed his scenes for a sequel to the 1994 film The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert. Reprising his role as the transgender nightclub performer Bernadette, Stamp went through “grueling sessions” to complete the film, but had “the time of his life,” director Stephan Elliott told Deadline. Elliott says that “it took decades to find a plot.” It also took decades for Stamp to agree to make the film. For years, the actor “absolutely refused.” Still, Elliott and the original core cast, including Stamp, Hugo Weaving, and Guy Pearce, agreed to make the sequel “just before COVID.” But as other films began using CGI to bring actors back from the dead, Stamp worried that “a digital clone of himself” would get the part if they didn't start filming. “With the blessing of him and his family, Guy, Hugo, and the financiers, I decided to pre-shoot all the Bernadette scenes.”

“Terence wasn't getting any younger, and that's a fact he loved to shove down our throats almost every day,” Elliott said. “What Terence's character, Bernadette, was going to look like at 88, it took a lot of trial and error. So the clock clicked on, and then when the AI wars broke out, Terence was indignant that he didn't want a digital clone of himself playing Bernadette.” Once it comes time to complete the film, Elliott will utilize “CGI face replacement” technology. “I'm going to have to have an actor playing Terence Stamp. I mean, it is scary. We're all scared, of course.”

“He exists as Bernadette, and we've just got to work out how to make it work. And the question is, as I said earlier, does anyone want to see this film? And part of me thinks that they would. Now that he's put the effort in, and basically, he gave the last months of his life to this. I think people want to see it. It's a tough one. It's a real tough one.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","EA goes private in record-breaking buyout","https://www.avclub.com/electronic-arts-buyout-ea-jared-kushner","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:29:00 GMT","

After a few days of rumblings within the industry, major game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) has officially announced that it's being acquired for $55 billion. The deal, which ranks as the largest ever leveraged buyout according to Variety, involves a group of investors including private-equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. The final figure is even bigger than earlier reports, which valued the deal around $50 billion based on EA's current market value. 

EA is best known for sports games like Madden, FC (rebranded from FIFA), and Skate. It will also release Battlefield 6 early next month. Despite its new ownership, some things will remain the same. The company will still be headquartered in California, with current CEO Andrew Wilson retaining his post. “Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” Wilson said in a statement, per Variety. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”

The deal is expected to close by June 2026 (the end of the first quarter of EA's fiscal year), pending approval from all the usual regulatory bodies. EA and its consortium of investors likely won't have to jump through the same sort of hoops as, say, Paramount and Skydance, however. As our colleagues at Endless Mode point out, Donald Trump has ties with both Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners (Kushner is his son-in-law) and the Saudi government, which has been pushing further into both the gaming and sports industries in recent years. The deal will be funded by a combination of capital from each of the investors, as well as a roll-over of the Saudi Public Investment Fund's prior stake in the company.

This article features plot details of One Battle After Another.

There isn't much backstory for Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn), the scowling face of white nationalism in Paul Thomas Anderson‘s One Battle After Another. There doesn't need to be. When French 75 revolutionary Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) gets the drop on him, she already knows his whole deal. She instinctively understands that she can force the overseer of the Los Angeles migrant detention center into having an erection while taken captive, adding insult to injury as her team frees his prisoners. The irony serves the film‘s underlying view of white supremacy: To claim racial purity is to reject your humanity. But as persistent as that hate is, humanity keeps fighting. Their meeting is the starter pistol for a film about the pervasiveness and hypocrisy of white supremacy, and the endless fight to rid society of it.

At its core, One Battle After Another is about one racist's inability to accept his sexual desires and his decision to make that everyone else's problem. His coercive relationship with Perfidia, which allows him to act on his feelings, ends with an attempt to subjugate her further. This sets the whole plot in motion. He forces her to rat out her comrades and pushes her into witness protection, where she can be safely hidden as his dirty little secret. After Perfidia flees from Lockjaw—a more desperate flight than she'd previously taken from her lover Bob (Leonardo DiCaprio) and their daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti)—the colonel gives his life meaning by applying to the Christmas Adventurers Club, the white nationalist organization apparently at the center of American power. However, if they were to find out that Willa was actually Lockjaw's child, it would disqualify him from membership. To be accepted, he must hide his transgression by any means necessary. His insecurity becomes a town's terror. 

White supremacy invades every element of One Battle After Another through systems of surveillance, enforcement, and resistance. Part of that reveals itself in Bob, née Ghetto Pat, who successfully goes into paranoid hiding after Perfidia's betrayal. But white supremacy has long had its eye on Bob, whether he knows it or not. In their only meeting, Lockjaw accosts Bob in the supermarket, where the new father is picking up diapers. “You like Black girls?” Lockjaw asks. “I love 'em.” The surprise interaction reflects the pervasiveness and hypocrisy of Lockjaw's ideology. He's resentful and jealous of Bob while also reminding him that he's being watched—if Lockjaw can't have Perfidia, he can at least flex his power over Bob. But it's also a confession. Because of this power imbalance, it's the only time in the film that Lockjaw can express what he actually wants to someone. 

What Lockjaw doesn't get is that he's just another mark, a pawn, for the Christmas Adventurers Club. He even walks like a strung-up marionette. They will never accept him, despite his willingness to terrorize non-white communities. Before he can even give Willa a DNA test, the shadowy admissions council plans on tossing him into the incinerator. That he debases himself further for their approval—surviving their assassination attempt in order to spend a few minutes in the crappy corner office of his dreams before the nerve gas begins to flood in—shows how little solidarity exists at the North Pole. It's all in-fighting, purity tests, and self-loathing. That's the truth about white supremacy: No one will ever be white enough for the people at the top. Like so many neo-Nazi foot soldiers, white nationalist mouthpieces, and violent ICE agents, Lockjaw is a means to an end for someone in power. Nothing more. 

But on the other side of this Battle, resistance springs eternal. For pretty much everyone other than Bob, white supremacy isn't something they can hide from. They've been living around it for so long that resisting its threats has become a casual and instinctive response. When a radio operator is snatched from his post, a pair of neighborhood kids jump on the mic to air an emergency transmission. When Bob needs to escape from Lockjaw's military forces, invading the sanctuary city of Baktan Cross, his daughter's martial arts sensei, Sergio St. Carlos (Benicio del Toro), cracks a Modelo and lends him a hand, despite having a “Harriet Tubman thing going on” with the rest of the town's immigrant community. Supported by an unbothered and enthusiastic network of skaters and nurses, Sergio fends off the military and shepherds Bob out of town without breaking a sweat. Sergio's network shows the forces organically formed to stop white supremacy, the underfunded community-building required to prevent the state from flattening us into homogeneity. Bob has always aligned himself with the opposition, and that's why he gets the happy ending—one where he can learn to ease his paranoia and where Willa can join the cause to fight the next battle.

Anderson does all this without making it explicit to the contemporary political landscape. There are no red baseball caps. No messages scrawled on bullets or warnings about online radicalization. This isn't adapted from a doomscroll. Rather, he structures the fight against white supremacy like it's Terminator 2: Two men in pursuit of the next generation, a necessary and humanistic battle for the future that we're all already fighting.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Russell Crowe Turns Heads with His Slimmed-Down Look [Photos]","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/russell-crowe-slimmed-down-look-photos/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:21:44 GMT","

Russell Crowe is one of the most beloved actors in Hollywood, thanks to roles in films such as “Gladiator.” Now, ahead of his new movie, “Nuremberg,” he not only received a lifetime achievement award, but he showed off his slimmed-down physique in the process. 

Crowe's “Nuremberg” is set to hit movie theaters on November 7. James Vanderbilt directed the movie, and it's being released in the US and Canada by Sony Pictures Classics. It also stars Rami Malek and Michael Shannon. 

Crowe attended the Zurich Film Festival on September 27. His appearance was not only for the screening of his new movie, but the 61-year-old actor also took home the Golden Eye Award for Lifetime Achievement. 

Crowe wore a formal navy blue suit at the event. He styled it with a green tie, a white shirt, and had his hair styled to the back. He seemed gracious as he walked onto the stage to give his speech and waved at the crowd. 

Crowe also walked the red carpet for the film festival. These photos show the actor in more casual attire as he greeted fans and even signed autographs. In them, he's wearing what appears to be a light blue polo-style shirt and a dark blue jacket. He completed his outfit with a pair of sunglasses. 

The “Nuremberg” also took the time to pose for photos with people at the event. Additional pictures show Crowe discussing the movie as well as posing with other celebrities on the red carpet for the film festival. He first showed off his dramatic weight loss at Wimbledon in July 2025. 

Nuremberg is a movie about the 1945 trials of the same name. In the film, a psychiatrist, played by Malek, must determine if Hermann Göring, played by Crowe, is fit to stand trial over war crimes. Crowe opened up to Deadline about accepting the role. 

He said, “For the most part, the things that attract me are the things that terrify me. I responded to the script straight away, but in a funny way, I was also emotionally exhausted by it. How would you even attempt to play that guy? When that kind of question comes up, that's usually what I'm attracted to.”

Crowe added, “It's also why you haven't seen me do 15 variations on Gladiator. And to this day, I still haven't done a sequel, which I consider a rare badge of honor.”

In the most beautiful celebration of love, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco got married in Santa Barbara, California, on September 27. It was one of the biggest celebrity events of this year, and loved ones rallied around the pair.

“There was so much love in the room,” a source told People of Blanco and Gomez's wedding. “At the reception, everyone was letting loose and celebrating them well into the night. The vibe was so much fun.”

Kieran Culkin's biggest win may not be onstage but at home, as he and Jazz Charton get ready for their third child. Culkin's wish has come true. More than a year after the “Succession” star melted hearts at the 2024 Emmys by asking his wife, Jazz Charton, for more kids, the couple revealed they are now expecting their third child.

The pair stepped out in New York City on Sunday, September 28, for the opening night of “Waiting for Godot,” where Charton, 37, proudly debuted her baby bump. Culkin, 42, couldn't hide his joy, smiling as he lovingly placed his hand on her belly for photos.

Culkin and Charton are already parents to their daughter, Kinsey Sioux, 6, and son, Wilder Wolf, 4. The couple looked overjoyed as they celebrated the milestone together in New York.

The reveal comes after Culkin reminded his wife of her promise to expand their family earlier this year. 

At the Academy Awards in March 2025, where he won his first Oscar for “A Real Pain,” he gently joked from the stage about their ongoing “deal.”

Culkin first made headlines in January 2024 when he used his Emmys acceptance speech for “Succession” to ask Charton for more kids. Fighting back tears, he thanked his mother and then turned to his wife.

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

“[Jazz] said, ‘I will give you four [children] when you win an Oscar,'” Culkin told the audience at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. 

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

“No pressure. I love you. I'm really sorry I did this again,” he added with a laugh, looking directly at his wife, who smiled from her seat. 

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

“And let's get cracking on those kids. What do you say?”

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

Culkin later admitted he had been asking Charton about having more children for years. “Jazz said, ‘Maybe if you win the Emmy,'” he recalled. “I didn't bring it up for months, and then when I won the Globe, I said, ‘Do you remember what you said?' And she was like, ‘What? No. What did I say?'”

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

He joked that Charton spent the week before the Emmys “being nervous” as she remembered their playful promise. When asked if he might name the baby after one of his trophies, Culkin laughed: “I wouldn't name it Emmy, or whatever other cute little thing.”

A post shared by ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴄʜᴀʀᴛᴏɴ (@jazzcharton)

Now, with another little one on the way, Culkin and Charton's story feels like a love letter built on humor, patience, and the joy of family.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Snoop Dogg Makes Major Announcement With NBC Sports: ‘Guess Who's Back?'","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/snoop-dogg-winter-olympics-announcement/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:21:30 GMT","

When Snoop Dogg wraps up season 28 of “The Voice,” he won't have much downtime before his next big assignment with NBC. On September 28, 2025, the network revealed the legendary rapper will head to Cortina, Italy, to cover the 2026 Winter Olympics. 

Snoop's commentary was so popular during the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, he will team up again with NBC Olympics host Mike Tirico, providing primetime viewers in the U.S. with “his wintry take on what's happening in northern Italy,” per NBC Sports. 

In a 15-second promo that aired during NBC's coverage of the NFL matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers, Snoop stood on a snowy mountaintop, turned to the TV audience and exclaimed, “Guess who's back!?” 

Later in the “Sunday Night Football” broadcast, Tirico and Cris Collinsworth watched an amusing video message from Snoop, taken as he rode in a limo decked out with twinkling lights. 

“Tirico, it's your boy, big Snoop Dogg,” he said. “Dynamic duo. Remember me? I'll be waiting on you in Milan, Cortina, so we can get this Winter Olympics poppin'. You know how we do it. In the meantime, in between time, hold it down till I get with you.”

Laughing, Tirico said, “I hear you! Alright, so Snoop is coming back to Italy” and then he turned to Collinsworth and asked, “How come you don't roll as cool as Snoop?”

Collinsworth smirked, “I wish I had one one-millionth of that (cool factor) — I would take that!” 

A post shared by The Olympic Games (@olympics)

NBC Sports' announcement about Snoop's addition to its team of Olympics correspondents said, “Similar to Paris, he'll explore the region's iconic landmarks and culture, attend Olympic competitions, and cheer alongside the athletes, their friends, and families.”

He'll bring back his “Snoop's Greatest Hits” segment, in which he joins Tirico on the primetime set “to riff on the day's biggest stories and most unforgettable moments with his unmistakable rhythm and style,” the announcement said. 

Viewers couldn't get enough of Snoop during the Paris Olympics, as he carried the Olympic flame, got to know and cheer on many of the American athletes, and attended some of the biggest events, including watching equestrian at the Palace of Versailles with his very proper pal, Martha Stewart. 

In a statement about the upcoming games, Snoop said, “The D O double G will be on the scene, and I am looking forward to celebrating with the athletes and their families. The Olympics is the biggest stage in the world and as everyone knows, I am about sports, bringing people together, and unifying while bringing the fun. I'll be bringing my puffy jackets, snow pants, goggles, skates (and will definitely be iced out).”

Right after Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Games will begin on February 6 at the most famous soccer stadium in Italy — the San Siro. The opening ceremony will air on NBC beginning at noon Eastern time that day, with primetime coverage kicking off at 8 p.m. Eastern time on both NBC and Peacock. 

Once the Opening Ceremony is over, athletes from around the world will compete in a record 116 medal events in 16 sports across 16 days, NBC said. 

But before Snoop focuses his energy on covering the Olympics, he has another job to do: coaching his season 28 team on “The Voice.” The next Blind Auditions air on September 29 and 30, with the season lasting through mid-December.

The Tom Cruise-approved action star has two professional writing credits to his name — co-writer Richard Linklater's 2023 film “Hit Man” and co-creator Michael Waldron's 2025 series “Chad Powers” — and both require Powell, a man once described on this very site as “plainly one of the most handsome and charismatic human beings on planet Earth,” to disguise himself as a goofy nobody. For all the debate over the state of movie stardom, which often centers discussion around Powell's ticket-selling muscles, it's clear, at least, he's not a nobody. He's a charming bad boy. A versatile beefcake. A cerebral bro (cerebro? no, that's something else) who can showcase his style on the cover of GQ in a half-lifted tank and pop two buttons too many for the suits who subscribe to The Hollywood Reporter.

“Hit Man,” at least, gives Powell ample opportunity to flex his range. As Gary, a nerdy professor pretending to be an assassin-for-hire in order to help the police expose real people's murder plots, each new “job” requires a new personality, and Powell's transformations provide plenty of hoots and hollers, a dash of heat, and a dab of human drama. But Chad Powers — the puffy-faced hillbilly persona assumed by disgraced quarterback Russ Holliday so he can reenter college football — actively gets in the way of “Chad Powers.” He's all disguise and no character, stranding Hulu‘s half-hour sports comedy in an implausible premise it doesn't know how to manage. Rather than bring out Powell's good side(s), “Chad Powers” gets stuck in the same identity crisis as its subject.

Before Chad, there was Russ. And Russ is an asshole. He drives a Cybertruck. He's got “buddies in crypto.” He believes conspiracy theories, most notably that Osama bin Laden is still alive. All of these personality traits are introduced within the first hour of “Chad Powers,” and while they're largely played for jokes, they also establish just how deep a moral hole ol' Russ has to climb out of by pretending to be someone else — someone nice or, at least, someone better.

You see, Russ hasn't recovered from his spectacular collapse eight years earlier. As the star quarterback of the Oregon Ducks, he led his team to the national championship and was inches away from winning it when he dropped the ball on the 1-yard-line. Just like that, everything changed. He went from athletic icon to laughing stock, from a first-round NFL draft pick with sponsorship deals to a former “Masked Singer” contestant who's too toxic for the XFL.

He didn't have to crash and burn quite so garishly, but Russ didn't handle his fall from grace with any, well, grace. The second he loses the big game, a young fan in a wheelchair shouts to Russ, “You're still my favorite player.” But Russ is too wrapped up in his own failure to recognize an outstretched arm as anything but an annoyance, and his reaction is ugly enough to “haunt him … for the rest of his life.”

 










Or that's what play-by-play announcer Chris Fowler says on TV, and his pointed prophecy is proven out by the disastrous decisions Russ makes in the present. Watching videos on his phone while driving through Los Angeles, he sees South Georgia University is holding open tryouts for their football team. Just then, he pulls up to the Fox lot, where he's supposed to drop off a set of prosthetics his father (Toby Huss) made for the new Michael Bay movie. But as Stephen A. Smith complains about open try-outs, shouting, “This isn't a movie,” Russ looks up and sees the “Mrs. Doubtfire” poster hanging above the studio entrance. He thinks for a second. An idea sparks. Then he looks directly into the camera… and smiles.

From that point on, any inkling that the TV show based on an Eli Manning sketch is meant to have both cleated feet rooted in reality vanishes. The premise is just there to set up jokes about Chad Powers' weird looks and absurd backstory (Russ likes to improvise answers, despite being terrible at it), while establishing a unique starting point for a conventional sports redemption story. Russ doesn't know who he is without football (other than a big ol' jerk), so maybe walking a football field in someone else's shoes will help him figure it out.

 










…except Chad's jokes are redundant and shallow, his prosthetics are an impediment to a good time, and the premise refuses to get out of its own way. First, the jokes: Russ is instinctually hesitant to talk about himself, which makes sense considering the more he says about Chad, the more opportunities there are for him to get caught in a lie. But establishing your lead funnyman as someone who just shuts up and stares blankly ahead isn't a recipe for sustainable comedy. He'll occasionally mumble made-up excuses, but those are too out-there to laugh at, and his coaches and teammates' confused conclusions aren't all that humorous either (especially when they involve the word “retard,” which continues its frustrating cultural comeback). 

As a commentary on how much leeway athletes are given in America, Chad's inability to string sentences together is disturbingly accurate, but “Chad Powers” isn't trying to make a point. It's trying to be funny, and the laughs only come elsewhere. Namely, they stem from Steve Zahn as Chad's oft-bewildered head coach, Clayne Crawford as Chad's bluntly entitled quarterbacks coach, and Frankie A. Rodriguez as Chad's unpaid assistant, roommate, and team mascot, Danny.

The colorful supporting cast gels well enough, taking pressure off Chad to score laughs and lending the series a “Ted Lasso” niceness. (Team-building through sports! Huzzah!) But a lot of the jokes are too crass to fit the forced inspirational tone, let alone a series about a douchebag learning to be less douchey. Plus, at least one cast member's side plot feels too much like a minefield. Perry Mattfeld plays Ricky, a talented assistant coach who's routinely overlooked because she's a) the coach's daughter and b) a woman. But Ricky also provides ample reasons of her own to negate moving up the ranks, as she forms a “will they, won't they” romance with Chad despite their perceived age-gap and very real coach-player dynamic.

 










In a show that so clearly wants you to just go along with its story, these kind of emotional (st)ick-ing points act as road blocks toward relaxed fun. There are too many unanswered questions — how is Chad passing his classes? does he even go? — and too many missed opportunities. (The cold opens are… rough.) But worst of all, “Chad Powers” manages to waste Glen Powell. Saddled with an uninteresting jerk half the time and a muzzled non-entity the other half, there's only a handful of moments in the first six episodes where Powell's star power shines through. That the majority of them arrive in the later episodes may be a sign for optimism, but “Chad Powers” has a lot more work to do if it's ever going to become its best self. 

“Chad Powers” premieres Tuesday, September 30 on Hulu. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on October 28.

President Trump is once again threatening to impose tariffs on film productions outside the United States, he shared on the Truth Social platform Monday morning.

“Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby,'” the President wrote. “California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit! Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President DJT”

Trump made a similar announcement back on May 4, in which he proposed 100% tariffs on all movies made outside the U.S., deeming the increased move of productions abroad a “national security threat” and an effort to undermine American businesses. It's not clear what reactivated the threat, though moments later on the same Truth Social platform, he motioned toward “substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States.” When Trump threatened tariffs this past Spring, the White House shortly after walked back his remarks.

Though filmmaking is increasingly moving overseas at an alarming speed and to places like Hungary, which offer large tax credits, tariffs such as these would likely only encourage more decampment of production, as IndieWire previously reported. There remains the question of can Trump even do this? How do you tax something that exists as a digital file, or an idea, and is not a physical object or product, and how will it be enforced? 

There's also the even simpler question of… how do you shoot in the United States to depict a foreign country when your American-made movie isn't actually set here or calls for a sequence shot abroad?

Last time around, Trump's threat against the film industry didn't amount to much. Also earlier this year, Governor Newsom (whom Trump is referring to here) signed a $750 million tax credit for film and TV made in California to help keep productions in the United States. He also suggested to Trump collaborating on a national federal incentive that would offer similar benefits, though no formal proposal has occurred.

George Clooney is an actor approaching the end of his tether in Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly.” That's because he is in fact playing an actor, who here is Hollywood-famous and adored, but with a career on the line after a bad run-in with a former acting school colleague (Billy Crudup) and a strained relationship with his daughter (Grace Edwards). The latest movie from the “Marriage Story” and “The Squid and the Whale” director opens in theaters from Netflix on November 14 before streaming December 5. Watch the trailer below.

“Jay Kelly,” which Baumbach co-wrote with Emily Mortimer, opens with a oner worthy of Robert Altman's “The Player,” inviting us onto a movie set as lights descend, cameras swirl in, and Jay (Clooney) is giving another performance that he feels he's phoning in. He's got a manager who's worried about Jay's career (played by Adam Sandler), a publicist who's spinning out (played by “Marriage Story” Oscar winner Laura Dern), and a bunch of other people whose whole lives are on the line because of him and dependent on him.

Jay decides to take all of them with him on a European trip in pursuit of his daughter, who's headed to a jazz festival, as the film turns into a screwball set piece on a train. Meanwhile, Jay is up for a career-acheivement award at a festival in Tuscany.

Clooney and Sandler are both expected to receive Oscar nominations for their performances, with the narrative of Sandler's overdueness merging with his deeply felt turn, and as a previous collaborator with Baumbach circa “The Meyerowitz Stories.” IndieWire reviewed the film out of Venice, where “Jay Kelly” didn't win any awards but energized conversation nonetheless. Baumbach's real-life partner, Greta Gerwig, co-stars in this film as Sandler's wife, who is saddled with childcare duties while Sandler's character is saddled with Jay Kelly-care duties abroad.

Also in the cast is Riley Keough as Jay's other daughter, this one estranged, who is shown in flashbacks and over phone calls as a woman who felt aggrieved and abandoned amid her father's success. Lars Eidinger, Louis Partridge, Patrick Wilson, Alba Rohrwacher (in a scene-stealing role), and Isla Fisher are also among the ensemble. Baumbach is on the hook for an Oscar win after four nominations, including in 2024 for Best Adapted Screenplay for “Barbie” with Gerwig. It's fascinating to see how his sensibility has broadened (and with a bigger budget) since the days of “Kicking and Screaming” and “The Squid and the Whale,” scrappy indies about neurotic New Yorkers.

Here's the trailer for “Jay Kelly,” which premieres at the New York Film Festival on Monday, September 29.

The 63rd New York Film Festival brought The Boss to Alice Tully Hall for the NYC premiere of “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” Jeremy Allen White transforms into iconic rocker Bruce Springsteen for the biopic, which is set in the early '80s during the recordings of “Born in the USA” and “Nebraska,” and co-stars Jeremy Strong, Paul Walter Hauser, Marc Maron, Gaby Hoffmann, and Odessa Young.

We caught up with White on the red carpet, who will soon go into production for the sequel to “The Social Network,” titled “The Social Reckoning.” “I have read the script, but I can't tell you anything,” White told IndieWire. As for whether he has connected with writer and director Aaron Sorkin, White said, “Yeah, of course.” He will also reunite with Strong in this film. “I feel like every October Jeremy and I should do a movie together,” he joked.

Last week we asked Andrew Garfield, star of the first film, if there was any chance he would return for this one. “No, no,” Garfield told IndieWire. “Eduardo [Saverin] is in Singapore having a good time.” And is the actor excited to eventually see it? “Oh yeah.”

 










The film will open in theaters on October 9, 2026. And alongside White and Jeremy Strong as Mark Zuckerberg, Mikey Madison and Bill Burr will also star. Sorkin's original screenplay for the film tells the true story of how Frances Haugen (Madison), a young Facebook engineer, enlists the help of Jeff Horwitz (White), a Wall Street Journal reporter, to go on a dangerous journey that ends up blowing the whistle on the social network's most guarded secrets.

But Sunday night at NYFF was all about all things Springsteen. In David Ehrlich's review for “Deliver Me from Nowhere,” he writes that it “is a semi-desolate sketch of a biopic about a depressed 32-year-old man who channel surfs across a much better movie on TV one night in the fall of 1981. The man is Bruce Springsteen (a possessed Jeremy Allen White), the movie is Terrence Malick's “Badlands,” and its story of a Korean War vet who takes his 15-year-old girlfriend on a killing spree across the American heartland gives the wayward rock god a newfound sense of direction that just might save his life.”

It is the latest musical biopic starring an in-demand rising actor: “A Complete Unknown” landed a slew of Academy noms, including a Best Actor nod for Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan. The four-part Beatles biopic is also in the works, with Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, and Harris Dickinson as John Lennon.

 










20th Century Studios will release “Deliver Me from Nowhere” in theaters on Friday, October 24. Check out the trailer here.

Coined by American philosopher W.V. Quine, “Gavagai” is a nonsense word meant to convey the indeterminacy of translation. The classic example: A British ethnologist visits some “exotic” foreign land, where a speaker of the native tongue points to a rabbit and says “gavagai.” While the natural assumption would be that “gavagai” is the local word for “rabbit,” the reality is that “gavagai” could just as easily mean “food,” “pet,” “mammal,” or “we're all vegans here.”  

Some assumptions are more plausible than others, but the fact remains that no two people can ever perfectly understand one another, let alone two people from completely different backgrounds. Communication is miscommunication, and if that's true of a single word, then it's exponentially more so of an ancient play, or a modern adaptation of it, or — say — of a racist incident that occurs to the lead actor of a modern adaptation of an ancient play in the hours before the new “Medea” he stars in is set to premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival.

So goes the premise of Ulrich Köhler's “Gavagai,” a patchy but provocative thought exercise of a movie that fittingly neglects to explain its title (hence the preamble here), which is all the better to let viewers arrive at their own interpretations. Loosely inspired by his experience shooting “Sleeping Sickness” (2011) in Cameroon, when the well-intentioned German director — sweating under the pressures of running a set in a distant country with a local crew — wound up “reproducing the neocolonial hierarchies and behavioral patterns that we address in the film” (as he puts it in the “Gavagai” press notes), this stilted meta-drama allows Köhler to more deliberately trace the inexorable tensions that underpin today's globalized film trade. 

 










Here, he recasts himself as a French director named Caroline (an extremely Claire Denis-coded Nathalie Richard), who seems a bit too headstrong and oblivious to appreciate why her Senegalese reimagining of Euripides' tragedy — in which the titular child-murderer is an entitled white immigrant who's reduced to refugee status after her native Black husband betrays her — could potentially reaffirm the same hierarchies of privilege that it hopes to address. Caroline is a headstrong liberal who's doing what she can to push civilization forward according to her understanding of what that means, but flipping the script on racist stereotypes may not be the most effective way of dismantling them, especially when the process of doing so finds the director stranding her extras in the hot Dakar sun for 10 hours at a time while denying them access to the craft services tent. 

To its credit, Köhler's film is much less interested in wallowing in such archly observed (and self-exculpatory) ironies than it is in articulating how difficult they are to avoid in a world where nothing is a rabbit, and everything is “gavagai.” While there are several wry moments of movie-within-a-movie satire toward the start (Medea comes to shore on the bow of a speedboat, and Caroline is horrified to see that Medea's dead children have been outfitted with life jackets for safety reasons), “Gavagai” soon keys into a wide variety of overlapping — and sometimes conflicting — realities about the process of exhuming an ancient text, most of which are more sober in tone. 

 










For starters, Caroline projects her frustration onto her lead actress, Maja (Maren Eggert), who she argues is too bourgeois to play an outcast “savage” capable of killing her own kids. The director is unaware that Maja — who FaceTimes her husband and daughter back home in Berlin during her breaks on set — is secretly having an affair with the film's Jason (“Sleeping Sickness” star Jean-Christophe Folly, wonderful as Nourou, a character who's always taking uncertain shape of his burden), which hardly rises to the crime of homicide, but suggests that Caroline doesn't perceive her cast as clearly as she might think. 

She's certainly oblivious to the anxieties that have confronted her leading man by virtue of his accepting a major role in this splashy European production. She's blithely unaware that Nourou's Senegalese identity is so threatened that he can only justify his part in the film by insisting that it's a masterpiece, even if the frequent clips we see of the finished product make it look like a hodgepodge of all the worst ideas that Julie Taymor never had (jet skis can only add so much to a 2,500-year-old play). 

Nourou's awareness of his own “complicity” in the project — the uncertain degree to which he's swallowing his doubts about the movie in order to enjoy the benefits of being in it — is left ambiguous, but other tensions produced by his performance are more evident on the surface. A high-status artist in the African city where “Medea” is shot, Nourou is forced to assume the role of barely tolerated outsider in the German city where the film is slated to premiere, a downshift in privilege that leads to a racist incident outside of the Berlin hotel where he's staying for the festival. A hostile security guard treats Nourou with undue suspicion, questioning his right to enter the lobby of the Intercontinental; the actor is understandably irked by the encounter, but it's Maja who sees it as a chance to perform her identity as a good white lady, and perhaps to openly defend the lover she's otherwise ashamed to keep as a secret. It's Maja who adopts the role of savior and insists that the security guard be fired.

 










 This too is based on a real incident, as a bigoted staffer — maybe or maybe not at the Intercontinental — confronted Folly after the premiere of “Sleeping Sickness.” This is also a chance for Köhler to redress his reaction to the event, and to examine how his reflexive transformation into a white savior may have been more for his own benefit than anything else. Like so much of “Gavagai,” the encounter is filmed from a remove (and in this case additionally obfuscated by a glass door), which doesn't approximate some kind of objectivity so much as it heightens our attention to the nature of perspective. 

Once again, this story is not being told through the eyes of its victim, but through those of his director, and while “Gavagai” avoids any self-flagellating displays of white guilt, the film is only so interesting because Köhler is keenly aware that he's at risk of repeating this cycle of moral relativism, and making the fact of his awareness more important than Folly's experience of prejudice. Is the act of extrapolating that experience into a feature-length film meant to absolve Köhler of his embarrassment over how it played out in real life, or — by reducing a long-time collaborator to his role in a particularly dehumanizing moment — is the director further confining Folly to the limits of his neoliberal gaze? 

 










These would be easy questions for Köhler to address on his own behalf, but “Gavagai” complicates them well beyond the yes/no binary (even if the film is weakened by its quasi-cartoonish portrait of Caroline's blinkered privilege, which prevents her from displaying any trace of self-awareness). Every scene is relaxedly suffused with the tension between the limits of perspective and the empathy of storytelling, until the act of seeing becomes as problematized as the refusal to look, and the boundaries between reality and fiction grow as blurred as those between the various genres that “Gavagai” swirls into an unclassifiable sludge. 

The last act of this movie becomes a ticking clock thriller set during the “Medea” premiere, by which point “Gavagai” has already refracted the dynamic between Köhler and his subject into an inescapable house of mirrors that's less interesting for its reflections than it is for the parallax of considering them from different angles. Those angles can be too obtuse in the moments when they aren't unavoidably acute, and I can't help but wish that Köhler had jettisoned the unhelpful “Medea” flashbacks in favor of a more explicitly self-reflexive approach that elevated the “Sleeping Sickness” of it all from backstory to text. Still, “Gavagai” remains worthwhile because it constantly adds new dimensions to the question of who this — or any — film is “for” in a world where even the simplest gestures can be lost in translation, and every viewer is left to arrive at their own meaning.

 










“Gavagai” premiered at the 2025 New York Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

At the turn of the last century, contemporary R&B entered a second adolescence. The power ballads of the 1990s were fading out, replaced by crossover hits that pushed the limits of the genre by incorporating dance, electro, and hip-hop into visions of a glittering future. The 28-year-old singer George Riley was born as this cultural transition kicked off—and her new mixtape, the shiny, upbeat, slightly irreverent More Is More, makes a close study of early '00s pop. Riley shuffles through retro sounds faster than a TRL lineup, combining rich vocals and radio-ready choruses with a dancefloor-oriented edge. A love letter to the work of producers like Dallas Austin, Darkchild, Jermaine Dupri, and Timbaland, More Is More takes their chopped-up acoustic guitar samples and house-indebted synths—elements that still sound innovative—and blasts them into the present.

Riley's performances supply the vitality and wit that's quickly become her trademark among the UK's most exciting new R&B voices. She arrived on the scene barely four years ago, lending her breathy soprano to Manchester producer Azn's ebullient dance track “You Could Be”; her 2022 Vegyn-produced breakthrough, Running in Waves, showed a softer side, marrying jazz and soul influences with jungle and electro flourishes. Earlier this year, she stepped into the role of UK garage diva on SHERELLE's acidic 2-step track “Freaky (Just My Type).” These releases set her up as a fan favorite and critical darling, but More Is More is, well, more: bolder, grander, and musically tighter than anything she's released thus far.

Riley makes no attempt to hide her influences or to couch them in anything but fervent appreciation. By her own admission, opener “Something New” borrows heavily from All for You-era Janet Jackson; its bubbly, tropical beat and skittering hi-hats recall “Someone to Call My Lover,” a song that's recently led the Y2K R&B revival trend on TikTok. Riley goes deeper, kicking off a full-bodied garage beat in the middle of the track that gives it just enough bite to set it apart from 2001 Janet. The relentlessly catchy “Forever” twists the hypnotic synth pulse of Kylie Minogue's megahit “Can't Get You Out of My Head” into a beachy love song, a rising tide of Spanish guitars and sultry harmonies sloshing at Riley's feet. Produced by Mura Masa, “Forever” is the best example of More Is More's mission to tweak massively recognizable sounds just enough to transform them.

The majority of the tape is co-produced by phil, a main collaborator of another UK artist known to wield '00s nostalgia to her advantage: PinkPanthress. Riley is more of a purist though, dissecting the music of her youth to find the sweet spot between homage and reinterpretation. She distinguishes her point of view with lyrics about self-love and agency, innermost wants and desires. Coupled with the uplifting music, the tone is fresh and galvanizing. “More,” co-produced by phil and Jordan Riley (no relation), pairs this approach with a musical nod to '00s British girl groups. “Gold on gold on gold on brown skin/Some say it's tacky, but I love it,” she sings, sounding like the fifth member of All Saints or a lost Sugababe. The sunny guitar riff echoes the theme of joy and abundance by evoking an era of sugary acoustic bubblegum that offered itself at face value. Riley takes it to the club: Just before the coda, “More” explodes into a jittery garage breakdown. Her novel engagement of established sounds anchors the music in the present.

Though it's reference-heavy, More Is More doesn't feel as if Riley were singing into a hairbrush, imitating some legendary act. Yes, she expounds on the mixtape's themes through imaginative songwriting and production, but it's her contagious excitement that takes the tape well beyond a lesson in fond reminiscence. By consistently delivering on a dense concept with songs that live up to the material they crib from, Riley proves she's ready to carry the torch for the R&B and UK dance sounds that she reveres.

“I don't acknowledge time,” is one of the first things Mariah Carey sings on her new album, Here for It All. Within the larger scheme of her public persona, this has come to be a refrain, a fun fact about her that is oft repeated in interviews. Her aversion to time is one of her diva affectations, like punctuating sentences with dahling or insisting on being photographed from the right, such that when she appears on Watch What Happens Live, she takes Andy Cohen's usual seat. There are obvious reasons why someone of Carey's superstar stature would ignore the clock. One is plausible deniability when she shows up late for an appointment. Another is that time is held against pop stars, especially women, whose years of hard work are met with apathy or even contempt as they age out of charting on Billboard. It's just not fair. If Carey can't bend the world to her will, she can at least blank out its needless punishment.

Time, on the other hand, does acknowledge Mariah Carey, and that's made clear on Here for It All. Her voice, a force of nature that launched her career into the stratosphere, is often hoarse on the album. At times, her rasp flirts with an alternate key. Whereas in the past Carey's voice glided between notes as though her saliva were silicone based, here it sometimes trips. There are plenty of the kind of creamy, luscious vocals Carey's known for on Here for It All, particularly when she projects from her chest. Sometimes she still soars. But her vocal roughness is too frequent to be an oversight. It's unlikely that she just didn't feel like doing another take, given the perfectionism evinced throughout her career. No, this is Carey opting for realistic portraiture of where she is now as a singer, and if her voice sounds blown out, well, of course it does after singing with the force she has for decades. The grit is alluring, bringing a tear-stained realness to her vulnerable lyrics and teasing out the soul of Paul McCartney and Wings' previously easy-listening ballad “My Love.” Carey's raw-piped cover saps much of the song's schmalz, giving it an unlikely edge.

The voice, and Carey's decision to spotlight where she is (which, whether she admits it or not, is a tacit acknowledgment of time), is the boldest of Here for It All's moves, a kind of no-makeup sound for a persona devoted to glamour. The album is otherwise a pleasant collection of the kind of well-constructed melodies that typify Carey's output. It leans toward a full-band sound, particularly on its collaborations with Anderson .Paak and Carey's musical director Daniel Moore II, though there are bassy electronic ballads as well, like the skittery opener “Mi,” the lovely Caribbean-kissed single “Sugar Sweet,” and the deliciously petty “Confetti and Champagne,” a fuck-you to an ex in which Carey proclaims, “Cheers cheers cheers cheers cheers/To me, not you, just me.” It sounds crafted to become an audio meme.

A certain sourness, or bubbling rage even, underpins many of these tracks. The Chi-Lites/Delfonics-inspired twinkling '70s soul that .Paak revisits with Soul Sonic is no safe haven here: “Play This Song” urges an estranged lover to “Listen by yourself, please listen by your damn self.” On “I Won't Allow It,” an organic disco track that works like a mash-up of Dua Lipa's “Levitating” and Carey's own “Make It Happen,” she dogs an ex for his dirty mustache and fast food proclivities, then mocks him with references to acne treatments (“So whatcha gonna do when your face all broke/And you're hot inside, lost your pride/Can't obtain any Accutane/Should have been more proactive”). There are more straightforward love songs and some inspir-iah tracks: “Jesus I Do,” a collaboration with the legendary Clark Sisters that sounds ripped from the disco gospel comp Overdose of the Holy Ghost; the minimal ballad “Nothing Is Impossible,” which is about overcoming obstacles and sung with conviction. But it's striking that an album that sounds low-key at its fastest tempo is often openly negative.

Whether or not this is pointed (Carey broke up with choreographer and backup dancer Bryan Tanaka in 2023) is anyone's guess. Carey, who has not been very descriptive in recent press, explained on Big Boy's Neighborhood how Here for It All came about: “We were just doing, you know, a couple songs here and there and then it just became like, ‘OK, this might as well be a project.'” Might as well! Gotta release an album at some point, right? Like 2018's superior Caution, there is a looseness here as Carey recommits to her craft. The time between albums (seven years, in this case) gives Here for It All a certain weight that its songs don't quite bear. In the scheme of her smash-packed discography, this is a minor work.

But if only all minor works were so consistently enjoyable. The air of meh palpable during many of Carey's recent public appearances is mostly replaced with gusto and wit (though the way lead single “Type Dangerous” flatlines in the hook is just meh again). .Paak's sense of humor, more subdued than Carey's, provides a wonderful foil. In the pre-chorus of “In Your Feelings,” Carey jams in a string of words (“I think you might be getting a little bit tooooo…”) and then luxuriates in her hook (“…in your feelings!”). It's a novel way to summon the kind of drama that is Carey's bread and butter. In “I Won't Allow It,” she sings, “I won't entertain all your narcissistic ways” with the put-on formality of a cartoon queen.

Carey remains committed to cultivating her own image. “You couldn't walk a mile in my shoes/'Cause they hurt like hell,” she sings on “Mi,” a play on her nickname, Mimi, and her focus. “I don't care about much if it ain't about mi,” goes the hook. She sounds equal parts celebrity diva and pleb fluffing herself on social media. She is larger than life but also of life. Carey's vocabulary is as boosted as ever (“harrowing,” “gruesome,” and “diligently” all stop by). Her flair for melodrama is alive, but never more effective than when she's dead serious—as on the title track, one of the album's few straightforward odes. Over little more than a piano and armed with an indelible melody, Carey affirms devotion despite personal tumult (“The glory, the shakes, and withdrawals/Even when you bounce off the walls/Baby I'm here for it all”). Then, in a single couplet, she evokes cataracts and anilingus: “Here for the clouds in your eyes/A kiss where the sun never shines.” She sings with a straight-faced vulnerability that boldly risks camp. It's simultaneously hilarious and moving. Within the song, there is a sense that her declarations double as a request. Here, Carey asks her audience to be here for it all: the lyrical indulgences, the flaws in her instrument, her endless self-absorption. It seems that how she gives love is also how she'd like to receive it.

The architects of modern fingerstyle guitar built their temple with steel. Sure, you have your Bola Setes, your Tashi Dorjis, the odd occasion Six Organs of Admittance would reach for a nylon-string; but the vast majority of fingerpickers walking in John Fahey's footsteps seem to have felt similarly as Robbie Basho, who once claimed that while the classical guitar may be fit for more romantic songs, steel-strings had the “fire.” Mason Lindahl, however, would beg to differ: He plays his classical guitar as if he were blowing out the final embers of some cave-dwelling flame, then tracing the smoke as it dances through the air. His music is stark yet warm, swirling yet still, violent yet hauntingly gentle.

Lindahl has remained an elusive figure in the instrumental guitar world, sometimes waiting a decade and change between releases (from the scant interviews he's done, one gets the sense that he doesn't want to bother releasing music unless he can get it just right). The last we heard from him was 2021's lovely Kissing Rosy in the Rain, the first album on which he fully dropped the vocals and let his guitar speak for itself. His latest release plumbs the mysterious depths of his instrument even deeper. Recorded between Marin County, California, and just outside Reykjavík, Joshua / Same Day Walking was initially conceived as two separate albums, but arrive collected as one unified, hour-long release. It's the right way to listen to them—each session has its own subtle character, but together they capture the complexity and malleability of his brusque, searching style as it climbs to an aching new high.

Though the nylon-string guitar is typically deployed for its softer qualities, Lindahl tackles it with maelstrom force, attacking his strings right at the base of the bridge, where they're at their most taut. Lindahl shrouds himself in textures both up close and physical: On “Joshua Underwater,” he twists and hammers his strings as if he were bending the neck of the guitar itself, while the low, winding melody of “Little Sister” is constantly interrupted by the sounds of strings snapping against the body, frustratedly resisting his plucks. Creaking, moaning wood ensnares these tracks, but there are whispers of other instruments around the margins, namely a soft glow of organ and a synthesizer that seems to be constantly decaying in the background, withering like snakeskin. “Same Day Walking” weaves these sounds directly into Lindahl's playing, his tense strums ringing out to leave room for uncanny hanging artifacts of reverb, bringing their artificiality into the performance itself.

Where fingerstyle guitarists often tend to pull from a shared language of folk music and ragtime, Lindahl's playing is closer to a pitch-black reimagining of bolero and flamenco. His spidery melodies swerve up, around, and backwards, tumbling in and out of meter as he hunts his way to his next chord. “Long Prowl, Underwater” closes out the first of the two albums with a delirium of bent notes that shimmer like reflected moonlight; you can instantly hear the difference in tone when “Anticipation of the Passed Baton” commences the second of the two recording sessions, as Lindahl leaves much more room for the empty space surrounding his muted strings. It's a delicate snowfall compared to the first album's snaking predator, though quietly menacing tracks like “Moon Over” hint at a simmering darkness lurking just beyond the frame.

It's rare these days to hear an artist pushing fingerstyle guitar—a style inherently boxed in not only by its instrumental limitations, but also its tendency toward traditionalism—in visceral new directions. Lindahl's approach operates somewhere parallel to Raphael Rogiń​ski's splintering jazz covers and Bill Orcutt's tortured blues, but steeped in a cosmic, melancholy dread that's fully his own. Present day torchbearer Hayden Pedigo has cited Lindahl as his favorite player; if Pedigo has shepherded American Primitive music to a more gentle and accessible place in recent years, here Lindahl is continuing to push it to its darkest, mistiest orbits, a doomed ferry ride into the dusk.

Bad Bunny will perform the halftime show at Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, California on Sunday, February 8, 2026. The news arrived during tonight's (September 28) Sunday Night Football game between the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys. Watch the announcement video below.

“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement to Billboard. “It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”

In a statement to Variety, Roc Nation founder Jay-Z added, “What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring.” His company has partnered with the NFL in booking the Super Bowl halftime show since 2019.

Super Bowl LX takes place at Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium. Apple Music is the halftime show's presenting sponsor, so the 2026 event is formally known as the Apple Music Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show.

Bad Bunny shared his latest album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, in January. The Puerto Rican superstar has since made his third appearance as Saturday Night Live's musical guest and staged a 30-show concert residency in San Juan. His upcoming world tour in support of Debí Tirar Más Fotos kicks off in November and is set to run through July 2026, with no stops in the United states currently planned. That means Bad Bunny's halftime show will be his only stateside performance for the forseeable future.

“[Estuve] pensando en estos días, y luego de hablarlo con mi equipo, creo que haré una sola fecha en Estados Unidos,” Bad Bunny wrote in an X post prior to the announcement. Translated, it reads: “I've been thinking about it these days, and after discussing it with my team, I think I'll do just one date in the United States.”

This past February, in New Orleans, Kendrick Lamar played the Super Bowl LIX halftime show, becoming the first rapper to headline the event as a solo artist. During his set, Lamar brought out Samuel L. Jackson, SZA, Serena Williams, and Mustard. He also repeatedly dissed Drake to camera. A performer in the show was detained and subsequently arrested months later for unfurling a Sudanese-Palestinian flag during the performance.

							By 

	Antonia Juhasz



	In a xenophobic, hate-filled speech laden with lies and disinformation, President Donald Trump declared before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that climate change is “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” and railed against all forms of green energy. It was more than just a rant; it is Trump's policy.


	Trump has set his sights on Alaska as a test case for his disastrous “National Energy Dominance” agenda. He wants to double oil production in the state, open up vast new tracts of land to exploitation, kneecap renewable energy, and push construction of what would be one of the largest and most expensive fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the nation. The project includes a massive 800-mile-long gas pipeline stretching from one end of Alaska to the other and a mammoth new export facility to ship gas out of the U.S. to Asia, with an estimated total price tag of over $70 billion.


	Last month, I met people across Alaska organizing to resist Trump's plans. They are pushing back against an agenda they see as catastrophically harmful to their pocketbooks, their way of life, and even their existence. They characterize Trump's fossil-fueled ambitions as more of a retrograde political ploy than a genuine effort to benefit the state or the nation. Organizing against Trump's energy agenda has strengthened ties between people often viewed as political adversaries, they explain, providing a sense of community and purpose despite the president's best efforts to divide the nation. 

	











	“No one is throwing up their hands and saying, ‘Well, he's won,'” Elisabeth Dabney, longtime executive director of the Northern Center in Fairbanks, tells me. “There is hope in being an Alaskan in this moment and seeing that there is solidarity, there is gumption to not give up, and there is strategy. It's very powerful.”

	











	On the first day of his second term in office, Trump signed an expansive executive order, “Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential.”  Two hundred and nineteen executive orders have followed, but Alaska remains the one and only state to receive such unique and unprecedented attention.

	The order seeks to open Alaska's oil and gas veins to extraction, proposing massive expansions of operations in a state that is already being pummeled by the impacts of the burning of fossil fuels driving the climate crisis, with devastating harms to the local economy, environment, and the survival of its residents. 


	On August 13, just two days before Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage for a summit that did little to advance peace in Ukraine but did further both presidents' commitment to fossil-fueled autocracy, residents of Alaska's capital city of Juneau were evacuating in advance of historic flooding from nearby melting glaciers.


	After reporting on the summit, I boarded the Taylor Skiff, bound for another Alaskan glacier disappearing because of global warming. The small boat was made by hand as a “Covid project” by Andy Moderow, a dedicated Swifty who christened his boat accordingly. The Alaska native is the senior director of policy at the Alaska Wilderness League, working with allies across the state to halt Trump's agenda.


	Our destination lay east of Anchorage, across the waters off of the small community of Whittier, and up a short hike to the Lawrence Glacier. Moderow has been visiting the site for years for recreation and now to track the stunning blue and white glacier's painful retreat. He describes watching the glacier “deflate like a balloon.” The less glacier ice there is, the less water there is for human use.

	We're joined by glaciologist and geophysicist Emily Baker, who explains that it is normal for glaciers to melt, but there should be enough cold and snow to replenish it “were we in a stable climate, but we're not in a stable climate it turns out! Who knew?! It turns out, everyone knew.” 


	Baker recently left her dream job of nine years working at the U.S. Geological Survey studying glaciers in Alaska — a victim of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.


	“There are people who think we can continue to have a free lunch,” Moderow says, extracting, producing, and burning fossil fuels without devastating harm. Baker adds, “They forget that we're in an ecosystem we depend upon.” 

	











	Trump's executive order directs federal agencies to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling and expand drilling in the Western Arctic area designated as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, undoing hard-fought victories won during President Joe Biden's administration that protect native communities and sensitive areas from further harm. 


	At a press conference, Alaska's Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy praised Trump while taking partial credit for drafting the executive order. His Department of Natural Resources commissioner, John Byole, said Trump finally ended Biden's “war on Alaska” that sought to impose a “radical ideology” on the state, freeing Alaskans from “wine and cheese eating environmentalists in Seattle or San Francisco or some other terrible city that wants to impose their agenda on us.” 


	Since January, the Trump administration has moved swiftly to enforce the order with provisions included in the budget reconciliation bill, also known as Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” and administrative actions. In June, Trump dispatched his secretaries of the Interior, Energy, and the Environment Protection Agency to Alaska to promote the projects and policy changes.


	Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich'in Steering Committee, tells me that the proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas is “a dagger in the heart” of her entire native community.


	“All of these horrible projects that we've been working to stop with thousands of Alaskans following tribal leadership to protect these lands” is now once again under attack by Trump, says Enei Begaye, executive director of Native Movement. Begaye is of the Diné and Tohono O'odham nations and founded the Anchorage-based nonprofit advocacy organization over 20 years ago with her partner, then chief of his Gwich'in tribe.


	Trump's order singles out the Alaska LNG Project, the proposed 800-mile pipeline and export plant, for special promotion. Liquified natural gas, or LNG, is gas processed into a liquid for transport. The order calls for “expedited permitting and leasing” and the “prioritization of the development” of Alaska's liquified natural gas potential, “including the permitting of all necessary pipeline and export infrastructure related to the Alaska LNG Project.” 

	











	The U.S. is already the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas, with exports reaching an all-time high in August. This has reduced domestic supplies of gas and increased costs, driving a surge in home power bills across the nation. Trump's rampage against renewable energy has already made wind and solar more difficult to use and expand, pushing electricity rates up even higher for American families. 


	“It's outrageous insanity,” Begaye says of Trump's LNG proposal. In an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News, she joined leaders of several other Alaskan organizations to denounce the project, writing, “New pipelines and more fossil fuel extraction are not answers to any of the crises we face.”


	The first shipment of liquified natural gas left the United States in 1969 from Alaska's Kenai Peninsula Borough port of Nikiski, delivering gas produced from offshore wells in Cook Inlet. The small plant shut down almost 40 years later in 2017, having helped virtually drain the inlet of gas. 


	Roughly two-thirds of Alaskans, some 450,000 people, live within the Kenai Peninsula and Cook Inlet region, most in Anchorage. The area remains largely dependent on Cook Inlet gas and faces a looming electricity crisis.


	The vast majority of gas produced in Alaska feeds the fossil fuel industry, which uses it to produce more oil. The state also uses fossil fuels to export and import more fossil fuels. Alaska generates about 30 percent of its electricity from renewable energy, and during the Biden administration communities across Alaska received federal funding to support new renewable energy projects. Trump wants to move Alaskans and the nation in the opposite direction by aggressively clawing back federal funds and regulatory backing for renewables, while locking in long-term fossil fuel dependence 


	Administration officials have taken to calling the Alaska LNG Project, the “big, beautiful twin,” a nod to the 1977 Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline on which it is modeled. The LNG project includes construction of a new, 800-mile long pipeline to move gas from the North Slope of Alaska down the entire length of the state to Anchorage, where an additional 42 miles of pipeline will be laid under the Cook Inlet to the port of Nikiski. Alaskans would get gas from the pipeline from spurs along the route. In Nikiski, a massive new liquefication plant to cool and condense gas for export and a new export facility would be built, dwarfing not only the former plant, but all other industrial operations.

	











	Following my trip to Whittier, I board a red propeller plane in Anchorage just large enough for eight passengers for the short flight to Kenai airport near Nikiski. Before taking off, our pilot turns around in his seat to let us know to expect choppy weather and to share a few basic flying instructions should he become incapacitated.


	Once airborne, we pass a gathering of giant white windmills standing tall and statuesque on the edge of the inlet. Next comes rich green marshlands that hide the Swanson River Oil Field, the first major fossil fuel discovery in the state in the late 1950s. Like the rest of Cook Inlet, Swanson River's production peaked in the 1990s and has been on a rapid decline ever since.


	At the tiny Kenai airport, I am met by Ben Boettger, a lanky former Peace Corps volunteer, National Park Service ranger, and oil and gas journalist-turned energy advocate. He is the energy policy specialist at Cook Inletkeeper, a small local environmental organization founded with the proceeds from a settlement with the oil industry over its extensive pollution in the inlet. 


	Like almost all of Alaska, the area is sparsely populated and surrounded by stunning wilderness. Blink and you'll miss the main industrial strip of Nikiski, a smattering of commercial operations along a quiet two-lane road with almost no other cars in sight. A street sign for “Chevron Road” is a marker of times past. Years ago, Chevron, along with every other major oil company, left the inlet for the North Slope. 


	It's apparent well before the weathered hull of the former LNG plant comes into sight that this is an area in a long economic decline. A fertilizer plant reliant on gas as its key input stands idle beside the former plant. Both are rusting monuments to the boom-and-bust-cycles that dominate fossil fuel dependence. Across the street, a small Marathon oil refinery continues to chug away.


	We get a better view of the remaining offshore oil and gas platforms from the beach. Boettger says there are 17, almost all dating from the 1960s and primarily operated by Hilcorp, a small Texas company. They've continued operating thanks to significant state financial subsidies. 


	A lone wooden fishing camp overlooks the beach, colorfully painted in dark blues and rich purples depicting the inlet and decorated with ghouls' faces, a large weathered American flag billowing on top. The inlet is one of the world's most biologically productive marine ecosystems, home to many of the state's leading fisheries, as well as sea lions, orcas, and beluga and humpback whales, on which native and other local communities have long relied. 

	











	It is the original home of the Dena'ina and Alutiiq/Sugpiaq native peoples. Native Iñupiat Aisenna-Tia Holley has lived in Kenai since 1981. Her mother moved to Kenai after marrying an oil worker. Holley also married not one, but two oil-worker husbands. Each of the men is now retired.


	Holley understands better than most the benefits of the industry, but also its costs. She attributes her current husband's kidney disease to exposure to toxins while on the job, ultimately forcing him to retire. Cook Inlet is “one of the hot spots for water pollution in the state,” she tells me. “Anywhere there's oil, there's contamination that gets into the water.” Often, she adds, with the industry, “it's just easier to pay a fine than fix a problem.” 


	Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” requires at least six Cook Inlet oil and gas lease sales starting in 2026. Cook Inletkeeper and groups across the state have organized to halt the sales.


	Holley worries that without producing the gas and oil remaining in the Inlet, there won't be enough energy for the state's needs, particularly without federal assistance to move off of fossil fuels. “We have enough wind power; we need to find renewables. But we'll need federal help to do it,” she says. But she strenuously disagrees that the state is locked into the fossil fuel economy. “I know that the mindset has changed, and people understand what a danger that the oil companies can be.” She cites the younger generation, “coming up with ideas to make things cleaner and safer and to protect the Earth and the waters and the land that we live on,” she says.


	Holley serves on the advisory board of Native Movement, which is working for a just transition off of fossil fuels, part of the Alaska Just Transition Collective of Alaskan groups that partners with organizations across the state, including in the North Slope of Alaska.


	Were it to be built, gas for the LNG pipeline would come from fields in the North Slope where Trump is also advancing rampant fossil fuel development.


	“For me, all of this has been a nightmare in continuous motion,” native Iñupiat Rosemary Ahtuangaruak tells me. Ahtuangaruak is the former mayor of Nuiqsut, a small remote village in the North Slope on the Beaufort Sea. Nuiqsut is within the region now known as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The village is virtually surrounded by current and planned ConocoPhillips oil and gas operations, she says. 

	











	In addition to mandating new lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the east of Nuiqsut, the “Big Beautiful Bill” mandates new lease sales across the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska while removing protections Ahtuangaruak and fellow allies worked hard to achieve under Biden. 


	Ahtuangaruak is executive director of Grandmothers Growing Goodness, dedicated to “elevating the understanding and protection of Iñupiat culture and people in the face of rampant oil and gas development and climate change.” A trained community health worker, she attributes worsening health harms experienced by local residents to growing fossil fuel development. “We've got real serious health issues in our community. And they just ignore that there's a little village that's in the middle of all of this oil and gas development. Human health gets left behind, and profitability stays at the table at the cost of our way of life, our tradition and our subsistence,” she explains. 


	“Do we work to prevent these harms?” she asks, “or are we here to just watch the demise?”


	Ahtuangaruak works closely with allied organizations, including Sovereign Iñupiat for Living Arctic. The group's executive director, Iñupiat Nauri Simmonds, was born in Utgiagvik (formerly called Barrow), the northernmost community in the U.S., perched on the edge of the Alaskan Arctic overlooking the Chukchi Sea and also within the National Petroleum Reserve. Simmonds split much of her youth between Utgiagvik and Nuiqsut.


	Until about five years ago, Simmonds was an oil worker. She worked at an oil field service company on the North Slope doing health, safety, and environmental compliance. “I went in with a grandiose plan of changing it into a renewable energy company,” she tells me. During her seven years in the industry, Simmonds was shocked by how few workers were from Alaska, much less native communities. “They say it's going to create jobs but the number of people who lived outside of Alaska was astounding,” she tells me. 


	According to the Alaska Department of Labor, almost half of all oil and gas workers on the North Slope come from outside of the state. Simmonds estimates the number is likely far greater. While there's been a recent increase in workers employed in the oil and gas sector, virtually all of the job growth has come from nonresidents, while the total number of workers remains only about half of what it was a decade ago. Nonresidents also have the highest wage jobs, earning the largest share of wages compared to other employment sectors. Overall, the entire mining sector, of which oil and gas extraction and services are a subset, employs just 3.6 percent of Alaska's workforce.

	











	Jobs may become even more scarce. The fossil fuel industry has been shedding jobs for years, the result of mergers and a streamlining of operations, including replacing workers with automated machinery. Alaska's leading companies are preparing for another round of global job cuts this year after the industry shed thousands of positions last year. ConocoPhillips plans to cut as much as 25 percent of its global workforce. Chevron and Shell plan to lay off as much as 20 percent. Exxon, Halliburton, and SLB are also reducing their global workforce. 


	Simmonds firmly believes that Alaska can free itself from fossil fuel dependence. Her organization has created “a safe space” for those in her community who feel the same but are afraid to speak out. She estimates that this is the silent majority and growing. “A lot of people are just trying to live,” she explains, and will support whatever allows them to do that. 


	She knows that the renewable energy transition can present not only an alternative form of vital energy, but also a new economy. “I know it can be lucrative,” she stresses.


	“We're on the bust side of an oil and gas economy,” Native Movement's Begaye tells me. She points to the relative youth of the industry — just 50 years — “and the jobs are already going away, the money is going away,” she says. Today, revenue from oil and gas accounts for less than 14 percent of the state's annual budget.


	Instead of investing in “fossil fuel distractions, we could be actively pursuing more local renewable energy, and Alaskans already know how,” Begaye and her colleagues wrote in their op-ed for the Anchorage Daily News. They cite Kodiak, which runs on nearly 100 percent renewable energy, and Galena, where a tribally owned and operated biomass system accounts for 75 percent of the community's heating needs, with another 1.5 megawatts of solar power on the way. 


	At 76 percent renewable energy generation, Alaskans would save $100 million a year because fossil fuels are a lot more expensive to produce and use. Transitioning to 100 percent renewables would add 67,216 Alaskan jobs, or nearly five times more than the fossil fuel jobs the Trump administration plans to “protect” in Alaska, and dramatically more than the “thousands” of new jobs Trump has promised.


	Native Movement hosts regular statewide Just Transition summits and an action camp for organizers. “Whether it's from labor, education, conservation, or community groups, to tribal governments, every year, more and more people are coming to collaborate on ways in which we can build regenerative economies and regenerative energy systems,” Begaye tells me. People are sharing what's working in their region and what could work in other parts of the state. “We're really trying to build the political willpower so that we can make these transitions happen.”

	











	Begaye argues that Trump's LNG pipeline would be too little too late to fill the gas supply gap that communities are already experiencing while further extraction only exacerbates the climate crisis, amplifying the costly impacts on communities.


	In 2017, Trump sat beside Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The two looked on as a delegation from Alaska signed an agreement to advance the Alaska LNG pipeline with China's Petrochemical Corporation and the Bank of China. The photo graces the cover of the 2017 Annual report of the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation. Its president, Keith Meyer, later told reporters, “We've been through the courtship, we are now engaged.”


	It was not the first or last time that the pipeline's promoters signed a deal that came to nothing. The idea of the Alaska LNG pipeline dates back well before Trump's first term, to at least the 1960s, Larry Persily tells me. Persily spent five years as federal coordinator for the Office of Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects and is author of a history of the failed 40-year effort to build the pipeline. 


	“The majority of the state legislature thinks this thing is kaka and it's time to close it down,” Persily tells me. Few would say so publicly, however, because it's got too much perceived political and public support and they'd rather spend their political capital on other fights. “Alaskans need to accept it's not going to happen and move on.”


	The latest iteration is led by a subsidiary of the Glenfarne Group, which owns 75 percent of the project to the state's 25 percent. The private company has liquified natural gas export development projects in Texas and Louisiana, neither of which is operational.


	“Market interest in Alaska LNG is high because of the project's energy security, economic, and environmental competitive advantages,” a spokesperson for Glenfarne tells Rolling Stone. “Alaska LNG is proceeding on schedule.” Glenfarne says that it has received expressions of interest in contracts for the purchase of more than half of the project's gas.


	Trump highlighted the project in his March address to Congress and is once again pushing it with Asian nations while threatening trade tariffs, giving it new impetus. At the White House in June, Trump announced that he'd concluded a deal with Japan to form a joint venture in Alaska “for the LNG.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in September that the administration could “suggest” that $100 billion of the $550 billion Japan has pledged to invest in U.S.-based projects would be directed to the Alaska LNG Project: “The president green lights it, we hire the construction people, and we send a capital call to the Japanese. They send the money.”

	











	Japan is less optimistic. Takashi Uchida, chairman of the Japan Gas Association, told Reuters there was still no clear path for how the project would be developed or brought to market and that it was too early to tell the final extent of Japanese industry involvement.


	The pipeline won't be “made in America.” Glenfarne named a South Korean company in a statement that will supply a significant portion of the steel for the pipeline. “U.S. steel companies and pipe mills are being considered for supply,” a company spokesperson tells Rolling Stone.


	Federal and state money continues to flow to the project. The state is spending roughly $3 million a year on the project, including the salary of Alaska's highest paid public employee, the Gasline Development Corporation's current president, Frank Richards, who earns nearly $500,000 a year, twice as much as the governor. More than $2 billion has likely been spent on the project over the decades, Persily says, half from the state and half from private companies. 


	Alaska's Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan made Alaska LNG eligible for tens of billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Project backers say a tax credit in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for carbon capture technology could subsidize the project with $600 million a year. 


	Murkowski also secured $4 million from the Department of Energy for a portion of the engineering and design costs that was matched by $4 million in state funds, Glenfarne tells Rolling Stone. The state plans to use an Affordable Energy Fund to subsidize Alaskans' access to gas from the pipeline, according to the Gasline Development Corporation.


	I asked Glenfarne to respond to local communities in the North Slope and Cook Inlet who contend that they are already harmed by oil and gas operations. Glenfarne's spokesperson said, “Repeated public interest surveys show that Alaskans support a North Slope natural gas project by overwhelming majorities because of the project's substantial benefits for the state's residents.”


	The project's fate remains uncertain at best. National Gas Journal recently reported, “The massive costs and potential commercial risks associated with the long-delayed Alaska LNG export project still remain significant impediments for development,” according to an analysis by Rapidan Energy Group. Rapidan expressed doubt that pledges of intent “will translate into binding financial commitments” and predicted the project will not proceed.

	











	“You know, that's one of the enduring mysteries of my life is why do people keep talking about this thing?” asks veteran Alaskan investigative journalist and author, Stan Jones. Jones wrote “Alaska's Pointless Pipe Dream,” a report sponsored by a coalition of Alaskan environmental groups organizing against the project. 


	He later answers his own question: politics. “It's such a petroculture up here politically that I just take it for granted that someone who's from Alaska and wants to get reelected has to go along with it,” Jones tells me. 


	Exxon, Chevron, Shell, Marathon, and many other smaller oil companies operate in Alaska and help to dominate its politics. But ConocoPhillips stands alone as Alaska's largest oil producer, largest lease holder, and the single largest career campaign contributor to the state's ranking politician, Senator Murkowski. ConocoPhillips also knows how to spread its money around. In 2022, it won a long-sought expansion into the Western Arctic, after pouring money across Washington, spending more on lobbying than in the previous decade. 


	Last year, ConocoPhillips was the single largest source of campaign contributions from Alaska to federal campaigns, dwarfing all other sources and giving almost entirely to Republicans. Its political contributions in 2024 eclipsed its own previous records with Political Action Committees affiliated with the company giving $2.5 million apiece to the Republican House and Senate Leadership funds — likely looking to the crucial 2026 mid-term elections that will determine which party controls Congress. Its current lobbying includes permitting reform, Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” and legislation to “unlock our domestic LNG potential.” 


	So, perhaps it's little surprise that Alaska's federal congressional delegation firmly backs the LNG project. Trump pushing it now not only helps him but also likely Alaska Republican Congressman Nick Begich and Senator Sullivan, who are both up for re-election in 2026, Jones concludes. There's also a gubernatorial race and Governor Dunleavy, who is term-limited, is talking about running against Murkowski in 2028. 


	“So, one part performance and one part helping his buddies here in Alaska would be my guess,” Jones says of Trump's Alaskan LNG pipe dream. “It's feel-good campaign fodder that kind of leads to nowhere. It's always off in the future. So, you don't get dinged for saying it's going to happen, and then it doesn't happen.”

	











	But there are real costs associated with the pomp. “If we just focus on this thing, well, what are we not focusing on?” Jones asks. “Most big energy infrastructure investment these days is in renewables, not fossils. To the extent that we are betting our future on a gas pipeline, we're probably betting on the wrong horse.”


	And just because it's not logical, doesn't mean Trump won't do it. Were the project completed, it would release the equivalent of 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide — like burning more than 8 million rail cars full of coal over its 30-year lifetime, even using carbon capture technology. 


	Eight young Alaskans ranging in age from 11 to 22 are suing to stop the project. Sagoonick v. State of Alaska II argues that Alaska's constitution does not allow the state to prioritize fossil fuels above the health, safety, cultures, and future of Alaska's youth who are already experiencing profound harms from the climate crisis bringing flooding, wildfires, and food and water insecurity.

	Begaye's 18-year-old daughter, Ch'eelil Iiná Tchegeownta, is a plaintiff, as is third-generation Alaskan, 21-year-old Linnea Lentfer. Lentfer has spent the majority of her life organizing against fossil fuels and to protect the climate. She joined her first climate lawsuit at the age of 12. In college, she helped organize a successful campaign that led her college to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. The challenge of the current Trump administration is new and all-encompassing, she says. She struggles with questions of where she can make the most impact and whether anything can actually result in change. 


	Ultimately, Lentfer finds solace in a key recognition. “There's nothing worse to do than to not try,” she says.

Yusuf/Cat Stevens has officially postponed his North American book tour due to ongoing visa delays.


	Earlier this month, the singer-songwriter warned fans that the tour — which is in support of his upcoming memoir, Cat on the Road to Findout — was in “serious jeopardy.” The trek was slated to kick off in Philadelphia on Oct. 2, followed by stops in major cities that include New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. 


	“Waiting months for visa approvals, we held out as long as we could,” Yusuf said in a statement. “However, at this point, the production logistics necessary for my show cannot be arranged in time. I am really upset! Not least for my fans who have bought tickets and made travel plans to see me perform.”


	He added, “North American audiences may still get a chance to see the tour if visa approvals eventually come through. Those dates would be some time away because of other travel tour plans but, hopefully, fans will be able to hop on the Peace Train route at some time in the future. Meanwhile, tour delays should not affect the book, which you'll still be able to enjoy… the obvious benefit of it being — books don't need visas!”

	In the summer of 2024, protests in Kenya against an unpopular tax-raising proposal led to at least 60 deaths, mostly at the hands of police, according to a local watchdog group. Undeterred, scores of people took to the streets again this summer to mark the one-year anniversary of the initial mobilization and decry persistent police brutality, corruption, and a prolonged cost-of-living crisis. Just as this recent wave of protests was receding, leaving behind deep concern and uncertainty, one of the country's most beloved bands — Just a Band — was staging a reunion at a party celebrating analytical webzine Africa Is a Country's first print anthology. Fittingly, that issue is all about the past 15 years of protest on the continent.


	Blending dance, hip-hop, funk, and more, the experimental outfit Just a Band, and their leader, Blinky Bill, have often had political undertones, as heard on their 2009 track “Ha-He.” With a music video often credited as the country's first viral one, some of “Ha-He” took aim at the Kenyan establishment. “There's a part of the song where it says [in Swahili], loosely translated, ‘The government doesn't care.' So, for me, I'd rather get myself a really good dog for protection,” Bill tells me.

	











	Many years later, as a soloist, Bill had a more foreboding take, like on his 2023 song “Dracula.” “It was kind of foreshadowing what was happening,” Bill says, reflecting on the last year of protest. “It's just like, ‘If the government and the powers that be don't really listen to us, then we also will not listen to them.'” This year's protests swelled tensely across some major Kenyan cities, where some saw government buildings set ablaze, even more police brutality, and ultimately at least 50 more deaths, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. Embattled President William Ruto attempted to stifle news of the dissent, halting live television broadcasts of the melee until Nairobi's High Court intervened

	“One of the bittersweet things that have come out of the whole protest is how it has spiked a lot of creativity,” says Mutinda Kilonzo, who helps lead Qwani, a Nairobi-based youth arts collective. Qwani members introduced me to music like “Maandamano,” by beloved Kenyan singer Bien, featuring rapper Breeder LW, roughly 10 years his junior at 28 years old. Bien is best known as the frontman of Sauti Sol, one of the continent's biggest bands, which he's spent 20 years shepherding. Though “Maandamano” was released on YouTube last July, it was brought to streaming services this summer as the June 25 protest anniversary approached. Bien and Breeder's reflections on the previous unrest took on a second life.


	Protests are referred to as maandamano in Swahili, and on the track, Breeder's verse, peppered with some English, honors those killed and the resolve to keep fighting, Qwani member Mark Murimiri translates for me. Breeder boasts that their brood is “tribeless” and “partyless” with bass and a matter-of-fact confidence. Meanwhile, each breathy “maandamano” Bien croons on the choir-backed chorus feels like a drop of kerosene on the fiery spirit of the protesters. With the jazzy bounce of laid-back Afrobeats — likely spreading its message even further — “Maandamano” is also filled with visceral sound bites from the demonstrations, from impassioned chants of “Ruto must go” to a senator asking “How do you tear-gas a baddie?” while seemingly praising the protesters on Kenyan television. To date, “Maandamano” has been played more than 2.3 million times on YouTube.


	Meanwhile, Kenyan rapper Octopizzo's “June 25th,” released to commemorate the lives lost when demonstrators stormed Parliament in Nairobi last year, takes a much more somber tone with its sad, twinkling synths and moody guitar. His gravelly croak sounds melodic but grave. The tempo supports his rapid-fire bars, though, balancing heartbreak over those slain with conviction for their cause. His refrain of “June 25th” is bookended with three forceful gunshots.

	Not all of Kenya's protest music is so severe. In his song “Risasi ya Mguu,” popular TikToker Arnold Malcolm satirizes Ruto's now-infamous advice that police shoot alleged vandals in the legs during protests. In one video liked more than 56,000 times on TikTok, children dance to the song by limping to its twangy beat, convulsing with rolled eyes and dangling tongues. Later, half of them mime shooting the others, who are retreating with their hands up. “I feel like for a long time, you would find [that] young people had given up on the country, saying they're not really into politics or they don't care about those things; they're the things for their parents,” says Qwani's Tresor Birhange. “But art provided a way for the younger generation to now resonate — and maybe feel that sense of responsibility to take action.”

	President Donald Trump appears keen on reviving his roundly criticized threat to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside the United States.


	Trump made the announcement on Truth Social Monday, Sept. 29, writing, “Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing ‘candy from a baby.' California, with its weak and incompetent Governor [Gavin Newsom], has been particularly hard hit! Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.” 


	Like the last time he threatened to slap a 100 percent tariff on films made outside the U.S., Trump did not say when or how the tariff would be enacted. He first raised the prospect of the film tariffs in May, but there was no follow through.


	As Trump's post did note, film and television jobs in the United States, especially in California, have declined significantly in recent years because of high production costs and fewer tax incentives. But while many Hollywood productions have gone overseas in search of lucrative inducements, there are still plenty of creative — and non-economic — reasons a film would shoot outside the United States. Ostensibly, Trump's tariff would affect all of these productions if implemented.

	











	Unsurprisingly, Hollywood has balked at the plan — both because of the havoc it would wreak on the industry, and because of its general unfeasibility. As one industry source told CNN back when the first tariff announcement was made, “On first blush, it's shocking and would represent a virtually complete halt of production. But in reality, he has no jurisdiction to do this and it's too complex to enforce.”

	Following Trump's initial tariff announcement, one of his own hand-picked “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, Jon Voight, shared a plan for revitalizing the U.S. film industry that did not contain anything close to a 100 percent tariff on foreign productions. He suggested, instead, a combination of federal tax incentives, tax-code changes, co-production treaties, and infrastructure subsidies for theater owners, production, and postproduction companies. At most, Voight called for “tariffs in certain limited circumstances.” 


	A rep for Voight said the actor did not have any comment on Trump's latest tariff call.

A respected congressman has claimed that advanced alien beings could be hiding out in 'five or six' underwater UFO bases right off the US coast.

Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee overseeing UFO reports, drew massive attention on social media after saying that he believed there were alien 'entities' currently living in deep-water areas on Earth.

The September 17 clip posted on X has already been viewed more than 1.9 million times.

During the sidewalk interview with Matt Laslo, reposted online by a UFO researcher who goes by the pseudonym Red Panda Koala, Burchett suggested that advanced alien beings or civilizations may have been hiding in Earth's oceans for generations.

He added that there have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft around five or six specific deep-sea areas, which he found significant given how little is known about the ocean compared to the moon's surface.

The congressman also noted that US Navy personnel have reported chasing these underwater craft that move at extraordinary speeds and far surpass the abilities of current US military technology.

Despite these claims, no verifiable physical evidence, such as artifacts or clear footage of these underwater craft, has been publicly presented to confirm the existence of alien bases.

Skeptics have argued that the reliance on anecdotal reports from naval personnel and the lack of peer-reviewed scientific data casts significant doubt on the claims made during recent congressional hearings on UFO phenomena.

UFO researcher Dr Michael Salla said these bases are believed to be in a region of the Atlantic near the Bahamas

Following the explosive revelations, Dr Michael Salla, an author and researcher focused on extraterrestrial phenomena, revealed where it's believed these UFO bases may be, singling out a region of the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas.

He added that he's also spoken to credible whistleblowers, including senior military and executive branch officials, who confirm the existence of underwater bases and advanced craft.

Dr Salla highlighted that the US Navy operates a top-secret underwater facility he likened to Area 51 called AUTEC, which stands for the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center, right in this region of the Atlantic.

'Just to the right of it is Tongue of the Ocean, which is a very deep part of the ocean there in the Bahamas. It drops off immediately around 3,000 feet,' Salla said while appearing on the Redacted podcast on September 19.

'So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water. So, there have been a lot of UFO sightings in that area,' he revealed.

The UFO researcher noted that he had interviewed two eyewitnesses who claimed that they had visited these secret bases, including one who was a US Army whistleblower who used the pseudonym 'JP.'

The whistleblower claimed he was on a mission where he was taken by a Blackhawk helicopter to an ocean platform, then boarded a high-tech submarine crewed by tall, Nordic-looking extraterrestrials.

The submarine, capable of space travel, took him to an underwater city under a dome, resembling Dubai, with a large white pyramid. The mission involved retrieving an artifact, but no physical evidence of this mission has ever been produced.

Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri recently revealed video of a US military drone striking an orb-shaped UFO with a missile, which bounced off and did not stop the craft

Despite Burchett and Salla's lack of tangible evidence, there has been growing interest and testimony from credible sources, including military personnel at congressional hearings, suggesting that UFOs and extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth. 

A recent congressional hearing on September 9 featured new whistleblowers who shared their experiences with UFOs, including a video showing an orb-like object surviving a missile strike and splitting into four parts they kept flying.

'We have naval personnel telling me we have these sightings, these underwater craft they're chasing that go hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we got is something that does maybe a little under forty miles an hour,' Burchett said in the interview with Laslo.

'So I got a lot of questions about that stuff.'

In recent weeks, a photo allegedly depicting a massive, disc-shaped object hovering hundreds of feet above the ground has sparked widespread debate and intrigue. The image was presented by Luis “Lue” Elizondo, a former U.S. Army counterintelligence officer and prominent figure in the UFO community, during a House Oversight and Accountability Committee meeting. The event, hosted by the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Fund, aimed to bring attention to the ongoing mystery surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). However, what initially seemed like compelling evidence of extraterrestrial activity quickly unraveled into a case of mistaken identity, leading to significant scrutiny and skepticism.

The image in question was reportedly captured by a civilian pilot and showed a silver-hued, disc-shaped object that was estimated to be between 600 and 1,000 feet in diameter. This revelation was shared during a panel titled “Science, National Security & Innovation,” where multiple speakers, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, were in attendance. Elizondo, who has been vocal about the need for transparency regarding UAPs, used the photo to call for a full declassification and scientific analysis of such occurrences.

Despite the initial excitement surrounding the photo, Elizondo admitted he could not verify its authenticity, as he did not take the picture himself. According to him, the image was provided by a private pilot just hours before the forum. This admission, coupled with the lack of due diligence, cast doubt on the photo's credibility and highlighted the challenges faced by those seeking to uncover the truth about UAPs.

The photo quickly attracted attention on social media platforms, particularly Reddit, where users began to scrutinize its authenticity. In the r/UFOs community, known for its openness to conspiracy theories, a user named mattperkins86 traced the image back to a satellite photo of two adjacent circular fields near Colorado Springs. The darker circle appeared to be a shadow of the lighter circle, suggesting a natural, terrestrial explanation rather than an extraterrestrial one.

This discovery prompted ridicule and criticism of Elizondo's presentation, with some users expressing disbelief at what they perceived as a blatant oversight. UFO debunker Mick West further examined the image, finding inconsistencies in the shadows, which contradicted the claim of an object floating in the sky. These revelations underscored the importance of thorough investigation and verification in the pursuit of credible evidence.

In response to the backlash, Elizondo took to social media to clarify his position. He explained that the dimensions he quoted were based on the pilot's assessment and that the photo had not been vetted prior to the forum. Despite acknowledging the need for careful examination, Elizondo maintained that the incident highlighted the stigma and ridicule faced by those reporting UFO sightings.

Elizondo, who resigned from the Department of Defense in 2017 over bureaucratic challenges related to UAP investigations, has been a vocal advocate for the release of classified information on the subject. However, his efforts have often been marred by controversies and debunked claims, such as a previous incident involving a photo of a cloud mistaken for a ""mothership"" UFO. These missteps have raised questions about the credibility of his assertions and the broader movement for transparency.

The recent incident has implications for the broader movement advocating for disclosure of UAP-related information. While Elizondo's presentation was intended to advance the cause, the exposure of the photo's terrestrial origins has instead fueled skepticism and undermined the credibility of the UAP Disclosure Fund. Critics argue that such blunders detract from the legitimate scientific inquiry and risk further stigmatizing the subject.

Despite these setbacks, the fascination with UAPs continues to captivate both the public and the scientific community. The ongoing debate highlights the need for rigorous scientific investigation and open dialogue about the potential implications of unidentified aerial phenomena. As the search for answers persists, the challenge remains to balance skepticism with genuine inquiry, ensuring that future revelations are grounded in verifiable evidence.

The controversy surrounding the recent photo of a purported UFO serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in the pursuit of the unknown. While the image ultimately proved to be a case of mistaken identity, it underscores the enduring intrigue and debate surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena. As researchers and enthusiasts continue to explore this enigmatic subject, one question remains: How can we ensure that the quest for knowledge is driven by evidence and scientific integrity, rather than sensationalism and speculation?

Wow, I can't believe someone tried to pass off farm fields as a UFO! 🤣

Wow, this is hilarious! A farm field mistaken for a UFO? 😂

How could a former army officer make such a blunder? Seems like someone needs new glasses! 🕶️

Why wasn't the photo verified before it was presented to Congress? Seems like a major oversight.

Thank you for the detailed article. It's a good reminder to always verify our sources.

Elizondo should have done his homework. This kind of mistake doesn't help the credibility of UFO researchers.

Is there any chance that the farm fields are actually a secret alien base? 🤔

Thank you for the article! It's important to highlight these incidents to keep the conversation grounded in reality.

This is why scientific rigor is so important. Mistakes like this can damage credibility.

Did anyone else notice how quickly Reddit users debunked the photo? Props to the online sleuths! 🕵️‍♂️

So, was the photo really just a shadow? That's insane!

Honestly, how can anyone take this seriously when such errors are made? It's embarrassing.

I feel bad for Elizondo. He probably just got excited about the news.

This incident shows how crucial it is to have rigorous scientific investigation in these matters.

Researcher Dr Michael Salla even linked the claims to a secretive Atlantic facility near the Bahamas, dubbed “Area 51 underwater”

A sitting US Congressman has ignited widespread debate with claims that aliens might not be arriving from faraway galaxies but could already be inhabiting Earth's oceans.

Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee which reviews UFO reports, was filmed in a casual sidewalk interview with UFO researcher and documentary maker “Red Panda Koala” near the US Capitol. In the clip, posted to X on 17 September, Burchett proposed that alien entities may have established underwater bases in the Atlantic Ocean.

“What if these are entities that are here on this earth, that have been on this earth for who knows how long, and we think they're coming from way out. Maybe they did a millennia ago, but they're here, and they're in these deep water areas,” Burchett said.

The Congressman also claimed that US Navy personnel had reported multiple sightings of unidentified underwater craft at “five or six” specific ocean locations. According to him, these objects were capable of speeds far beyond the limits of existing American military technology. “We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings … of these underwater crafts that they're chasing,” he added.

Supporting these remarks, Dr Michael Salla, a researcher specialising in extraterrestrial phenomena, pointed to a region near the Bahamas where the US Navy operates the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center (AUTEC). The highly classified facility, often compared to an “Area 51 underwater,” lies close to the Tongue of the Ocean — a deep marine trench plunging around 3,000 feet.

“That's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water,” Salla explained during an appearance on the Redacted podcast on 19 September.

While there is no verified evidence of extraterrestrial underwater bases, Burchett's remarks have added to a growing list of UFO-related claims made by US officials in recent years. His comments have since gone viral, fuelling speculation and renewed debate about what lies hidden beneath the oceans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","The 20 greatest movies about making first contact","https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/the_20_best_movies_about_first_contact/s1__42791821","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:02:12 GMT","

The idea of contact with extraterrestrial life is something that continues to haunt the popular imagination, so it is not surprising that it appears consistently in movies. After all, there's something both exciting and terrifying about the thought that there might be life out there beyond the stars. What's particularly notable about the movies' exploration of first contact is just how many forms this story takes. Whether it's a B-movie, a comedy, or an elevated piece of sci-fi storytelling, the movies have proven to be fertile ground for exploring the exchange of cultures between humans and extraterrestrials.  

Contact  is one of those films that is both thought-provoking and also quite beautiful to watch, and much of that is due to both Robert Zemeckis' direction and Jodie Foster's performance. She portrays a scientist who, driven by the death of her father when she was young, attempts to discover signs of extraterrestrial life. It's the kind of film that doesn't talk down to its audience, but instead takes them on an extraordinary journey of discovery. As such, it's a fitting homage to Carl Sagan, the author of the original novel, who died before the movie was released. 

 Stanley Kubrick's  2001: A Space Odyssey is often seen as the benchmark against which epic sci-fi is measured. It's easy to see why this would be the case, as the film is operatic and achingly beautiful in its ambitions. One of the key plot elements of the film involves the giant monoliths, which, it turns out, are key to humanity's various developments. The film remains as thought-provoking and beautiful as it was when it was first released in 1968, serving as a testament to what sci-fi cinema can achieve.

Several years before he appeared in the Star Wars  sequel trilogy, John Boyega showed his acting chops in  Attack the Block. It's a brilliant mash-up of science fiction and comedy, but it's also a remarkably insightful examination of class and race in 2010s Britain, particularly since so much of the action takes place in public housing. It definitely leans into its own B-movie approach to the material, and, among other things, the film demonstrates why Boyega was the perfect choice to appear in a sprawling franchise like Star Wars. 

Flight of the Navigator is peak 1980s sci-fi cinema, perfectly blending the conventions of science fiction and adventure. Joey Cramer is also perfectly cast as David Freeman, whose encounter with a spaceship leads him to jump several years into the future. Ultimately, of course, David establishes a strange bond with the ship itself. It's a film that is often surprisingly heart-warming, in the proud tradition of 1980s American movies, because when it comes down to it, there's no bond quite like that between a boy and his spaceship.

Wonder and terror go hand in hand in the film Annihilation,  which stars Natalie Portman as a scientist whose team investigates a mysterious entity known as the Shimmer. As it turns out, the Shimmer is essentially an entity that has the power to shape and change DNA, with results that are often beautiful but which can also be absolutely horrifying. The film speaks of American culture's ongoing anxiety about the threat of the alien and the unknown, and, ultimately, it speaks to a fear that humans may not be as in control of their bodies as they might like to believe. 

 Steven Spielberg has repeatedly shown an interest in alien stories, and there's no doubt he's directed some of the best.  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was a mainstay for Gen X and older millennials, and it features the trademark Spielberg sentimentality without getting overwhelmed by it. Indeed, even many years after its release, the film retains its power to charm and enchant, and its titular character remains endearingly both ugly and cute, as he was when the film was first released in 1982.

Galaxy Quest is that rare gem of a movie: one that manages to keep its science fiction and comedy elements in perfect balance. It's quite obviously a riff off of Star Trek  and its devoted fandom, but it's also a humorous look at the sci-fi trope of first contact. It also features a cast that is nothing short of comedy gold. In addition to Tim Allen, it also stars Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver (arguably the most famous woman in sci-fi), and Tony Shalhoub. In an age of constant franchises, it becomes more relevant with every year. 

Viewers who wanted to learn more about the sinister creatures from A Quiet Place got their wish with A Quiet Place: Day One.  As its title suggests, it focuses on the day that the beings known as Death Angels came to Earth and started to wreak havoc. Though it doesn't shy away from the terror and the horror, it's really the deeply human performances from both Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn that help this film to stand apart and become something more than just another entry in a franchise.  

Steven Spielberg has long been fascinated by aliens and humanity's encounters with life beyond Earth. This is evident in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which focuses on two people whose lives are irrevocably changed by their encounters with extraterrestrials. It's one of those films that is peak early Spielberg, with a sense of wonder that encompasses both the vast reaches of space and the human spirit. It's thus easy to see why it has continued to enchant audiences and why it remains so beloved.

The 1950s were something of a golden age for sci-fi movies. The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of those films that is very much of its time and yet also relevant, focusing as it does on the arrival of a powerful alien that demands that humans stop trying to destroy one another before they are themselves destroyed by other races that see them as a destabilizing threat. The film crystallizes the anxieties about atomic energy and humanity's reckless drive to destroy itself, and its selection for preservation in the Library of Congress is a testament to its influence.

 Few filmmakers working today have as acute an understanding of science fiction as Denis Villeneuve. In  Arrival,  he managed to make a film that was both visually stunning and also thought-provoking. Among other things, it is a fascinating exploration of the power and importance of language. It certainly helps that the entire film is anchored by Amy Adams' performance as linguist Louise Banks, one that earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in Motion Picture–Drama. 

A Quiet Place  proved without doubt that John Krasinski was a bit of a wizard both behind and in front of the camera. The film offers a unique spin on the alien invasion concept, this time involving extraterrestrial beings that hunt by sound. The film is a tightly woven and terrifying look at life after first contact, and though it ends with the humans finally finding a means of fighting back against the invaders, there's also no doubt that it will take a lot to attain final victory. 

 Few first contact films have had quite as much of an enduring influence as Ridley Scott's  Alien. From the terrifying and viscerally horrifying Xenomorph, whose creature design remains unmatched, to the formidable heroine that is Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, there's much about this film that still resonates and entertains. What's more, its message about the corrosive and destructive power of corporate greed remains relevant, as evident in Alien: Earth, the current TV series set long before the events of the film.  

District 9 is one of those sci-fi films that, once seen, is never forgotten. Set in South Africa, it focuses on Wikus van de Merwe, who finds his life and fate inextricably intertwined with a group of extraterrestrials that have been essentially imprisoned on Earth. It's one of those first contact films that uses this particular sci-fi trope to ask deep questions, not just about humanity's place in the universe but even what constitutes personhood and whether one has to be a human in order to be given that identity. 

M. Night Shyamalan has earned a reputation for his use of twist endings, not all of which are particularly effective. Signs is often seen as one of his better films, though the twist at the end is arguably a bit hackneyed. Nevertheless, the film does a nice job of capturing a sense of looming dread, and, just as importantly, it also emphasizes the human stakes involved when an alien race decides to take over the planet. Like the best science fiction, it also grapples with larger moral and philosophical questions, which lend the monster movie aspect more depth.

Roland Emmerich may not be a darling with the critics, but there's no doubt that he knows how to put together a big-budget film spectacle. One of his most successful would have to be Independence Day, which focuses on an alien invasion and efforts to defeat it. The film has many notable action set-pieces, but arguably the most memorable is the one in which a giant spaceship destroys the White House itself. It is, in some ways, the most powerful moment in ‘90s sci-fi, so it's easy to see why the film became a box office phenomenon.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers was given a new lease on life in 1978 with the release of a new adaptation. Like its predecessor, it focuses on a group of people struggling to survive in the aftermath of the sinister aliens who replace humans through pods. Though it has many terrifying scenes, arguably the final scene is the film's signature moment. Also like the 1950s version, it is an expression and reflection of America at the end of the 1970s, when consumerism was on the rise and a sense of futility and fatalism seemed to be everywhere.

Jack Finney's novel The Body Snatchers has the distinction of being adapted several times for the screen, but one of the best is the original film adaptation from 1956. With its story about aliens that take over the bodies of their hosts through pods, it is the perfect encapsulation of many of the anxieties and concerns percolating in Cold War America. It has steadily gained a reputation as one of the finest and most terrifying sci-fi films ever made, and it continues to fascinate as an expression of American society's deep-seated angst about communism.

If there's one filmmaker who has made his name in crafting science fiction that is both beautiful and thought-provoking, it is James Cameron. One of his lesser-known gems is The Abyss, which focuses on a group of humans extracting a sunken submarine, only to discover that there is an alien city deep beneath the ocean's surface. As always, Cameron knows how to wed together big-screen spectacle with thought-provoking philosophy, and the film has only improved with the release of a special edition years after its initial release. 

 H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel about the horrors of first contact has inspired more than its fair share of adaptations. Arguably, however, one of the best is the 2005 version. Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise, it's the perfect meeting of material, director, and star. It manages to capture so much of what makes Wells' novel so enduringly compelling and terrifying, and it's a humbling reminder that humans may not be the masters of the universe that they often imagine themselves to be.

Olivia Burke

A woman has told how she believes a psychic 'predicted' her horror accident, which left her needing part of her skull removed.

Hannah Roper visited a fortune teller in April last year, who she claims told her to be wary if she ever visited the nearby town of Fenton, Staffordshire.

After supposedly looking into the future, the clairvoyant warned the 24-year-old to 'watch her drink' if she ever did end up in the area. From there on out, Hannah avoided the place for 'months' after being spooked by the psychic's hunch - and when she finally found herself in Fenton, the carer ended up leaving in an ambulance.

Advert

Disaster struck shortly after she had shared a bottle of rosé wine with a pal in a local pub in October last year.

Take a look at this:

She ended up going back to her friend's boyfriend's house and at one point nipped to the loo - but unfortunately, she never made it there.

""We didn't drink much more,"" Hannah explained. ""I said I was going to the toilet, and then she heard a 'bang' and I was at the bottom of the [cellar] stairs.""

Advert

The carer suspects she accidentally mistook the cellar door for the bathroom one, seeing her 'slip down' the staircase.

Hannah continued: ""I was bleeding from my nose and my ear, and I was in and out of consciousness.

""They put me in the recovery position because I was being sick. I had no bruises, so I must have just hit my head.

""All I remember then is being at the hospital, but I don't remember much because of the injury and because I was on very strong painkillers.

""Doctors said that if they hadn't called the ambulance I would have died. A silly drunk mistake could have cost me my life.""

Advert

After arriving at The Royal Stoke University Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, Hannah was diagnosed with a bleed on the brain.

Medics informed her that part of the left side of her skull needed to be removed to relieve the pressure and reduce the swelling.

""Within 10 minutes they had told my mum I needed to be taken into surgery else I would die before the end of the night,"" Hannah said.

She underwent a three-hour emergency surgery where half of the left side of her skull was removed, and a drain was fitted into her head to unload the blood from her brain to reduce the swelling.

Advert

During her two-week hospital stay, it dawned on Hannah that the psychic she had visited in 2024 had forewarned her about visiting Fenton after having a drink.

Recalling the premonition, Hannah said: ""There's a town near me called Fenton, and she asked if I ever go out there. I said I sometimes do. 

""She told me to be careful and watch my drink. I didn't go for months, and then I went, and this happened. She predicted my accident.""

Hannah was forced to spend the following five months wearing a helmet to protect her exposed brain before she underwent a second surgery this year.

Advert

The three-hour operation in April allowed medics to insert a metal plate into her head to replace the part of her skull which was removed.

""I will now have a metal plate in my head for life,"" Hannah explained. ""Part of my head is going to be metal for life.""

Thankfully, she says she has not been left with any permanent brain damage after her traumatic fall - but she does get extremely fatigued and dizzy daily.

""Because it's an injury to my brain, it can affect everything,"" Hannah explained. ""I went away in August in Spain, and [my injury] affected my temperature control, and I was sick every day.

""I now have hormonal imbalances because of it too now.""

Ahead of her second operation, almost five months ago, Hannah shaved her entire head and raised more than £2,000 for the brain injury charity, Headway.

She has been wearing wigs while her hair grows back.

Over the weekend, the president of the United States posted an A.I.-generated video of himself making a major announcement. The post, which was made on TruthSocial, prompted an online furor among those familiar with conspiracy theories, because it promoted a particularly fringe one, even by the standards of an administration that has pushed anti-vaccine paranoia onto the public and advanced widespread falsehoods about a presidential election. The theory, which revolves around something called a “medbed,” is pulled from the strangest, most paranoid corners of the conspiracy world—not something one of the most powerful world leaders should be tapped into. Let's get into it.

So, what exactly happened?

At 10:19 p.m. Saturday, Donald Trump's account posted a 37-second video on TruthSocial. The video, which was A.I.-generated, was meant to look like a Fox News segment announcing the arrival of a medbed hospital—a kind of fantastical facility that uses advanced technology to more or less magically treat everything that ails the human body. Remarkably, the video included an A.I.-generated video of Trump himself talking; the promotion of this video from his account seemed, bafflingly, to make the announcement look legitimate. Trump has never posted anything like this before—an A.I.-generated version of him announcing news, giving life to a fringe conspiracy theory—on any of his accounts.

The next morning, the account deleted the post.

What did the video say?

It announced “the launch of America's first medbed hospital and a national medbed card for every citizen.” It showed B-roll shots of gleaming hospitals with futuristic-looking technology. An A.I.-generated version of Trump, speaking with low energy from the Resolute Desk, says, “Every American will soon receive their own medbed card. With it, you'll have guaranteed access to our new hospitals, led by the top doctors in the nation, equipped with the most advanced technology in the world. These facilities are safe, modern, and designed to return every citizen to full health and strength. This is the beginning of a new era in American health care.” An A.I.-generated version of Lara Trump, speaking as a Fox News host, then clarifies that there will first only be a limited number available and that registration details would be announced soon. Trump's post came without commentary—just the video.

OK, then. What is a medbed? 

To be abundantly clear, medbeds are not real. But per the conspiracy theory, a medbed is a kind of extremely advanced technology capable of healing the human body of literally everything, including natural aging. They're often thought of as pods of some kind. In the telling of the conspiracy theory, it may have an alien origin or a mystical origin or just be breathtakingly advanced science. A medbed has no limits to what it can do.

My goodness. Where does that come from?

Mostly, it comes from the QAnon world. For years, Q influencers have hyped it as a way to promise a kind of golden future on the other side of their revolution. Medbeds are one of the many exciting promises that were supposed to come after the Storm, the long-promised mass roundup of the evil cabal members at the center of the QAnon conspiracy theories. At times, medbeds have also been useful for connected conspiracy theories, explaining how some figure—an assassinated John F. Kennedy, for example—who should have died long ago is still alive.

In the theory, how is it this technology exists but has not been in use?

Well, as with so many conspiracy theories, there are variations. Some people believe that medbed technology is in development but still somewhat theoretical, or that it's already here but being suppressed by evil actors—sometimes the cabal, sometimes the pharmaceutical industry, keen on keeping people sick. Other variations have it that the elite have had access to medbeds for years and have hoarded the technology for themselves. But some in the community believe that under Trump, it's being quietly tested and rolled out for the public. Some QAnon influencers have even claimed to have firsthand or secondhand experience with medbeds.

Uh-oh. Does that mean there's a grift element?

Unfortunately, yes. As the Daily Beast has detailed, some companies sell devices they describe as medbeds, invoking some kind of New Age healing promises or other nonsense science. These devices are advertised as having the ability to do some pretty miraculous things, including heal terminal cancer. Some cost tens of thousands of dollars. There are also medbed clinics, where people can pay to receive quack treatments from people who claim to have working medbeds.

Oh no. 

Right. Medbed theories, at their core, are deeply depressing, because they offer false hope to people with pretty desperate situations. At their least harmful, they're a way of making healthy people excited about some kind of futuristic golden age without suffering. At their most harmful, they encourage desperate people with debilitating or life-threatening medical conditions to turn away from legitimate medical science and possibly spend fortunes on useless woo-woo junk.

Why on earth would Trump promote this?

It's unclear. Trump does often promote QAnon content, but it typically doesn't involve anything as fantastical as medbeds. It's possible it was someone else who had control of his account, but we don't know. Sometimes, Trump appears to enjoy what he sees as hyperbolic, semi-trolling claims of his greatness, as when he reposts videos of him as a muscular wrestler or some other heroic figure; it's possible he or someone with account access thought this was harmless fun. If so, he underestimated the level at which conspiracy theorists actually buy into these ideas. It's also possible that he wants to continue to string along his QAnon supporters, some of whom are growing restless, particularly after Trump failed to expose Democrats and other “deep state” actors with Epstein's “client list.”

Do we know where this video came from?

No, but it's certainly not a Trump original. It's unclear how Trump himself stumbled upon this video, but one journalist found it on a couple of scam Instagram pages. On TruthSocial, it was shared by at least one QAnon account before Trump posted it.

How has the right-wing-conspiracy-theory world responded to the video?

Most of the community seems aware that it's A.I. and aren't being fooled into thinking it's a genuine Fox News segment. (That being said: Many people—often older people—do have a hard time discerning what is real and what is not with A.I.-generated content, so it is very likely that some people will encounter this video on Facebook and take it at face value.) But, judging by posts on TruthSocial and activity from known QAnon accounts on X, some see the post as a message from Trump that medbeds are indeed on their way, possibly thanks to advances from A.I. technology. Others have other, convoluted theories about some play he's making related to A.I. Perhaps predictably, others have been using the post to boost their own scams, latching onto the moment to peddle their medbed products or even try to sell the medbed cards promised in the video.

So this post may actually cause sick people real harm?

It does seem very possible, yes. Trump deleted the video, limiting its harm to some degree, but some will choose to see the deletion not as a retraction but as part of the secret form of communication he uses for his most devoted followers. Trump has a huge audience, and he's a near-messianic figure for some of these people; even if the medbed post was meant as a joke—and nothing he has said or written has indicated it was—people will almost certainly latch onto this post as a coded message, telling them to turn away from the corrupt medical community and hold out for something better. For people facing life-threatening illnesses, such false hope can be deadly.

Earlier this year, the Mason County Sheriff's Office announced they were tracking down new leads in the 1993 killing of Scottville teen Melissa Simmons.

She was last seen alive in June of 1993.

“Scottville is an area where the kids walk to school every day,” Mason County Sheriff Kim Cole said. “It is Norman Rockwell's America. To have a 15-year-old girl just go missing and then be found murdered, days later. It's everything that is wrong in our country. When you put it into a small community, it just amplifies it, because those things aren't supposed to happen here, and they're not supposed to happen in Scottville, Michigan.”

In this article

Electronic Arts said Monday that it has agreed to be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in an all-cash deal worth $55 billion.

Shareholders of the company will receive $210 per share in cash.

EA's stock climbed 5% on Monday. The shares gained about 15% on Friday, closing at $193.35, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was nearing a deal to go private.

PIF is rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company and will, by far, be the majority investor in the new structure, people close to the deal told CNBC's David Faber.

The acquisition is the latest in a ""recent gaming spree"" by the Saudi PIF, which has been active in gaming since 2022, analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note early Monday.

The fund's gaming arm, Savvy Gaming, has taken stakes in public video gaming publishers and bought ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely, the analysts noted, but the deal for EA is ""the biggest such move to date by some distance."" 

Affinity CEO Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, touted EA's ""bold vision ​for ​the ​future"" in a release announcing the deal.

""I've admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids - I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead,"" Kushner said in a statement.

The group of companies is making a total $36 billion equity investment, with $20 billion in debt financing from JPMorgan, according to the release. JPMorgan was brought in a couple of weeks ago, people familiar with the deal told Faber.

The take-private deal for the maker of popular games like Battlefield, The Sims and the Madden series of NFL games, among others, is set to be the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.

In a note to employees, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said he is ""excited to continue as CEO.""

""Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment,"" he wrote. ""They are committed with conviction to EA – they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together.""

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027.

There is a 45-day window to allow for other proposals, people familiar with the terms of the deal told Faber. The deal talks started in the spring, the people said.

Silver Lake, which is led by co-CEOs Egon Durban and Greg Mondre, is also one of the key investors in Trump's push to get TikTok under U.S. control.

CNBC has reached out to EA for further comment and information on the deal.

The S&P 500 inched up on Monday as Wall Street tried to regain its footing after a week in which the artificial intelligence trade lost some steam.

The broad market index climbed 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, however, falling 60 points, or 0.1%.

AI chip darling Nvidia rose after skepticism around the AI trade put pressure on the broader stock market last week. Some traders even questioned whether there was enough energy to power an infrastructure plan between Nvidia and OpenAI. Nvidia was last higher by 2%. Other AI stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology added 2% and 3%, respectively.

Meanwhile, shares of Electronic Arts jumped 4% after the video game company announced that it's going to be taken private in a $55 billion deal. U.S. M&A announced has surpassed $1 trillion year-to-date so far this year, up 29% from the same time a year ago, according to Goldman Sachs.

U.S. stocks slipped last week as cracks appeared in a key pillar of the bull market rally — enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence buildout. The S&P 500 saw its worst weekly performance since Aug. 1. The Nasdaq also recorded its weakest week since early August, and the Dow posted first loss in three weeks.

But Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays, believes that capital expenditures in the AI industry is still ultimately providing a boost to the market.

""The AI capex story is showing no signs of slowdown. Moreover, other industries have also been benefiting from the tidal wave of AI infrastructure spend,"" he said in a note on Monday. ""Concentration warrants some caution, but with AI gaining momentum as the focal point of global growth, S&P 500 should be well-positioned vs. peers given its Tech-heavy sector mix.""

All eyes are watching for a possible shutdown of the federal government as this week's funding deadline looms. The Labor Department is preparing to not release any data, including the September nonfarm payrolls report that was slated for release Friday, if a shutdown cannot be averted. Additionally, President Donald Trump told NBC News over the weekend that mass firings of federal workers could take place in the event of a shutdown.

""We are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis,"" the president said, adding that he'd ""rather not do that.""

Government shutdowns have historically not impacted markets much, but sentiment could take a hit if any delays around the release of key economic data muddy the interest rate outlook for the Federal Reserve.

The market is still poised for modest gains for the month of September. The S&P 500 has increased 3% this month, while the Dow has risen 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has been the outperformer with a 5% rally.

Coal stocks are rising after the Trump administration unveiled a plan to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to keep power plants from closing. 

Peabody Energy jumped nearly 8%, Ramaco Resources rose more than 3%, and Core Natural Resources was up more than 1%.

The Department of Energy will invest $625 million to support the struggling industry, with $350 million dedicated  to upgrade and recommission coal plants. 

And the Interior Department announced Monday it would make 13.1 milion acres of federal land available for the industry to lease.

President Donald Trump signed a series of exceutive orders in April aimed at boosting coal production in the U.S. The coal inudstry has struggled as plants have been displaced by cheaper natural gas and renewable energy in recent years.

The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking ""to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse.""

While the department's scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors. The DOL, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has several key reports upcoming that will provide important clues about the direction of the economy and inform Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of their next meeting in October.

""BLS will suspend all operations,"" the 73-page plan stated. ""Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released.""

Alibaba shares gained about 4% on Monday, reaching a fresh 52-week high, after Morgan Stanley earlier lifted its price target on the Chinese cloud giant.

After Alibaba's Apsara Conference 2025, analyst Gary Yu walked away more bullish on the company's cloud revenue business, upgrades in its AI models and accelerating international expansion. He maintained his overweight rating on the stock while lifting his price target by $40 to $200, which suggests 16.3% potential upside from its latest close. 

Yu pointed out that Alibaba management during the conference highlighted strong demand, saying the number of tokens it was processing has been doubling every 2 to 3 months.

""BABA also announced new developments during the conference, such as 1) its flagship model Qwen3-Max (ranking top 3 globally) and Bailian agent platform upgrades, 2) partnership with NVIDIA on physical AI, and 3) accelerating overseas expansion with the first data centers launching in Brazil, France, Netherlands etc,"" Yu added. ""We expect these initiatives, in addition to increased capex, to further accelerate cloud growth, and thus we raise our cloud growth estimates to 32% for F26 and 40% for F27 (vs. 30% for each of F26 and F27 previously.""

Novo Nordisk could be due for even more losses over the coming months, spurred by a pullback in the growth rate of U.S. GLP-1 prescriptions, according to Morgan Stanley.

U.S. shares of the Danish pharmaceutical giant were under pressure in late morning trading Monday after analyst Thibault Boutherin downgraded the stock to underweight from equal-weight, saying that there's a ""tough path ahead."" The analyst also cut his price target to $47 from $59, which reflects more than 15% downside from Friday's close.

""We expect downward revisions to 2026-27 consensus from slower US GLP-1 prescription growth and competitive pressure, and we see catalysts with downside risk over the next 6 months,"" Boutherin wrote on Monday. He added that a ""lack of momentum"" in U.S. prescriptions for Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus specifically makes him ""cautious on the short-term growth profile.""

""As the window before semaglutide US/EU [Loss of Exclusivity] narrows, we expect valuation multiples to compress,"" Boutherin also said.

Monday's losses put the stock's year-to-date fall at more than 35%.

Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Monday said the U.S. central bank faces challenges as it attempts to balance fighting stubborn inflation or protecting jobs.

""On the inflation side right now, I continue to be worried about where we are from an inflation perspective,"" Hammack told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""We have been missing our mandate on the inflation side, our objective of 2%, for more than four-and-a-half years and I continue to see that we have pressure in inflation both in the headline, in the core, and particularly, where I am worried about it, is I'm seeing it in the services,"" she added.

Asked whether it is mistake for the Federal Reserve to be cutting interest rates given the economic backdrop, Hammack described it as ""a challenging time for monetary policy,"" saying the U.S. central bank was facing pressure on both sides of its mandate.

There was more good news for the housing market Monday as pending home sales unexpectedly rose in August.

The National Association of Realtors reported that houses under contact increased 4% for the month, much better than the Dow Jones forecast for no change.

""Lower mortgage rates are enabling more homebuyers to go under contract. In the Midwest, low mortgage rates combined with high levels of affordability are attracting more buyers compared to other regions,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.

Borrowing costs declined during the month, with a typical 30-year mortgage rate falling from 6.75% to 6.58%, according to Bankrate.

President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he's going to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas.

""Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing 'candy from a baby.' California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. ""Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.""

Trump first announced such plans early May. He previously said foreign productions could be a national security threat.

Shares of media and entertainment companies came under pressure Monday on the heels of the announcement. Warner Bros Discovery and Comcast, for example, dipped 0.5%. Others like Disney and Netflix were last higher, however, after initially falling in premarket trading.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

There could be more room to run for stocks, according to Goldman Sachs.

The firm upgraded global equities to overweight from neutral for the next three months, saying that ""good earnings growth, Fed easing without a recession and global fiscal policy easing will continue to support equities.""

""Markets have continued with their 'risk on' shift supported by a Goldilocks backdrop based on optimistic growth expectations (boosted by AI) with dovish Fed expectations,"" said Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman's head of asset allocation research in London, in a Monday note. ""While Goldilocks regimes with strong growth and low inflation can last for a long time as seen since the 1990s, the current backdrop is different as weak labor market conditions drive Fed dovishness rather than anchored inflation. 

Mueller-Glissmann noted that investor sentiment and positioning has ""not picked up materially"" even with the risk-on performance in the market.

""Unlike previous Goldilocks periods, positioning hasn't reached very bullish levels - flows into bonds, gold, and money markets stay strong while surveys remain somewhat bearish (only retail investors are more bullish),"" he said. ""We remain modestly pro-risk in our asset allocation,"" he added.

To be sure, Mueller-Glissmann pointed out that the Goldilocks backdrop could meet a bearish scenario in one of three ways: firstly, a growth shock due to rising unemployment rate or AI disappointments; secondly, a rate shock from the Federal Reserve not delivering on more dovish expectations or from long-term yields signaling more risk of fiscal dominance; or thirdly, increasing pessimism about the prospects of the U.S. dollar.

Barrick Mining Corp. ABX-T, one of the country's largest gold miners, cut ties with chief executive officer Mark Bristow on Monday and named a company veteran as its interim CEO. 

Toronto-based Barrick said Mr. Bristow had departed, effective immediately, after seven years at the helm. The company named Mark Hill, who joined Barrick in 2006 and was running its Latin American and Asia Pacific operations, as group chief operating officer and interim president and CEO.

“We are delighted to welcome Mark Hill as Group COO and Interim President and CEO,” said Barrick executive chair John Thornton in a press release. “His caliber, experience and deep knowledge of the company will ensure we maintain momentum.”

Over the past year, Mr. Bristow, aged 66, told analysts and investors he planned to be at Barrick for three more years.

“This will be a surprise to the market,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Matthew Murphy in a report on Monday. “We believe this was a decision of the board and may have been related to stock underperformance vs peers in recent years.”

Barrick's share price initially rose by 3 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on news of the CEO's departure. By mid-morning Monday, Barrick shares were up by 0.12 per cent.

“Following today's news, we believe the strategic outlook of Barrick is less certain and Barrick's leadership transition could be a catalyst for future changes to this, potentially either positive or negative,” said analyst Josh Wolfson at RBC Capital Markets in a report.

Barrick has hired executive search firm Egon Zehnder to find a new CEO and will consider internal and external candidates. The company said it expects to meet performance expectations set out in its most recent quarterly financial results, released in August.

Mr. Bristow became CEO of Barrick after the company merged with Randgold Resources Ltd., which he ran. Since then, Barrick's stock price has underperformed peers such as Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., the country's largest gold miner.

The South African-born Mr. Bristow faced challenges with governments in a number of countries that are home to Barrick mines, including standoffs in Tanzania, Papua New Guinea and Mali that led to temporary closures. 

“On behalf of the board, I want to thank Mark for his leadership of Barrick,” said Mr. Thornton, former president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ”During his tenure, Mark strengthened our portfolio and helped position Barrick as a leading global producer of gold and copper.""

In 2023, Barrick paid Mr. Bristow US$12.7-million, including a US$4.1-million cash bonus. Proxy advisory firm Glass, Lewis & Co. censured Barrick for the CEO's compensation package, which came in a year when five employees were killed in accidents at mine sites.

The US is working to ramp up missile production in preparation for a potential conflict with China, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing officials familiar with the matter. The Pentagon is reportedly pressing defense contractors to double or quadruple output amid mounting concerns over insufficient weapons stockpiles.

The US Department of Defense launched the drive in June, when it invited top missile makers to a Pentagon roundtable, sources told the paper.

Led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, the meeting drew major arms contractors, startups like Anduril Industries and crucial component suppliers.

Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg is playing an “unusually” hands-on role in the effort, reportedly known as the Munitions Acceleration Council. The WSJ noted that the top official personally calls some executives on a weekly basis to track their progress.

“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth are exploring extraordinary avenues to expand our military might and accelerate the production of munitions,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told the newspaper. “This effort has been a collaboration between defense industry leaders and senior Pentagon officials.”

The new acceleration council is focused on 12 weapons that the Pentagon wants on hand for a potential conflict with China, the WSJ relayed.

Some officials and experts have reportedly expressed concerns that the Pentagon's goals may be unrealistic, citing the fact that assembling certain missile systems can take up to two years. At the same time, certifying new suppliers requires hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure the products meet military standards.

Funding remains another major concern, according to analysts cited by the news outlet. While the “Big, Beautiful Bill” recently approved by Washington provided an extra $25 billion in munitions spending over five years, meeting the Pentagon's new targets could require tens of billions more.

China is viewed by the US as its primary strategic rival due to its rapid military modernization, expanding influence in the Indo-Pacific, and alleged growing pressure on Taiwan. Washington fears that Beijing may attempt to forcibly reunify with the self-governing island, potentially triggering a regional conflict that could draw in American forces.

Beijing has rejected the allegations, maintaining that Taiwan is an internal matter and has repeatedly accused the US of stoking tensions by arming the island and encouraging separatist sentiment.

The European Union is now a “war project” that puts the economies of its members at risk, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said, vowing to oppose Brussels' belligerent policies.

Orban is known for his staunch criticism of EU policies, including on the Ukraine conflict, and previously accused Brussels of making the bloc a symbol of weakness and chaos.Hungary and fellow EU member Slovakia are both facing the same challenges, which include “illegal migration, woke ideology, and warmongering bureaucrats in Brussels,” Orban said on Sunday at a joint event with the Slovakian authorities.

“We will continue to defend our sovereignty, our values, and our future!” Orban said in a post on X to mark the occasion. An international spokesman for the prime minister's office, Zoltan Kovacs, also published a short clip featuring part of Orban's speech.

“Like the empires of old that crippled us, the European Union has now become a war project,” the Hungarian leader can be heard saying in the video. Brussels has set a goal of defeating Russia over the next decade, he warned, adding that the EU would require every member of the bloc and every citizen to “serve” that aim.

Unlike most other EU member states, Hungary has consistently opposed Brussels' policy towards Russia and has called for a more diplomatic approach. Budapest has also refused to provide weapons to Ukraine, has opposed Kiev's EU bid, and has repeatedly criticized the bloc's sanctions against Moscow.

Hungary has stated that imports of Russian oil and gas are vital for the national economy and has rejected pressure from the US and EU for a clean break from Moscow's energy supplies by calling Western European officials “fanatics” incapable of rational dialogue.

Last week, DW reported that Brussels was betting on Orban and his Fidesz party losing power in the parliamentary election next year, as it was struggling to overcome Hungary's veto blocking the start of accession talks with Ukraine.

Last month, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also claimed that EU officials were conspiring to overthrow the “patriot Slovak, Hungarian, and Serbian governments” and replace them with puppet regimes.

Bad Bunny will bring his Latin trap and reggaeton swagger to the NFL's biggest stage next year: The Grammy winner will headline the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show in Northern California.

The NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Sunday that Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California.

The Puerto Rican superstar's selection comes amid another career-defining run: He's fresh off a historic Puerto Rico residency this month that drew more than half a million fans and is leading all nominees at the Latin Grammys in November. He has become one of the world's most streamed artists with albums such as Un Verano Sin Ti, an all-Spanish-language LP.

Bad Bunny will host Saturday Night Live on Oct. 4.

“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement. “It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown … this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”

NFL training camps open, as does the road to Super Bowl 60 in San Francisco

Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has “done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honoured to have him on the world's biggest stage.”

The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as Bullet Train, Caught Stealing and Happy Gilmore 2, and collaborated with top fashion houses. He'll enter the Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter Édgar Barrera.

Roc Nation and Emmy-winning producer Jesse Collins will serve as co-executive producers of the halftime show. Hamish Hamilton will serve as director.

“We know his dynamic performances, creative vision, and deep connection with fans will deliver the kind of unforgettable experience we've come to expect from this iconic cultural moment,” said Jon Barker, SVP of Global Event Production for the NFL.

Last year, Kendrick Lamar shined with guest SZA in New Orleans, setting the record for the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show with 133.5 million viewers. His performance surpassed the audience for Michael Jackson's 1993 show.

“His music has not only broken records but has elevated Latin music to the center of pop-culture and we are thrilled to once again partner with the NFL and Roc Nation to deliver this historic performance to millions of fans worldwide,” said Oliver Schusser, the vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “We know this show will be unforgettable.”

Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press

Thomas Lukaszuk is a former deputy premier of Alberta.

Over the past few months, talk of Alberta separating from Canada has grown from idle chatter to specific threats to hold a province-wide referendum on separation. 

I'm sure Canadians across the country must be asking: Are they serious? Do Albertans really want to separate from the rest of Canada?

I strongly believe – and all the evidence suggests – the answer is a resounding No. 

Opinion: Alberta separatists should be careful what they wish for

At different times in Alberta's history, tensions with the federal government have led to talk of separation. Former premier Peter Lougheed's battle with then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau over the National Energy Program was fierce, but even then, Mr. Lougheed believed that a stronger Alberta made for a stronger Canada. Throughout Alberta's history, we've had politicians and pundits who talked about firewalls, flirted with separation or even created political parties with separation as their primary motivation. They enjoyed brief moments in the limelight but every time, the stronger will of Albertans and their pride in Canada doused the flames of separation, and we were able to get back to the business of building a strong future for Alberta within Canada.

Now, spurred on by U.S. President Donald Trump's preposterous idea of Canada becoming a 51st state, we have another small, vocal group of Albertans trying to whip up support for separation. And they are serious. Their claims of how Alberta would be better off as a separate nation are frankly ludicrous but, in the current political climate, unleashing outrage over false claims and stirring up grievances sells better on social media than reasoned debate and proven facts.

That's not to say there aren't some legitimate reasons for Albertans to feel they haven't always received a fair deal from the federal government. Alberta is a prosperous province whose abundance of natural resources has contributed significantly to Canada's prosperity. We're home to leading researchers seeking cures to diabetes and other serious illnesses. Others are breaking new ground in artificial intelligence or establishing world-leading businesses. And yet, there's a feeling that, too often, Alberta isn't given the respect it deserves when it comes to national issues and federal government priorities. 

Those challenges notwithstanding, separation is clearly not the answer. Even the talk of separation damages Alberta's reputation, creates uncertainty, drives away talent and investment, and divides communities. All of this at a time when Prime Minister Mark Carney is inspiring renewed confidence in a strong and united Canada that charts its own course, builds a more productive economy, and seeks new opportunities with new partners around the world. Alberta needs to be a key partner in all those initiatives.

Gary Mason: The comments of the U.S. Ambassador to Canada reveal a shocking ignorance and disdain

That's why I launched the “Forever Canadian” petition. Rather than sit back and wait for the possibility there may be a referendum on separation from Canada, I launched a positive petition that asks Albertans a simple question: Do you agree that Alberta should remain in Canada?

The response has been astonishing and overwhelmingly positive. Thousands of Albertans across the province have volunteered to canvas for signatures and thousands more are lining up to sign the petition at hundreds of events across the province. In parks, on driveways and street corners, at farmers' markets, concerts and community celebrations, volunteers are gathering signatures from Albertans eager to say “No” to separation. 

As a former politician, I've frankly never seen a movement that has taken off with such incredible enthusiasm and excitement, all driven by volunteers with a single motivation: to send a clear message that Albertans want to remain in Canada.

By Oct. 28, we need 300,000 Albertans to sign our petition. When we succeed – and we will – our petition will reaffirm Albertans' beliefs that Alberta is better in Canada, and Canada is better with Alberta in it.

So my message to Canadians is this: Don't believe the separatist rhetoric. Don't believe Conrad Black or the various pundits breeding discontent to feed their egos or drive readers to their columns. 

I believe in Albertans. They are proud Canadians who know Alberta's future lies within Canada.

The directive labels common beliefs such as “anti-capitalist” opinions as terrorism “indicators.”

With the mainstream media distracted by the made-for-TV drama of James Comey's indictment, Trump has signed a little-noticed national security directive identifying “anti-Christian” and “anti-American” views as indicators of radical left violence. Called National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, it's being referred to as “NSPM-7” by administration insiders.

“This is the first time in American history that there is an all-of-government effort to dismantle left wing terrorism,” Trump's homeland security advisor Stephen Miller said, referring to the issuance.

To the extent that the major media noticed the directive at all, they (even C-SPAN!) incorrectly labeled it an “executive order,” like last week's designation of “Antifa” as a domestic terrorist organization.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

It's hard to overstate how much different NSPM-7 is from the over 200 executive orders Trump has frantically signed since coming back into office.

An executive order publicly lays out the course of day-to-day federal government operations; whereas a national security directive is a sweeping policy decree for the defense, foreign policy, intelligence, and law enforcement apparatus. National security directives are often secret, but in this case the Trump administration chose to publish NSPM-7 — only the seventh since he's come into office.)

Previous national security directives have been controversial, even politically earthshaking. In 1980, for example, President Jimmy Carter signed the Top Secret Presidential Directive 59 (“PD-59”) directing new nuclear warfighting policies that persisted until the end of the Cold War. When revealed, PD-59 caused a public furor.

Similarly, President George W. Bush signed a series of classified national security directives after 9/11, the most famous of which authorized NSA's unlawful domestic intercepts, a directive that wasn't publicly revealed until four years later.

In NSPM-7, “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” President Trump directs the Justice Department, the FBI, and other national security agencies and departments to fight his version of political violence in America, retooling a network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces to focus on “leftist” political violence in America. This vast counterterrorism army, made up of federal, state, and local agents would, as Trump aide Stephen Miller said, form “the central hub of that effort.”

NSPM-7 directs a new national strategy to “disrupt” any individual or groups “that foment political violence,” including “before they result in violent political acts.”

In other words, they're targeting pre-crime, to reference Minority Report.

The Trump administration isn't only targeting organizations or groups but even individuals and “entities” whom NSPM-7 says can be identified by any of the following “indicia” (indicators) of violence:

“The United States requires a national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence so that law enforcement can intervene in criminal conspiracies before they result in violent political acts,” the directive states (emphasis mine).

A “pre-crime” endeavor, preventing attacks before they happen, is core to the post-9/11 concept of counterterrorism itself. No longer satisfied to investigate acts of terrorism after the fact to bring terrorists to justice, the Bush administration adopted preemption. Overseas, that led to aerial assassination by drones and “special operations” kill missions. Domestically, it led to a counter-terrorism campaign whose hallmark was excessive and illegal government surveillance and the use of undercover agents and “confidential human sources” to trap (and entrap) would-be terrorists.

Now, with Donald Trump's directive retooling the counter-terror apparatus to go after Americans at home, this means monitoring political activity, or speech, as an investigative method to discover “radicalism.” (Contrary to other national security documents all during the post-Watergate era, NSPM-7 doesn't even mention the First Amendment or the fundamental right of Americans to organize and protest.)

The focus on speech is evident throughout NSPM-7. The directive says that political violence is the result of “organized campaigns” that often begin (with the left) dehumanizing targets in “anonymous chat foras, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions.”

To give a sense of how broad this formulation is, Trump's earlier designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist group was accompanied by a White House fact sheet singling out people who “celebrated” Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. As I wrote at the time, this describes a lot of Americans!

Trump's new national security memorandum also alludes to Mangione but adds to it even larger categories of potential targets.

NSPM-7 is fundamentally a law enforcement directive, and it dispenses with the complications of using the active duty military or the National Guard in pursuit of political violence. It directs the Department of Justice to focus the FBI's approximately 200 Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) to the new mission. The FBI network of task forces comprises over 4,000 members — including FBI personnel and task force officers (or TFOs) from more than 500 state and local agencies and 50 federal agencies, including special agents, police officers, intelligence analysts and surveillance technicians. First established in New York City in 1980 to systematize FBI and NYPD cooperation, today there are task forces around the country, including at least one in each of the FBI's 55 field offices.

For the Trump White House, the beauty of using an already existing network is that it bypasses Congressional oversight and scrutiny and even obscures federal activity to governors and legislatures at the state level. States, cities, and local police have already signed Memoranda of Agreements with the feds to fight terrorism and officers are already assigned as task force officers.

NSPM-7 says the JTTFs “shall investigate” potential federal crimes relating to “acts of recruiting or radicalizing persons” for the purpose of “political violence, terrorism, or conspiracy against rights; and the violent deprivation of any citizen's rights.” It authorizes the JTTFs to investigate individuals, organizations, and funders “responsible for, sponsor, or otherwise aid and abet the principal actors engaging in the criminal conduct.”

“The Attorney General shall issue specific guidance that ensures domestic terrorism priorities include politically motivated terrorist acts such as organized doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder,” NSPM-7 says. Civil disorder?

I don't want to sound hyperbolic but the plain truth is that NSPM-7 is a declaration of war on anyone who does not support the Trump administration and its agenda. Yes, it repeats the word “violent” over and over to purport only to go after citizens who are moved to take up arms, but it also directs monitoring and intelligence collection to map and target the new “evildoers,” to borrow a Bush label he took from the Bible just days after 9/11.

The partisan focus couldn't be more obvious.

“The real problem is this: since Charlie [Kirk] was murdered — a friend of mine, assassinated — nothing's changed on their side,” White House counter-terrorism czar Sebastian Gorka told Newsmax after NSPM-7 was signed. “Not one leader — not one left wing thought leader, member of Congress, Senator — nobody has said we distance ourselves from the violent rhetoric.”

“The left refuses to rid themselves of the justification for violence,” Gorka continued, “and as such, President Trump is taking measures to protect us from the violent rhetoric that becomes snipers and bullets.”

The “MedBed” conspiracy theory has led to websites seeking to scam people who wrongly believe that the product is real.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Over the weekend on his Truth Social account, President Donald Trump shared (then quickly deleted) a seemingly AI-generated video that included a deep-fake version of himself promoting a nonexistent product related to the broader QAnon conspiracy theory.

The video, which purported itself to be a Fox News segment hosted by Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump, featured a product called a “MedBed” — fictional health care technology that supposedly heals the ailments of any individual who lays in it. Some variants of the “MedBed” conspiracy theory also allege that it can reverse aging or regrow missing limbs.

Conspiracists allege that MedBed technology is only available to the rich and well-connected, but that Trump may make it available to the public one day. 

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

In his Truth Social post, the deep-fake version of Trump says he is giving every American “guaranteed access” to the “advanced technology” and to MedBed hospitals, which do not exist. By doing so, the fake Trump in the video says, he will “restore every citizen to full health and strength.”

The video further alleges that more information on how to register for MedBed cards will be coming soon. Websites for MedBed cards do exist, but they are money-making scams meant to deceive people who believe the conspiracy theory. 

It is unclear why Trump shared the video. The president frequently shares news reports of himself on social media, but sharing an AI-generated video, showcasing a statement he has never actually made, bewildered a number of people online, leading some to question whether the post was a sign that Trump's mental acuity is declining. 

During the 2024 presidential campaign, several commentators noted that signs that Trump could potentially be facing cognitive decline were underreported on. New polling indicates that a large bloc of Americans is concerned about the president's current cognitive state.

According to an Economist/YouGov poll published earlier this month, only 40 percent of voters believe Trump has the right temperament to be president, while 50 percent say he does not. On the question of whether Trump's age or health is affecting his duties as president, 34 percent believe they are severely limiting what he can do, while another 27 percent say they are having little effect on his job performance. Just 26 percent believe Trump's age and health do not affect his handling of the presidency. 

A Data for Progress poll published in July showed similar worries from voters, with a plurality, 49 percent, saying Trump was “too old” to be president — a 10-point increase from one year prior, when he was a candidate for the White House. A similar number, 48 percent, say they think Trump is experiencing symptoms of cognitive decline, while 45 percent say they disagree.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina said on Monday he was dissolving the government following youth-led protests over water and power cuts in which the United Nations says at least 22 people have been killed and more than 100 injured.
    


            Inspired by the so-called “Gen Z” protests in Kenya and Nepal, the three days of demonstrations are the largest the Indian Ocean island has seen in years, and the most serious challenge Rajoelina has faced since his re-election in 2023.
    


            “We acknowledge and apologize if members of the government have not carried out the tasks assigned to them,” Rajoelina said in speech on state broadcaster Televiziona Malagasy (TVM).
    


            The president said he wanted to create space for dialog with young people, and promised measures to support businesses affected by looting.
    


            “I understand the anger, the sadness, and the difficulties caused by power cuts and water supply problems. I heard the call, I felt the suffering, I understood the impact on daily life,” he said.
    


            The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the casualties include protesters and bystanders killed by members of the security forces, but also others killed in subsequent widespread violence and looting by individuals and gangs not associated with the protesters.

            Madagascar's ministry of foreign affairs rejected the casualty figures reported by the UN, saying the data did not come from competent national authorities “and are based on rumors or misinformation.”
    


            On Monday protesters gathered at a university where they waved placards and sang the national anthem before attempting to march towards the city center, footage from 2424.MG news channel showed.
    


            Police fired teargas to disperse the crowd, after authorities declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew last week.
    


Why the ‘One Piece' flag is being hoisted across the world



            The protesters have adapted a flag used in Nepal where protesters forced the prime minister to resign this month and have also used similar online organization tactics as protests in Kenya last year that culminated in the government scrapping proposed tax legislation.
    


            Rajoelina first came to power in a 2009 coup. He stepped down in 2014 but became president again after winning the 2018 election, and secured a third term in a December 2023 poll that his challengers said was marred by irregularities.

            Video game maker Electronic Arts is going private in a $55 billion deal that's funded by Saudi Arabia and a Jared Kusher-backed investment firm.
    


            The company, which makes hits like “Madden NFL,” “The Sims,” and “Battlefield,” announced Monday that the consortium is led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Kushner's Affinity Partners. They are paying shareholders $210 per share — making it the largest buyout on record.
    


            Shares of EA (EA) jumped about 5% in early trading. The purchase is a 25% premium on Friday's closing price prior to reports of a buyout, first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
    


            “Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business,” said EA CEO Andrew Wilson in a press release.
    


            Kushner said he's admired EA's “​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​— and now enjoys them with his ​kids — I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead.”
    


            The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2027 and is subject to regulatory approval.
    


EA, founded in 1982, has a broad portfolio of well-known hits, ranging from sports to first-person shooting games, including the eagerly awaited release of “Battlefield 6.”
    


            Last year, the company laid off 5% of its workforce, joining other video game companies that have reduced their headcount after experiencing a boom during the height of Covid-19 and changing consumer habits.

Electronic Arts, the maker of video games like “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” and “The Sims,” is being acquired for $55 billion in what could become the largest private equity-funded buyout in history. 

Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF, and Affinity Partners will pay EA's stockholders $210 per share. Affinity Partners is run by President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The equity value of the deal is $55 billion, far exceeding the $32 billion price tag to take Texas utility TXU private in 2007, which had shattered records for leveraged buyouts. 

PIF, which was currently the largest insider stakeholder in Electronic Arts, will be rolling over its existing 9.9% investment in the company. 

The commitment to the massive deal is inline with recent activity in the gaming sector by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote Andrew Marok of Raymond James. 

“The Saudi PIF has been a very active player in the video gaming market since 2022, taking minority stakes in most scaled public video gaming publishers, and also outright purchases of companies like ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely,” he wrote. “The PIF has made its intentions to scale its gaming arm, Savvy Gaming Group, clear, and the EA deal would represent the biggest such move to date by some distance.” 

PIF is also a minority investor in Nintendo.

If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA's 36-year history as a publicly traded company that began with its shares ending its first day of trading at a split-adjusted 52 cents. 




The IPO came seven years after EA was founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, who began playing analog versions of baseball and football made by “Strat-O-Matic” as a teenager during the 1960s.

CEO Andrew Wilson has led the company since 2013 and he will remain in that role, the firms said Monday. Electronic Arts would be taken private and its headquarters would remain in Redwood City, California.

“Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future,” said Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. “I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.”

The size of the video game market has attracted large investors in recent years. 

One of EA's biggest rivals Activision Blizzard was snapped up by technology powerhouse Microsoft for nearly $69 billion in 2023, while the competition from mobile video game makers such as Epic Games has intensified.

This marks the second high-profile deal involving Silver Lake and a technology company with a legion of loyal fans in recent weeks. Silver Lake is also part of a newly formed joint venture spearheaded by Oracle involved in a deal to take over the U.S. oversight of TikTok's social video platform, although all the details of that complex transaction haven't been divulged yet.

Silver Lake also bought out two other well-known technology companies, the now-defunct video calling service Skype in a $1.9 billion deal completed in 2009, and a $24.9 billion buyout of personal computer maker Dell in 2013. After Dell restructured its operations as a private company, it returned to the stock market with publicly traded shares in 2018.

By going private, EA will be able to retool operations without worrying about market reactions. Although its video games still have a fervent following, EA's annual revenues have been stagnant during the past three fiscal years, hovering from $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion.

Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company thinks the proposed deal's $210 per share offer price may be falling short of EA's intrinsic value.

“With Battlefield 6 about to launch and a pipeline that could add more than $2B in incremental bookings by FY28, the true earnings power of EA is only beginning to emerge,” he wrote.

Hickey is unsure if the transaction is in shareholders' best interest.

“In our view, this transaction is a self-serving, opportunistic move by management and the investor group,” he wrote. “Management has long been rumored to seek a sale around $200 per share, a level that may have been defensible in prior years but not in the current environment where visibility into growth, franchise momentum, and pipeline strength is far more robust. The board's decision to recommend a sale at $210 per share suggests a prioritization of near-term certainty and legacy over maximizing long-term shareholder value.”

But Nick McKay of Freedom Capital Markets believes the offer makes sense for EA because share price appreciation is likely limited given that the success of its sports franchises and various live services streams are already mostly baked into the stock. 

“The financial backing and resources of the investor consortium should enable EA to increase its focus on long-term growth opportunities that may have been viewed as too risky or expensive as a public company,” he wrote in an analyst note.

EA shares, which rose nearly 5% on Monday, had jumped 15% on Friday after rumors of a takeover began to circulate. 

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027. It still needs approval from EA shareholders.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Authorities in the Bahamas closed most schools Monday as Tropical Storm Imelda dropped heavy rain in the northern Caribbean, including over Cuba where landslides killed at least one man.

The storm was located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Great Abaco Island of the Bahamas, which is still recovering from Hurricane Dorian after it slammed into parts of the Bahamas as a devastating Category 5 hurricane in 2019.

Imelda had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) and was moving north at 9 mph (15 kph). It was forecast to become a hurricane on Tuesday and spin out to open ocean, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

A tropical storm warning was in effect for parts of the northwestern Bahamas, including Eleuthera, the Abacos, Grand Bahama Island and the surrounding keys. Power outages were reported in some areas, with authorities closing government offices on affected islands. Authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for some islands over the weekend.








Imelda was expected to drop 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain across the northwest Bahamas through Tuesday, and 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) across eastern Cuba. State media in Cuba reported that 60-year-old Luis Mario Pérez Coiterio died in Santiago de Cuba following landslides in that area. 

“After two days of intense rains in the municipality of Santiago de Cuba, we are now in the stage of saving human lives and the economy of the entire city,” Mayor Indira Oliva Bueno said, according to a broadcast aired by the official Caribe channel.

In the easternmost part of Cuba, from Camagüey to Guantánamo, authorities supplied food and drinking water to residents, according to official TV reports.

Overall, Imelda forced the evacuation of some 1,291 people across Cuba, with 158 of them staying in shelters.

“We are working with our agricultural colleagues to provide food to the population, which is essential,” said Alexander Olivares, president of the San Antonio del Sur Defense Council in Guantánamo.








Meanwhile, Hurricane Humberto, a Category 4 storm, churned in open waters nearby, which forecasters said would cause Imelda to abruptly turn to the east-northeast, away from the southeastern United States coast.



AP correspondent Julie Walker reports Tropical Storm Imelda forms and is expected to become hurricane off the US East Coast in coming days.

“This is really what's going to be saving the United States from really seeing catastrophic rainfall,” said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert for AccuWeather, a private U.S. weather forecasting company.

DaSilva said the two storms would draw closer and start rotating counterclockwise around each other in what's known as the Fujiwhara effect. 

“It's a very rare phenomenon overall in the Atlantic basin,” he said.

Humberto had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph). It was located about 320 miles (515 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda, moving north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). A tropical storm watch was in effect for Bermuda.

“This is going to be no threat to the United States,” DaSilva said.



However, moisture from Imelda was expected to move up the Carolinas, with heavy rain forecast through Tuesday morning. The heaviest rains will be limited to the coastline, from Charleston in South Carolina to Wilmington in North Carolina, while Charlotte and Raleigh might receive only 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) of rain, he said.

The Carolinas might see wind gusts of 40 mph, but only along the coastline, DaSilva said, as he warned of dangerous surf and heavy rip currents all week. 

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said authorities were prepositioning search and rescue crews over the weekend.

In North Carolina, Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency even before Imelda formed, while authorities on Tybee Island off the coast of Georgia handed out free sandbags to residents.

Even though Imelda was not making landfall in Florida, its impact was still felt. 

At the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, crews found a couple of turtle hatchlings that rough surf had tossed ashore.

“We actually had two washbacks come in over the weekend,” said Justin Perrault, the center's vice president of research. “We may get more as the day goes along.”

He said typically beachgoers will see a hatchling resting in the seaweed and call the center for help.

Further south in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Carl Alexandre exercised at the beach on Monday. He said he was grateful the storm was not heading toward South Florida, but that he would pray for those in the Bahamas.

“It's great that we're not having one as of right now,” Alexandre said. “And now we get to run in the Florida sun.”

Mick Varley, who was visiting Fort Lauderdale from London, said he's delighted the storm will remain offshore.

“I'm very happy it's not going to disrupt our plans,” he said.



As Tropical Storm Imelda and Hurricane Humberto swirled in open waters, authorities in Bermuda prepared for two near misses.

“It's going to be a double whammy for Bermuda, Humberto first and Imelda following close behind,” Da Silva said.

He said Imelda could pass within 15 miles (24 kilometers) of Bermuda as the Atlantic season's soon-to-be fourth named hurricane. Meanwhile, the center of Humberto is expected to pass west and then north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Michael Weeks, Bermuda's national security minister, urged residents to prepare, warning that there have been “some near misses this season regarding severe storms.”

“Hurricane Humberto is a dangerous storm, and with another system developing to our south, every household in Bermuda should take the necessary steps to be prepared,” he said.

Flights to and from the islands in the Bahamas were canceled, with airports expected to reopen after weather conditions improve.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday they've agreed to a plan to end the war in Gaza, but it's unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms.

Trump on Monday laid out a 20-point plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war and establishing a postwar governance in the war-battered Palestinian territory. Trump's plan would establish a temporary governing board that would be headed by Trump and include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

The plan does not require people to leave Gaza and calls for the war to end immediately if both sides accept it. It also calls for all remaining hostages to be released within 72 hours of Israel accepting the plan. 

Trump said Israel would have the “full backing” of the United States to take steps to defeat Hamas if it doesn't accept the proposed peace deal. 

“I think we are beyond very close,” Trump said at the start of a news conference with Netanyahu where he detailed the plan. “We're not quite finished. We have to get Hamas.”

“If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself,” Netanyahu said. “This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done”

The president went on to urge Palestinian people to take responsibility “for their destiny” and embrace his peace proposal.




Netanyahu earlier extended a formal apology to his Qatari counterpart for a recent military strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emirate that infuriated Arab leaders and triggered rare criticism by the U.S. of Israel.

Netanyahu made the call to Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, as he met with Trump, according to the White House.

Trump described the exchange between the Israeli and Qatari leader as a “heart-to-heart” call.

“As a first step, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,” the White House said in a statement. “He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future.”

The White House talks, and apology from Netanyahu, come at a tenuous moment. Israel is increasingly isolated, losing support from many countries that were long its steadfast allies. At home, Netanyahu's governing coalition appears more fragile than ever. And the White House is showing signs of impatience.

The question now is whether Trump, who has offered steadfast backing to Netanyahu throughout the war, will change his tone and turn up the pressure on Israel to wind down the conflict.

As he welcomed Netanyahu to the White House, Trump responded affirmatively when asked by reporters whether he was confident a deal would be soon reached to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas.

“I am. I'm very confident,” Trump said.

Israel stuck the headquarters of Hamas' political leadership in Qatar on Sept. 9 as the group's top figures gathered to consider a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

The strike on the territory of a U.S. ally was a stunning escalation and risked upending talks aimed at winding down the war and freeing hostages. No senior Hamas officials were killed in the strike.

The attack on an energy-rich Gulf nation hosting thousands of American troops, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas throughout the war and even before, was described by Trump as out of step with Israeli and U.S. interests. And Trump sought to move quickly to assuage his Qatari allies.

Qatar, meanwhile, condemned the strike as a “flagrant violation of all international laws and norms” as smoke rose over its capital, Doha. Other key U.S. allies in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, promised their support to Qatar.

The White House said al Thani welcomed Netanyahu's “assurances” and emphasized “Qatar's readiness to continue contributing meaningfully to regional security and stability.”

But even as the White House was spotlighting the apology, Israel's far right national security minister newly defended the decision to carry out Israel's attack.

Itamar Ben-Gvir, a key coalition partner of Netanyahu's, in a posting on X called the operation “an important, just and ethical attack.”

“It is very good that it happened,” he added.

Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt urged both sides to finalize an agreement to bring an end to the nearly two-year-old war in Gaza.

“Ultimately the president knows when you get to a good deal, both sides are going to leave a little bit unhappy,” Leavitt told reporters. “But we need this conflict to end.”

Trump and Netanyahu were first holding talks with aides in the Oval Office and over a private lunch. A joint press conference is expected later. 

Meanwhile, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, said Palestinian officials stood ready to work with Trump and Arab countries in bringing an end to the war.

“Let us not delay a single minute more in doing what is necessary for this just peace to replace the unbearable reality of today,” Mansour said during a Security Council meeting on the Middle East.

Trump joined forces with Netanyahu during Israel's brief war with Iran in June, ordering U.S. stealth bombers to strike three nuclear sites, and he's supported the Israeli leader during his corruption trial, describing the case as a “witch hunt.”

But the relationship has become more tense lately. Trump was frustrated by Israel's failed strike this month on Hamas officials in Qatar.

Last week, Trump vowed to prevent Israel from annexing the West Bank — an idea promoted by some of Netanyahu's hard-line governing partners. The international community opposes annexation, saying it would destroy hopes for a two-state solution.

On Friday, Trump raised expectations for the meeting with Netanyahu, telling reporters the U.S. was “very close to a deal on Gaza.” 

Trump's proposal to stop the war in Gaza calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, according to three Arab officials briefed on the plan. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan has not been formally unveiled.

Hamas is believed to be holding 48 hostages, 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. The militant group has demanded Israel agree to end the war and withdraw from all of Gaza as part of any permanent ceasefire.

Trump discussed the plan with Arab and Islamic leaders in New York last week on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. It doesn't include the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which Trump appeared to endorse earlier this year.

The 21-point proposal also calls for an end to Hamas rule of Gaza and the disarmament of the militant group, said the officials briefed on the plan. Hundreds of Palestinians, including many serving life sentences, will be released by Israel, according to the proposal.

The plan also includes the establishment of an international security force to take over law enforcement in postwar Gaza, they said. 

A Palestinian committee of technocrats would oversee the civilian affairs of the strip, with power handed over later to a reformed Palestinian Authority, they said. Netanyahu has rejected any role for the authority, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinians, in postwar Gaza.

A Hamas official said the group was briefed on the plan but has yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The group has repeatedly rejected laying down arms and has linked its weapons to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

Board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Jeremy London, based in Savannah, Georgia, explains why VO2 max and muscle mass are the main indicators of longevity.

The key to a good workout could be sitting in your kitchen cabinet.

A viral social media trend claims that taking a spoonful of honey and salt before hitting the gym provides an energy boost.

Some say this combination mimics the effects of pre-workout supplements, which are meant to enhance physical performance and energy levels when exercising.

EATING FOODS IN THIS ORDER COULD HELP WITH WEIGHT LOSS AND BLOOD SUGAR, EXPERTS SAY

TikTok creators and influencers have been filming themselves pouring honey onto a spoon, or even on the back of their hand, and sprinkling it with salt — many opting for natural options of both — and taking a dose before heading to the gym.

Honey, a ""rapidly digesting carbohydrate,"" and the sodium from salt could be beneficial as a workout booster, an expert says. (iStock)

In an interview with Fox News Digital, certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco confirmed that this strategy ""does make sense"" as a pre-workout boost.

The combination mixes a ""rapidly digesting carbohydrate"" with sodium, both of which are thought to be ""beneficial for an effective workout,"" the New Jersey-based nutritionist said.

""It's usually suggested to eat a snack of carbohydrates (usually mixed with some protein or a bit of good fat) before a workout to help increase sustained energy and muscle re-building, so this is just saying to use honey as the carbohydrate/sugar,"" she said. 

""Essentially, some applesauce or fruit juice can be used the same way as the honey.""

The combination mixes a ""rapidly digesting carbohydrate"" with sodium, both of which are thought to be ""beneficial for an effective workout,"" the nutritionist said. (iStock)

DeCicco believes this trend is most likely popular because honey is digested quickly into the bloodstream and breaks down easily.

She does not, however, recommend consuming only honey and salt before a workout. Adding a snack with more substance, such as whole-grain crackers with tuna fish or a banana with peanut butter, could offer more energy, according to the expert.

""These types of snacks will work to provide energy throughout the entire workout,"" she said. ""The snacks can be eaten one to two hours before a workout, and then the honey and salt directly before.""

Acting US Attorney for Northern Texas Nancy Larson says new video showing I.C.E agents protecting detainees proves ‘lie' about agency wrong on ‘America Reports.'

An anti-ICE agitator is facing federal charges after allegedly threatening to kill a U.S. Border Patrol agent during a protest at an Illinois facility over the weekend. 

A crowd gathered outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, just outside Chicago, on Saturday to protest immigration enforcement operations in the area, federal prosecutors said. 

According to the criminal complaint, Paul Ivery approached an agent outside the facility and said words to the effect of, ""I'll f---ing kill you right now,"" and, ""Do something."" Ivery then fled from Border Patrol agents and, at one point, pulled one agent's helmet, authorities said.

He then allegedly ran away from agents and jumped on top of an occupied civilian vehicle on the street, which resulted in damage to the car.

Ivery is one of at least four people facing federal criminal charges stemming from the protests in Broadview.

The others are Jocelyne Robledo, Ray Collins and Hubert Mazur. Both Collins and Robledo allegedly had loaded guns on them at the time, authorities said. 

The Trump administration has vowed to criminally prosecute those who act violently toward immigration authorities. 

On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that America has entered a ""new era of political violence,"" amid a rise in attacks and threats against federal officers. 

SPECIAL AGENT SLAMS ‘DANGEROUS' TREND OF DEMOCRATS USING ICE AS CAMPAIGN PROPS

""Assassins have tried to murder President [Donald] Trump twice and tried to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh,"" Bondi said in a post on X. ""In Minnesota, legislators, and even children attending Mass, were gunned down in cold blood in two separate incidents, and an assassin targeted and murdered our friend Charlie Kirk. A sniper shot three people at a Texas ICE facility, and now more than 200 violent rioters were at a Chicago ICE facility, chanting, ‘Arrest ICE, shoot ICE.' At least one had a gun.""

She noted if protesters ""so much as touch one of our federal officers,"" they will be sent to prison.

""We've seen this before. We saw it in Portland and with the LA riots. These are not peaceful protests. These are coordinated attacks by radical extremists, and they end now,"" Bondi said.

""Anyone who threatens or assaults our federal officers will be arrested and charged federally, not in some liberal state court,"" she added. ""Same goes for anyone who's funding and aiding these extremists. You will be dismantled brick by brick. We are taking our country back. Make America safe again.""

Bondi's remarks came a day after she announced that Justice Department agents will be deployed to ICE facilities nationwide.

Erika Kirk appears as a guest host on ""The Charlie Kirk Show"" and reveals untold hours of content from her late husband is forthcoming.

Erika Kirk told the audience of her late husband Charlie's show to ""buckle up"" on Friday as she promised countless hours of previously unseen content from him and discussed the responsibility she feels to continue his movement.

The new CEO of Turning Point USA, Erika Kirk appeared as a special guest host on ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" where she said the program will continue on as a ""north star"" for conservatism with rotating hosts and casts.

""Charlie and ‘The Charlie Kirk Show' is not just a show,"" she said. ""It has a movement attached to it… This is not going anywhere. It's just not.""

Erika Kirk added that she had ""decades worth of my husband's voice"" in archives that no one had seen or heard. Clips of Charlie Kirk's viral sparring sessions on college campuses and past speeches have spread across social media in the weeks since his assassination on Sept. 10.

OPINION: ERIKA KIRK SHOWS HOW WE SHOULD FORGIVE, ‘BECAUSE IT WAS WHAT CHRIST DID'

""We have unused material from speeches that he's had that no one has heard yet,"" she said. ""We have Sunday specials lined up to the brim because my husband was so intentional about making sure that there was enough content always.""

""He made sure we recorded everything,"" executive producer Andrew Kolvet said.

""We have speeches that no one's heard of. We have interviews that no one's heard of. We have stuff from Korea and Japan that no one's heard of,"" she said. ""In the words of my husband, buckle up, because there is a lot of content to be had, and we have so many amazing things down the pipeline that we are working on… I am so excited.""

Erika Kirk added that her husband had a plan for the show past 2030, the same as he had with Turning Point USA, the conservative nonprofit he co-founded at age 18. 

PASTORS HAIL ERIKA KIRK'S FORGIVENESS OF HUSBAND'S ACCUSED KILLER AS POWERFUL TESTIMONY TO CHRISTIAN FAITH

""We have the blueprints,"" she said. ""We have our marching orders. And we are just remaining humble and grateful to God. And we're remaining just stewards to what God has blessed us with. And I know Charlie is going to continue to guide us and the Lord will continue to guide us.""

She added it was ""weird"" to use a term like ""excited"" to describe her emotions, but she said Charlie was in Heaven rooting everyone on. Kolvet added Charlie's life and mission couldn't be contained even after his death.

""It's on us, and Charlie would look at us and expect us to do the right things here,"" Kolvet said.

During her appearance, she also discussed a connection Charlie shared with his daughter while hosting the show. He would bring a puppet or some other item that she gave to him and sometimes show it off on the program.

""We will never be silenced,"" she said in agreement. ""We will never be silenced, and that's why continuing his platform in a beautiful, honorable way will reinforce that we will never be silenced.""

Interest in Kirk and Turning Point USA has surged in the weeks since he was killed, and Erika Kirk received widespread praise for forgiving her husband's alleged assassin during his memorial service last week.

New York Mets team owner Steve Cohen addressed disappointed fans on Monday after the team suffered a dreadful collapse and missed the postseason.

The Miami Marlins brought the final bit of doom to the Mets, defeating them 4-0 in the season finale on Sunday.

""Mets fans everywhere,"" Cohen wrote on X. ""I owe you an apology. You did your part by showing up and supporting the team. We didn't do our part. We will do a post-mortem and figure out the obvious and less obvious reasons why the team didn't perform up to your and my expectations.

""We are all feeling raw emotions today. I know how much time and effort you have put into this team. The result was unacceptable. Your emotions tell me how much you care and continues to motivate the organization to do better. Thank You to the best fans in sports.""

Minutes after the loss, first baseman Pete Alonso said he was going to opt out of his deal and test free agency.

""There's some great guys in this clubhouse, there's some great people on the staff,"" he said. ""And every single day, it's just been a pleasure coming to work and putting on the orange and blue. I've really appreciated and been nothing but full of gratitude every single day. Nothing's guaranteed, but we'll see what happens.

2025 MLB WILD CARD ODDS: YANKEES, DODGERS FAVORED TO MAKE DIVISIONAL SERIES

""I've loved being a Met, so hopefully they've appreciated me in the same (way).""

The Mets got off to a hot start. New York was 45-24 on June 12, one of the best records in MLB at the time, and only went 38-55 the rest of the season to finish 83-79 after their latest crushing loss on Sunday evening.

New York came into the 2025 season with the second-highest total payroll – more than $341 million – and the second-highest active roster payroll with $266.6 million, according to Spotrac. Juan Soto came over to the Mets from the New York Yankees on a 15-year deal reportedly worth $765 million. And while the bats were hot to start the year, the team cooled off when it mattered.

The Mets suffered an eight-game losing streak at the worst time, starting with a series against the Reds and continuing through the Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers matchups. The team bounced back against the San Diego Padres and then dropped two of three against the Washington Nationals.

The series against the Marlins was crucial, but New York was only able to pull out one win out of the three games. New York was 11-17 in August and finished 10-15 in September.

The Trump administration is on the short end of the nation's debate over the president's aggressive policies and actions, with nearly 6 in 10 likely voters agreeing that “fascism … is here.”

In the latest test of the public's reaction to President Donald Trump's tough talk, more voters than not — 47% to 44% — believe that ABC temporarily suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel because of the president's criticism of him, not for violating network standards.

In the latest Rasmussen Reports survey, voters also agreed with a Democratic critic that the suspension of Kimmel for six days was another sign that Trump was putting a stranglehold on democracy.

The pollster tested a charge from liberal Rep. Martin Frost (D-FL), who said after the Kimmel suspension, “The president and his lapdogs … are implementing a dangerous agenda to punish their opposition. Fascism is not on the way. It is here.”

Rasmussen found that 58% agreed that fascism “is here” while 38% didn't. Of the majority, 40% were in the “strongly agree” category, driven by liberals and Democrats.

In blaming Trump for the suspension, which ABC said was also due to affiliate reaction to a nasty comment the host made about the assassination of popular conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 49% said the network was not justified in its action, versus 38% who said it was.

The suspension sparked a national debate on free speech, what people should be allowed to say on regulated TV airways, and the president's increasing involvement in every corner of American society.

The poll came as Trump has been cracking down on inner-city crime by deploying National Guard troops to Washington and Los Angeles, and as his administration expanded efforts to round up immigrants illegally in America for deportation.

The administration has strongly denied limiting free speech and squeezing democracy, but the poll suggests it is losing that argument.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

EXCLUSIVE — Rep. Byron Donalds's (R-FL) campaign for Florida governor received a boost on Monday with the endorsements of law enforcement leaders across the Sunshine State. 

Over a dozen sheriffs backed Donalds, one of two Republicans who have announced bids to succeed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL). Donalds received one of his first high-profile endorsements in February when President Donald Trump endorsed his candidacy. 

The endorsements “cement Donalds as the MAGA candidate and the law and order candidate for Florida,” the Donalds campaign said. Five of the sheriffs representing the state's top 10 counties by population were among the authorities to back Donalds this week. They include Miami-Dade County Sheriff Rosie Cordero-Stutz, Hillsborough's Chad Chronister, Duval's T.K. Waters, Lee's Carmine Marceno, and Pasco's Chris Nocco. 

“Congressman Byron Donalds is the leader that Florida needs in this moment, as we work and stand with President Trump to implement the mandate he received from the American people and the citizens of our great state of Florida,” said Nocco, the first sheriff to endorse Donalds, in a statement touting the congressman's ties to Trump. 

Nocco cast Donalds as DeSantis's natural heir. The governor has yet to endorse a successor, as his wife, Casey DeSantis, is rumored to be weighing her own bid for the office. 

“I know Congressman Donalds will stand with law enforcement as we work to keep Florida safe and will be innovative in his ideas to create jobs, improve education, and make our economy more competitive. Florida has been blessed to have a fantastic legacy of Governors with Governor Rick Scott and Governor Ron DeSantis. I know future Governor Byron Donalds will continue that legacy, and he will keep making Florida great,” Nocco said. 

Other sheriffs who supported Donalds's bid for office this week included Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith, Brevard's Wayne Ivey, Collier's Kevin Rambosk, Hendry's Steve Whidden, Indian River's Eric Flowers, Jackson's Donnie Edenfield, Martin's John Budensiek, Monroe's Rick Ramsay, St. Lucie's  Richard Del Toro, and Wakulla's Jared Miller. 

Donalds is one of multiple leading House Republicans declining to run for reelection in the midterm elections. Instead, they are choosing to back away from national politics by mounting bids for offices in their home states. 

Donalds and former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, who entered the race earlier this month, are the two Republicans challenging Democrat David Jolly to become Florida's next governor. 

The Donalds campaign has highlighted recent polling giving the congressman a commanding lead in the Republican primary. A survey by the American Promise gave Donalds 40% of the vote outright. Renner and another rumored GOP candidate would each take 2%, with another 54% of voters remaining unsure of which Republican to support ahead of the 2026 election.

A poll looking at where voters place Donalds in relation to Democratic candidates ahead of the general election gave the congressman an 8-point lead over Jolly, 49% to 41%. Of those surveyed in the poll, conducted in late August by the AIF Center for Political Strategy, 11% of Floridians remained undecided about their candidate.

BYRON DONALDS TARGETS DAVID JOLLY ON GUN CONTROL AS FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE HEATS UP

Jolly's campaign has touted a poll it commissioned in early September showing the Democrat in a statistical tie with Donalds and Renner, with nearly 20% of voters undecided. 

Jolly's internal polling also indicated that with over 13 months to go until the general election, the leading candidates lack name recognition. More than half the respondents reported they do not know who Donalds, Jolly, or Renner are, with Donalds receiving the highest name recognition rate.

Pin Ni, an automobile executive identified in corporate documents as a member of the Chinese Communist Party, has donated roughly $45,000 to support New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

The donations Pin made to support Sherrill span across her career in Congress and her current bid for New Jersey governor. In February, Pin cut a $30,000 check to One Giant Leap PAC, the super PAC supporting Sherril's bid for the governor's mansion, campaign finance records show. Between February 2022 and September 2024, meanwhile, Sherrill accepted $14,500 in donations from Pin through her congressional campaign account. 

Pin sits on the board of directors for the Wanxiang Group, one of the world's largest automotive components manufacturers, and is the president of the conglomerate's American branch. During his tenure at the company, Pin has been recognized as an “outstanding Communist Party Member” 15 times and has taken on leadership roles at nonprofit organizations, such as the US-China Strong Foundation and the China General Chamber of Commerce, that outside observers have accused of working on behalf of the CCP.

Lu Guanqiu, the founder of Wanxiang Group and Pin's late father-in-law, received praise directly from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who said that his company is “in line with the Party Central Committee” and that he “always actively does what our Party committees and governments at all levels advocate.”

Guanqiu's son, Lu Weiding, took over the company after his father's death in 2021. 

New Jersey campaign finance records show that Lu donated $5,800 to Sherrill's gubernatorial campaign in November 2024. 

“Everyone here is a Communist Party member,” Lu said in a 2018 speech, which honored the 97th anniversary of the CCP. “Wanxiang's hallmark is to promote cadres from among its members and recruit party members from among its cadres. … A towering tree must have its roots; a stream flowing through a mountain must have its source.”

Sherrill is the second Democrat running in a competitive governor's race who counts Pin as a financial backer.

Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Abigail Spanberger received $50,000 in donations from Pin to support her campaign, the Washington Free Beacon reported in August. Additionally, federal campaign finance records reveal that Pin and Lu are massive donors to candidates and political committees across the country — primarily Democrats, but with some smaller contributions earmarked for Republicans. Examples include former President Joe Biden, the nonprofit group that put on the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ). 

HOW THE CCP'S PROPAGANDA MACHINE USES WESTERN ELITES TO BOLSTER ITS LEGITIMACY

The donations made by Pin have raised legal concerns among some experts. 

Chinese law, for instance, typically forbids members of the CCP from holding foreign citizenship or permanent residency. To make campaign contributions, people must either be green card holders or citizens of the United States. 

“It's bad enough if Spanberger is taking illegal campaign donations from a foreign source, but outrageous that it's from a member of the Chinese Communist Party,” National Legal and Policy Center counsel Paul Kamenar told the Washington Free Beacon in reference to its reporting on Spanberger, noting that the group would file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission.

Sherrill is a longtime supporter of policies favoring electric vehicles. Those same policies could be beneficial for Wanxiang Group's bottom line. Recent polling indicates that, despite New Jersey's historically Democratic leanings, Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli is locked in a statistical tie with Sherrill as controversies mount for the Democrat.

The Sherrill campaign did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The White House on Monday released a 20-point plan by President Donald Trump to end the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.

The release came minutes before Trump began speaking at the White House about the proposal, which has not been agreed to by Hamas. 

Trump was joined by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Trump said that Israel and other nations have accepted the outline he detailed.

""If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages, immediately, but in no case more than 72 hours,"" Trump said. That provision would require all dead and living hostages to be released by Hamas.

""I hope that we're going to have a deal for peace, and if Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible, they're the only one left,"" Trump said.

""Everyone else has accepted it. But I have a feeling that we're going to have a positive answer. But if not, as you know Bibi you'd have our full backing to do what you would have to do.""

The plan calls for Gaza to ""be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. 

The plan also calls for Gaza to ""be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza,"" and, ""If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end.""

""Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release,"" the proposal said.

""Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty,"" the proposal says. ""Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries."" 

""Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip.""

Netanyahu said, ""I believe that today, we're taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East."" 

""I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,"" Netanyahu said.

He warned that Israel would continue to prosecute the war if Hamas refuses Trump's plan.

""If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr. President, or if they supposedly accept it and then, then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself,"" Netanyahu said.

""This can be done the easy way, or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.""

The Trump administration will expand coal mine leasing on federal lands and provide hundreds of millions of dollars to support more coal-fired power generation, officials said on Monday.

The plan is part of a broader effort by the administration to reverse the decline of coal use in the U.S., a fossil fuel that has been hard hit by environmental regulation and competition from natural gas in recent years.

At a press conference in Washington, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said his department would open 13.1 million acres (5.3 million hectares) of federal land for coal leasing. The area opened up, in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, was more than triple the area in President Donald Trump's massive funding law.

President Joe Biden put a pause on coal leasing on federal lands and the last auction of leasing rights occurred in January 2021, just before he took office.

The Department of Energy, meanwhile, said it would provide $625 million in funds to expand power generation fueled by coal.

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said his agency would give coal plants more time to comply with regulations on coal ash, which contains contaminants including mercury, cadmium and arsenic and must be carefully disposed of.

Coal-burning plants generated about 15% of U.S. electricity in 2024, a fall from 50% in 2000, according to the Energy Information Administration, as fracking and other drilling methods have hiked natural gas output. Solar and wind power growth has also cut coal use.

The Sierra Club environmental group blasted the effort. ""If this dangerous agenda continues to advance, years from now we will look around at failing health outcomes, skyrocketing bills, and a decaying environment,"" it warned.

The coal workforce has declined to about 40,000 from 70,000 a decade ago.

Trump had signed executive orders in April to increase coal output, in one of his many actions that run counter to global efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Burgum, surrounded by more than a dozen coal miners wearing hard hats, said that the effort to support coal will strengthen the U.S. economy and create jobs.

Chris Wright, the U.S. energy secretary, told Reuters last week he expects most of the nation's coal-fired power plants to delay retirement to help deliver electricity needed to fuel artificial intelligence.

Last month, Wright extended his emergency order to keep a Michigan coal plant running, even though the plant's operator had been planning to shut permanently for economic reasons.

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, predicted that 38 coal plants scheduled to close through 2028 would remain open, either on Trump orders or voluntarily.

Analysts, however, have been skeptical about a long-term U.S. boost in the use of coal as the economics have shifted in favor of less carbon-intensive fuel.

""Coal may see a temporary boost from regulatory relief, and some investors may profit in the short term,"" Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors, wrote after Trump's orders. ""But in the long run, I think the writing is on the wall.""

Anthropic on Monday announced its latest artificial intelligence model: Claude Sonnet 4.5.

The model is better at coding, using computers and meeting practical business needs, and it excels in specialized fields like cybersecurity, finance and research, Anthropic said. The Amazon-backed startup, which is valued at $183 billion, is making Claude Sonnet 4.5 available to all users. 

Anthropic said Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the ""best coding model in the world"" according to industry benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities.

""People are just noticing with this model, because it's just smarter and more of a colleague, that it's kind of fun to work with it when encountering problems and fixing them,"" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's co-founder and chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview.

The model generates higher-quality code, is better at identifying code improvements and can follow instructions more reliably, the company said. 

Claude Sonnet 4.5 comes after Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.1 in August and Claude Sonnet 4 in May. It's the latest example of the breakneck pace of innovation within the AI industry.

Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers in 2021, and the two companies have been fierce competitors ever since. 

OpenAI kick-started the generative artificial intelligence boom following the release of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. The startup, which has seen its valuation swell to $500 billion, announced its latest model, GPT-5, in August. The rollout was rocky, as some users complained about losing access to the company's prior models.

Mike Krieger, Anthropic's chief product officer, said that Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be the default for users and that Anthropic recommends the model for ""basically every use case.""

Even so, users will have options. Paid subscribers can still choose to use Opus, and users with specific workflows can select an older generation of Sonnet if they aren't ready to migrate overnight, he said.  

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is smaller than Claude Opus 4.1 but smarter than it in ""almost every single way,"" Krieger added. 

""We have found it, and our customers are finding it, very useful for real, actual work,"" Krieger said.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 can run autonomously for 30 hours, and Anthropic said it's able to maintain focus on complex, multistep tasks throughout that period. Claude Opus 4, which the company launched in May, could run autonomously for just seven hours. 

Anthropic has also been able to improve the model's behavior through extensive safety training, the company said. It has reduced ""concerning behaviors"" like deception, power seeking and sycophancy, which is when a model tells a user what they want to hear. 

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is also more resistant to prompt injection attacks, where a model can get tricked into doing something malicious, like exposing sensitive data.  

""This is the biggest jump in safety that I think we've seen in the last probably year, year and a half,"" Kaplan said. 

Additional model launches are already on the horizon for Anthropic. Kaplan said better models are coming, including ""very likely Opus.""

""No promises,"" he said. ""But I think that we'll probably have one or two more releases before the end of the year.""

In this article

OpenAI on Monday announced Instant Checkout, a new feature that allows users to buy products through its artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. 

Instant Checkout initially supports single-item purchases directly from U.S. Etsy sellers, and it's available to U.S. ChatGPT Plus, Pro and Free users. OpenAI said more than one million Shopify merchants, including Skims and Glossier, are coming soon. 

Shares of Etsy rose more than 13% on Monday. Shopify's stock popped more than 5%.

OpenAI will take a fee from transactions that are completed through ChatGPT, which means Instant Checkout could become an important new revenue stream for the startup. OpenAI is not yet profitable, and is burning through cash as it works to scale up its computing infrastructure. 

The company declined to share specific details about how large the fees are since they are determined through confidential contracts with Etsy and Shopify. Instant Checkout is free to users and will not affect their prices, OpenAI said. 

""Our vision for ChatGPT – and a lot of the technology we create, but especially ChatGPT – is that it's not just providing you information, it is also helping you get things done in the real world,"" Michelle Fradin, OpenAI's product lead for ChatGPT commerce, told CNBC in an interview. 

The company plans to introduce multi-item carts and expand the regional availability of Instant Checkout going forward. 

OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months and introduced product recommendations as part of its search experience in April. ChatGPT surfaces products from across the web, and the results are ranked by relevance to the user and not influenced by partnerships with OpenAI, Fradin said.

Following the launch of Instant Checkout, if users are browsing and come across a product from an Etsy seller, for instance, they'll be able to purchase that item directly through ChatGPT instead of clicking out to the merchant's site.

Instant Checkout is powered by OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol, which is the underlying technology that allows users to complete a transaction directly with a merchant through ChatGPT. OpenAI built the framework in partnership with the fintech company Stripe, which powers ChatGPT subscriptions.

""If you are already a subscriber, you're already using your card in ChatGPT, then when you go to buy something from Etsy, you don't have to redo that work,"" Fradin said.

OpenAI initially decided to use Agentic Commerce Protocol for e-commerce, but Fradin said the company thinks it could be used to facilitate other types of purchases or payments as well. OpenAI is open-sourcing the framework to help merchants build integrations more quickly, and so that developers can explore different use cases, she said. 

ChatGPT surpassed 700 million weekly active users in August, and Fradin said ""a huge portion"" of the questions people are asking are related to shopping and commerce in some capacity. The questions can be specific, like asking for help finding a pair of black boots, or more broad, like how to plan a birthday party for 12 kids, for instance.  

""What we wanted to do is make it even easier for users to complete their journey in ChatGPT, and for merchants and developers to convert those conversations into checkouts,"" Fradin said.

Newmont Corp. on Monday announced that President and Chief Operating Officer Natascha Viljoen will succeed Tom Palmer as chief executive officer, starting in January.

Palmer, who has served as president and chief executive officer since 2019, will resign from the board and as CEO on December 31.

Viljoen joined the company in 2023 as executive vice president and chief operating officer, according to the company's website. Prior to joining the gold miner, she served as CEO of Valterra and held leadership positions at BHP and Lonmin.

Viljoen will become the first woman to lead Newmont in its over 100-year history, according to the company.

""I want to express my gratitude to Tom for his mentorship and support, and to the Board for entrusting me with the responsibility to lead Newmont into its next phase of growth,"" Viljoen in a press release.

Palmer joined Newmont in 2014 as Managing Director Indonesia before serving as the company's Managing Director Asia Pacific in 2015, and chief operating officer in 2016, according to its website.

""After 12 years with Newmont, and almost 40 years in the mining industry, it is time for me to retire and hand over to Natascha to lead our Company through the next chapter in its storied history,"" Palmer said in a statement.

Newmont earlier this month said it sold its stake in Orla Mining for $439 million as part of its divestiture program.

The Chinese national, 47, was the alleged mastermind of a £5bn fraud before coming to the UK.

Monday 29 September 2025 17:31, UK

A woman has pleaded guilty to money laundering offences over the UK's biggest-ever cryptocurrency seizure of Bitcoin, currently worth more than £5bn.

Chinese national Yadi Zhang, 47, who is also known as Zhimin Qian, was arrested in April last year after spending years on the run.

She first arrived in the UK on a false St Kitts and Nevis passport in September 2017 after allegedly carrying out a £5bn investment scam in China involving 130,000 investors in fraudulent wealth schemes between 2014 and 2017.

Police first raided her £5m six-bedroom rented house near Hampstead Heath, in north London, on 31 October 2018.

But it was another two and a half years before investigators discovered more than 61,000 Bitcoin in digital wallets - one of the biggest ever cryptocurrency seizures in the world.

The cryptocurrency was worth £1.4bn at the time but its value has now risen to more than £5bn and the fortune is at the centre of an intense battle between the UK government and Chinese investors over who gets to keep it.

The seized assets have reportedly been earmarked by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to help plug the hole in the public finances.

Zhang was due to face trial at Southwark Crown Court but has pleaded guilty to charges of possessing criminal property and transferring criminal property on or before 23 April 2024.

She appeared in the dock wearing glasses and a beige cardigan over an animal print blouse, nodding to confirm her identity before entering her pleas with the help of a Mandarin interpreter.

Judge Sally-Ann Hales remanded Zhang in custody ahead of sentencing at a later date.

Prosecutor Gillian Jones KC said she would not apply to launch confiscation proceedings because of the ongoing proceedings in the High Court.

Jian Wen, 43, was last year jailed for six years and eight months after being found guilty of one count of money laundering between October 2017 and January 2022 relating to 150 Bitcoin, now worth around £12.5m.

Her trial heard Wen was not involved in the alleged fraud but was said to have acted as a ""front person"" to help disguise the source of the money, some of which had been used to buy cryptocurrency and smuggled out of China on laptops.

Zhang's solicitor, Roger Sahota of Berkeley Square Solicitors, said: ""By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses.""","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}","cryptocurrency"

Zhimin Qian pleads guilty after wallets with 61,000 bitcoins, currently worth over £5bn, seized from north London home

A woman has been convicted for her role in a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud after what is thought to have been the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure.

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, 45, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket.

She stored the proceeds in bitcoin, but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices.

The Metropolitan police believe it is the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world.

Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring cryptocurrency that was criminal property and possessing it between October 2017 and April 2024.

She had fled China using a bogus St Kitts and Nevis passport in 2017 and entered the UK, where a year later she attempted to launder the money by buying property with the help of Jian Wen, 43, a Chinese takeaway worker. Wen was jailed for six years and eight months for her part in the scam in May 2024.

Qian appeared in court aided by a Mandarin interpreter. She will be sentenced at a later date.

Wen had arrived in the UK in 2007 and lived modestly in Leeds between 2011 and 2017 before working at a Chinese takeaway in south-east London. She moved in with Qian at a six-bedroom house in Hampstead Heath, north London, in September 2017.

While laundering the proceeds of the fraud, Wen drove around in a Mercedes and flew her son over from China 18 months later to attend a private school.

Qian fled after police raided the Hamsptead property, known as the Manor House, and seized a safety deposit box containing digital wallets that held vast sums in bitcoin.

Wen insisted she had no idea that the bitcoin came from the proceeds of fraud and claimed Qian had duped her. She said she helped Qian run a jewellery business which had branches in Singapore, Malaysia and China.

In January this year a judge ordered Wen to pay back more than £3m within three months or serve another seven years in jail. The recoverable amount derived from the bitcoin and two properties in Dubai.

For more than a century, the United States and the United Kingdom have been amongst the most influential nations in finance, working together to create the playbook for global trade and markets. Today, that partnership is entering a new phase as both countries commit to closer cooperation on digital assets—a gambit that could further entrench Washington and London at the vanguard of global finance, even as hubs like Singapore and Dubai emerge as formidable challengers.

This latest U.S.-UK tie-up comes via the recent creation of the Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future, which calls for joint recommendations on digital assets and capital markets within six months. The new body signals that the countries recognize that alignment—not isolation—is critical at a time when the likes of Singapore, Dubai and others are already seeing the financial and economic benefits of an inclusive approach to crypto regulation. 





The new taskforce brings together both banks and crypto firms, underscoring how central digital assets have become to the future of markets. Stablecoins, blockchain infrastructure, and programmable digital securities are no longer fringe concepts. They are fast becoming the backbone of 21st-century financial innovation.





The US and UK are at pivotal moments. In the US, Congress is advancing legislation to establish a stablecoin and digital asset framework. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England are designing rules under FSMA 2023, laying the groundwork for robust regimes around stablecoins and distributed ledgers.





Legislators and regulators in both countries are in rare bipartisan agreement on the benefits of crypto and blockchain. The fact that President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are engaging on the issue underscores their belief in how critical this technology will be. Likewise, England's main financial regulators—the Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England—as well as Chancellor Reeves are actively creating regulatory frameworks and working groups. They have even taken the step of allowing at least six major banks to launch pilot programs for tokenized crypto deposits, while increasing collaboration with highly regulated markets like Singapore to assess the impact crypto can have on global trade.




 By aligning now, both countries can set a global precedent – encouraging others to work across borders to build a more efficient, accessible, and stable financial system. This is not just about economics. It is about ensuring the next generation of payments and infrastructure are efficient, secure, and widely available.





Recent discussions about joint digital sandboxes and shared oversight show how practical cooperation can take shape. Just as the UK's Faster Payments System redefined real-time settlement, and Wall Street pioneered financial instruments that reshaped markets, a joint effort on stablecoins and digital currencies could anchor the next era of global innovation.





I write this as someone who has spent the past decade building OKX into one of the world's largest regulated crypto exchanges, with licensed operations across the US, EU, Middle East, and Asia. From this vantage point, I see how quickly digital assets are moving from the periphery of finance into the mainstream.





History shows that financial leadership is sustained by openness to innovation. Properly regulated stablecoins and robust blockchain infrastructure are not threats to systemic stability; they are the new building blocks of trust in the digital economy. Both the US and UK already recognize this.





The opportunity is huge when it comes to stablecoins. Properly regulated, they create a bridge between traditional money and blockchain-based systems, offering trust at the core while unlocking efficiency at the edges.




In the US, proposed legislation mandates 1:1 fiat reserves. In the UK, regulators are moving toward high-quality backing requirements, though final rules remain under consultation. Stablecoins could become a reliable medium of exchange once these regimes are live. More importantly, by operating on blockchains, they can dramatically lower the cost of remittances, payroll, and B2B trade – giving companies of all sizes greater liquidity and competitiveness.





Digital ledger technology is the foundation of this transformation. Its transparency and interoperability can reduce risk in clearing and settlement, improve auditability, and give regulators better tools for oversight. Together, stablecoins and blockchain infrastructure could reinvigorate financial systems in both countries, ensuring they remain leaders in the future of global finance.





Chancellor Reeves and Treasury Secretary Bessent have laid out an aggressive 180-day sprint to identify the first areas of crypto collaboration. I, for one, look forward to the findings. If London and Washington succeed, the entire world stands to benefit.





Star Xu is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of crypto exchange OKX,  and a frequent commentator on how crypto and digital finance can strengthen transparency, efficiency, and competitiveness in the global economy.

Hyperliquid rewarded loyal users with NFTs, but looming unlocks keep traders watchful.

Hypurr NFTs are unique digital collectibles airdropped to early Hyperliquid users as a reward for supporting the project.

Yes, several NFTs tied to compromised wallets were stolen, and analysts are wary of a looming $12B HYPE token unlock that could impact prices.

Early users of Hyperliquid [HYPE] just got a big reward for sticking around.

On the 28th of September, the Hyper Foundation rolled out its long-awaited Hypurr NFT collection, handing out these digital collectibles to early adopters of the perpetuals-focused Layer-1 blockchain.

Hyperliquid pushed ahead with its latest community move on Sunday, dropping 4,600 Hypurr NFTs to early supporters through the HyperEVM.

The collection, designed to celebrate the culture and quirks of the ecosystem, required no action from users and was automatically distributed.

The statement read,

“The goal of the Hypurr NFT collection was to share a memento with those who believed in and contributed early on to Hyperliquid's growth. Each NFT is unique and captures the different moods, hobbies, tastes, and quirks of the Hyperliquid community, as depicted by Hypurr.”

Most of the supply went to Genesis Event participants from November 2024, while 144 NFTs went to the Foundation and 143 to contributors including Hyperliquid Labs and NFT artists.

But the rollout wasn't without drama.

Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT flagged that eight Hypurr NFTs tied to compromised wallets were stolen shortly after the drop, netting the attacker around $400,000.

The incident quickly caused concerns around wallet safety, even as hype built around the new collection.

Alongside the NFT drop, Hyperliquid also unlocked a new feature on its mainnet recently: permissionless spot quote assets.

This means stable asset issuers can now activate quote status on-chain without approval, giving the platform more flexibility.

AMBCrypto previously reported that Native Markets was quick to jump in, launching USDH (a stablecoin backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries) as the first permissionless quote asset.

The move immediately enabled HYPE/USDH trading, and more assets are likely to follow.

Despite all this, risks remain.

Analysts are watching a looming $12 billion HYPE unlock that could put pressure on prices, while recent instability in kHYPE's peg has raised questions about the durability of its token economy.

Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid's Hypurr non-fungible token (NFT) collection is changing hands at around $55,000 on Monday, Sept. 29, just one day after its deployment on HyperEVM, the ecosystem's Layer 1 (L1) blockchain.

The 4,600 NFT collection currently has a floor price of 1,250 HYPE ($55,000), with the top offer at 1,161 HYPE ($52,000). Meanwhile, its total 24-hour volume has reached 1.5 million HYPE, or roughly $70 million. HYPE is currently trading at $46.94, up 6.3% on the day, according to CoinGecko. 

About 11% of the collection is listed, with 3,955 unique owners representing roughly 86% of the total supply, according to OpenSea data. Of the 4,600 NFTs in the collection, 4,313 were allocated to Genesis Event participants, 144 to the Hyper Foundation, and 143 to core contributors, including Hyperliquid Labs and NFT artists.

However, shortly after the airdrop, a threat actor reportedly stole eight Hypurr NFTs from compromised wallets, profiting approximately $400,000, according to blockchain analyst ZachXBT, who shared the news on Telegram. Despite this, enthusiasm around the NFT collection remains strong. 

Even before their official launch, Hypurr NFTs drew strong interest, trading on OTC markets for $30,000 to $60,000 throughout much of 2025. By Sept. 19, demand had pushed the floor price to $100,000 on DripTrade, a Hyperliquid-based NFT platform, The Defiant reported at the time. 

The Hypurr NFT launch underscores Hyperliquid's efforts to reward its early supporters, strengthen community engagement, and expand its ecosystem through new features. 

“The goal of the Hypurr NFT collection was to share a memento with those who believed in and contributed early on to Hyperliquid's growth,” the Hyper Foundation posted on X. “Each NFT is unique and captures the different moods, hobbies, tastes, and quirks of the Hyperliquid community, as depicted by Hypurr.”

Hyperliquid currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $5.86 billion, per DeFiLlama. Meanwhile, the Hyperliquid L1 boasts a TVL of $2.2 billion. 

The Hypurr NFT launch coincides with Hyperliquid's ongoing ecosystem expansion. Most recently, the project rolled out its native stablecoin USDH through Native Markets, following its successful bid to develop the asset.

Currently, USDH, which is Hyperliquid's first dollar-pegged asset, has a market capitalization of $1.44 million. 

Hyperliquid also made headlines earlier this summer for, at one point, handling more Bitcoin (BTC) spot volume over a single weekend than both Coinbase and Bybit, highlighting its growing influence, The Defiant previously reported.

Hyperliquid launched HyperEVM in February. At the time, the Hyper Foundation called it “a major step toward the vision of housing all finance by bringing general-purpose programmability to Hyperliquid's performant financial system.”

In collaboration with leading token fundraising platform Legion, Kraken has introduced Kraken Launch, a token sale launchpad with retail crypto investor access. The launchpad enables individual investors to participate in transparent and fair token sales before they get listed on exchanges for public trading.

Retail investors usually get access to early-stage tokens only after VCs, institutions, and other private participants have already invested. As a result, individual investors often face disadvantages in early crypto investing, where ICOs are typically restricted to insiders.

Kraken aims to address this insider exclusivity issue through its new and innovative ICO participation platform, Kraken Launch. It enables users to invest in trusted crypto presales alongside VCs and institutional investors. Additionally, the platform is based on Legion's merit-based token allocation, which rewards dedicated community members.

Overall, Kraken Launch fosters a fair crypto fundraising environment that enhances token distribution and unlocks greater opportunities for passionate community members and everyday crypto investors.

Let's highlight Kraken Launch's main features and how it excels as a new token sale launchpad.

With the Legion partnership, Kraken Launch benefits from the crypto fundraising platform's merit-based ICO funding technology. It combines blockchain transparency with regulatory compliance, primarily adhering to MiCA rules in Europe, utilizing AI-assisted compliance tools.



Legion provides retail-friendly access to crypto token sales, enabling anyone, regardless of their financial situation, to potentially secure early-stage allocations. For client safety, the platform uses a compliance-focused fundraising approach, requiring crypto ICO projects to provide transparent details and adhere to MiCA standards, with no hidden terms.

At the core of the entire crypto fundraising system is the Legion score, a reputation system that rewards active, value-adding community members with larger token allocations. It bases the score on social activity, on-chain history, and developer contributions to give the most deserving users greater token access.

Kraken Launch, leveraging Legion's merit-based crypto fundraising model, offers key advantages for investors and crypto project teams.

Retail investors benefit from a safe ICO investing experience thanks to Kraken's proven platform security and Legion's compliance-focused fundraising framework. They also receive transparent project information with no hidden allocations. The platform also rewards higher token allocations to the most dedicated investors.

For crypto project teams, Kraken Launch offers global distribution and greater liquidity through more inclusive capital formation. Through Legion's fair model, the ICO participation platform ensures presale tokens go to committed users who are more likely to support the project's long-term growth, rather than purely VCs and institutions that might only be interested in capital gains.

Blockchain technology was built to democratize finance, promising inclusivity, fairness, and permissionless security. Leaders from both Kraken and Legion see Kraken Launch as a return to broad asset ownership and real community distribution.

“Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow's financial infrastructure with crypto at its core,” explained Brett McLain, Kraken's Head of Payments and Blockchain. “Together with Legion, we're scaling a product that democratizes token sales and aligns communities with builders.”

Aligning with this vision, Legion co-founder Matt O'Connor added, “Crypto gave us the tools to rebuild capital markets from first principles. This partnership combines Legion's approach to regulation and merit-based access with Kraken's global distribution, compliance infrastructure, and deep liquidity.”

Kraken Launch stands out compared to other popular launchpads, such as Binance Launchpad or KuCoin Spotlight, mainly due to the platform's Legion partnership. It allows Kraken to offer a dual sale model, where crypto token sales occur on-chain and are further facilitated by the Kraken exchange.



Additionally, Kraken Launch enforces a compliance-first approach to crypto fundraising based on Legion's model. In particular, this helps investors stay aligned with MiCA regulations. Featured ICO projects provide transparent tokenomics with no hidden round allocations.

By leveraging the Legion score, Kraken's new launchpad platform provides a more community-driven fundraising environment compared to other platforms that lack the merit-based allocation system. As a result, Kraken Launch features early-stage cryptos with the most potential, supported by more committed token holders.

What can you do now to prepare for the first few projects at Kraken Launch? Here are some easy steps to follow:

Kraken Launch, in partnership with Legion, is making crypto fundraising more accessible, fairer, and transparent. By adopting a compliance-first approach, it is paving the way for increased regulatory approval in early crypto investing and ICO projects.

Participate in the first industry-exclusive token sale on Kraken Launch before the project goes public. Visit Kraken today and discover how to gain early access to upcoming Web3 projects, as well as receive significant presale token allocations.

Crypto.com announced its strategic partnership with Sharps Technology, Inc. (STSS) to manage the latter's Solana-based digital asset treasury. With more than 2 million SOL tokens in its holdings, valued at over $400 million, STSS aims to use Crypto.com's platform for managing these assets. This collaboration will also drive greater institutional participation in the Solana ecosystem, aligning both companies with Solana's future growth.

STSS has been expanding its digital asset treasury strategy, with a clear focus on the Solana network. As part of the agreement, Crypto.com will offer its institutional-grade custody infrastructure, along with access to its OTC desk. The partnership aims to maximize returns on STSS's Solana holdings while maintaining secure management. Crypto.com's platform will allow STSS to deploy a portion of its assets into Solana-native projects, contributing to the broader growth of the Solana ecosystem.

The strategic collaboration marks a pivotal moment for Solana as both companies focus on fostering institutional involvement. Through Crypto.com's secure custody solutions and OTC services, STSS will deploy its Solana holdings more efficiently and transparently. This approach aligns with institutional needs for compliance, security, and liquidity access.

Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, commented on the partnership, saying, “STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision.” 

He further emphasized that Crypto.com's infrastructure is uniquely suited for institutions looking to safely manage digital asset treasuries. The partnership underlines the growing importance of bridging traditional finance with the Solana blockchain.

The collaboration between STSS and Crypto.com will go beyond simple asset management. STSS plans to actively engage with Solana's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, allocating capital into staking, liquidity provision, and validator support. These efforts are designed to strengthen the Solana network's infrastructure, increasing liquidity and supporting long-term growth. 

By generating yield through these strategies, STSS will also play a role in the sustainability of Solana's ecosystem.

James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS, explained, “Partnering with Crypto.com provides us with institutional-grade tools and liquidity access to responsibly manage one of the largest Solana treasuries, while also contributing to the growth of the Solana ecosystem.” This move shows how institutional players are increasingly looking to capitalize on the blockchain's potential, integrating these assets into real-world financial strategies.

On September 26, 2025, RTX Corporation witnessed a 2.31% surge in stock value amid news of securing a $1.7 billion defense contract. This deal, acquired through RTX's Raytheon division, involves providing nine Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) radar systems to both the U.S. Army and Poland, marking Poland's first foray into employing this technology. This significant deal not only positions RTX favorably within the competitive global defense market but also illustrates the company's capability to garner considerable international contracts in the midst of intensifying geopolitical tensions and increases in defense budgets worldwide.

The LTAMDS radar system is engineered to counteract sophisticated threats, including hypersonic weapons, boasting cutting-edge technology capable of delivering a full 360-degree surveillance radius to track multiple threats at once. Such advanced technology cements RTX's standing in next-gen defense systems, piquing the interest of several nations eager to adopt the radar technology, opening avenues for future revenue growth.

With U.S. Department of Defense funding expected to hit $1.01 trillion for FY2026—steering focus towards modernization, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital transformation—fintech companies are becoming increasingly acknowledged as pivotal components in defense ecosystems. This burgeoning budget provides fertile ground for fintech to ease the burdens faced by defense industrial bases and supply chains, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Rising defense allocations stimulate demand for advanced financial solutions. Increased fintech innovations cut financial frictions for SMEs by broadening credit accessibility, reducing costs of capital, and amplifying transparency via improved risk assessment. This is particularly vital for SMEs embedded within defense supply chains that frequently encounter convoluted financing predicaments. Through these innovations, SMEs can better manage cash flow volatility as well as recover more quickly from setbacks—perfectly aligning with the defense sector's necessity for resilient suppliers.

The potential involvement of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in bolstering defense financial operations cannot be understated. The digital transformation in finance, which has been sped up by tools such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, is redefining the finance landscape, including procurement and supply chain financing. This evolution lays the groundwork for integrating crypto solutions into defense-related financial operations, facilitating faster, more transparent, and secure payment options.

Acknowledging the strategic significance of fintech in defense ecosystems bolsters the argument for innovating financial services that enhance national sovereignty. Fintech firms are anticipated to contribute to strengthening strategic autonomy through deploying crypto and blockchain solutions for secure transactions. Such integration could refine the efficacy of defense financial operations, rendering them less vulnerable to geopolitical risks.

The advent of fintech solutions in the defense arena presents SMEs with enhanced access to financial resources and cutting-edge payment systems. Innovations from fintech can mitigate financial frictions, allowing SMEs to tackle financing complexities with renewed vigor. With stablecoins becoming increasingly integrated into payroll systems, they provide employees in inflation-sensitive regions clarity regarding salary values.

Furthermore, fintech enables more seamless cross-border payments, simplifying processes for SMEs seeking to employ international contractors and manage offshore payroll services. The rise of USDC payroll solutions resonates well, attracting startups looking to entice global talent who prefer crypto compensation. This is critical in today's geopolitical climate where cryptocurrencies are often deemed as hedges against inflation and systemic risks.

Looking ahead, several trends are set to redefine crypto payroll and financial management. The ascendancy of stablecoins is anticipated to serve as a buffer against the volatility of cryptocurrencies, establishing a level of salary value stability for employees. There is an increasing inclination among startups to adopt hybrid models, amalgamating crypto with stablecoins for effective management of income fluctuations.

Additionally, the adoption of advanced technologies like AI and blockchain in payroll systems will elevate security and transparency, making crypto payroll solutions attractive to businesses. Interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto payment channels is expected to facilitate cross-border transactions, reducing expenses and optimizing performance.

By 2030, salaries could predominantly shift toward cryptocurrencies, with firms employing crypto treasury management strategies to enhance financial operations. The buzz around ""Pay Me in Bitcoin"" among tech workers indicates a significant shift in how compensation is regarded across the modern workforce.

In essence, the synthesis of escalating defense contracts, growing defense expenditures focused on technology, and fintech's validated capacity to facilitate SME financial access and resilience points to a transformative era. Crypto-enabled solutions may very well become synonymous with defense supply chains, fundamentally changing how companies engage with financial operations in an increasingly complex world.

The Algorand Foundation has tapped Nikolaos Bougalis, a veteran cryptographer and former Ripple engineering lead, as its new chief technology officer, the company said in a press release Monday.

Bougalis, who spent nearly a decade guiding development of the open-source XRP Ledger, will lead Algorand's engineering efforts and help advance its 2025 technical roadmap.

Algorand's ALGO (ALGO) token was trading 2.6% higher over 24 hours alongside a generaly rally in crypto prices.

Algorand's roadmap, unveiled in July, focuses on decentralization, Web3 adoption, enterprise use cases, and cutting-edge cryptography. Bougalis is expected to play a key role in aligning the foundation and Algorand Technologies around those goals.

“Nik brings a wealth of experience in distributed systems, cryptography, and blockchain, as well as a demonstrated ability to foster collaborative development communities,” Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden said in the release. “He will help us double down on decentralization, performance, and security.”

Bougalis will be based in the U.S. as the foundation seeks to expand its footprint among domestic enterprises and institutions looking for compliant, scalable blockchain infrastructure. 

His background in security and cryptography is expected to strengthen Algorand's work on privacy, quantum resistance and scalability.

Algorand, launched in 2019, aims to offer instant finality and low fees for builders creating projects in payments, identity, supply chain, and asset tokenization. The ecosystem now includes millions of users and a global network of developers using familiar programming languages like Python and TypeScript.

Crypto credit firm Maple Finance and Elwood Technologies are joining forces to make it easier for large financial institutions to enter digital asset credit markets. The companies announced Monday that Maple's on-chain lending and asset management platform will link up with Elwood's execution, portfolio management, and risk tools.

Maple, founded in 2021, specializes in structured lending products and yield strategies built on public blockchains. Elwood, the trading company backed by hedge-fund manager Alan Howard, provides connectivity to global crypto exchanges, custodians and fund administrators, along with analytics and risk monitoring tools for institutional investors.

The collaboration targets a key friction point for traditional players. Banks and asset managers looking to diversify into digital assets face fragmented infrastructure and operational hurdles. By combining Maple's lending expertise with Elwood's institutional trading and risk systems, the firms aim to create a framework that mirrors what professional investors expect in traditional markets.

Sid Powell, Maple's CEO, said the partnership will extend “institutional-grade” access to on-chain credit opportunities. Elwood CEO Chris Lawn added that credit markets are an essential piece of crypto's evolution and need the same type of infrastructure as other asset classes.

The move comes as demand for tokenized credit and fixed-income products grows. For example, Ripple and Credbull recently launched initiatives that bring U.S. Treasuries and private credit onto blockchain rails. Maple and Elwood's tie-up underscores how service providers are trying to position themselves as gateways for institutional capital entering the decentralized economy.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) ETH$4,174.27 holdings rose to 2.65 million tokens, the company announced in a Sunday evening (U.S. hours) press release. That amount would be more than 2% of the total ETH supply, said the company.

Combined with 192 BTC, $157 million in ""moonshot"" equities, and $436 million in unencumbered cash, the company's holdings were worth $11.6 billion.

The company's total ether owned seemingly show a jump of around 200,000 ETH, or around $820 million, from its previous ether treasury update.

BitMine's goal is to own 5% of all ETH. In the company's words, the “alchemy of 5%” would position BitMine to benefit from Ethereum's long-term network effects.

Tom Lee, Fundstrat's head of research and BitMine's chairman, described crypto as one of two “supercycle” investment narratives of the decade, alongside AI.

“These two powerful macro cycles will play out over decades. Since ETH's price is a discount to the future, this bodes well for the token and is the reason BitMine's primary treasury asset is ETH,"" he said.

Bitmine is currently the leading ETH treasury firm, far ahead of runner-up SharpLink Gaming, which holds 838,730 ETH according to StrategicEthReeserve data. In total, these firms hold 5.26 million ETH, or around 4.34% of its supply.

Shares are higher by 3% in premarket action alongside a weekend bounce in the price of ETH to $4,110.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Swift partners with Consensys to build blockchain settlement system","https://cointelegraph.com/news/swift-taps-consensys-for-blockchain-settlement-system","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:34:25 GMT","

 Swift is teaming up with Consensys and over 30 unspecified institutions to build a blockchain-based settlement system for 24/7 real-time cross-border payments. 

The Swift interbank communication network is working with Ethereum ecosystem developer Consensys to develop a blockchain settlement system.

According to a Monday announcement, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is developing a blockchain in collaboration with over 30 financial institutions and Consensys. The initial focus is on developing infrastructure for “real-time 24/7 cross-border payments.”

One of the objectives of the new blockchain will be interoperability with “existing and emerging networks,” while also maintaining compliance. Consensys is tasked with developing the conceptual prototype in the first phase and defining the future work phases.

“The ledger will extend Swift's financial communication role into a digital environment,” the announcement said. Swift added that the platform will support the exchange of tokenized assets, though the types of tokens will ultimately be determined by central and commercial banks.

Blockchain, once described as a solution in search of a problem, is now being adopted rapidly by the traditional finance industry. Per the announcement, the vision for Swift's new infrastructure is “a secure, real-time log of transactions between financial institutions.”

This would be important considering that Swift underpins most international payments in the modern financial ecosystem. According to the organization's website, over 11,500 institutions in over 200 countries rely on the company's infrastructure to process their transactions.

Swift does not directly move any money; instead, it provides an interbank communication network. It is meant to reduce errors and fraud risk. It is so pervasive that sanctions or exclusion from Swift can effectively cut a country or bank off from the global financial system.

“Because there are very few alternatives to SWIFT, financial sanctions that limit access to this network have become particularly costly for sanctioned entities,” according to a US Federal Reserve Bank of New York report.

This is not Swift's first move into blockchain. In March 2024, Swift publicly recognized the value of tokenization and the shared ledger model. The organization sees a continuing role for its messaging layer within a blockchain-based financial system:

In November 2024, Swift provided its global financial messaging network to integrate tokenized fund processes with existing fiat payment systems. The initiative was carried out in collaboration with UBS Asset Management and blockchain oracle network Chainlink as part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Guardian.

Also in late 2024, Swift announced that North American, European and Asian banks would begin digital asset trials on its network. The trials aim to explore how the banking network can provide financial institutions with unified access to “multiple digital asset classes and currencies.”

 Bitcoin failed to follow gold to all-time highs this month, but analysts argue that BTC usually follows three to four months later, setting targets as high as $300,000. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's bull market still has room to run with a target range of $150,000-$300,000, analysts say.

BTC must decisively push above the $112,000-$114,000 zone to ignite a possible rally to $140,000.

Bitcoin's (BTC) sudden drop to $108,000 last week made it a 13% drawdown from its $124,500 all-time high, sparking fears that the BTC price might have peaked. 

Despite this drawdown, some analysts argued that Bitcoin's bull market had not even started, citing its performance relative to gold. 

As Cointelegraph continues to report, both gold and US stock markets have posted repeated all-time highs, while Bitcoin remains stuck as liquidity games keep bulls away.

Analysts were not worried about gold front-running Bitcoin, as analyst Milk Road Macro said, 

The comparative analysis showed that both gold/USD and BTC/USD pairs had formed rising wedge patterns, with gold breaking out to the upside in January. 

In March, “$BTC began to mimic gold's ‘rise → pause → last minute spike' pattern” highlighted in the green below, the analyst said, adding: 

Milk Road Macro further explained that while gold's breakout represented about a 10% gain, “Bitcoin has been known to outperform these percentage returns by 5-10x.”

They added that this puts Bitcoin's potential upside gains in the 50% to 100% range, or $160,000 to $220,000.

Related: A Bitcoin strategic reserve may be bad for BTC and USD: Crypto exec

The “bull market in Bitcoin has not started yet,” said 50TFunds CEO Dan Tapiero in an X post on Monday.

He highlighted that the BTC/XAU pair traded in a “massive cup and handle” pattern in the weekly time frame, which could lead to new price discovery for Bitcoin over the next few weeks.

A break above the neckline at 37 XAU opens the way for the BTC/XAU pair to rally 446% toward the measured target of the cup-and-handle pattern at 160 XAU.

This points to a major price breakout for Bitcoin over the next few months.

Tapiero's argument was a response to crypto investor Zynx's analysis, who said the BTC/USD pair needed to rise above $150,000 to “equal its all-time high in gold.”

Historically, “Bitcoin has more than doubled its price in gold at a minimum, usually much more than that,” wrote Zynx's, adding:

Meanwhile, CryptoQuant contributor XWIN Research Japan argues that Bitcoin is still in its bull market, based on several onchain metrics. 

Bitcoin hit an intra-day high of $112,293 on Monday, reclaiming the $112,000 level after losing it on Thursday. It was trading at $112,233 at the time of writing, up 2.4% over the last 24 hours, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

“$BTC broke out of the down trend line overnight after squeezing all the late shorts,” said AlphaBTC in his latest analysis on X.

An accompanying chart showed that a key area of interest for Bitcoin bulls was today's open at $112,000. Holding this level would see the price push toward the local high at $114,000, signalling the strength of the recovery.

The 24-hour Bitcoin liquidation heatmap showed that BTC price could target a large block of bid liquidity as it moves higher. There is over $612 million in ask orders between $112,350 and $114,000. 

A sweep of this liquidity seems highly likely in the coming days, and a break above $114,000 could signal the end of the correction.

As Cointelegraph reported, a decisive move above the $113,000-$114,000 resistance zone could confirm a breakout from a bull flag, opening the door for a rally toward $140,000 in the months ahead.

Scientists found that climate change has been increasing the size of larger trees in the Amazon by about 3 percent per decade over the past three decades.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When the words “Amazon rainforest” and “climate change” appear in the same sentence, the news is rarely good.

Known as the “lungs of the planet” due to its immense concentration of vegetation, the Amazon is central to humanity's fight against climate change, acting as a vital carbon sink for humanity's greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the sprawling rainforest captures up to one-fourth of the CO2 absorbed by all of the land on Earth. That's why it's immensely bad news that in the past 40 years, the Amazon has lost roughly 121 million acres of rainforest—roughly the same size as the nation of Spain.

While the Amazon is helpless against the ecological wrecking ball known as humanity, a new study shows that it still retains a remarkable ability to adapt. Published in the journal Nature Plants, this study—completed by an international team of scientists and led by University of Cambridge ecologist Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert—details how climate change (specifically, the rise in carbon dioxide levels) is having a surprisingly positive effect on average tree size in the Amazon. 

“Large trees are hugely beneficial for absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and this study confirms that,” Esquivel-Muelbert said in a press statement. “Despite concerns that climate change may negatively impact trees in the Amazon and undermine the carbon sink effect, the effect of CO2 in stimulating growth is still there. This shows the remarkable resilience of these forests, at least for now.""

In the study, Esquivel-Muelbert and her team analyzed 188 permanent plots in the Amazon and found that the trees consistently grew larger than expected over the course of three decades. While this fertilization benefit from increased carbon dioxide impacts trees both small and large, the most profound impacts were witnessed in the latter category. Measurements of these larger trees' basal area—the cross-section of the tree when measured at roughly chest height—increased by 3.3 percent per decade. 

The authors note that this finding runs counter to the “large-trees-lose hypothesis,” which states that larger trees should be more susceptible to increased drought or windthrow (being uprooted by strong winds). 

The Amazon also isn't the only forest that's experiencing shifts due to climate change. A 2023 study from the University of New Brunswick in Canada found that boreal forests (northern high latitude forests) will grow 20 percent faster in 2050 due to warmer temperatures and the longer growing seasons they bring. 

But in both of these cases, the good news of chunkier or faster-growing trees may not necessarily outpace the climate change-induced disruptions these forests face—whether by humans, insect outbreaks, wildfires, or other extreme climate calamities. Reuters reports that 2024 was one of the worst years for tropical rainforest loss in history.

“What happens to big trees—including how they deal with increasing climate threats and manage to disperse their seeds—is now mission-critical,” Oliver Phillips, a co-author of the study and ecologist from the University of Leeds, said in a press release. “The only way the giants will stay healthy is if the Amazon ecosystem stays connected. Deforestation is a huge threat-multiplier and will kill them if we let it.”

Rainforests around the world will help us heal the planet as we transition away from fossil fuels to a green energy future. We just need to stop destroying them and let them get on with the job.

The ship, which sunk off the coast of Greece after striking a German mine during World War I, sits about 400 feet below the ocean's surface. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Diving nearly 400 feet into the ocean off the coast of the Greek island of Kea, a team of 11 navigated the sunken Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. In doing so, they retrieved a trove of artifacts, despite the strong current and poor visibility. 

The team wasn't able to grab every item they were after, due to the state of decay of the vessel and artifacts it houses. But the ship's lookout bell and port navigation lamp came to the surface in secure lift bags, along with ceramic tiles from the onboard Turkish bath, silver-plated first-class trays and a pair of items from the second-class cabins: a passenger's binoculars and a porcelain sink, according to a report from the Greek-language Kathimerini. 

Britannic, a slightly larger and newer sister ship of the Titanic, launched in 1914 as a White Star Line's Olympic-class luxury cruise liner, and was converted into a hospital ship for the British Royal Navy during World War I. While traveling to a hospital on the Greek island of Lemnos in November 1916, the ship hit a German mine off the coast of Kea. Less than an hour later, the Britannic had fully sunk. Tragically, thirty of the 1,065 people on board died when two lifeboats were sucked into the ship's still-moving propellers. 

The location of the wreck—about 45 miles southeast of Athens in the Aegean Sea—in deep and tumultuous waters have made the site's exploration tricky, open only to specialist divers. Under approval from Greece's Ministry of Culture, the 11-member multinational team used closed-circuit rebreathers to reach the Britannic, aiming for specific items during a weeklong effort this past spring.

But reaching the sunken ship was just the beginning of the difficulties. The divers had navigate tight quarters, in some cases with extremely fragile conditions. This, in addition to the aforementioned strong currents and poor visibility due to the depths to which they dove, made it impossible to retrieve all of the items they had hoped to resurface. 

Each item they did recover was placed in a lift bag, and then a protective container, and immediately cleaned of grime from over 100 years underwater. Once brought to shore, the Kea Police Department provided secure storage, and the items were then taken to the conservation laboratories at the Department of Underwater Antiquities in Athens as teams prepare them for display at the under-construction National Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Piraeus. A planned World War I exhibit will feature the Britannic's recovered items at the center.

Polymyxin antibiotics target lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) in both membranes of the bacterial cell envelope, leading to bacterial killing through a poorly defined mechanism. Here we demonstrate that metabolic activity is essential for the lethality of clinically relevant doses of polymyxin B (PmB) and leverage this insight to determine its mode of action. PmB killed exponential-phase Escherichia coli but did not eliminate stationary-phase cells unless a carbon source was available. Antibiotic lethality correlated with surface protrusions visible by atomic force microscopy and LPS loss from the outer membrane via processes that required LPS synthesis and transport but that were blocked by the MCR-1 polymyxin resistance determinant. While energy-dependent outer-membrane disruption was not directly lethal, it facilitated PmB access to the inner membrane, which the antibiotic permeabilized in an energy-independent manner, leading to cell death. This work reveals how metabolic inactivity confers tolerance of an important, membrane-targeting antibiotic.

The bactericidal activity of many antibiotics is dependent upon cellular metabolic activity1,2,3,4,5. For the efficacy of membrane-targeting antibiotics or peptides, however, it has been proposed that metabolic activity is not required, because intact membranes are presumed essential in all physiological states6,7,8. In support of this, many membrane-targeting compounds are effective against metabolically active and inactive bacteria9,10,11,12,13.

Polymyxin antibiotics are the only membrane-targeting drugs used clinically against Gram-negative bacteria, but often lack efficacy in vivo, despite potent bactericidal activity in vitro14,15,16,17,18. Two polymyxins are used therapeutically, polymyxin B (PmB) and polymyxin E (colistin), both of which consist of a cationic cyclic peptide component coupled to an extracyclic peptide chain which in turn is linked to an acyl tail14,15,18. Both polymyxin antibiotics target lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) via high-affinity, long-lasting interactions, leading to disruption of the outer membrane (OM)18,19,20. However, the nature of this OM disruption and the mechanism by which bacteria are killed by the antibiotic is largely unknown14,15,18,21,22,23,24.

Several previous studies have shown that inner-membrane (IM) permeabilization, which is proposed to be required for killing, occurs after OM disruption14,15,21,25,26,27,28. Our previous work showed that LPS is the IM target of polymyxins, just as it is for the OM27,28. While it is unknown how polymyxins cross the OM to access the periplasmic space, the predominant model is ‘self-promoted' uptake, by which the cationic properties of the antibacterial disrupt cation bridges between LPS molecules, compromising barrier function and enabling antibiotic ingress through the OM14,29,30.

Despite the membrane-damaging effect of polymyxins, they do not eradicate persister cells of Escherichia coli or Acinetobacter baumannii31,32. Stationary-phase E. coli has also been shown to have a high level of polymyxin tolerance, suggesting that the bactericidal activity of these membrane-targeting antimicrobials is affected by metabolic activity and/or growth state10. Accordingly, metabolic activity was found to be required for colistin lethality at clinically relevant doses13. However, at concentrations above those typically achieved clinically (>10–50 µg ml−1), polymyxin lethality was found to be unaffected by growth phase or metabolic activity13,32,33.

In summary, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of how polymyxin antibiotics kill bacteria, and the requirement for metabolic activity remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether and why metabolic activity was needed for polymyxin lethality and thereby gain a significantly improved understanding of the mechanism by which this class of antibiotics kill bacteria.

To assess the role of growth and metabolic activity in PmB-mediated killing, we took equal numbers of E. coli in exponential phase (high metabolic activity) or stationary phase (low metabolic activity) and exposed them to a clinically relevant concentration of the antibiotic (4 µg ml−1) in minimal medium only (MM) or with glucose (MM + G) to stimulate metabolic activity (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a)34,35,36. Exponential-phase E. coli cells were rapidly killed by PmB regardless of whether glucose was present (Fig. 1a), and PmB efficiently killed stationary-phase bacteria in the presence of glucose, albeit after a lag phase of 15 min during which there was no decrease in viability (Fig. 1a). Strikingly, however, there was no detectable killing of stationary-phase E. coli during exposure to PmB in the absence of glucose, indicating that metabolic activity is required for the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic (Fig. 1a). This effect of glucose was dose dependent, and the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose did not support PmB-mediated killing of stationary-phase E. coli (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Conversely, there does not appear to be a requirement for cell division for PmB killing, as MM without antibiotic (±glucose) did not support noticeable growth of E. coli from either exponential or stationary phase during the assay.

Except for stationary-phase cells without glucose, all bacteria were SYTOX positive by the end of the imaging (Supplementary Fig. 6a). It is worth noting that a lower PmB concentration was used for AFM relative to other experiments, due to the low density of cells used in these assays.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the effect of the antibiotic on the OM of living bacteria37,38, we tracked the effects of the antibiotics in real time: PmB exposure of exponential-phase E. coli resulted in rapid and profound changes to the cell surface, with the appearance of numerous protrusions, regardless of the presence of glucose (Fig. 1b). By contrast, stationary-phase E. coli only showed PmB-induced OM changes in the presence of glucose (Fig. 1b), correlating with the effects on bacterial viability (Fig. 1a,b). Scanning electron microscopy replicated the AFM observations, confirming these distinct, glucose-dependent phenotypes of stationary-phase cells exposed to PmB, while the antibiotic caused surface protrusions in exponential-phase E. coli regardless of the presence of glucose (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Next, using the small hydrophobic dye NPN (N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine)39, we showed that the binding of PmB to its lipid A target was unaffected by glucose or growth phase (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1a). This finding was supported by mass spectrometry27, which ruled out the presence of lipid A modifications in stationary-phase cells that might reduce PmB binding but intriguingly did show a large reduction in LPS abundance in cells exposed to PmB in MM + G (Extended Data Fig. 3). We further investigated changes to OM integrity by measuring the leakage of heterologously expressed mCherry (28 kDa) from the periplasm40. In the presence of PmB and glucose, stationary-phase E. coli showed a significant increase of mCherry in the supernatant, compared with cells not exposed to the antibiotic from 90 min onwards. This suggests that minor OM permeabilization/disruption occurs rapidly, as measured by NPN, but that major disruption to the OM—as measured by mCherry release—occurs much more slowly, possibly via lysis (Fig. 1d).

Finally, we used SYTOX green nucleic acid stain, to assess permeability of both the OM and IM during PmB exposure. As expected from the viability data (Fig. 1a), stationary-phase E. coli showed significantly increased permeability in the presence of glucose, after a lag of 15 min (Fig. 1e); permeability also occurred in the absence of glucose, but at significantly lower levels than for cells exposed to the antibiotic in the presence of glucose (Fig. 1e). Again, consistent with the viability data (Fig. 1a), PmB-induced IM permeability was unaffected by glucose in exponential-phase E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Taken together, these data show that PmB binds to E. coli regardless of metabolic state, leading to minor OM disruption sufficient to allow NPN ingress, but that bactericidal activity, OM protrusions and release of periplasmic protein require metabolic activity. It is worth noting that stationary-phase viability and OM/IM permeation were similarly dependent on glucose across a diverse panel of laboratory and clinical isolates, indicative of a broadly conserved phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 4).

High-resolution AFM imaging of the OM of stationary-phase E. coli showed a similar abundance and organization of OM protein networks as previously reported37,38 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 5; note porous appearance of the OM in phase images). The porin networks were initially unaffected by PmB, but over time, the appearance of the PmB-exposed OM was dominated by protrusions at a scale >10 nm (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). On these living E. coli cells, we did not observe any PmB-induced LPS rearrangement into hexagonal lattices, such as previously reported based on AFM on solid-supported, collapsed OM vesicles22,23,24.

Unless stated otherwise, experiments were replicated in n = 3 independent assays. Error bars show the standard deviation of the mean. Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way ANOVA; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; NS, not significant.

Further examination of PmB-induced OM changes revealed that LPS was released from cells exposed to PmB in the presence of glucose but not in the absence of the antibiotic or glucose (Fig. 2b). Analysis of bacterial cells found a corresponding loss of LPS from E. coli exposed to PmB in the presence but not absence of glucose (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2), which was maximal by 15 min and fully consistent with the mass spectrometry results reported above (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 6a). This coincided with the appearance of surface protrusions, which subsequently increased in abundance, up to IM permeabilization as measured by SYTOX (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, LPS loss at 15 min was not due to cell lysis as, in contrast to LPS, there were no differences in levels of the cytoplasmic protein GroEL or OM porin OmpF across our experimental conditions (Fig. 2c).

Combined, these data revealed that PmB at least initially leaves the OM protein networks intact but causes substantial and rapid LPS loss in the presence of glucose. PmB-induced LPS loss also occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and with exponential-phase E. coli in Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB), indicative of a conserved process (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 4).

The observed dependence on metabolic activity for PmB lethality suggests an energy-dependent bacterial response to PmB challenge. As PmB-triggered LPS release required metabolic activity, we hypothesized that LPS synthesis and/or transport to the OM contributed to bacterial killing.

To establish energy dependence, we sought to distinguish between carbon- and energy-related effects. Using equimolar concentrations of various carbon sources in MM, we measured stationary-phase E. coli survival under PmB challenge and, in parallel experiments without PmB, bacterial ATP production and overall LPS abundance (Fig. 3a). In these experiments, bacterial PmB susceptibility correlated with ATP production and with the amount of LPS associated with cells in the absence of PmB (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7). In the presence of PmB, the amount of LPS dropped to lower levels in the presence of carbon sources that yielded higher ATP production (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7), confirming the importance of energy for PmB-induced LPS loss and bacterial killing.

Error bars show the standard deviation of the mean. Statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way (h) or by two-way repeated measures ANOVA between the PmB-treated and PmB + antibiotic-treated groups (c–f) or between wild type with PmB and imp4213 with PmB (g). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; NS, not significant.

Source data

To establish a link between LPS production and PmB-induced LPS loss and killing, we performed PmB killing assays in the presence of various inhibitors41. Inhibition of UDP-3-O-acyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC), the rate-limiting step of lipid A synthesis, reduced the rate and degree of PmB-mediated killing of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa, whereas the protein synthesis inhibitor tetracycline had no effect (Fig. 3c–e and Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). There was also a slower progression of PmB-triggered surface protrusions in the presence of CHIR-090 (an LpxC inhibitor) relative to PmB alone (Extended Data Fig. 8d). We also found that an inhibitor of the LPS transporter MsbA (multicopy suppressor of the HtrB temperature-sensitive phenotype) reduced killing by PmB and slowed protrusion appearance, while a strain with reduced LPS transport protein D (LptD) function was also killed more slowly than the wild type (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 8e). For all inhibitors, PmB binding to the OM was not affected, as determined via NPN uptake, whereas reduction of LPS synthesis and transport significantly reduced PmB-induced IM permeation as measured by SYTOX ingress into the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).

Further evidence for the importance of LPS transport came from experiments with novobiocin, which promotes LPS trafficking from the IM to the OM42 and was found to promote PmB-mediated LPS loss (Extended Data Fig. 9). This finding also provides a molecular explanation for the potentiating effect of novobiocin on polymyxin susceptibility42,43.

Combined, these experiments revealed that the magnitude of PmB-mediated LPS loss correlated with metabolic activity, which in turn correlated with bacterial killing. The role of metabolic activity in LPS loss was due, at least in part, to a requirement for LPS synthesis and transport.

To differentiate between PmB action on the OM and on the IM, we examined whether PmB could kill metabolically active cells by LPS loss alone, without the need for permeabilization of the IM. For this purpose, we first exposed E. coli to PmB for 15 min in MM + G, long enough for LPS loss to reach its maximum but before IM disruption occurred and before colony-forming unit (c.f.u.) counts started to decrease relative to the inoculum (Fig. 1a,e and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). We then washed the bacteria to remove unbound antibiotic, which also removed released LPS, followed by incubation in MM ± PmB and ±glucose. In the absence of PmB, bacteria survived at the same level over 2 h in the presence or absence of glucose (Fig. 4a). By contrast, bacteria that were re-exposed to PmB were efficiently killed, regardless of the presence of glucose (Fig. 4a). Therefore, PmB-mediated LPS loss alone is not sufficient to kill bacteria. Moreover, the requirement for metabolic activity for PmB-mediated killing appeared to only apply to LPS loss from the OM and is not required for subsequent IM disruption and killing.

a, Survival (c.f.u.) of stationary-phase E. coli first pre-treated with 4 µg ml−1 PmB in MM + G for 15 min before washing to remove unbound antibiotic, and next (from t = 0) exposed to 4 µg ml−1 PmB, or not, in MM ± glucose. b, LPS levels of untreated E. coli or bacteria exposed to 4 µg ml−1 PmB, 4 µg ml−1 PmBN or 10 mM EDTA for 15 min in MM + G.

To further test the impact of LPS loss on bacterial killing, we exposed stationary-phase E. coli to the nonlethal PmB nonapeptide (PmBN)18, which also caused significant LPS loss within 15 min in the presence of glucose, and to EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid), which caused LPS loss both in presence and absence of glucose (Fig. 4b,c). At the doses tested, neither EDTA nor PmBN had any effect on bacterial viability and did not trigger membrane protrusions (Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that polymyxin-triggered LPS release, while not bactericidal on its own, facilitates antibiotic entry into the periplasm, enabling PmB to access and permeate the IM and thereby kill the cell. To test this, we exposed stationary-phase E. coli to PmB, PmBN or EDTA for 15 min in MM + G to trigger LPS loss, as above, before removing these OM-disrupting agents (and released LPS) by washing, and finally measured bacterial survival in the presence of freshly added PmB. Each of the three pre-treatments enabled killing by PmB at concentrations below those required to kill untreated control cells, indicating that LPS loss sensitizes bacteria to PmB-mediated killing (Fig. 4d).

It is worth noting that we saw a greater level of bacterial killing for experiments where bacteria were pretreated with a membrane-disrupting agent before washing and subsequent exposure to PmB (for example, Fig. 4a,d), compared with experiments without a pre-treatment step (for example, Fig. 3c,d,f). A possible explanation for this difference is that released LPS sequesters PmB, reducing its activity44. As this is washed away in the pre-treatment experiments, it cannot reduce the activity of the subsequent PmB dose. Furthermore, once the OM is compromised by the membrane-disrupting pre-treatment, subsequent PmB treatment can efficiently access the IM. Combined, this explains the higher levels of bacterial killing in the pre-treatment experiments relative to other assays.

To demonstrate that PmB-triggered LPS loss causes the OM to become permeable to molecules of the size of PmB, we showed periplasmic ingress of a bodipy-conjugated analogue of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (Mw = 1723.35 g mol−1 versus 1301.56 g mol−1 for PmB) (Fig. 4e)45. However, minor permeabilization of the OM, as occurs with PmB in the absence of glucose, did not permit entry of vancomycin into the periplasm (Fig. 4e).

As EDTA caused LPS loss from stationary-phase E. coli in the absence of glucose (Fig. 4c), we hypothesized that EDTA would enable PmB to access the IM and thereby kill E. coli in the absence of energy. First, in MM + G, there was a significant loss of viability of E. coli exposed to PmB alone and to PmB combined with EDTA, but not EDTA alone (Fig. 4f). However, levels of bacterial viability were the same for cells exposed to PmB alone and PmB–EDTA, indicating this combination was not synergistic at the concentrations used (Fig. 4f). We then repeated this experiment in MM without glucose. In keeping with our earlier findings, metabolically inactive cells were not killed by PmB alone (Fig. 4g). However, there was a significant loss of viability of metabolically inactive cells exposed to PmB and EDTA together (Fig. 4). In addition, analysis of EDTA/PmB co-treatment of metabolically inactive cells by AFM revealed a roughening of the bacterial surface, with numerous protrusions that resembled the effects observed of PmB alone in the presence of glucose (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 8).

Together, these experiments show that metabolic activity is required for PmB lethality because it supports LPS release, which provides the antibiotic with access to the IM, the disruption of which leads to bacterial killing. However, if LPS loss occurs via a PmB-independent mechanism, such as EDTA, then there is no need for metabolic activity, showing that IM disruption occurs via an energy-independent process.

Mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, which encode phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferases, are globally disseminated in the Enterobacterales46,47,48. MCR-1, which is the most common variant, selectively modifies the 4′ phosphate of lipid A targeted by PmB, reducing susceptibility to polymyxin antibiotics47. Previous work showed that MCR-1 protected the IM of both whole cells and spheroplasts from colistin28,39. However, previous studies have shown that polymyxin antibiotics can disrupt the OM of polymyxin-resistant E. coli as evidenced by ingress of NPN or hydrophobic antibiotics such as rifampicin14,28,39. As such, the impact of MCR-1 on OM integrity during PmB exposure is unclear. Based on the work above, we hypothesized that pEtN modification would contribute to polymyxin resistance by inhibiting PmB-triggered LPS release, which would block access of the antibiotic to the IM.

To test this, we used E. coli transformed with an inducible mcr-1 construct but allowed expression to occur at basal levels (that is, no inducer) so that we had minimal production of MCR-1 and thus only a 4-fold increase in PmB minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) above the wild-type strain (Supplementary Table 1). Despite this modest change in susceptibility, MCR-1 fully protected E. coli from PmB at 4 µg ml−1 in MM + G, whereas there was a >4-log10 reduction in c.f.u. counts of the wild type (Fig. 5a). There was also a substantial reduction in the viability of E. coli that produced a catalytically inactive version of MCR-1 (MCR-1*) (Fig. 5a)49. As expected, MCR-1 reduced but did not prevent OM disruption as indicated by NPN uptake relative to the wild-type strain, whereas the IM was fully protected from PmB (Fig. 5b,c)27,28,39,49.

In support of our hypothesis, we next showed that MCR-1 prevented PmB-triggered LPS loss, as well as surface protrusions, both of which occurred in the wild type and the strain expressing the catalytically inactive MCR-1 variant (Fig. 5d–f).

Therefore, MCR-1 mediated pEtN modification of lipid A prevents LPS loss from E. coli exposed to PmB, which contributes to resistance by blocking access of the antibiotic to the IM. However, it is not clear whether the lack of LPS release is due to reduced PmB binding or greater membrane integrity due to the pEtN modification or a combination of both factors.

The mechanism(s) by which polymyxin antibiotics kill bacteria has been the focus of multiple studies, with various conclusions reached and models proposed14,15,18,21,22,50. In this work, we established that metabolic activity is required for bactericidal activity of a clinically relevant concentration of PmB and used this as a starting point to build a refined model for the mechanism by which polymyxin antibiotics kill bacteria (Fig. 6). We found that the initial interaction of PmB with the OM was unaffected by the metabolic state of the bacteria, explaining how polymyxins can sensitize metabolically dormant persister bacteria to antibiotics32,51,52 (Fig. 6a). In metabolically inactive bacteria, there is no further disruption to the bacterial surface and no loss of viability. However, in metabolically active E. coli, PmB causes rapid, large-scale LPS loss, which required ATP-dependent LPS synthesis and transport (Fig. 6b). With the loss of OM integrity, PmB gains access to LPS in the IM, and surface protrusions appear, although it is not yet clear whether these processes are directly linked (Fig. 6c). Finally, the interaction of PmB with LPS in the IM results in IM disruption and bacterial killing via an energy-independent process, and OM disruption increases, sufficient to allow the egress of proteins from the periplasm (Fig. 6d).

a, PmB binds to the OM, causing minor permeabilization, regardless of bacterial metabolic activity (insufficient damage to provide PmB with access to the periplasm). b, In metabolically active bacteria, PmB triggers LPS release via a process that requires ATP-dependent synthesis (Raetz pathway) and transport of LPS (further boosted by novobiocin (Nov)). c, The shedding of LPS compromises the integrity of the OM, resulting in surface protrusions, and enables ingress of the antibiotic into the periplasm where it targets LPS in the IM, leading to permeabilization. d, The loss of integrity of both the OM and IM results in bacterial killing.

The full mechanism of PmB-triggered LPS loss remains to be elucidated. While EDTA and PmB both disrupt the cation bridges that stabilize LPS molecules in the OM, only EDTA causes LPS release in the absence of metabolic activity. This likely reflects the fact that EDTA chelates cations, whereas PmB displaces cations from LPS by binding lipid A phosphates. While cation displacement by PmB weakens inter-LPS interactions, it appears that this is only sufficient to cause minor permeabilization. We speculate that the insertion of PmB into the LPS monolayer causes slipping between molecules, and as more LPS is transported into the OM, this leads to loss of PmB-bound LPS from the OM. Such slipping could be consistent with the complex interplay between PmB and OM fluidity53,54.

Several antibiotic classes require bacterial metabolic activity for lethality2,3,4,5. However, our finding that this requirement also applies to PmB goes against the common assumption that the efficacy of membrane-targeting antibacterials is independent of metabolic activity. It also provides an explanation for polymyxin tolerance observed in stationary-phase cells and persisters4,5,9,10,31,32,55,56. An important distinction, though, is that while many bactericidal antibiotics kill via metabolism-dependent production of reactive metabolites5,8,57, the key energy-dependent step required for polymyxin activity is disruption of the OM, which enables the antibiotic to permeabilize the IM and kill the bacterium.

We have previously shown that sub-inhibitory concentrations of the LptD inhibitor murepavadin promoted polymyxin susceptibility of P. aeruginosa, via LPS accumulation in the IM, without reducing LPS transport to the OM27. Based on the work presented here, we would predict that growth inhibitory concentrations of inhibitors of the Lpt system would reduce killing by polymyxins. However, we could not test this because the available inhibitors (murepavadin and thanatin) are cationic peptides that cause OM disruption, including membrane blebbing, which would compromise the findings58,59,60. Instead, we capitalized on the observation that novobiocin promoted LPS transport by enhancing ATPase activity, which in turn increased bacterial susceptibility to polymyxin antibiotics, although it was not known why at the time42,43.

Although our conclusions agree with some previous reports, they may appear inconsistent with others. For example, there is evidence that PmB is active against metabolically inactive bacteria. However, those studies used either exponential-phase cells that may retain a degree of metabolic activity or used assay conditions with low concentrations of nutrients or supra-physiological concentrations of polymyxins where specificity for LPS is lost due to the amphipathic nature of these antibiotics13,15,32,33,34,35,61. There have also been conflicting studies on the contribution of reactive oxygen species to bactericidal activity of PmB62,63,64,65. Our finding that energy is required for severe OM disruption does not rule out a role for reactive oxygen species, which could arise via LPS synthesis, for example. Finally, while we show surface protrusions, it is unclear whether these are released as vesicles, which has been reported to occur at sub-inhibitory PmB concentrations20,66,67,68,69,70,71. More work is also needed to determine whether PmB-induced vesicles are driven exclusively by antibiotic action on the membrane or part of bacterial stress response. For example, previous work indicated that a trigger of the Sigma E (RpoE) membrane stress response system resulted in increased vesicle production72, and there is evidence that the conjugative plasmid expression (Cpx) and reactive chlorine species (Rcs) systems, which respond to IM and OM stress, respectively, are activated by polymyxin exposure and contribute to bacterial survival73,74,75,76,77. As such, there remains much to understand about how bacteria respond to polymyxin antibiotics and how this influences survival.

Despite the loss of LPS that occurred during PmB exposure, cells remained viable until IM disruption occurred, in agreement with our and others' previous work showing that IM damage is required for lethality25,27,52. Although the OM is an important load-bearing structure, much of the mechanical strength is provided by the porin network, which forms tight associations with LPS78,79,80,81 and which remained largely intact during PmB exposure (Fig. 3a). The mechanical integrity of the porin network may therefore explain how E. coli can tolerate major LPS loss without a reduction in viability38,78.

Intrinsic and some acquired polymyxin resistance is associated with very high levels of lipid A modification with cationic pEtN and/or 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (L-ara4N) moieties, which prevents PmB binding to the OM14,18,20,48. However, MCR-mediated resistance often involves modification of only some of the lipid A in the OM, which likely explains how PmB can bind and sufficiently permeabilize the OM for the ingress of hydrophobic antibiotics such as rifampicin28,39. We found that some OM permeabilization occurred for E. coli mcr-1 but also showed that the MCR-1-mediated lipid A modification prevented PmB-triggered LPS release, which in turn prevented access of the antibiotic to the IM. This, coupled with the protection of the IM via LPS modification27,28, provides distinct layers of protection against PmB.

Minimal media, including M9 used in these studies, have been found to better predict antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria at infection sites than rich laboratory media, which likely reflects the reduced metabolic activity of organisms in vivo1,2,82,83. That said, as M9 does not fully replicate the host environment, further work will be needed to comprehensively understand the relationship between host environment, bacterial metabolism and polymyxin treatment outcomes. For example, one aspect of infection absent in these studies is host immunity. Previous work has shown that polymyxins synergize with complement and the antibacterial histone H2A84,85. PmB has been shown to reduce the pro-inflammatory activity of LPS, which likely modulates the host immune response86.

In summary, this work advances our understanding of the mechanism of action of polymyxin antibiotics by showing that the nature and magnitude of PmB-mediated OM damage is dependent upon the metabolic activity of the cell, which in turns modulates access of the antibiotic to the IM, disruption of which is required for lethality but is not energy dependent (Fig. 6). This work also provides an explanation for how polymyxin tolerance occurs in persister and stationary-phase cells, despite the membrane-disrupting activity of these antibiotics (Fig. 6).

The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (refs. 87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94). E. coli strains expressing mcr-1 or mcr-1* under the control of the arabinose-inducible araBAD (pBAD) promoter were based on those described previously and were transformed with plasmids synthesized by Thermo Fisher48. Unless stated otherwise, all strains were grown in MHB (Millipore) for 18 h at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.) to stationary phase. Where indicated, exponential-phase bacteria were generated by inoculating fresh MHB with 1:1,000 dilution of stationary-phase cells followed by a second growth period of 3 h at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.) For all experimentation, bacteria were washed three times with 1× M9 minimal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4 and 0.1 mM CaCl237 (referred to here as minimal medium, MM). Washed cells were then resuspended in MM ± 0.36% glucose (MM + G) to 108 c.f.u. ml−1. To enumerate bacterial c.f.u., 10-fold serial dilutions were made in PBS and plated onto Mueller–Hinton agar (MHB supplemented with 1.5% bacteriological agar). Inoculated agar plates were incubated statically for 18 h in air at 37 °C.

The MIC of PmB, the LpxC inhibitors CHIR-090 and ACHN-975, tetracycline, the MsbA inhibitor G907, novobiocin and murepavadin against indicated bacterial strains was determined according to the well-established broth microdilution method95. In brief, a 96-well microtitre plate was used to prepare a range of antibiotic concentrations in 100 µl of MM + G or cation-adjusted MHB via a series of 2-fold serial dilutions. For antibiotic synergy determination, checkerboard analyses were performed by preparing 2-fold serial dilutions of two antibiotics, with each one across a different axis, generating an 8 × 8 matrix to assess the MICs of each antibiotic when used in combination96. Stationary-phase bacteria were diluted to 1 × 106 c.f.u. ml−1 in MM + G or cation-adjusted MHB and 100 µl used to seed each well of the microtitre plate to give a final inoculation density of 5 × 105 c.f.u. ml−1. Plates were then incubated statically at 37 °C for 18 h in air, at which point the MIC was defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration at which there was no visible growth of bacteria. In some cases, the extent of bacterial growth after incubation was also determined by obtaining measurements of optical density at 595 nm (OD595nm) using a Bio-Rad iMark microplate absorbance reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Following three washes in MM, stationary-phase or exponential-phase bacteria were added at a final concentration of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 to 3 ml of MM, MM + G or MM without cations and supplemented with 10 mM EDTA, containing PmB (4 µg ml−1) when required. This assay was also repeated in the presence of PmB and 1× MIC of a range of different antibiotics (CHIR-090, ACHN-975, tetracycline, G907), as well as in MM supplemented with a selection of equimolar concentrations of either glucose, rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, acetate, succinate or glycerol. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.). At each time point (0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min), aliquots were taken, serially diluted 10-fold in PBS and plated to determine bacterial viability by determination of c.f.u. counts.

Bacterial imaging by AFM followed protocols described previously37,38. Briefly, for sample preparation, round glass coverslips of 13 mm diameter were used. They were washed by sonication in 1% w/v SDS for 10 min at 37 kHz and 100% power, then rinsed with MilliQ water and ethanol and dried with a nitrogen gun. Then they were plasma cleaned for 2 min at 70% power. These two procedures were repeated once more. Then coverslips were coated with Vectabond: they were placed in a beaker with a 1:50 ratio of Vectabond solution to acetone (40 ml of acetone and 800 µl Vectabond solution) for 5 min, then rinsed with MilliQ water and dried with a nitrogen gun97. The coverslips were glued to microscope slides with water-soluble glue purchased from Bruker (Reprorubber thin pour, Flexbar). Subsequently, E. coli was cultured to stationary phase (18 h) in MHB, then diluted 1:100 into fresh MHB and incubated to mid-exponential phase. Bacteria were then prepared by centrifuging 3 times at 17,000 × g for 90 s and resuspended in MM or MM + G at an OD600 of 0.5. (MM: 1× M9 salts (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2; MM + G: MM with 0.36% glucose). They were resuspended the fourth time in 100 µl 20 mM HEPES and incubated onto the Vectabond-coated glass coverslips for 5 min. They were then washed off with imaging media (MM or MM + G) to remove unadhered bacteria. SYTOX green nucleic acid stain (at a final concentration of 5 µM) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. We first imaged untreated bacteria in MM or MM + G, then with a pipette this was removed as much as possible and replaced with either PmB, EDTA, PmBN, CHIR-090 or combinations, added in the same way. Scans were subsequently taken after the introduction of the drug.

All experiments were performed in dynamic mode with a Nanowizard III AFM with UltraSpeed head (Bruker AXS), with an Andor Zyla 5.5 USB3 fluorescence camera on an Olympus IX 73 inverted optical microscope. FastScanD cantilevers were used, with a resonant frequency around 110 kHz and a spring constant of 0.25 N m−1. The drive frequency used ranged from 95 to 120 kHz, depending on the cantilever resonance measured by calibration. The setpoint was between 10 and 15 nm (approximately 50% to 70% relative to free amplitude). The whole-cell images were acquired at 2 to 2.5 Hz line frequencies, 2 × 2 µm2, and 512 × 512 or 512 × 256 pixels. Higher-magnification images were acquired over 500 × 500 nm2 and 512 × 512 pixels, recorded at 4 to 5 Hz line frequencies. Images in Fig. 2a were acquired over 200 × 200 nm2 and 512 × 512 pixels recorded at 8 to 10 Hz line frequency. To process the images obtained from AFM the software Gwyddion 2.65 was used (https://gwyddion.net/)98.

The following steps were taken to obtain a post-processed image: (1) level data by mean plane subtraction; (2) level by flattening base; (3) if there were strongly protruding features, apply a mask by selecting features above a 50% threshold, to prevent these from biasing the background correction and row alignment; (3) align rows by second polynomial line-by-line background subtraction (and exclude the masked region if applicable); (4) apply a 1–2 pixel Gaussian filter to the whole image to remove high-frequency noise (remove mask if applicable); and (5) define zero reference and adjust the colour scale to highlight key features.

The E. coli cells were cultured in MHB to stationary phase before bacteria were collected using centrifugation, and the cell pellet was washed three times with M9 medium without glucose. The cells were then diluted to 108 c.f.u. ml−1 in M9 ± glucose with 4 µg ml−1 PmB, and samples were collected at various time points through centrifugation for further analysis. The samples obtained were treated with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH = 7.3) and were allowed to fix overnight at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were suspended in the 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and subjected to dehydration using ethanol concentrations of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 80% and 100%, with a 10 min incubation at each step. The drying procedure was performed via critical point drying, and a platinum coating of 10 nm thickness was applied after the samples were completely dried. The prepared samples were examined under a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Crossbeam 550 FIB-SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV, and all images were analysed after conversion for differences in magnification. The ImageJ/Fiji software (version 1.53) was used in scanning electron microscope image processing and analysis.

To detect OM damage by PmB, the well-established NPN uptake assay was performed39. The fluorescent probe NPN (Acros Organics), at a final concentration of 10 μM, was added to 100 µl of 2 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 stationary-phase or exponential-phase bacteria in MM, MM + G or MM without cations and supplemented with 10 mM EDTA in a black microtitre plate with clear-bottomed wells (Greiner Bio-One). Relevant concentrations of PmB or PmB in combination with 1× MIC of various antibiotics were added to the wells of the microtitre plate to give a total volume of 200 µl. Fluorescence, at 37 °C with shaking, was measured immediately using a Tecan Infinite 200 pro plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm. Fluorescence measurements were obtained every min for 20 min, and the degree of OM permeabilization, referred to as the NPN uptake factor, was calculated using the following formula:

The resulting NPN uptake factor values were normalized according to OD600nm.

To further assess OM damage by PmB, PerimCherry E. coli was prepared by transforming the pPerimCh plasmid40 into E. coli MG1655. This plasmid encodes a constitutively expressed mCherry construct that accumulates in the periplasm. Stationary-phase bacteria (2 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1) were incubated with PmB in MM or MM + G. At each time point, 200 µl of the culture was centrifuged to separate bacteria and culture medium, and the supernatant was removed and placed in the wells of a black clear-bottomed 96-well plate (Greiner Bio). The fluorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength of 587 nm and an emission wavelength of 610 nm.

To measure IM permeabilization by PmB, the well-established SYTOX green assay was used99. Following washes in MM, stationary-phase bacteria at an inoculum density of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 was added to 3 ml of MM or MM + G containing the relevant antibiotics. The fluorescent probe SYTOX green (Invitrogen) was added to these cultures at a final concentration of 1 µM. Aliquots (200 μl) were transferred to a black microtitre plate with clear-bottomed wells (Greiner Bio-One). Fluorescence and OD600nm were measured in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (excitation at 535 nm, emission at 617 nm) every 15 min for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking. Raw fluorescence readings were normalized according to OD600nm.

Lipid A was prepared and analysed for modifications by mass spectroscopy as described previously27,28. Briefly, lipid A was detached from carbohydrates via mild acid hydrolysis (2% acetic acid, 100 °C 30 min), washed in H2O, loaded on the target and overlaid with 9H-Pyridol[3,4-B]indole (Norharmane, Sigma-Aldrich) used at 10 mg ml−1 in chloroform to methanol 9:1 and mixed before air drying and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis using a MALDI Biotyper Sirius system (Bruker Daltonics).

The experimental conditions for LPS quantification were the same as those used for the antibiotic time-kill assay. Briefly, 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 of stationary-phase bacteria was added to 3 ml cultures of MM or MM + G in the presence of either PmB, PmB with 1× MIC of various antibiotics, PmBN or EDTA. LPS quantification was also performed in the presence of PmB in MM supplemented with a selection of equimolar concentrations of either glucose, rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, acetate, succinate or glycerol. Following 15 min incubation at 37 °C with shaking (180 r.p.m.), samples were pelleted at 16,000 × g and washed twice with PBS. Pellets were incubated with 2% SDS and DNAse1 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of 1× sample buffer (4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris, 2% SDS at pH 6.8). The volume of sample buffer was adjusted according to the fold change in OD600nm compared to time point zero to give equal biomass between samples. Next, samples were incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. They were then checked to contain equal biomass by separation on a 12% Tris–glycine gel, followed by Coomassie staining. The samples were then incubated with 100 µg ml−1 proteinase K overnight at 55 °C to remove protein and again separated on a 12% Tris–glycine gel. The gel was fixed overnight in a solution of 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid. LPS was then quantified using the Pro-Q Emerald 300 Lipopolysaccharide Gel Stain Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Densitometric analysis was performed using Fiji ImageJ with the resulting values used to interpolate the standard curve performed in Supplementary Fig. 8c, to calculate relative LPS abundance. Undigested total protein samples served as loading controls.

GroEL and OmpF were detected by western blotting of total bacterial protein samples, obtained as described above for detection of LPS by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), using the following primary antibodies: Monoclonal anti-GroEL antibodies were obtained from Abcam (clone, EPR28718-8; catalogue number AB318970, lot number 1096886-3) and used at 1:2,000 dilution; polyclonal Anti-OmpF antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen (catalogue number PAS-121442, lot number 2K4557550) and used at 1:5,000 dilution. Bound primary antibodies were detected using polyclonal Goat Anti-Rabbit HRP conjugated (catalogue number AB6721, lot number GR342221), used at a 1:2,000 dilution, and ECL western blotting detection reagent (Amersham, RPN, 2106).

This protocol was provided by R. Hancock (https://cmdr.ubc.ca/bobh/method/kdo-assay/). Briefly, 50 µl of supernatant (generated from 15 min incubation of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 of stationary-phase bacteria in MM ± glucose, and ±4 µg ml−1) was boiled in 50 µl 0.5 N H2SO4 for 15 min, followed by the sequential addition of 200 µl arsenite reagent (0.3 µM NaAsO2 dissolved in 0.5 N HCl) and 800 µl 42 mM 2-thiobarbituric acid. The solution was boiled for a further 10 min before the addition of 1.5 ml butanol reagent (5.0 ml of concentrated HCl added to 95 ml n-butanol). The butanol layer was separated from the solution by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,500 × g. The Kdo (3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid) extinction coefficient (OD552nm − OD509nm) was calculated by measuring 200 µl for absorbance at OD552nm and OD509nm in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader. The difference in OD was used to interpolate a standard curve generated by performing Kdo analysis on a 1/10 serial dilution of 5 mg ml−1 of purified rough LPS (Supplementary Fig. 8a).

To quantify ATP levels of stationary-phase bacteria in different carbon sources conditions, an ATP standard curve was first generated using the BacTiter-Glo (Promega) kit. A 10-fold serial dilution series of ATP was performed in MM over a concentration range of 1,000 to 0.01 nM in a white microtitre plate (Greiner Bio-One). The BacTiter-Glo buffer was added to the substrate to make the BacTiter-Glo substrate. This substrate was combined with the dilution series, and luminescence was measured in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader using a 100 ms integration time. Following this, stationary-phase bacteria at an inoculum density of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 was added to MM or MM containing a range of equimolar concentrations of different carbon sources. At each time point (0, 15 and 30 min), 100 µl of the culture was combined with 100 µl of the substrate in a white microtitre plate, and luminescence was measured. ATP concentrations under these different conditions were interpolated from the standard curve.

Following three washes in MM, stationary-phase bacteria were added at a final concentration of 1 × 108 c.f.u. ml−1 to 3 ml of MM ± glucose and ±4 µg ml−1 PmB, in the presence of 10 µg ml−1 BODIPY FL Vancomycin (Invitrogen). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by three washes in PBS to remove unbound BODIPY FL Vancomycin. Cultures were resuspended in 3 ml PBS and 200 µl added to a black clear-bottomed 96-well plate (Greiner Bio). Fluorescence and OD600nm were measured in a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (excitation at 480 nm, emission at 520 nm). Raw fluorescence readings were normalized according to OD600nm.

Experiments were performed on at least three independent occasions, and the resulting data are presented as the arithmetic mean of these biological repeats unless stated otherwise. Error bars, where shown, represent the standard deviation of the mean unless otherwise stated. For single comparisons, a two-tailed Student's t-test was used to analyse the data. For multiple comparisons at a single time point or concentration, data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal–Wallis test. Where data were obtained at several different time points or concentrations, two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. Appropriate post hoc tests (Dunnett's, Tukey's, Sidak's, Dunn's) were carried out to correct for multiple comparisons, with details provided in the figure legends. Asterisks on graphs indicate significant differences between data. Precise P values for all comparisons are provided in the source data files. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software).

Where images are shown for example gels, blots or AFM, these are representative examples of at least three replicates, unless otherwise stated.

a, Visual representation of the set-up for all microbiological assays. E. coli MG1655 was grown in 3 ml of MHB for 16 h at 37oC 180 r.p.m. to stationary phase. The culture was washed three times in MM and resuspended at an inoculum density of 1×108 in 3 ml of MM or MM + G. To test exponential phase E. coli, the overnight culture was diluted 1/1000 in fresh MHB and grown for a further 3 h. b, Survival of stationary phase E. coli exposed to 4 µg ml−1 PmB from t = 0 in the presence of a 1/10 dilution series of 0.36% glucose. A 1/100 dilution of 0.36% glucose supported PmB killing, however, a 1/1000 dilution substantially reduced the rate and degree of PmB killing. c, Survival of stationary phase E. coli exposed to 4 µg ml−1 PmB from t = 0 in MM + G or MM with an equimolar concentration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, as determined by CFU counts. All experiments were replicated in n = 3 independent assays. Error bars show the standard deviation of the mean. Significant differences were determined by two-way repeated measures ANOVA. P= *<0.05, ***<0.001.

Source data

Exponential (Exp) or – (Stat) E. coli cells were exposed to PmB (4 µg ml−1) in MM ± glucose and samples taken at the indicated time points. In keeping with the data from AFM studies, stationary phase cells exposed to PmB in the presence of glucose began to show surface protrusions from ~30 min, which increased over time. Conversely, stationary phase cells exposed to the polymyxin without glucose showed minimal to no surface protrusions. PmB triggered surface protrusions in exponential phase cells whether glucose was present or not. Images for stationary phase cells at 120 min are shown again in an enlarged image to highlight differences in surface appearance. Scale bar represents 400 nm (N = 1).

a, From top to bottom, representative mass spectra showing unmodified lipid A from stationary phase E. coli at time 0 min in MM, stationary phase E. coli at time 15 min in MM, and stationary phase E. coli at time 15 min in MM + G, and stationary phase E. coli at time 15 min in MM + G exposed to 4 µg mL−1 PmB. The peak at ~1800 m/z corresponds to native hexa-acyl diphosphoryl lipid A containing four C14:0 3-OH, one C14:0 and one C12:0100. The peaks at ~1710 and ~1800 m/z correspond to the subtraction or addition of phosphate to the native form of lipid A. b, Overlaid mass spectra of stationary phase E. coli at time 15 min in MM + G (black) and stationary phase E. coli at time 15 min in MM + G exposed to 4 µg mL−1 PmB (red), indicating a substantial reduction in native lipid A.

For g, and h, the blank value refers to the relevant fluorophore in medium without bacteria. All experiments were replicated in n = 3 independent assays, error bars show the standard deviation of the mean. Significant differences were determined by two-way (a - h) repeated measures ANOVA.

Source data

a, Combined brightfield and fluorescence (SYTOX) images of the AFM scan region for the experiments in Fig. 1b with exponential (Exp) and stationary (Stat) phase E. coli at 90 min post PmB treatment (the circled cells are those chosen for the image sequences shown here and were all SYTOX-positive by 90 mins, except for stationary phase E. coli in MM). b, Higher-magnification AFM height and phase scans of stationary phase E. coli. The surface of untreated cells is covered in a network of pores, here best visible in the phase images. The resolution of pores (trimeric OMPs) is ultimately compromised by the progressive roughening of the OM after PmB is added in the presence of glucose (MM + G). In MM + G, PmB caused disruption to the OM in the form of protrusions. Without glucose the appearance of the OM at the nanoscale did not change.

Previous work has shown that the antibiotic novobiocin promotes the rate of LPS transport from IM to OM via an interaction with LptB41. In turn, this leads to increased susceptibility to polymyxin B, although the mechanism was not established42. Based on the findings described in this manuscript, we hypothesised that increased LPS transport to the OM would promote PmB-mediated LPS loss, which correlates with bacterial killing by the antibiotic. a, b, Checkerboard broth microdilution assay showing the synergistic growth-inhibitory interaction between novobiocin and PmB (a), or PmBN (b) against E. coli, as determined OD595nm after 18 hr incubation and in line with previous findings42. Note: PmBN is an inactive polymyxin analogue that served as a useful control for increased entry of novobiocin caused by OM disruption. (c, d) Survival of E. coli exposed, or not, to 1 µg ml−1 PmB (c) or 1 µg ml−1 PmBN (d) with or without 32 µg ml−1 novobiocin. These concentrations were chosen because they showed maximal synergy in the PmBN checkerboard assay. For (c), there was no killing of E. coli by the polymyxin or novobiocin alone, but a significant reduction in the viability of E. coli in the presence of both antibiotics. By contrast, there was no reduction in bacterial viability in the presence of PmBN with novobiocin. Therefore, bacterial killing in these assays appears to be PmB-mediated, rather than increased ingress of novobiocin into cells caused by OM disruption. e, f, Combined OM and IM disruption of stationary phase E. coli exposed to 1 µg ml−1 PmB (e) or 1 µg ml−1 PmBN (f) in MHB with and without 32 µg ml−1 novobiocin, as determined by uptake of the fluorescent dye SYTOX green. Crucially, in the presence of PmBN, novobiocin did not cause membrane disruption, even at concentrations well above those required to inhibit growth in the checkerboard assay. However, novobiocin promoted PmB-mediated membrane disruption in a dose-responsive manner, confirming that novobiocin promotes the activity of PmB by increasing IM disruption, which is the key step for lethality27,42. Next, we wanted to examine the impact of novobiocin on PmB-mediated LPS loss. (g) Representative SDS-PAGE image of LPS band intensity of stationary phase E. coli exposed, or not, to 1 µg ml−1 PmB with and without 32 µg/ml novobiocin for 15 min in MHB. (h) Densitometric analysis of the LPS gel in (g), showing that PmB or novobiocin exposure alone at 1 µg ml−1 or 32 µg ml−1 respectively, had minimal impact on LPS abundance after 15 mins incubation (N = 4). However, there was a significant drop in LPS levels when PmB and novobiocin were used in combination at these concentrations. Therefore, we concluded that novobiocin enhances PmB activity by promoting LPS loss, most likely via its reported effect on increasing LPS transport from the IM to OM41,42. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were replicated in n = 3 independent assays. Error bars show the standard deviation of the mean. Significant differences were determined by one- (h) or two-way repeated measures ANOVA (c, d, e, f). P= *<0.05, **<0.01, ***<0.001, ****<0.0001, ns=not significant.

Despite recent advancements demonstrating the potential of tumor-agnostic biomarkers to guide effective therapies, randomized evidence supporting the clinical superiority of precision oncology approaches compared to standard therapies remains limited. The ROME trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 2 study comparing tailored treatment (TT) to standard of care (SoC) in patients with advanced solid tumors progressing after one or two lines of therapy. Comprehensive genomic profiling on tissue and blood was performed to identify actionable alterations. Overall response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint, and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), time to next treatment (TTNT) and safety were the secondary endpoints. Between November 2020 and August 2023, 1,794 patients were screened, 897 were evaluated by the molecular tumor board (MTB) and 400 were randomized to TT or SoC. TT achieved a significantly higher ORR (17.5% versus 10%; P = 0.0294) and improved median PFS (3.5 months versus 2.8 months; hazard ratio = 0.66 (0.53–0.82), P = 0.0002). TT also showed superior 12-month PFS rates (22.0% versus 8.3%). Median OS was similar, with a 52% crossover rate. Grade 3/4 adverse events were also similar (40% TT versus 52% SoC). These results highlight the potential of TT to improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations. These results also provide relevant evidence supporting a tumor-agnostic precision oncology strategy and highlight the potential of TTs, guided by genomic profiling and MTB recommendations, to significantly improve outcomes for patients with diverse actionable genomic alterations. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04591431.

Precision oncology aims to enhance clinical outcomes by tailoring cancer treatments to individual patients, focusing on specific vulnerabilities identified through the analysis of cancer characteristics and the patient's clinical history1. However, implementing these strategies presents major challenges, such as detecting actionable biomarkers, interpreting their clinical significance within the context of an individual patient's history and systematically utilizing available tailored treatments (TTs). This complexity is further compounded by the variability in the frequency of actionable molecular alterations across different tumor types, making histology a less reliable factor for determining treatment options2. Additionally, standard therapeutic options vary considerably across different tumor types. As a result, the clinical significance of an actionable genetic alteration can differ substantially across various cancer types3.

Among the different approaches for detailed molecular characterization of tumor samples, genomic tests are the most widely used in clinical trials to identify patients with actionable alterations.

Recent advancements have uncovered that treatments targeting some tumor-agnostic biomarkers induce considerable clinical benefits regardless of histology. Notable examples include pembrolizumab4 and dostarlimab5 for tumors exhibiting high microsatellite instability (MSI-H); pembrolizumab for high tumor mutational burden (hTMB)6; larotrectinib7, entrectinib8 and repotrectinib9 for tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions; dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors10; selpercatinib for RET fusions11; and trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-overexpressing (3+) solid tumors12.

However, definitive evidence demonstrating the superiority of these approaches over standard therapies is lacking, with inconsistent outcomes reported across randomized agnostic precision oncology clinical trials. For instance, although the SHIVA trial did not show progression-free survival (PFS) benefits for off-label TT compared to standard treatments13, the MOSCATO-01 trial achieved its endpoint, underscoring the value of broad genomic testing and targeted drug treatments14.

Large, prospective, non-randomized trials are being conducted to identify molecularly defined subpopulations of patients deriving benefit from TTs. The results of multiple cohorts of the Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) study were published15,16,17,18. Similarly, the MyPathway and the NCI-MATCH trials provided valuable insights into the actionability of molecular findings in multiple tumor types19,20,21.

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) sought to address these challenges by developing tools such as ETAC-S, which contains minimum requirements for identifying TTs with tumor-agnostic potential based on mechanistic evidence paired with prospective clinical insights22. Another widely implemented framework is the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT)23, which ranks genomic aberrations to guide therapeutic decisions. The SAFIR02-BREAST trial demonstrated the utility of ESCAT, indicating that only patients harboring genomic alterations ranked as tier I and tier II benefit from maintenance TT, whereas those harboring alterations with lower actionability levels do not24.

Moreover, molecular tumor boards (MTBs) provide essential multidisciplinary expertise for implementing precision medicine25. However, the impact of MTBs on patient outcomes requires further validation, as current evidence is limited and varies based on factors such as drug availability and tumor types treated26,27,28,29. Despite these advancements, important hurdles remain in effectively implementing precision oncology in Italy30. Although regulatory approvals for targeted therapies have increased recently, many MTB-recommended treatments continue to face narrow or delayed approvals, limiting patient access to TTs even when actionable alterations are detected. Consequently, referral to clinical trials often becomes a viable option for patients to access TTs. Challenges such as limited enrollment availability and strict inclusion criteria further hinder the efficiency of this approach. Therefore, collaborative policies are essential to overcome these issues and facilitate the implementation of precision oncology in clinical practice25.

The nationwide ROME trial was designed to provide comprehensive genomic profiling and TT for patients with solid tumors across multiple medical oncology units in Italy. This trial aims to evaluate the outcomes of a TT established after discussions in the MTB compared to the standard of care (SoC). Additionally, this approach seeks to generate high-quality data to identify potentially effective treatments that deserve further clinical validation in specific biomarker-defined subsets of patients.

From 13 October 2020 to 19 July 2023, 1,794 patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1 and metastatic solid tumors, who had received up to two lines of therapy, were accrued across 40 oncological centers in Italy. These patients were screened for genomic alteration on tissue and peripheral blood with FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx centralized next-generation sequencing (NGS). A total of 897 patients with potentially actionable molecular alterations were identified and discussed during 127 weekly MTB meetings. Patients with mutations deemed actionable by at least one of the drugs available in the trial were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to received TT versus SoC. In total, 497 patients were excluded from randomization based on MTB directives outlined in Methods.

Actionable genomic alterations and MTB-selected treatment options for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population are reported in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Following the MTB recommendations, 221 (55%) patients were referred to a targeted therapy, 153 (38%) to immunotherapy and 26 (7%) to a combination of both (Extended Data Fig. 2). Thus, 400 patients were ultimately randomized into the TT and SoC arms. Patients were allowed to crossover at the locally confirmed progression of the disease. The CONSORT diagram is presented in Fig. 1.

CONSORT diagram for the ROME trial.

Patient characteristics and lines of prior therapy are detailed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1, respectively. The median age, baseline ECOG PS and number of previous lines of treatment were similar between arms. The TT arm had a higher proportion of women. The primary tumor origins were well balanced, with only glioblastomas and biliary tract tumors showing a slight overrepresentation in the SoC and TT arms, respectively, with no statistical differences observed. The TT arm also had a higher percentage of patients who received prior targeted therapy or hormonal therapy or a combination of chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In contrast, the SoC arm had more patients with prior immunotherapy.

The overall response rate (ORR) in the ITT population of 400 patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the TT arm compared to the SoC arm. Among the 200 patients receiving TT, the ORR was 17.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.5–23.5), which included 3% (six patients) achieving a complete response and 14.5% (29 patients) achieving a partial response. In contrast, the SoC arm achieved an ORR of 10% (95% CI: 6.2–15.0), with no complete responses and a 10% partial response rate (20 patients). Stable disease was observed in 19.5% (39 patients) in the TT arm and in 17.5% (35 patients) in the SoC arm, and progressive disease was reported in 63.0% and 72.5% of patients in the TT and SoC arms, respectively. The primary endpoint analysis conducted using the stratified analysis by Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test demonstrated a significant difference in ORR between groups (P = 0.0285; Extended Data Table 1). ORR varied across prespecified strata: in the breast cancer subgroup (Stratum A), ORR was 20.0% for TT versus 35.0% for SoC; in the non-colorectal gastrointestinal cohort (Stratum B), rates were 14.8% versus 9.1%; in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Stratum C), 12.5% versus 6.7%; and in ‘Other malignancies' (Stratum D), 19.1% versus 6.4%. The unique discrepancy with general results was observed in the breast cancer subgroup, probably as a consequence of the small breast cancer cohort and its inherent heterogeneity. The P value from the chi-square test (P = 0.0294; Extended Data Table 2) is nearly identical to the stratified CMH result, supporting the robustness of the main conclusion of the study. Furthermore, the Breslow–Day test for homogeneity of odds ratios across strata was not significant (P = 0.1231), failing to provide evidence of heterogeneity in the treatment effect across cancer types. PFS was significantly improved in the TT arm (median 3.5 months, 95% CI: 3.0–4.8) compared to the SoC arm (2.8 months, 95% CI: 2.5–3.2), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53–0.82, P = 0.0002; Fig. 2a). This benefit extended to key timepoints, showing substantial higher 9-month and 12-month PFS rates in the TT arm: 27.8% (95% CI: 21.4–34.2) at 9 months and 22.0% (95% CI: 16.0–28.0) at 12 months compared to 13.4% (95% CI: 8.4–18.5) and 8.3% (95% CI: 4.2–12.5), respectively, in the SoC arm. No significant difference in median overall survival (mOS) was observed between the TT and SoC arms (mOS: 9.1 months (TT) and 7.9 months (SoC); HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.72–1.19, P = 0.5322; Fig. 2b). A high crossover rate (59%) from SoC to TT occurred after disease progression. Among non-crossover patients in the SoC arm (n = 74), key reasons included rapid clinical deterioration (n = 33) and death before crossover eligibility (n = 25). Full details are reported in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. Approximately half of the enrolled patients in both arms had already received two prior lines of systemic therapy, which may have influenced both treatment responsiveness and overall clinical outcome. Analyses of the key secondary endpoints—time to treatment failure (TTF) and time to next treatment (TTNT)—showed superior outcomes in the TT arm compared to the SoC arm. Median TTF was 3.5 months (95% CI: 3.1–4.9) in the TT arm versus 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.5–3.1) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51–0.79, P < 0.0001). At 12 months, TTF was 22.0% (95% CI: 16.0–28.0) in the TT arm and 8.6% (95% CI: 4.4–12.7) in the SoC arm (Fig. 2c). Patients receiving TT had a significantly longer TTNT than those in the SoC arm (median TTNT: 5.0 months (95% CI: 3.9–6.3) versus 3.5 months (95% CI: 3.0–3.8); HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47–0.75). The TT arm also demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of patients remaining on treatment at 12 months (24.6%, 95% CI: 18.1–31.1) than the SoC arm (8.7%, 95% CI: 4.4–13.0) (Fig. 2d).

The overall incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) was similar in the TT and SoC arms (40.0% (80/200) and 52.5% (105/200), respectively). However, the specific AEs differed between the arms. In the TT arm, diarrhea was the most common AE (11 patients, 5.5%), whereas neutropenia was the most common AE in the SoC arm (16 patients, 8.0%) (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Figure 3 presents a tornado plot illustrating these AEs, categorized by System Organ Class categories of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5. Extended data provide a comprehensive list of grade ≥3 AEs (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and all grade 5 AEs (Extended Data Fig. 3b).

This figure shows the system or organ grade ≥3 AEs that occurred during the study for patients receiving SoC or TT.

Further exploratory analyses in specific subgroups provided additional insights. To assess the efficacy of TT against SoC, we analyzed subgroups defined by clinically relevant molecular alterations: MSI-H, hTMB, BRAF mutations and ERBB2 (HER2) alterations (including amplifications and mutations). Within the ITT population, these alterations were detected with the following frequencies: hTMB/microsatellite stable (MSS) (≥10 mutations per megabase, 33.7%), MSI-H (4.5%), BRAF mutations (4.3%) and ERBB2 alterations (14.3%). Treatment allocation was as follows: patients with hTMB, irrespective of microsatellite status, in the TT arm received immunotherapy (ipilimumab plus nivolumab or nivolumab monotherapy); patients with BRAF mutations received vemurafenib plus cobimetinib; and patients with ERBB2 alterations received one of several anti-HER2 regimens (pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, TDM1, trastuzumab plus lapatinib, pertuzumab plus TDM1, TDM1 plus atezolizumab or trastuzumab plus everolimus). The results of these exploratory subgroup analyses of the ORR are presented in Extended Data Table 3; the swimmer plots for duration of response are reported in Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5; and PFS and OS are reported in Fig. 4.

Statistical test used to calculate P values: log-rank test. P values derived from exploratory analyses should be interpreted with caution, as these analyses are hypothesis generating rather than confirmatory. Due to the non-predefined nature of exploratory endpoints and the potential for an inflated α level, the statistical significance observed in these analyses serves primarily to generate hypotheses for future confirmatory studies rather than providing definitive evidence NE, not evaluable; NR, not reached.

Of the 135 patients with hTMB and MSS status (65 in the SoC arm and 70 in the TT arm), all patients in the TT arm received immunotherapy (ipilimumab plus nivolumab or, in a few cases, nivolumab monotherapy). The ORR was higher in the TT arm (25.7%, 95% CI: 16–37.6) than in the SoC arm (15.4%, 95% CI: 7.6–26.5) (Extended Data Table 3). PFS was significantly longer in the TT arm (3.2 months, 95% CI: 2.5–5.6) compared to the SoC arm (2.8 months, 95% CI: 2.2–4.0) (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43–0.94; Fig. 4a). At 12 months, the PFS rate was 32.6% (95% CI: 21.3–43.9) in the TT arm versus 8.1% (95% CI: 0.9–15.3) in the SoC arm, representing a 25% absolute improvement in patients alive and progression free at 1 year. OS was 10.6 months (95% CI: 4.2–16.8) in the TT arm and 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.9–14.1) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.62–1.49; Fig. 4b).

Among 18 patients with MSI-H, the ORR was 57.1% (95% CI: 18.4–90.1) in the TT arm and 0% in the SoC arm (Extended Data Table 3). PFS had not been reached in the TT arm at the time of analysis, whereas it was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.4–3.7) in the SoC arm. Furthermore, at 1 year, 57.1% (95% CI: 20.5–93.8) of patients in the TT arm remained on treatment compared to none in the SoC arm (HR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03–0.73; Fig. 4c). The mOS was not reached in the TT arm. However, at 12 months, the OS rate was 71.4% in the TT arm compared to 33.3% and an mOS of 3.7 months in the SoC arm (HR = 0.38; Fig. 4d).

Of the 14 randomized patients with BRAF alterations, five received SoC and nine received TT, consisting of a BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination. A notable difference in PFS was observed: PFS was not reached in the TT arm, whereas it was 2.0 months (95% CI: 1.6–not evaluable) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01–0.67; Fig. 4e). The ORR was 22.2% (95% CI: 2.8–60.0) in the TT arm compared to 0% in the SoC arm (Extended Data Table 3). Despite the small sample size, the 12-month PFS rate was substantially higher in the TT arm (64.8%, 95% CI: 32.4–97.2) compared to the SoC arm (0%). The TT arm also demonstrated superior OS compared to the SoC arm; mOS was not reached in the TT arm, whereas it was 8.1 months (95% CI: 1.9–not evaluable) in the SoC arm (HR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.04–1.57; Fig. 4f).

In the subgroup of 58 patients with HER2 alterations, various anti-HER2 agents were administered. One patient in this group had an ERBB3 mutation, was also HER2 positive and received an indication for anti-HER2 treatment. The ORR was 13.8% (95% CI: 3.9–31.7) in the TT arm versus 6.9% (95% CI: 0.9–22.8) in the SoC arm (Extended Data Table 3). PFS was significantly longer in the TT arm (4.6 months, 95% CI: 3.0–5.7) compared to the SoC arm (2.6 months, 95% CI: 1.7–3.0) (HR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.24–0.74; Fig. 4g). Furthermore, at 12 months, 14.4% (95% CI: 1.40–27.50) of patients in the TT arm remained progression free compared to no patients in the SoC arm. Patients with HER2-altered tumors receiving TT showed a trend toward higher OS compared to the SoC arm, with an mOS of 10.2 months (95% CI: 6.5–not evaluable) versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.8–13.7) (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.32–1.16; Fig. 4h).

The ROME trial provides evidence that TT, guided by comprehensive genomic profiling and expert MTB decision-making, significantly improves outcomes in pretreated patients with metastatic disease. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the ORR and prolonged PFS compared to SoC, underscoring the clinical value of molecularly driven precision oncology. The improvement in ORR, the primary endpoint of the study, observed in the TT arm compared to the SoC arm within the ITT population (17.5% versus 10%), is clinically relevant and methodologically robust, although modest in magnitude. Notably, the TT arm achieved complete responses in a patient population with advanced metastatic disease treated in later lines, whereas no complete responses were observed in the SoC arm, underlining the potential efficacy of TTs in achieving deeper and potentially more durable clinical responses. The improvement in ORR was consistent despite variations across predefined cancer type strata. Subgroup analyses revealed pronounced benefit in the ‘Other malignancies' stratum (19.1% versus 6.4%), positive trends in non-colorectal gastrointestinal (14.8% versus 9.1%) and NSCLC (12.5% versus 6.7%) subgroups and a lower ORR in the TT arm for breast cancer (20.0% versus 35.0%). However, the analyses of the differences in the odds ratios of response across subgroups have merely exploratory importance due to the limited size of most subgroups and, more importantly, because the primary aim of the trial was to assess the feasibility and potential global impact of a tailored therapeutic strategy based on comprehensive genomic profiling. The observed numerical imbalance across the four predefined cohorts resulted from a combination of protocol-driven and real-world factors. Although the initial design anticipated competitive enrollment with balanced strata, the trial's biomarker-driven framework inherently favored variability in recruitment. A key factor contributing to this disparity was the differential prevalence of actionable genomic alterations across tumor types. Stratum D, which included diverse malignancies, exhibited higher rates of potentially actionable targets compared to other strata. Molecular profiling success rates further influenced recruitment dynamics. Tumors with lower shed DNA or suboptimal sample quality, common in certain histologies, reduced liquid biopsy utility, whereas tissue availability varied by cancer type. Additionally, site-specific expertise and patient populations probably played an important role, with centers specializing in rare cancers contributing more to Stratum D, whereas those focused on common tumors faced stricter exclusion thresholds. Temporal factors, including profiling turnaround times and drug availability after protocol amendments, also contributed to uneven accrual. Despite these imbalances, the trial's statistical integrity remained robust, as previously discussed. The observed disparities reflect real-world heterogeneity in the distribution of actionable targets rather than methodological shortcomings. The ROME trial's agnostic design, prioritizing molecular over histologic stratification, inherently accommodates such variability, validating its approach in capturing the complexity of precision oncology (Fig. 5). The recruitment pattern underscores a critical challenge in biomarker-driven trials: molecular prevalence and clinical exclusion criteria inevitably influence enrollment dynamics. The trial's outcomes, however, demonstrate that robust statistical methods can mitigate imbalances, ensuring meaningful conclusions even in heterogeneous populations. These insights support the feasibility of tumor-agnostic frameworks while emphasizing the need for adaptive designs in future precision oncology studies. A major methodological departure from prior precision oncology trials is the timing of molecular profiling. In contrast to most studies that also use archival tissue samples from primary tumors, the ROME trial specifically employed metastatic tissue collected upon disease progression after the last therapy (with few exceptions; see supplementary materials). This strategy provided a more precise evaluation of the tumor's mutational landscape at study entry. The addition of liquid biopsy analysis, comprehensive MTB assessment and early randomization (within the first two lines of therapy) further enhanced the accuracy of TT recommendations while mitigating the confounding effects of clonal heterogeneity frequently observed in later-stage disease.

A key finding from this study is the significant long-term benefit of PFS associated with TT. At the 12-month mark, patients receiving TT demonstrated improved disease control, indicating that it can extend PFS beyond 1 year for certain patients. This benefit, observed even in pretreated metastatic cases, highlights the clinical importance of personalized treatment strategies based on individual molecular alterations.

The observed significant improvements in ORR and PFS within the TT arm were not accompanied by a similar improvement in OS. The substantial crossover rate (58.8%) from the SoC arm to the TT arm after disease progression, although ethically appropriate, likely contributed to this lack of OS benefit. The high rate of non-crossover (41.2%) underscores the challenges of implementing precision therapies in late-line settings, where declining performance status and emergent complications often preclude treatment changes. This reality suggests that TTs may require earlier deployment to maximize clinical impact. This highlights the need for future studies to incorporate stratified crossover analyses to better understand the long-term effects of TTs on survival outcomes.

Subgroup analyses focused on specific molecular alterations (hTMB, BRAF mutations and ERBB2 alterations) revealed considerable benefits. The hTMB subgroup demonstrated a particularly strong PFS benefit with immunotherapy (nivolumab with or without ipilimumab), showing efficacy across both MSI-H and MSS tumor types. This finding supports hTMB as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response, even within a biomarker-agnostic approach, particularly when using the TMB calculation algorithm employed by the Foundation One platform. Despite this promising conclusion, literature reports on TMB have been inconsistent, likely due to several factors. Key contributing elements include methodological variations, site-specific influences and a lack of standardization across the field. The complexity is further compounded by the use of different platforms and proprietary algorithms as well as variability in panel size, gene coverage, bioinformatics pipelines, sequencing depths and tumor purity. Additionally, cancer-type-specific variations play an important role in the assessment of TMB. Despite these challenges, the potential of hTMB as a predictive tool for immunotherapy response remains promising, highlighting the need for continued exploration and standardization efforts. Similarly, TTs showed efficacy against tumors harboring BRAF and HER2 alterations. Although the smaller sample sizes in some subgroups may have limited the statistical power of certain observations, the overall findings emphasize the potential of precision oncology.

The similar incidence of grade 3/4 AEs in the TT and SoC arms, albeit with different AE profiles (diarrhea and fatigue in TT versus neutropenia in SoC), underscores the importance of proactive, personalized management of toxicities to optimize the therapeutic benefit–risk ratio.

The pivotal role of the MTB in shaping clinical decision-making was evident throughout the trial. Composed of a multidisciplinary team of specialists, the MTB enabled a mutation-agnostic and tumor-agnostic approach, tailoring treatment plans based on comprehensive molecular profiles rather than histology alone, avoiding the passive acceptance of the mutation/drug axiom. This approach, combined with the clinical data provided by referring clinicians, facilitated a patient-specific therapeutic strategy. In scenarios where multiple targeted treatment options were available for a single molecular pathway (such as PI3K/AKT or ERBB2 alterations), the MTB prioritized agents based on each patient's unique molecular profile and clinical characteristics. Factors driving these decisions included the specific type of alteration (for example, ERBB2 mutation versus amplification), published evidence on drug efficacy in specific contexts, prior therapeutic exposures and drug safety profiles. Notably, several agents (alpelisib, tepotinib, talazoparib, selpercatinib and pralsetinib) were introduced via protocol amendment in 2024. These updates, documented in Extended Data Table 4, preserved trial integrity through predefined statistical analysis plan (SAP) stratification while enhancing real-world relevance.

The MTB's ability to address each patient's biological complexity and clinical heterogeneity optimized therapy selection, contributing substantially to the positive outcomes of this trial. In case of detection of multiple actionable alterations, the MTB evaluated the potential clinical benefit of each therapeutic option, considering evidence from published literature, drug mechanism of action, patient-specific clinical factors, prior therapeutic responses and toxicity risks. The presence of multiple actionable biomarkers considerably complicates therapeutic decision-making due to pathway interactions, conflicting clinical evidence and diverse drug toxicities. Managing this complexity often exceeds individual clinician capacity and simple biomarker–drug algorithms. In the era of precision oncology, the MTB model is proving essential for interpreting complex genomic data and guiding personalized treatment plans that extend beyond traditional histopathological and direct target–drug association models, as seen in the prescription of TTs based on demonstrated efficacy in controlled clinical studies. The ROME trial provides, to our knowledge, the strongest evidence supporting MTB implementation in clinical practice, thanks to its agnostic and randomized design. Previous evidence suggested a potential improvement in survival outcomes when MTBs were implemented, as published by Miller et al.31 in a prospective, non-randomized phase 2 study. MTB utility is also being assessed in other prospective clinical trials, such as the Danish phase 2, non-randomized ProTarget study, implementing a Drug Rediscovery Protocol (DRUP)-like design32. Another example is the TARGET study (NCT04723316), a large nationwide prospective trial based in the United Kingdom designed for this purpose, aiming to enroll 6,000 patients with advanced cancers33. Our findings underscore the critical need to further develop MTBs and implement advanced decision support tools to effectively integrate and interpret complex multiomic data, ultimately enhancing the precision of clinical recommendations. The management of dual biomarkers (that is, hTMB and HER2 alteration) posed unique challenges reflecting real-world precision oncology dilemmas, where pathway crosstalk (for example, MAPK activation dampening immunotherapy efficacy) and heterogeneous evidence bases complicate decisions. Our MTB addressed these scenarios by carefully evaluating multiple dimensions, including the biological relevance and actionability of each target (assessed using validated tools), variant allele frequency (VAF) of the detected alterations, quantitative thresholds for biomarkers such as TMB, strength of existing clinical evidence, potential interactions between targeted pathways, patient-specific clinical factors (including prior treatments, clinical status and comorbidities) and safety and toxicity profiles of candidate therapies, thus enabling structured and patient-centered decision-making. AI platforms can enhance MTB decisions in multitarget scenarios by structuring complex genomic/clinical data (for example, prioritizing therapies for HER2+/hTMB cases) and reducing cognitive overload through evidence-based recommendations. In Italy, the Alliance Against Cancer (ACC) consortium is advancing AI tools under initiatives such as CraNE/EUNetCCC to support MTBs in analyzing mutational profiles, aligning with European Union goals for precision oncology. These systems cross-reference real-world outcomes, biomarker–drug evidence and toxicity profiles, offering clinicians actionable hierarchies while maintaining human oversight. The work of the ACC exemplifies how AI augments, rather than replaces, expert deliberation, improving efficiency and consistency in biomarker-driven care.

The complexities of precision oncology necessitate adaptive platform trials to expedite patient access to effective TTs and keep pace with rapidly advancing genomic knowledge34,35. Platform trials, often referred to as multiarm, multistage studies, are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate multiple treatments within different arms of a single trial, all compared to a shared control arm. This design incorporates adaptive features, allowing for the removal of ineffective treatment arms and the inclusion of new arms tailored to specific drug–target interactions. Additionally, patients may be reassigned to different treatment arms based on their response to prior therapies or changes in biomarker profiles. By replacing the traditional sequential trial model, this approach accelerates the process of drug discovery and development36. Furthermore, it will be beneficial to complement RCTs with observational studies to assess the generalizability and real-world applicability of their results. Future precision oncology will strongly benefit from dynamic national and international clinical trial databases, comprehensively annotated with gene-specific and variant-specific targets, directly linked to advanced decision support platforms to facilitate patient stratification into molecularly driven trials. Although the ROME trial provides robust evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of molecularly guided therapies in a controlled environment, the complexities of real-world practice—including patient heterogeneity, varied access to genomic testing and differences in healthcare infrastructure—may influence the outcomes observed. Observational studies using robust real-world data sources, such as population-based cancer registries, electronic health records and multicenter collaborative networks, combined with advanced AI analysis, would be instrumental in addressing these aspects. Future research priorities include optimizing biomarker-driven patient selection and MTB processes, developing innovative trial designs, investigating specific strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms and exploring combination approaches with immunotherapy and other tailored agents to propel the field of precision oncology further and realize its potential.

The competent authority, Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA), authorized the trial on 8 July 2020 (AIFA/SC/P/76132). The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier NCT04591431 and in the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT) with number 2018-002190-21. The trial adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki regarding research involving human subjects. Forty-one centers received ethics approval and participated in the study enrollment. All patients signed the specifically conceived informed consent form (ICF).

This randomized, prospective, multicenter, proof-of-concept phase 2 clinical trial enrolled patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic solid tumors, regardless of histology. Eligible patients had failed at least one, but no more than two, prior lines of systemic therapy. An ECOG PS of 0 or 1 was required as well as being at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICF. All patients had to have measurable or evaluable disease defined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)37 or immune-related response criteria (irRC)38. If clinically indicated, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans could have been performed. PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST)39 were applied in cases where a baseline PET scan was available. Adequate renal, liver and bone marrow functions were required at baseline. Patients who were candidates for potentially curative surgery or other locoregional therapies were excluded. Those with well-established actionable molecular targets, not detected in previous molecular profiling, for which approved and marketed targeted therapies were available—such as EGFR mutations or ALK translocations in lung cancer, BRAF mutations in melanoma, KIT mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer or tumor-agnostic biomarker-driven treatments already available in clinical practice—were also excluded. Furthermore, patients with only bone and/or brain metastases, uncontrolled brain disease (untreated and/or symptomatic) or those whose brain metastases had not been monitored for over 2 months were excluded. Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions that could compromise their participation in the study (for example, uncontrolled diabetes, clinically relevant cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the last year, chronic liver or renal disease, active gastrointestinal ulceration or severely impaired lung function) were also excluded (see supplementary materials for all inclusion/exclusion criteria).

For genomic testing, a tissue sample obtained during the screening phase or within 6 months before enrollment was required. The biopsy should be performed during the screening period, after the completion of conventional therapy for recurrent/metastatic cancer. Samples collected within 3 months before the patient's ICF signature were acceptable, as were samples collected within 6 months, with prior acceptance by the MTB. Archived tissue samples were accepted for patients with glioblastomas and high-grade malignant gliomas. Patients with only one available biopsy, either liquid or solid, due to a failure of one method during the screening phase remained eligible for inclusion and discussion in the MTB. Conversely, if both tissue and liquid biopsy characterizations failed, patients were classified as screening failures.

Molecular profiling was performed using FoundationOne CDX and FoundationOne Liquid CDX tests on tissue and liquid biopsies. DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples was isolated using the DNA extraction method and analyzed with the FoundationOne CDx panel to assess alterations across 324 genes, including substitutions, insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations (CNAs) and gene rearrangements. Genomic signatures of MSI and TMB were also evaluated. For FoundationOne Liquid CDx, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from plasma collected from anticoagulated peripheral whole blood samples using FoundationOne Liquid CDx cfDNA blood collection tubes. The cfDNA was analyzed for substitutions, indels in 311 genes, rearrangements in four genes and CNAs in three genes. Additionally, the test evaluated tumor fraction and genomic signatures such as blood-based tumor mutational burden (bTMB) and MSI-H status.

Upon identification of actionable alterations in either tumor tissue or liquid biopsy, and after MTB discussion, selected patients were assigned to receive immunotherapy, targeted therapy or both based on MTB recommendations. A crossover between the two treatment arms was planned upon progressive disease. The study design is reported in Fig. 5.

An MTB convened weekly to review each eligible patient. The MTB consisted of medical oncologists, pathologists, geneticists, immunologists, bioinformaticians and other relevant specialists. Before the MTB discussion, the steering committee identified patients with potentially actionable genomic alterations. The MTB then reviewed each case, considering comprehensive molecular profiling data alongside the patient's clinical features, such as performance status, comorbidities and concurrent treatments. The treating clinician presented each case selected by the steering committee, highlighting potential actionable therapeutic targets.

Molecular alterations were evaluated using databases such as ClinVAR, OncoKB and COSMIC and the ESMO ESCAT scale. The board employed VAF thresholds of 1% for tissue biopsies and 2% for liquid biopsies. It systematically reviewed potential intrinsic resistance mechanisms, such as KRAS mutations in patients considered for PIK3CA or AKT inhibitors. For patients with multiple actionable alterations (for example, hTMB alongside HER2 amplification or BRAF mutation), the MTB prioritized therapies using a hierarchical framework prioritizing clinical urgency (for example, immunotherapy for MSI-H tumors regardless of co-alterations), followed by biomarker–drug evidence strength (for example, HER2-targeted agents over exploratory TMB-directed therapies when both were present) and, finally, considering toxicity overlap avoidance (for example, excluding PI3K inhibitors if preexisting hyperglycemia).

Patients discussed at the MTB who were not randomized were excluded for various reasons, including the absence of target alterations, the presence of resistance mutations, known negative studies related to a specific alteration, rare mutations without literature data, low VAF, unavailability of drugs for specific alterations, clinical considerations, high levels of uncertainty regarding potentially targetable alterations and the presence of established targetable alterations with available standard treatments. In cases suggesting a germline origin, germline testing was recommended.

MTB recommendations included randomizing patients to receive TT, referring them to a geneticist in the presence of somatic alterations with potential germline significance, modifying SoC only when necessary and suggesting enrollment in clinical trials or early drug access programs, when available in Italy. MTB activities are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 6.

Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and received a recommendation for a specific targeted agent or combination therapy from the MTB were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SoC or TT, according to their molecular profiles. In the SoC arm, patients were treated with standard chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy based on primary tumor histology according to national guidelines and at the investigators' discretion. The MTB also proposed possible modifications based on molecular profiling and expert opinion in the control group.

In the TT arm, patients received targeted therapy, immunotherapy or a combination that was selected according to their genomic profiles, as determined by the MTB. Combination therapies were proposed in cases where efficacy data for the combination were well established in different malignancies (for example, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab for HER2+ breast cancer and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib for BRAF-mutant melanoma) or when there was a biological rationale due to the presence of multiple actionable mutations. Such proposals were contingent upon the availability of published phase 1b/2 data supporting the combination in other tumor types. In cases involving immunotherapy, the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab was usually preferred unless a patient's clinical condition or comorbidities suggested otherwise. The decision was made collaboratively between the MTB and the patient's treating clinician.

Patients were allowed to crossover to the TT arm upon disease progression. A substantial amendment to the protocol was implemented in October 2022, introducing additional treatments to the existing options, including entrectinib, alpelisib, pralsetinib and selpercatinib. Investigational therapies included erlotinib, pertuzumab, vemurafenib, trastuzumab emtansine, alectinib, vismodegib, cobimetinib, atezolizumab, trastuzumab, ipatasertib, entrectinib, everolimus, palbociclib, lapatinib, ipilimumab, nivolumab, brigatinib, ponatinib, itacitinib, pemigatinib, alpelisib, tepotinib, pralsetinib, talazoparib and selpercatinib. In cases where hTMB coexisted with a targetable mutation, a combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy was generally preferred, provided that safety data were available. All treatments were administered according to the investigator's brochure or the relevant regulatory clinical protocol. Each targeted agent was associated with a specific pathway, signature or gene alteration (Extended Data Table 4).

The primary endpoint of the study was the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response or partial response, with respect to the total number of randomized patients. Secondary endpoints included PFS, defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurred first; TTF, defined as the time from randomization until patient withdrawal for any reason, including disease progression or death; TTNT, defined as the time from randomization to the start of the next line of therapy; and OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Additional planned secondary endpoints not reported in this paper include concordance between molecular profile on tumor tissue and ctDNA, quality of life measurements, immune fitness in the two treatment arms and the association between the molecular evaluation and gene expression profiling.

Tumor response was locally assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 and irRC. In patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or consent withdrawal, tumor assessments continued until documented progression. Survival was monitored until death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal or study termination. AEs were graded using CTCAE version 5.0, with the frequency and severity of AEs documented for each patient.

Data were collected at the clinical sites and inserted into a web-based electronic case report form (eCRF) by investigators or designated personnel. The trial was overseen by an independent external data monitoring committee, which conducted periodic safety evaluations and reviewed efficacy during prespecified interim analyses. Per the study protocol, the data monitoring committee (DMC) conducted a prespecified interim analysis after 20% of the randomized patients (n = 76) had reached the final efficacy evaluation (day 308 or early termination), irrespective of treatment group assignment. The DMC reviewed these data and recommended proceeding with patient accrual as planned. As predefined, the stopping threshold for conditional power (CPt) was set at 5%. Comparisons were made between the observed TT group response rate at interim analysis and the projected end-of-study SoC group response rate (5%). At interim analysis, the TT group exhibited a 7.1% response rate. The calculated CPt for the projected SoC outcome, derived from the sample size assumptions, was 88.7%, demonstrating strong evidence to continue the trial and prompting a unanimous DMC recommendation to proceed. The authors confirm that the trial was conducted in compliance with the protocol, its amendments and the principles of Good Clinical Practice.

We hypothesized that TT would yield higher ORR compared to SoC, specifically a 20% ORR for TT versus 5% for SoC. According to the site of primary tumor, four cohorts were defined as breast cancer (Stratum A), non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers (Stratum B), NSCLC (Stratum C) and ‘other malignancies' (Stratum D), with competitive enrollment across these strata. To detect a 15% difference between the two arms, assuming an α of 0.10 and a β of 0.20 (80% power) and employing a one-sided chi-square test, a total of 86 patients (43 in each arm of the four cohorts) were required. The four cohorts were evaluated as separate strata, resulting in a combined cohort size of 344 patients (86 patients per stratum). The overall ORR was assessed using a two-sided CMH test at a 5% significance level; an unstratified sensitivity analysis was also performed. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, 384 patients were required. Assuming actionable mutations in at least 30% of eligible patients, the planned screening sample size was 1,280. During the course of the study, the screening failure rate was higher than initially anticipated, leading to a total of 1,794 screened patients. Due to the extended screening periods required for genomic testing and the inherent unpredictability of patient eligibility based on mutational test results, 12 additional patients undergoing screening at the time the target of 384 randomized participants was reached were permitted by the steering committee to enroll, resulting in a final total of 400 patients.

All analyses were conducted using SAS software (v.9.4). The SAP, detailing the analyses to be executed, was finalized before database lock (SAP v.1.0). The randomization list was generated with a dedicated SAS program using the PROC PLAN procedure by an independent statistician. The randomization lists were incorporated into the eCRF system, which automatically managed the assignment of treatment arms. A soft lock of the database was performed on 31 July 2024. SAP v.2.0 was finalized on 30 January 2025, after the database freezing and data review meeting, and governs all analyses presented here. The full SAP is available upon reasonable request. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, with mean, s.d., quartiles for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical variables. Differences in clinical characteristics were evaluated with t-test, binomial test, chi-quadro and CMH. The Breslow–Day test was used to evaluate the homogeneity of odds ratios. Box plots and tornado plots assessed the overall incidence of grade 3/4 AEs. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, accompanied by the log-rank test, was employed to compare OS and PFS across arms and subgroups. To visualize clinical benefit duration (response and stable disease) across molecular subgroups—including high TMB and PI3K/AKT-altered and ERBB2-positive cohorts—swimmer plots were generated. HRs and 95% CIs were also calculated. Homogeneous subgroups of patients were evaluated in a prespecified exploratory analysis. Exploratory biomarker analyses, including assessments of hTMB (≥10 mutations per megabase), BRAF V600E mutations and HER2 amplifications, were predefined in the SAP to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity. These subgroups were selected based on emerging preclinical evidence during the trial's enrollment phase, with steering committee approval for post hoc stratification. All statistical analyses were conducted on the ITT population. R v.4.3.3 and RStudio were used to build toxicity and genomic alterations plots.

Ferroelectric topological textures have sparked intensive interest, due to their exciting applications in a new era of non-volatile and ultrahigh-density information storage. However, these textures remain largely dependent on the given heterostructures with engineered neighbouring layers to balance the competing energies. Here we report high-density polarization bubbles in van der Waals ferroelectric crystals CuInP2S6, without the need for a spatially confined heterostructure. From piezoresponse force microscopy, it is observed that the formation and distribution of bubble domains exist in the inherent coexistence of polar phases. Crucially, the phase ratio can be facilely tailored by external stimuli such as mechanical force, enabling the labyrinth domains to be manipulated into high-density isolated bubbles through a mechanism involving polar phase competition and flexoelectricity, as revealed through density functional theory and phase-field modelling. Our findings not only provide insights into the creation of topological structures in a controlled manner but also demonstrate potential memory applications based on bubble domains in van der Waals ferroelectrics.

There exists a polar phase with weak amplitude surrounding the polarization bubbles in the VPFM image.

a, The diagram of PFM scans across ferroelectric domain with Ising type wall and Néel type wall. b, The amplitude response for the typical case. A clear domain wall can be clearly visible in the amplitude image for Ising domain. The Néel-type bubble domain (region 2) typically exhibit weaker amplitude compared to the surrounding regions (region 1 and 3), making domain wall less visible in the amplitude image. c, The amplitude response for our case in the CuInP2S6 ferroelectrics. The Néel-type bubble domains are surrounded by weak-amplitude region. The comparable amplitude intensity between the bubble domain (region 2) and surrounding regions (regions 1 and 3) makes the domain walls more easily observable.

a, High-density elongated labyrinth domains. In some local region indicated by square boxes, the elongated labyrinth domains have evolved into isolated bubbles. b, High-density bubble domains. The elongated labyrinth domains are the precursor of bubbles as revealed by the weak phase signal (yellow) surrounding bubbles with labyrinth pattern. c, The zoomed-in image corresponding to the local area marked in panel a. d, The schematic evolution of elongated labyrinth domains disrupted into isolated bubbles.

The phase and amplitude images for vertical PFM (VPFM) and lateral PFM (LPFM) measured at four sample rotation angles of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90°. The LPFM results of the bubble domains clearly reveal tilted domain walls. For instance, the bubble marked by white circle exhibits an S-shaped form in its LPFM domain walls, as labeled by the white dashed circles. The scale bar is 200 nm.

a, The schematic of angle-resolved LPFM. The in-plane (IP) PFM was measured as a function of tip angle φ, with amplitude (A) and phase delay (θ) determined by fitting Acos(φ-θ-π/2). A and θ represent the polarization vector's length and angle relative to the defined direction, respectively. Numbers 1-4 denote sample rotation angles (0°, 30°, 60°, 90°). The piezoresponse vector field is constructed from IP components (Acosθ, Asinθ) as a function of position. b, Top view of reconstructed IP polarization field P, superimposed with color maps of IP piezoresponse vector map (θ). The distribution of polarization field demonstrates the center-divergence of IP polarization component. c, The trigonometric curve fittings for four representative points denoted as purple spots in panel b. d, The IP polarization field. e, Top view of 3D polarization field P, superimposed with color maps of the IP-phase (0°, 90° rotation) from the LPFM and out-of-plane (OP) phase (VPFM).

Source data

a, VPFM phase images. b, VPFM amplitude images. c, The schematic diagram for the distribution characteristics of bubble domains. Bubble domains tend to be densely distributed in the weak-amplitude region (HP phase) or near the boundaries of strong/weak amplitude region (LP/HP phase boundary). Notably, it can be observed that the weak-amplitude region with varied patterns significantly influences the bubble distribution.

a-b, PFM phase and amplitude images before (a) and after (b) the force scanning of ~2.8 μN using an AFM tip. The tip force leads to the formation of HP phase with weak piezo-amplitude and bubbles also tend to densely form in the weak-amplitude HP region, or near the boundaries of strong/weak-amplitude region (LP/HP phase boundary).

a, 3D PFM phase and amplitude image overlaid with topography for the region with the high-density elongated labyrinth domains. b, The corresponding 3D PFM phase and amplitude image after applying a force scanning of 2.8 μN. After the force scanning, weak-amplitude LP and strong-amplitude HP phases become spatially separated, with high-density bubbles formed in HP regions. The scanning area is 3 μm×3 μm.

a, The simulated high-density polarization bubbles. A bubble is circled in red for analyzing the charge concentration (ρₑ), internal field (Ez), and polarization configuration. The simulation dimensions are 2040 nm×2040 nm×120 nm. b, The OP electric field of the top surface for the red-circled bubble in panel a. c, Bound charge density of selected bubble domain in panel a. d, Cross-sectional polarization view for the circled bubble along the A-B line in panel a. The blue (red) center depicts counter-clockwise (clockwise) vortex domain wall center. e, OP polarization component obtained along the blue line marked in panel d.

Source data

a-b, The phase and amplitude after applying different pulse tip voltages (+60 V, +90 V and -90 V) at the central point of the scanning region (indicated by the white arrow) using the conductive tip, respectively. The bubble domains with net upward polarization (net Pup) and downward polarization (Pdown) are circled in white and yellow, respectively. c, The schematic polarization configuration and amplitude response of bubble before and after applying pulse voltage, respectively. d, The distinct conductive differences between the bubble domains with net Pup and Pdown. e, Large areas of conductive bubble domains.

It's September 29, the day that America celebrates its least guilty vice and addiction, known in the streets as “java” or “joe.” That's right, it's National Coffee Day—the day that thousands of people burn $2 worth of gas waiting in a drive-thru to get a free $2 cup of coffee from Dunkin'.

Or how about this instead? Get free or cheap coffee without leaving your house, like a civilized person in the age of the internet. Take advantage of online coffee subscription deals instead.

WIRED has long considered delivery coffee subscriptions to be the promise of technology fulfilled: The best coffee, from all over the country and world, gets scooted to your door without you lifting more than a finger. Anyway, three of WIRED's absolute favorite coffee subscriptions are offering big introductory deals for National Coffee Day 2025, so it's a good day to discover the joys of always having good coffee.

Here are National Coffee Day deals on Atlas Coffee Club, Trade Coffee, and Podium Coffee. Each is 50 percent off for the holiday.

Atlas Coffee Club

Atlas (12 Oz)

Atlas is WIRED's favorite overall coffee subscription for multiple very good reasons. It roasts very good coffee. It also offers reliable, friendly, and swift service—a simple necessity when conducting long-distance relationships over the web. But especially, it offers single-origin coffee from a different country each month, letting you try coffee with flavors you likely haven't tried before. Arabica coffee from Vietnam, or coffee grown in multiple regions of China or India. It's cool. It's kinda what you want showing up at your door, and you can choose your favorite roast level to suit the kind of person you are.

Anyway, Atlas Coffee Club deals are going big for National Coffee Day.

Between September 29 and October 1, 2025, enter the Atlas Coffee promo code FREECOFFEE to get the following discounts and freebies:

Trade

Trade (11 Oz Bag)

If Atlas is our favorite single-origin roaster subscription, Trade Coffee is your ticket to coffee from everywhere—the best and broadest selection of coffee from the best coffee roasters all over the country. I like Trade, especially, as a great way to find roasters I would have never tried, whether chocolatey roasts from Canton, Georgia, or big funky, fruity, light roasts from Portland, Oregon.

And so a Trade Coffee deal is always welcome. On National Coffee Day, Trade Coffee is offering half off a one-month trial subscription.

Podium Coffee Club

Podium (Platinum Subscription)

Podium (Gold Subscription)

Podium Coffee Club is yet another vision of coffee subscription, and also among my favorites. The name says it all: It's a coffee subscription devoted to only award-winning coffees that have been judged among the best in the country and world in large and credible competitions. Podium picks just one wonderful coffee to send you each month, depending on whether you asked for the Gold or the Platinum subscription.

The Podium Gold subscription is generally very balanced, classic, excellent coffee beans. The Podium Platinum subscription, in part, raises its standards for how prestigious an award a coffee might need to be included. But also, the Platinum picks are often rare, funky, interesting, or just different—coffee that changes your mind about what coffee's supposed to taste like. Either way, lucky you, it's cheap today with an exclusive code from WIRED.

Enter the Podium Coffee Club promo code WIREDNTNLCFF50 for half off your first month's subscription.

On Monday, Anthropic launched a new frontier model called Claude Sonnet 4.5, which it claims to offer state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks. The company says Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building “production-ready” applications, rather than just prototypes, representing a leap in reliability from previous AI models.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be available via the Claude API and in the Claude chatbot. The pricing for developers is the same as Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, or more than the entire Lord of The Rings series) and $15 per million output tokens.

In the last year, Anthropic's AI models have emerged as a favorite among developers and enterprises, in large part due to their strong performance on software engineering tasks. Apple and Meta reportedly use Claude AI models internally, and Anthropic has made a significant business selling API access to AI coding applications such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit. Recently, OpenAI's GPT-5 has challenged Anthropic's dominance in the space, outperforming Claude models on a variety of coding benchmarks.

Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers industry-leading performance on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified. However, Anthropic AI researcher David Hershey tells TechCrunch that it is hard to capture Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance on benchmarks alone.

Hershey says he's seen Claude Sonnet 4.5 code autonomously for up to 30 hours during early trials with some enterprise customers. In that time, he watched the AI model not only build an application, but stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform a SOC 2 audit to make sure the product was secure.

In a statement shared with TechCrunch Cursor CEO Micheal Truell said Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents state-of-the-art coding performance, specifically on longer horizon tasks. Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said in a statement that Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a “new generation of coding models.”

Anthropic also claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is its most aligned frontier AI model yet, with lower rates of sycophancy and deception than previous models. The company says it has also improved Claude's susceptibility to prompt injection attacks.

Alongside the launch of Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic is also launching the Claude Agent SDK. The company says this is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, and can be used to help developers build their own agents.

Anthropic is also releasing a temporary research preview called “Imagine with Claude” for Max subscribers, which shows the AI model generating software on the fly. The company says the model will respond to user requests in real time, with no predetermined functionality or prewritten code.

The tense competition in the AI world has made it common for companies to ship flagship models every few months. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is launching less than two months after Anthropic's last AI model, Claude Opus 4.1. These rapid production cycles make it difficult for any company to hold a meaningful lead for very long.

The Department of Energy has instituted a long list of banned words at the direction of a Trump appointee, including some that many would consider politically neutral.

The “words to avoid” were sent in an email to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) on Friday, according to Politico, which saw the memo. “Please ensure that every member of your team is aware that this is the latest list of words to avoid,” EERE special advisor Rachael Overbey wrote.

The terms staffers are forbidden from using include: climate change, green, decarbonization, energy transition, sustainability, sustainable, subsidies, tax breaks, tax credits, and carbon footprint. 

Also on the banned word list is the term “emissions.” According to the report, the term apparently implies some level of negativity, despite the neutrally worded dictionary definition. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases aren't simply emissions, though, but instead can be regulated as air pollutants.

The EERE was established in the late 1970s after several government agencies were rolled into one. The office was a response to the 1973 energy crisis, which had sent oil prices skyrocketing. The intent of the EERE was to foster renewable energy and energy efficiency in an effort to stabilize the American economy from price shocks that can roil commodity markets, like oil and gas.

President Trump and his appointees have decided to bet the American economy on expanded use of those commodities. 

In speeches and official communications, the Trump administration has continually referred to anything related to the energy transition as the “green energy scam.” Last week in a speech at the United Nations, Trump took aim at countries around the world for investing in technologies like solar, wind, and batteries. 

“Your country is going to fail,” said Trump.

Despite the rhetoric, global investment in renewable energy reached a new record in the first half of 2025. Offshore wind and small-scale solar helped push investment up 10% from the previous year to $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

OpenAI began testing a new safety routing system in ChatGPT over the weekend, and on Monday introduced parental controls to the chatbot — drawing mixed reactions from users.

The safety features come in response to numerous incidents of certain ChatGPT models validating users' delusional thinking instead of redirecting harmful conversations. OpenAI is facing a wrongful death lawsuit tied to one such incident, after a teenage boy died by suicide after months of interactions with ChatGPT. 

The routing system is designed to detect emotionally sensitive conversations and automatically switch mid-chat to GPT-5-thinking, which the company sees as the best equipped model for high-stakes safety work. In particular, the GPT-5 models were trained with a new safety feature that OpenAI calls “safe completions,” which allows them to answer sensitive questions in a safe way, rather than simply refusing to engage.

It's a contrast from the company's previous chat models, which are designed to be agreeable and answer questions quickly. GPT-4o has come under particular scrutiny because of its overly sycophantic, agreeable nature, which has both fueled incidents of AI-induced delusions and drawn a large base of devoted users. When OpenAI rolled out GPT-5 as the default in August, many users pushed back and demanded access to GPT-4o. 

While many experts and users have welcomed the safety features, others have criticized what they see as an overly cautious implementation, with some users accusing OpenAI of treating adults like children in a way that degrades the quality of the service. OpenAI has suggested that getting it right will take time and has given itself a 120-day period of iteration and improvement.  

Nick Turley, VP and head of the ChatGPT app, acknowledged some of the “strong reactions to 4o responses” due to the implementation of the router with explanations.  

“Routing happens on a per-message basis; switching from the default model happens on a temporary basis,” Turley posted on X. “ChatGPT will tell you which model is active when asked. This is part of a broader effort to strengthen safeguards and learn from real-world use before a wider rollout.” 

The implementation of parental controls in ChatGPT received similar levels of praise and scorn, with some commending giving parents a way to keep tabs on their children's AI use, and others fearful that it opens the door to OpenAI treating adults like children.

The controls let parents customize their teen's experience by setting quiet hours, turning off voice mode and memory, removing image generation, and opting out of model training. Teen accounts will also get additional content protections — like reduced graphic content and extreme beauty ideals — and a detection system that recognizes potential signs that a teen might be thinking about self-harm.  

“If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,” per OpenAI's blog. “If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.” 

OpenAI acknowledged that the system won't be perfect and may sometimes raise alarms when there isn't real danger, “but we think it's better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent.” The AI firm said it is also working on ways to reach law enforcement or emergency services if it detects an imminent threat to life and cannot reach a parent.

Browser maker and Google Search alternative Brave announced on Monday that it's adding a new feature to its AI-powered search suite, Ask Brave, to provide detailed answers on a topic based on the query.

The search company said that this new feature will co-exist next to its AI Answers feature, which was introduced last year to give summarized responses to search queries. The company said that people are getting more than 15 million answers every day.

You don't need to switch to a special mode to use Ask Brave. The search engine will automatically recognize what kind of query you are asking and give a response accordingly.

You can use the ask button next to the Brave search box to begin a search. You can also turn your normal search query into an AI search query by tapping into the ask tab on the search page result. If you have the Brave search as your default search engine, you can append a double question mark “??” to a query to begin an ask Brave search query.

“While AI Answers give our users quick summaries, Ask Brave provides longer answers, follow-ups, and a chat mode enhanced with Deep Research, and most importantly, contextually relevant enrichments such as videos, news articles, products, businesses, shopping, and more – in the right place, at the right time,” said Chief of Search at Brave, Josep M. Pujol, in a statement. “Search makes it possible, LLMs glue it together. We anticipate that Ask Brave will generate millions more daily AI-powered answers with this powerful combination of search and chat, and look forward to deploying more useful AI-powered search tools for our users.” 

The format of the answer you get out of Ask Brave is more akin to a report format that you get out of ChatGPT or Perplexity, which includes links, videos, and image carousels. Once you get the answer, you can ask the AI chatbot to convert the answer into a different format or ask follow-up questions.

Brave said that it is using the company's own API to ground search results for accuracy, along with deep research for certain queries.  

AI-powered Q&A is now creeping into various search experiences. Google has expanded its AI mode to multiple languages, including a global rollout for Spanish last week. Brave's feature is similar but comes with a privacy claim that the company encrypts users' chats and deletes them after 24 hours of inactivity.

I doubt Apple could demonstrably prove damages before the civil statute of limitations expires. This is a nonstarter in court, and furthermore this is not negligence by the FCC. You do not have a right to keep your FCC filings from leaking under all circumstances, and the FCC has not assumed a civil obligation externally to your rights to do so. Government agencies do not sign NDAs when corporations submit technical documents to them. The Federal government has no obligation in statute to keep them secret, you asking them to is a polite suggestion to the FCC and holds no bearing in law. Even if you could prove damages, trying to bring a case under the Federal Tort Claims Act against the government for this would be a nightmare in any administration, and there's no way that the Supreme Court would cede the idea that the government has an absolute obligation your filings secret forever under pain of civil penalties. It's an embarrassing clerical error, but it isn't a tort.

For competitors they're useless anyway - the big guns (think Samsung, Apple, Motorola, ...) all know how to design a smartphone and none of them will want to get caught copying a competitor. Chinese cloners and repair shop suppliers somehow manage to reverse engineer even highly complex PCBs in a matter of weeks, to the tune you can walk around in Shenzen and have a multitude of deepest level repair options, including upgrades by reballing and replacing storage options that Apple doesn't even offer.But actual repair shops and repair cafes here? They would greatly benefit from having quality documentation and access to tools.

However, some schematics are for products only used internally - like Google TPU's or some cellular radio access network equipment. I think that there exist FCC-approved devices for which the public does not have any interest in the schematics and can remain private.The schematics aren't really “secret” in the sense of a recipe. There's not really a way to precisely determine the recipe for a particular food product, it's more of a process than just a list of ingredients.Schematics are right there inside the physical circuit board for anyone to inspect. You already give them away with every product. It's just expensive to reverse engineer.Personally I also think most material compositions should also be made public by similar logic. I think consumers should be able to know what's in their blankets, dishware, and alcoholic beverages as well. Apparently beer/liquor isn't required to list ingredients either, which is mind-blowing to me in 2025.

Schematics for high-density boards like this are not as informative as you might expect. It's mostly connections between balls of ICs and the values of passives here and there. The values of those passives can be measured from parts salvaged from boards if necessary. More likely, the technician would simply steal the part from another PCB that has been scrapped.

There have been a few videos posted here or showing up on my YT feed for phone repairs, iirc the voltage/battery regulators are things that do like to fail (and pretty obviously, when looking at the pcb with a heat camera).

reply

Those are actives. On a highly integrated device like this it would most likely be an application-specific PMIC (power management IC) that isn't generally available. It would be an IC that would be salvaged from one board and transferred to another.

It's not like some other radioisotopes using in dating, such as carbon-14, which are continuously produced naturally (i.e. by cosmic rays initiating nuclear reactions in the high atmosphere). In that case, an airtight container had a known concentration at the time of its sequestration, and radioisotope dating (to oversimplify) counts the number of half-lives that elapsed since that point. (Or with the example of organic matter—the number of half-lives since a tree was felled into lumber—since it ceased metabolizing atmospheric gases).

What happens to rating agencies that dare cut US ratings? Surely nothing good. So they will keep saying things are good - either because they are, or because they aren't, but they cannot say.But then of course ratings, especially of sovereign debt, are kind of meaningless anyway. The ratings agencies don't have any extra information or deeper analysis available. They know as much as a basic investor, but have no upside in being smarter. The ratings revisions are always reactive, and only really matter because plenty of investors have to avoid bonds below a certain grade.So it's a demeaning of a meaningless number perhaps.

In a somewhat surprising team up, Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund are joining together to buy video game giant Electronic Arts for a staggering $55 billion.

EA announced today that it has agreed to be taken private by a group of investors that includes Kushner's private-equity firm Affinity Partners, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and investment firm Silver Lake. The group plans to pay stockholders $210 a share in cash.

The deal comes as the gaming industry has seen younger gamers gravitate more toward mobile and free-to-play hits like Fortnite and Roblox, rather than the pricey, franchise-driven blockbusters EA is known for. Founded in 1982 by ex-Apple exec Trip Hawkins, EA has built mega-series like sports franchises FIFA and Madden NFL, as well as the iconic life simulator The Sims. Battlefield 6, the next installment in the company's military first-person shooter series, drops next month.

EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who will stay on after the sale, tried to calm nerves about the coming shake-up.

In a memo to staff, Wilson called the agreement one of the largest investments ever made in the entertainment industry.

“Our new partners bring deep experience across sports, gaming, and entertainment. They are committed with conviction to EA – they believe in our people, our leadership, and the long-term vision we are now building together,” Wilson wrote.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund already owns nearly 10% of EA, a stake it's rolling into the new deal. The fund has been on a gaming buying spree in recent years. In 2021, it launched Savvy Games Group to manage a planned $38 billion push into the industry. Savvy has since acquired companies like Scopely, the studio behind Monopoly Go. And then earlier this year, Scopely itself bought the gaming division of Niantic, the makers of Pokemon Go.

These moves could hint at where the new owners want to steer EA. By taking the company private, they can make big changes without considering quarterly market reactions.

The deal is slated to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2027, at which point EA would be removed from public trading.

Shareholders and regulators still need to sign off, though regulatory approval may be easier in a business-friendly Trump administration—especially with the president's son-in-law among the investors.

“Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future. I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games – and now enjoys them with his kids – I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead,” Kushner said in a press release.

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a streaming smash: Superman, which performed more than fine in theaters, has continued to draw fans' attention now that it's on HBO Max.

As Variety reports, the James Gunn-directed, David Corenswet-starring Superman pulled in 13 million views in its first 10 days on the streamer. It earned “the platform's biggest 10-day audience for a movie debut since Barbie began streaming in 2023.”

The trade doesn't note the numbers for Barbie—the 2023 comedy is still Warner Bros.' highest-grossing movie ever—but the studio has got to feel good about Superman‘s longevity with audiences.

What's more, Variety reports that the Superman magic has rubbed off on other streaming features; Christopher Reeve in both documentary and narrative form got a bump, and even the Snyderverse got some love:

“During the week of Sept. 15-21, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story saw a 670% increase in streaming compared to the week before. Superman: The Movie jumped by 155%, Superman Returns jumped by 120%, and Man of Steel jumped 40% during the same window.”

What's more, HBO Max's Peacemaker series is currently heading into its final episodes (with a Superman movie star cameo just last week), and fan excitement continues to build for DC's next big-screen outings in 2026's Supergirl and 2027's Man of Tomorrow. We may be waiting forever in vain for Barbie 2, but DC's revamped era is looking more solid by the day.

When Elon Musk gave two Nazi-style salutes the day President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) came to the billionaire's defense, saying it was just an “awkward gesture.” But Musk clearly doesn't have the same kind of affection for the ADL.

“The ADL hates Christians, therefore it is is a hate group,” Musk wrote in a tweet Sunday.

The ADL hates Christians, therefore it is is a hate group

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 28, 2025



The billionaire Tesla CEO was responding to a tweet from an account called @iamyesyouareno, which has about half a million followers. The pseudonymous account wrote, “The ADL considers Christianity a hateful terrorist extremist belief. You don't hate the ADL enough.” 

Christian Identity (notice the capitalization of the I in Identity) is an extremist ideology that believes Jews are the Satanic offspring of the biblical Eve and the Serpent from the Garden of Eden. All of that is explained in the ADL's page for Christian Identity.

It's not clear if Musk understands the difference between Christian Identity as a specific extremist ideology and small-i Christian identity. The far-right billionaire often operates in bad faith while discussing politics on X, the platform he owns, but he also simply isn't that smart when it comes to many topics.

Reached for comment over email, the ADL pointed Gizmodo to a statement from the ADL on the organization's X account explaining the Christian Identity ideology. Replies for that tweet have been turned off, perhaps because X has itself become an extremist platform filled with anti-semitic hate since Musk bought the site in late 2022.

The ADL also sent Gizmodo a link to a tweet from CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who wrote that the idea ADL is anti-Christian is “offensive and wrong.”

“Many of our staff members are Christian. Many of our supporters are Christian,” Greenblatt tweeted. “We are blessed to work with many Christian brothers and sisters in the shared fight against antisemitism and all forms of hate. In contrast, the Christian Identity movement is an antisemitic, racist, and unambiguously poisonous ideology. Its values bear no resemblance to those of any mainstream Christian denomination.”

Replies to Greenblatt's tweets have also been turned off, and the ADL didn't specifically address Elon Musk in its tweets.

Other high-profile accounts also commented on the ADL's page about Christian Identity recently, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida. Luna accused the ADL of “intentionally creating a targeted hate campaign against Christians.” 

Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who has taken credit for getting several people fired from the Trump administration for supposedly being disloyal, replied to Musk that the ADL should be “designated as a domestic terror org.”

Musk made several changes after he bought Twitter and changed the name to X, including a big shift in what kind of content gets moderated. The CEO has welcomed back white supremacists who had previously been banned from Twitter, including Nick Fuentes, who's been able to get a lot more attention ever since he was allowed to again have a mainstream platform. Fuentes has a long history of praising Adolf Hitler and spreading anti-semitic hate.

um pic.twitter.com/ISwJiM4EsH

— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 20, 2025



The group X Out the Hate has previously called out Musk's extremism, calling on Apple and Google to drop X from its services after the CEO's two Nazi-style salutes.

“From the Nazi salute to his Holocaust ‘jokes' to his support of the extremist AfD party in Germany, Musk's antisemitism has moved to the international stage,” X Out the Hate wrote in February. “Almost daily, he spreads heinous conspiracy theories like the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, promotes neo-Nazis, and agrees with tweets claiming Jews push hate against white people.”

Musk has previously defended his salutes as something he did to express the idea that he was sending out love to the audience. And the ADL defended Musk, insisting that the world didn't just witness what seemed obvious to millions of people.

“It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge,” the ADL tweeted on Jan. 20. “In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath. This is a new beginning. Let's hope for healing and work toward unity in the months and years ahead.”

Musk replied at the time with a crying-laughing emoji while thanking the organization.

Thanks guys 😂

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 21, 2025



Musk also stirred controversy in 2023 when he endorsed a tweet that said Jewish communities had been pushing “hatred against whites.” Musk also attacked the ADL during that tirade, writing, “The ADL unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel,” Musk wrote at the time.

The billionaire has also threatened to sue the ADL for scaring advertisers away from X. And more recently, he became upset that Turning Point USA, the organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk, is listed on the ADL website as an extremist group. “The ADL needs to change this now,” Musk tweeted on Sept. 27.

X didn't respond to an email on Monday seeking comment about Musk's tweet calling the ADL a hate group. Gizmodo will update this article when we hear back.

You won't have to wait too long before the Android diehards will be holding aloft their top-of-the-line Android phones and comparing them to Apple's latest iPhone 17 Pro. Already, OnePlus promises we'll have the OnePlus 15 (yes, we're skipping over the 14) in hand soon enough. Overseas, Xiaomi has a wild-as-hell smartphone, the 17 Pro, with a screen on the camera bump. Both devices are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip announced last week. Samsung will likely unveil a new Galaxy phone with the chip early next year. Lucky for you, I have a small inkling of what users can expect if you're planning to buy the latest and greatest Android phone.

In my tests using a Qualcomm-supplied dummy phone packed with a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, 24GB of RAM, and a 4,300mAh battery, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 performed more than admirably. In Geekbench 6 CPU tests, the phone scored 3,830 in single-core and 12,224 in multi-core settings. That's more than 700 points higher in single-core and an eye-popping 2,400 points higher in multi-core than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with its last-gen Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.

If I were to compare that to an iPhone 17 Pro and its A19 Pro silicon, they're neck and neck in single-core tests, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 trounced Apple's latest in multi-core by 2,438 points. Here we come to graphics performance (as a note, the iPhone 17 Pro scores around the same as the 17 Pro Max in 3DMark save for Solar Bay Extreme benchmarks, which push the phones on ray tracing performance). The Steel Nomad Light test propped up Qualcomm's claims with a score of 3,180, equivalent to around 23 average frames per second. An iPhone 17 Pro scored 2,331 in our own Steel Nomad Light tests.

It was at this point that I started running into problems where the test phone started to overheat and throttle performance. I normally run benchmarks three times to achieve the best result and compare averages, but it seems the device wasn't in the mood to game for very long. In 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme test, the phone hit 7,396 points, or about 44 fps. That's less than Qualcomm's claimed 50 fps in the same room temperature conditions. Performance sagged at the expected rate when the phone kept getting hotter and hotter. Phone makers themselves will have to dictate how well their phones perform after sustained periods with better thermal control.

Let's take a moment to catch our breath. This isn't an apples-to-apples test. The iPhone 17 Pro has 12GB of RAM, the same as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. I truly doubt we'll see a phone with 24GB of RAM anytime in the near future. Synthetic benchmarks never ever tell the whole story. Google's Pixel series, powered by its own Tensor chips, normally ranks far below anything put out by Apple or Samsung, and the Pixel 10 Pro is still perfectly serviceable as a daily driver phone.

Performance will matter more if you're trying to eke out better frame rates in mobile gaming or if you plan to somehow turn your phone into a mobile video editing suite. Qualcomm claims its chip will allow for full support for the Advanced Professional Video codec, which is used by professionals for high-quality video recording. Again, it will be up to Samsung and the other phone makers to take advantage of this.

CMF is finally done teasing its first pair of over-ear headphones. The company—which is, for now, a subbrand of Nothing—is launching the $99 Headphone Pro, an affordable pair of active noise cancellation headphones (ANC) with lots of buttons and a really sturdy battery life.

Like I suspected, the 100-hour battery that CMF already teased doesn't apply to playback with ANC like I had hoped, but if you're listening sans ANC, the company says they're rated for that length of listening. If you are listening with ANC on, though (like most people), you'll get 50 hours, which is still pretty good to be fair. For reference, Nothing's Headphone 1, which also came out this year, get 35 hours with ANC on and 80 hours with ANC off. That's a big difference, especially in the ANC department, and even more so when you consider the Headphone 1 cost $299.

See CMF by Nothing Headphone Pro at Amazon

One thing that carries over between Nothing's Headphone 1 and CMF's Headphone Pro is an emphasis on buttons. Just like the Headphone 1, which comes with a pill-shaped rolling button for volume and play/pause or turning ANC on/off and a paddle for track selection and audio scrubbing, the CMF Headphone Pro have its own array of tactile controls. Probably the most interesting button is what CMF is calling the “Energy Slider,” which is meant for adjusting the bass levels without having to use the Nothing X app. As someone who's pretty specific about having too much bass, I'm actually excited about this one. That fact is, sometimes you want a bass boost and sometimes you don't, and using a button to toggle features like that on or off lacks granularity.

There's also an action button built in that's programmable via the Nothing X app and a power button for, well, turning the headphones on and off. That's not all; there's a roller, which, like the Headphone 1, serves many purposes. In addition to adjusting volume, it also controls play/pause and can control ANC to allow for more or less ambient sound. I, for one, love the tactile controls on the Headphone 1, even if they aren't always the smoothest to use. There's still something about reaching for your headphones that feels so much easier for quick controls when you're riding the subway or just running around with your phone tucked away.

Just as CMF had teased, the Headphone Pro will also have swappable earcups, though that concludes the modularity aspect of its headphones. I was hoping CMF would do more with customization. The $99 Headphone Pro come in dark gray, light green, and light gray, while the additional earcups come in either orange or light green, and will cost $25 each. They're available in the U.K. and EU starting today, Sept. 29; in the U.S. on Oct. 7. My biggest question is how they sound compared to the Headphone 1, but I'll have an answer to that soon enough. And even if they sound notably inferior, they're also one-third of the price, so you can't expect them to be one-to-one.

The various recent partnerships involving OpenAI and Nvidia have been discussed at length by the entire internet as well as the stock market. Besides enhancing shareholder value, though, it's hard to say what the endgame of these large corporations is. The answer is a bit clearer after a CNBC interview, where OpenAI's President Greg Brockman talked up a future with agentic AI that works in your sleep — pointing out we'll need 10 billion GPUs or the equivalent thereof for the future he envisions.

The interview in question includes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Brockman. The discussion goes back and forth, but Altman offers some perspective on pointing out that the scale of its partnership with Nvidia is larger than even the Apollo program that put mankind on the moon. He thinks of the future AI proverbial collective as a ""superbrain"", embedded in our daily lives.

The most interesting remarks, though, come from Brockman, whose vision for the future is that of ""an agent that's going to do work proactively for you while you're asleep"", with every person on Earth having their dedicated GPU on the job. ""You really want every person to have their own dedicated GPU,"" he told CNBC. That's definitely a hot take, one that might elicit some eye-rolls given how many folks are weary of AI features being shoehorned into every product.

However, keep in mind that in the early nineties, Microsoft's ex-CEO Bill Gates envisioned not just one computer in every home, but on every desk, a notion that seemed even more far-fetched and met with excitement and derision in equal measure. And yet here we are today, with one in every pocket.

Brockman continues on to state that the industry is still ""three orders of magnitude off"" where it needs to be in terms of AI computing power, and posits that to fulfill the always-on, always-working AI vision, about 10 billion GPUs would be necessary — a figure above the 8.2 billion people currently inhabiting the planet. He minces no words, saying that the world is heading to a state where ""economy is powered by compute.""

Reinforcing the notion, he went on to say he world is heading towards ""compute scarcity,"" and in a direction where ""the economy is powered by compute,"" implying that AI datacenter service could become de facto currency. While some could call that remark dystopian in nature, it's also hard to deny at this point in time, given that Nvidia's GPUs have become flashpoints in Sino-American diplomatic relationships — and that situation is bound to repeat itself in the future quite frequently.

Long in the Bluetooth.

Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have identified several design flaws in Tile's location trackers that could be exploited to stalk the device's owner.

Wired reported that Georgia Tech's Akshaya Kumar, Anna Raymaker, and Michael Specter discovered problems affecting both individual Tile devices and the methods those devices use to communicate with infrastructure managed by Tile owner Life360.

The trio ""found that each tag broadcasts an unencrypted MAC address and unique ID that can be picked up by other Bluetooth devices or radio-frequency antennas in a tag's vicinity to track the movements of the tag and its owner,"" Wired reported.

Gathering that information is trivial and common. The New York Times reported in 2019 that retailers were using Bluetooth beacons to track people's movement through their stores, for example, and so-called ""sniffers"" are readily available to individuals. Such devices are even somewhat common in smart-home setups.

Those methods of collecting data about location trackers would also circumvent the safeguards Tile added to its devices in 2023. Those protections, which the company introduced after several high-profile incidents of location trackers being used by thieves, stalkers, and other criminals, apply only to the misuse of its products.

But that isn't what's happening here. Those safeguards are supposed to make it more difficult for a Tile owner to stalk someone by slipping a tracker into their bag, for example. However, those same safeguards cannot determine if the Tile is communicating with a seemingly innocuous Bluetooth device while it's still in the owner's possession.

That wasn't the only issue. Wired reported ""the location of a tag, its MAC address, and unique ID also get sent unencrypted to Tile's servers, where the researchers believe this information is stored in cleartext, giving Tile the ability to track the location of tags and their owners, even though the company claims it does not have this capability.""

The problem, of course, is the difference between claiming not to currently have this capability and ensuring that this capability won't be developed later. Encrypting this data wouldn't just protect it now; it would also ensure that historical data can't be misused by Life360, cybercriminals, or even government agencies in the future.

Deborah Brauser

 September 29, 2025  

A consortium of global experts released proposed updated diagnostic criteria for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).

The proposed update would revise criteria first released in 2014 by the International Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders (VasCog). The proposal for the second iteration also provides guidance on neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers and has already been endorsed by the World Stroke Organization (WSO), earning it the name VasCog-2-WSO.

“Considering subsequent advances in the field, a revision was needed,” Perminder Sachdev, MD, PhD, Center for Healthy Brain Aging at the University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia, and colleagues wrote.

The update “should provide an international standard for VCID diagnosis, facilitating diagnostic consistency among clinicians and researchers,” they added.

Deborah Blacker, MD, one of the consortium authors and professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Harvard Medical School, Boston, noted the importance of addressing vascular contributions to dementia, and how to deal with it in the clinic, especially when it comes to developing interventions.

“There's a broader understanding these days about just how multifactorial dementia is, especially in older individuals. And I think [this project] is about people figuring out the best way to address these issues,” Blacker told Medscape Medical News.

The proposed criteria were published online on September 16 in JAMA Neurology.

Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, vascular dementia is the second most prevalent, accounting for roughly 15%-20% of cases, the authors reported. In addition, up to 75% of individuals with dementia may experience cognitive and functional decline related to cerebrovascular disease.

However, a major obstacle to advancing research in this area “is the absence of universally recognized and clearly operationalizable diagnostic criteria, reducing the validity and interpretability of clinical outcomes and research findings,” the authors wrote.

A 2019 study showed that the original VasCog-1 criteria were comparable to those of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and the Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study.

“But technology is accelerating,” which is why updated criteria will be helpful, Blacker said.

The VasCog-2-WSO was developed using a Delphi process that included at least three rounds of online surveys, sent in 2023 to 70 experts. Each round required a minimum of 75% agreement among participants.

Among the experts, 77% were neurologists, psychiatrists, epidemiologists, or geriatricians. Geographically, 78% were from Europe, North America, or Australia, 9% from Asia, 4% from Brazil, and 2% from the Caribbean.

Agreement was reached by 49-54 experts on the diagnostic criteria for preclinical, mild, and major levels of VCID, as well as on research guidelines.

Using “VCID” to refer to the overall cognitive construct for all forms of vascular cognitive deficits, “vascular MCI” for a mild level, and “vascular dementia” for a major level achieved 84% consensus among the Consortium.

Other key revisions include:

The investigators also noted that VasCog-2-WSO offers “practical guidance” for applying all of the criteria.

“This is designed to assist with decision-making in both clinical and research settings and remain sufficiently broad and flexible to facilitate clinical judgment,” the authors wrote.

They noted that the new criteria now need validation in longitudinal studies and assessment of their clinical utility.

“The criteria remain to be tested in the field, and their validation is an important future goal to build on previous efforts involving VasCog-1 and other criteria,” the authors wrote.

In an accompanying editorial, David S. Knopman, MD, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, noted that input from such a wide group of clinicians “that captured points of agreement but also acknowledged gaps in consensus” was a major strength of the new criteria.

Although Knopman participated in the Delphi process, he noted a few concerns with VasCog-2-WSO.

The new criteria continued to accept that, even without a history of stroke, the presence of physical signs consistent with a stroke can serve as a core criterion.

However, the impact “is mooted by the addition of an alternative core clinical criteria that allows any cognitive syndrome to fulfill a core criteria to improve sensitivity,” Knopman wrote.

On the other hand, “a step in the right direction” is the reliance on cardiovascular (CVD) imaging features in order to achieve specificity.

Overall, VasCog-2-WSO “have advanced a practical clinical approach to the categorical diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment. However, the causal contribution of CVD to later life cognitive impairment is broader than the cases captured by the categorical diagnosis,” Knopman wrote.

“A probabilistic approach to explicate the role of atherosclerotic and arteriolosclerotic CVD would represent the broader clinical-biological construct more accurately,” he added.

This paper was funded by a long list of organizations, including the University of New South Wales, the National Institutes of Health, the National Heart Foundation of Australia, the National Medical Research Council of Singapore, and the French Department of Health Direction Générale de l'Offre Des Soins. Sachdev reported receiving advisory board fees from Eisai, Roche Australia, and Eli Lilly Australia outside the submitted work. Blacker reported no relevant financial relationships. A full list of conflicts for Knopman and other members of the Consortium are provided in the original articles.

Outcomes after bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) for patients with advanced emphysema were not significantly affected by the level of heterogeneity before the procedure, based on data from more than 200 adults presented at the 2025 European Respiratory Society (ESR) Congress in Amsterdam.

Previous research has suggested that patterns of heterogeneity may affect outcomes after BLVR in patients with heterogenous emphysema, said presenting author Ahmad Raza, MBBS, Department of Thoracic Medicine and Surgery, Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, in an interview.

In these patients, heterogeneity has been defined as the difference in the percent of emphysematous destruction between the target lobe and the nontargeted ipsilateral lobe, Raza said.

Previous research has established that patients with heterogenous emphysema have a better response to treatment with BLVR than those with homogenous emphysema, but the extent to which the degree of heterogeneity affects outcomes remains unclear, said Raza.

“Various studies have used different cutoffs for heterogeneity, which creates confusion when predicting outcomes with BLVR in discussions with patients and referral physicians; therefore, we decided to study the various degrees of heterogeneity and their impact on outcomes in our patients undergoing BLVR,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Raza and colleagues reviewed data from 206 adults with emphysema who underwent BLVR at a single center between January 2018 and December 2024. The mean age of the patients was 68.4 years, and included 99 women. The patients were divided into three groups according to degree of heterogeneity: less than 10% (group A, 48 patients), 10%-14% (group B, 37 patients), and 15% or higher (group C,121 patients). The researchers compared respiratory function measures at baseline and 6-12 months after BLVR.

Baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was similar across the three groups (approximately 80 L), and the mean residual volume/total lung capacity ratio, a test of air trapping and lung hyperinflation, was similar across the three groups (approximately 61).

Overall, post-procedure change in FEV1 was significantly different from baseline between the lowest and highest heterogeneity groups (A and C, post-procedure changes of 0.11 L and 0.29 L, respectively; P = .02).

However, no significant changes in FEV1, or in other outcomes including the 6-minute walk test, the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, or the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire were noted between group B and group C, which included patients with heterogeneity greater than 10%.

Raza said that he was surprised by the study findings, which adds to the importance of the research. “We hypothesized that a greater degree of heterogeneity would have a greater impact on outcomes post-procedure, but that turned out not to be true,” he said. Instead, the researchers found that, while having heterogenous emphysema of the target lung may confer better patient-related outcomes, the degree of heterogeneity does not matter as much as they thought.

Therefore, the study's takeaway is that the degree of heterogeneity of emphysema is less important than the presence of air trapping in predicting outcomes of BLVR in patients with advanced emphysema and hyperinflation, Raza told Medscape Medical News.

The study findings were limited by factors including the retrospective design and use of data from a single center that may challenge generalizability, despite the relatively large study population, Raza said. More research is needed to standardize the definition of heterogeneous emphysema, as is research to quantify the volume loss after the BLVR procedure in patients with heterogenous emphysema, he added. “Interestingly, various AI software is being studied to quantify the pre- and post-procedure lobar volume, which would be a novel way to predict outcomes post-procedure,” Raza noted.

The current study is important because patterns of emphysema, whether homogenous or heterogenous, affect clinical outcomes after BLVR, said Emily DuComb, MD, interventional pulmonologist at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, in an interview.

“Further evaluating degree of heterogeneity and how that may impact treatment response makes sense to better understand who responds to BLVR and to what degree,” said DuComb, who was not involved in the study.

“Although various studies have used different cutoff values, my practice is to use 10% for the cutoff for heterogeneity,” DuComb told Medscape Medical News. The finding that heterogeneity beyond 10% was not impactful on outcomes was interesting, she added.

Overall, the current study supports the use of 10% as the threshold value for heterogeneity, but additional research is needed to stratify which patients acquire most benefit from valves, DuComb noted.

The study received no outside funding. Raza and DuComb had no relevant financial conflicts to disclose.

A supervised high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength exercise intervention significantly reduced fatigue and improved quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with benefits persisting through 12 months of follow-up.

""The pragmatic approach employed to deliver the exercise in the study, utilizing existing exercise equipment at the physiotherapy units of the respective hospitals and clinically active physiotherapists supervising the exercise makes the implementation of the exercise protocol in clinical practice feasible,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Annelie Bilberg, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. It was published online on September 18, 2025, in Arthritis Research & Therapy.

This study may have been underpowered to detect true changes in fatigue because no power calculation was performed for the primary outcome.

This study received open access funding from the University of Gothenburg and additional funding from the Swedish state through the ALF agreement, the Healthcare Board of Region Västra Götaland, the Swedish Rheumatology Association Research Grant, the Rune and Ulla Amlöv Foundation for Rheumatology Research, and the Norrbacka‑Eugenia Foundation.

A monumental increase of more than 400% in infections from a dangerous drug-resistant bacteria known as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE) suggests a growing risk for life-threatening illnesses and deaths with limited treatment options, based on two recent reports.

New data in the Annals of Internal Medicine and the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) show spikes in NDM-CRE, a type of gram-negative bacteria often treated with carbapenems.

The presence of NDM gives the bacteria its resistant bite because this enzyme is less common in the US than elsewhere in the world and is resistant to most available antibiotics, according to the researchers.

In a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Danielle Rankin, PhD, a CDC epidemiologist, and colleagues outlined the trends in carbapenemase-producing CRE (CP-CRE) clinical isolates reported to the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network of the CDC from January 2019 through December 2023.

“The researchers found a dramatic increase in NDM-CRE of 461% in 5 years in the United States,” she said.

“CDC's Antimicrobial Resistance Threats Report identifies carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales as an urgent threat to human health in the United States, requiring aggressive public health action to prevent, detect, and control these pathogens to protect lives,” Rankin said in an interview.

NDM-CRE is particularly alarming because of its increasing prevalence in the US, its ability to cause infections that are difficult to treat, and its ability to defeat many types of antibiotics, Rankin said. “Monitoring the epidemiology of CRE and NDM-CRE is crucial, as it changes the way infections are treated and how we implement infection control measures in healthcare facilities,” she emphasized.

“Unfortunately, the rise in NDM-CRE increases the likelihood that the sickest patients, such as those in hospitals and long-term care facilities, may get these serious infections that have very few treatment options,” said Rankin. The bacteria are also at risk of spreading to people in the community, meaning that common infections, such as urinary tract infections, that are usually treated with oral antibiotics may be more likely to need intravenous antibiotics and may require hospitalization, she added.

While the NDM carbapenemase is recognized as the most globally widespread, the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has historically been the most common carbapenemase enzyme among CRE in the US, Rankin said.

The rise in NDM-CRE is concerning but not surprising, Rankin told Medscape Medical News. Antimicrobial-resistant infections surged in the US after the COVID-19 pandemic pushed healthcare to its breaking point, she said. Increases in NDM elsewhere in the world suggested that increases could appear in the US as well, she added.

The takeaway for clinicians is that the recent increases in CP-CRE and NDM-CRE threaten to reverse years of stable declining CRE rates, Rankin said. “Understanding the specific carbapenem resistance mechanisms can help healthcare providers select the appropriate treatment for their patients with CP-CRE infections,” Rankin said. Most approved drugs used to treat CP-CRE infections target specific carbapenem resistance mechanisms. To date, only two available drugs are effective against NDM-CRE: ceftazidime-avibactam in combination with aztreonam and cefiderocol.

“In addition, healthcare providers, laboratory professionals, and pharmacists should be aware of the increasing threat of NDM-CRE, and testing for NDM should be included in clinical laboratory workflows,” Rankin told Medscape Medical News. Identifying patients with highly resistant pathogens and adhering to good infection control practices are crucial for slowing the spread of CRE and other antibiotic-resistant germs, she added.

The Annals of Internal Medicine study included 29 states with mandated submission of CRE specimens; therefore, data were not available from every state, Rankin said. However, the data from the study cohort aligned with national trends in a sensitivity analysis, she said. “Additional research is needed on understanding the reasons for the increases in CP-CRE and on the development of antibiotic therapy and decolonization agents,” Rankin added.

Similarly, data published in the MMWR showed a significant increase in the number of NDM-CRE cases in New York City in recent years, from 58 in 2019 to 388 in 2024.

In 2024, the number of NDM-positive CRE cases surpassed the number of KPC-positive CRE cases, which remained relatively stable during the study period, according to a report by Katelynn Devinney, MPH, of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City, and colleagues.

Some resistance mechanisms, such as NDM, can be transferred across different bacterial species and can reduce the effectiveness of both carbapenem and non-carbapenem antibiotics, limiting treatment options, said an NYC Health Department spokesperson in an interview.

The researchers were surprised by the rate of increase and that NDM-CRE had become more common than KPC-CRE, which has been present in New York City for much longer and has had stable case counts for the past few years, the spokesperson added. Contributing factors to the increase remain unclear because data on how the infections were acquired are limited, the spokesperson said. “The NYC Health Department is exploring ways to enhance our understanding of CRE exposures, including through laboratory testing, and the study findings highlight the important of access to carbapenemase testing to help inform treatment decisions,” the spokesperson said.

In the meantime, “healthcare providers treating CRE in areas with higher NDM incidence should consider empiric therapy effective against NDM-CRE in the absence of susceptibility results, particularly for patients with severe CRE infection,” the spokesperson said. Looking ahead, routine whole genome sequencing of CRE isolates would provide valuable insight to understand transmission and detect clusters and outbreaks, the spokesperson added.

Tracking the NDM-CRE is important, given the transmission in both healthcare settings and the community, said Gonzalo Bearman, MD, professor of medicine and chair of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, in an interview.

“When someone is colonized and later infected with this pathogen, treatment options are limited and require restricted antibiotics, ones are usually prescribed only by infectious diseases specialist,” said Bearman, who was not involved in the studies.

The increase in NDM-CRE is not unexpected, given the significant rise in global travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, Bearman said. Other potential factors contributing to the increase include the ongoing indiscriminate use of antibiotics and the breakdown of many infection prevention practices during the pandemic period in hospitals and long-term care facilities, he added.

Expert consultation with an infectious disease specialist should be strongly encouraged for patients with suspected or proven CRE infections, Bearman told Medscape Medical News. Additional research is needed to better define the transmission mechanisms of the CRE, as well as infection prevention measures and optimal treatment strategies, Bearman said.

The studies received no outside funding apart from the CDC.

Bearman, Devinney, and Rankin reported having no relevant financial conflicts to disclose.

The United States Men's U-20 National Team have arrived in Chile for the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup, and they arrive with expectations to try and make a breakthrough. In the past 4 U-20 World Cups, the United States has advanced to the quarterfinals, but that has been where their road ends. This time around, they hope to take the next step and get to the semifinals, where they would have a chance to get to the final game.

They are in Group E alongside New Caledonia, France, and South Africa, and they begin the group stage tonight against New Caledonia. The United States will not take the team from Oceania for granted, but they also want to start out on the right foot and put some points on the board. They have some good players on the roster and head coach Marko Mitrović will have to utilize that talent to get them going. It's a nice look at the future as the United States gets their U-20 World Cup started.

The U. S. Men's National Team is just one week away from regrouping for a crucial series of international friendlies against Ecuador in Austin, Texas (Oct. 10) and against Australia in Commerce City, Colo. (Oct. 14). It's the second-to-last USMNT camp of 2025, and one in which coach Mauricio Pochettino will aim to stop experimenting and start narrowing down his roster for next summer's World Cup jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Many Americans are performing well for their club teams around the world, but four stand out:

It's been a wild few weeks for Pulisic in Italy. The attacker followed up a two-goal performance against Udinese with a stellar showing Sunday against league leader (and defending champion) Napoli. Pulisic assisted Alexis Saelemaekers' goal in the third minute before scoring a banger of his own in the 31st. Those two goals were the difference: Milan wound up beating Napoli 2-1 and leapfrogged it to take the top spot in the Serie A table.

""It sends a message for sure,” Pulisic said of his team's performance, per CBS Sports Golazo America.

It does — but Pulisic's individual performance is sending a message, too. With four goals and two assists just five games into the Serie A season, he's one of the most in-form players in the world.

Juarez-born dual national Zendejas spent much of 2025 outside the USMNT looking in, but his nigh-unbelievable form with Club América in Mexico has brought him back into the fold for good. In a 4-1 win over Pumas UNAM on Saturday, he scored twice as América won the hotly contested Clasico Capitalino. His first goal was an audacious chip; his second, a thumping, decisive penalty.

Zendejas may not have the global appeal of Pulisic, the World Cup experience of Brenden Aaronson or the domestic pull of Diego Luna, but he's quietly become one of the USMNT's more fascinating wide attacking options — and he's done so at precisely the right moment. He's worth keeping an eye on as the Liga MX season develops.

Crystal Palace versus Liverpool was the headlining fixture of this Premier League weekend, and for good reason: Both teams entered the Saturday match unbeaten with plenty to prove. While many expected defending champion Liverpool to win, it was Palace that prevailed 2-1 thanks to an Eddie Nketiah goal on the last kick of the game.

Much has been written about Palace's brilliant offense, and rightfully so; Nketiah, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Adam Wharton, Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino are fantastic (and underrated) Premier League attackers. But Palace's defense, anchored by USMNT regular Richards, is arguably even more impressive. It's a three-man system that looks awfully similar to the one the USMNT experimented with successfully against Japan, and Richards looks fabulous within it.

21-year-old USMNT prospect Alex Freeman is the highest-scoring defender in Major League Soccer.

Freeman scored arguably the most impressive goal of his 2025 campaign Sunday against FC Cincinnati. With just two minutes left and Cincinnati up 1-0 in the crucial Eastern Conference clash, Freeman found himself some space in the penalty box and headed in a gorgeous Tyrese Spicer cross to level the score. The 1-1 tie all but ended Cincinnati's hopes of winning the 2025 Supporters' Shield and lifted Orlando to seventh in the Eastern Conference standings.

Ban would take in Nations League and Europa League

World Cup, co-hosted in 2026 by US, is a Fifa competition

Uefa is expected to avoid trying to block Israel from World Cup qualifying as the European governing body considers measures against the country's football association.

Under plans being worked out by Uefa that are expected to be voted on by its executive committee (exco) this week, the Guardian understands Israel would be banned only from competitions that Uefa directly controls. That means the Israel men's and women's national teams would be excluded from the Nations League and Maccabi Tel Aviv would be removed from the Europa League this season.

The World Cup, however, is a Fifa competition, for which Uefa organises the qualifying format and fixtures within Europe. This is done “in collaboration” with Fifa but only subject to the global governing body's approval. Acting unilaterally to remove Israel would be a politically complicated decision, and one that appears to have been avoided. In the absence of a wider ban, however, Uefa would be in the unusual position of staging World Cup qualifiers for a country otherwise excluded.

If Israel were blocked from Uefa's competitions, the spotlight would spring back to Fifa. Last week a US state department spokesperson warned that it would “absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup”. Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, has formed a close relationship with Donald Trump in the buildup to the World Cup next year, which the US is co-hosting.

Norway and Italy are due to face Israel in qualifying during the upcoming international break, which begins next Monday. Amnesty International in Norway last weekend called on the national football association to increase its pressure on Uefa, and a 24 hour general strike was held in Italy last week in protest at the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.

Asked last week about the prospect of Italy boycotting their fixture, Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on the Uefa exco, said it “would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament”. Israel are third in their qualifying group, level on points with second-placed Italy, having played a game more, with the runners-up granted a place in the World Cup playoffs.

Gravina's point was echoed by Norway's FA president, Lise Klaveness, who feels Israel should be banned. “I work on the issue from a principled standpoint, but we will not boycott on our own,” Klaveness, a Uefa exco member, said on the Norwegian podcast Pop and Politics. “A boycott would only result in Israel going to the World Cup instead of us. In general, we are now working for Israel to be sanctioned.”

Norway are believed to be among the nations calling on Uefa to convene an extraordinary meeting of its exco this week to take a decision on the matter. It is understood the growing impetus behind a resolution is in part being driven by the president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin. Any meeting is expected be held remotely and could be convened at short notice.

Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote. Insiders suggest that if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of passing with very few members of Uefa's 19-strong exco expected to object.

Uefa, even if it imposed a ban, would continue to be responsible for organising Israel's World Cup qualifiers, including providing match officials, security and other staff for their “home” games in Hungary.

Maccabi Tel Aviv are due to play Dinamo Zagreb in their second Europa League tie on Thursday, and that game is expected to go ahead. It could, though, be Maccabi's final involvement in the competition. A replacement team would be sought, with the most likely possibility being Dynamo Kyiv, who lost in qualifying against Maccabi, though that would have a knock-on effect on the Conference League.

Spaniard Martin Landaluce boosted his chances of qualifying for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF on Sunday when he won the ATP Challenger Tour 125 event in Orleans, France.


The 19-year-old, up three places to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, downed top seed Raphael Collignon 6-7(6), 6-2, 6-3 in the Co'met Orleans Open final. 


Landaluce lifted his second Challenger trophy, but this one was a work of art — literally. The Orleans Challenger was celebrating its 20th anniversary, and true to tradition, every champion receives a painting commissioned from a local artist. Landaluce's prize was a vibrant red painting, depicting a pyramid of 20 tennis balls, symbolising the tournament's 20 editions. It was painted by Natacha Toutain.

“I don't have much art at home, so I have plenty of space!” Landaluce said with a smile. “I think it's beautiful, it's very bright. I think I'm going to put it in the gym, because that's where I work and where I push, and this trophy is thanks to that.


“I said yesterday that I wanted to bring the trophy back home, and that's what I did. It's amazing. This is a very beautiful tournament and it's an honour to win this tournament.”


A former junior No. 1, Landaluce won the US Open boys' singles event in 2022. He captured his maiden Challenger title last October in Olbia and is now aiming for his maiden trip to the 20-and-under Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The event will be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 17-21 December. 


The Madrid native is closing on his Top 100 debut, currently sitting at No. 111 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.


“It will happen if I still play this game, keep pushing and working day by day,” Landaluce said of his Top 100 potential. “I'm not thinking about a goal, because if I reach it, I'm going to have more goals. I'm going to be very close to it and it will be more pressure than a good thing, so I'm just thinking to play my best and play my game. My goal is to be my best version.”

How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts?

Iconic Alain Prost onboards

Racing Bulls Team Principal Alan Permane has revealed what most impressed him about Yuki Tsunoda during the Japanese driver's time with the squad.

Alan Permane believes that Yuki Tsunoda's skills as a driver – including his feedback and work outside of the car as well as in it – are “really in line with the top drivers”, something that the team boss admits came as a “nice surprise” when he first worked with Tsunoda.

Since joining Racing Bulls as Racing Director at the start of 2024 – before being promoted to Team Principal this July – Permane has now worked with three of the four drivers currently racing for the two Red Bull teams, with Liam Lawson returning to the sister squad in a swap with Tsunoda earlier in the season where he now partners Isack Hadjar.

As such, when quizzed during the Azerbaijan Grand Prix weekend on what stood out about Tsunoda during the Japanese driver's time at Racing Bulls, Permane highlighted numerous qualities that the 25-year-old displayed.

“His speed [stands out], for one thing,” said Permane.

“I didn't know Yuki at all before I started with the team in '24, and I was immediately impressed by him – by his pace, by how he can handle the tyres, his Qualifying pace, how he could get on top of the tyres as quickly as he did to extract the most out of the car in Qualifying.

“That was the very first thing that surprised me. And honestly, his feedback, and the way he is in the car, the way he drives, the way he is out of the car, are really in line with the top drivers.

“He's a great driver. And honestly, that was a little bit of a – let's say it was a surprise. I guess I hadn't thought about it, but it was a nice surprise when I got to start working with him.”

For now, the drivers that Permane is most focused on are Hadjar and Lawson as the pair look to maximise Racing Bulls' performance during the final seven Grands Prix of the campaign, while Tsunoda will be hoping to extend a decent run of form that saw him claim a season-best P6 last time out in Baku.

How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts?

Iconic Alain Prost onboards

Ahead of a new wave of technical regulations being introduced into the sport in 2026, Fernando Alonso believes there is an ""opportunity"" available for Aston Martin.

Fernando Alonso believes that future success is “more or less guaranteed” for Aston Martin in F1's new era, but admits that his “only question mark” is over when this will happen and whether he will still be driving for the team at that point.

The Silverstone-based outfit have taken on new signings in recent times as they aim to reap the rewards when a new wave of technical regulations come into effect in 2026, with Adrian Newey – who came onboard as Managing Technical Partner in March – focusing his attentions on preparing for next year's car, while Chief Technical Officer Enrico Cardile and CEO and Team Principal Andy Cowell have also joined the project.

As such, when asked during an interview on Aston Martin's official website if he feels that all of the pieces are in place for the squad to succeed during this new phase, Alonso responded: “I hope so. I mean, I'm pretty convinced about that.

“The only thing is when. That's probably my only question mark from this project.

“In my case, driving in the last couple of years of my career, obviously, I want to taste the success of the Aston Martin project. But I know that everything takes a little bit of time to glue all the pieces together. And that's my only question mark.

“Aston Martin Aramco fighting for and winning the World Championship is more or less guaranteed in the future. We have everything that is needed to fight for a World Championship.

“Then, to execute the job and to win it, you need some external factors as well: you need a little help from the competitors [with results not going their way]; you need a little bit of luck; you need to execute every weekend well.

“But let's say, in preparation for 2026, we have everything in place.”

Alonso cited “opportunity” as his first thought when it comes to next year, with the Spaniard adding: “With the current regulations, the gap to the frontrunners is a little bit too much, and the energy and the effort that you need to overcome that gap is too much for now – too much to do in 2025.

""I see 2026 as an opportunity. Everything will be reset in a way, and then it's up to us to do a better job than the others.""

With Alonso recently stating that 2026 is more likely to be his last year in Formula 1 if the car performs well – allowing him to end on a high note – the two-time World Champion was hopeful that his vast experience in both F1 and other categories in motorsport could prove useful when it comes to adapting to the new regulations.

“I've driven very different cars in motorsport, from rally cars in the dunes to endurance racing to Formula 1 – and very different eras of Formula 1,” the 44-year-old explained.

“So, you know, whatever we find next year in the first couple of days with the car, I'm sure that it will have some similarities with some of the experiences that I had in the past.

“Hopefully, I can understand any problems or opportunities, and feed that back to the team: what could be needed to tackle these.”

Following the 2024 Paris Games, the rapper will reprise his role sharing his take on the competitions and exploring the culture and landmarks of the Milano Cortina region.


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


NBCUniversal said Sunday night that Snoop Dogg will return to his gig helping cover the Olympics for NBC and Peacock.


	Following on the heels of the 2024 Summer Games in Paris, the rapper will head to Italy for the Milano Cortina Olympics. The Games kick off Feb. 6 with the Opening Ceremony. 




	According to NBCUniversal: “The global megastar will explore northern Italy, from the vibrant streets of Milan to the breathtaking Dolomites, providing his unique perspective to viewers during NBCUniversal's Winter Olympic primetime coverage.”

	Throughout the Winter Games, Snoop also will speak with NBC Olympics host Mike Tirico and share his take on what's going on in the Games as part of the “Snoop's Greatest Hits” segment. As he did previously, Snoop will also explore the culture and landmarks in the region, attend Olympics competitions and cheer alongside the athletes, their friends and families. 


	The announcement was made Sunday night during NBC Sports' Sunday Night Football coverage of the Green Bay Packers at Dallas Cowboys. 


	“I am excited to be back with my main man Mike Tirico for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina,” Snoop said in a statement. “The D O double G will be on the scene, and I am looking forward to celebrating with the athletes and their families. The Olympics is the biggest stage in the world and, as everyone knows, I'm all about sports, bringing people together, and unifying while bringing the fun. I'll be bringing my puffy jackets, snow pants, goggles, skates (and will definitely be iced out).” 

	











	Added NBC Olympics executive producer Molly Solomon: “Our Ambassador of Happiness returns! We can't wait to see how the kid from Long Beach handles the snow and ice of Italy at his first-ever Winter Olympics. In Paris, Snoop amplified the joy of the Summer Olympics: training with the athletes, watching nervously alongside their families, and cheering on their performances. He connected with viewers in a way we've never seen before and now he's primed to return as Team USA's most effusive supporter. Mike Tirico has the announcer blazer and microphone standing by.”


	During the Paris Games, Snoop carried the Olympic torch ahead of the Opening Ceremony, celebrated with athletes including gymnast Simone Biles, watched equestrian with longtime friend Martha Stewart and celebrated with gold-medalist swimmer Caeleb Dressel's wife Meghan and infant son August.


	Earlier this year, the NBCU's Entertainment & Studios division under Donna Langley announced an expansive deal with Snoop's Death Row Pictures across film, television and streaming. The company's upcoming slate of projects includes a Snoop Dogg biopic. Snoop also returned to NBC's The Voice this fall and will host Snoop Dogg's New Year's Eve celebration live from Miami on NBC and Peacock.

The veteran executive joined Comcast a decade ago as CFO, and was most recently president.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	In a major move atop one of the world's largest entertainment companies, Comcast has named Mike Cavanagh co-CEO, joining Brian Roberts atop his family's communications conglomerate.


	Cavanagh was most recently president of the company, and also effectively ran NBCUniversal, with all of the media company's executives reporting to him. He joined Comcast as CFO in 2015.




	Cavanagh's elevation will be effective Jan. 1, at which time he will also join the Comcast board of directors. Roberts will remain as chairman and co-CEO.

	“Since joining Comcast a decade ago, Mike has proven himself to be a trusted and collaborative leader,” said Roberts in a statement. “He is the ideal person to help lead Comcast as we manage the pivot we are making to drive growth across the company. Mike and I work seamlessly together, and I am thrilled to be partnering with him as Co-CEO and with the rest of our talented management team, for years to come.”

	











	“Comcast is a special company with exceptional businesses and an incredible team. It is an honor to work with Brian and the entire Comcast NBCUniversal leadership team during this exciting and transformative time in our industry,” added Cavanagh.


	The elevation of Cavanagh is unusual in that Comcast is a family-controlled company, having been founded by Brian Roberts' father Ralph Roberts more than 60 years ago. Brian succeeded his father atop the company in 1990. Brian Roberts' son Tucker Roberts is also an employee of Comcast, in its Spectator division, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers NHL team and the Wells Fargo Center.

	











	That said, it is not unusual for controlled by companies to elevate executives to run them day to day. Paramount and its predecessors, under both Sumner Redstone and Shari Redstone, relied on professional CEOs to run the companies, while the Murdoch family turns to Robert Thomson to run News Corp.


	And while the co-CEO structure is unusual, it is not unprecedented. Netflix, of course, has had a co-CEO since Ted Sarandos was elevated to lead the company alongside Reed Hastings.

	The recording artist posted the news on his Instagram account Sunday night with the caption: “Super Bowl LX. Bay Area. February 2026. #AppleMusicHalftime.”

A post shared by Benito Antonio (@badbunnypr)

	Commented Roc Nation founder Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter: “What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage.”


	Bad Bunny joins a coveted list of artists who have gotten the opportunity to headline the NFL's biggest night, including Lamar, Michael Jackson, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Diana Ross, Katy Perry, The Weeknd, Usher, The Rolling Stones and Bruno Mars, among many others.

	











	The Puerto Rican singer, a three-time Grammy winner, will host NBC's Saturday Night Live Season 51 premiere, with musical guest Doja Cat, on Oct. 4. He's recently added acting to his résumé, with credits including Bullet Train, Happy Gilmore 2 and Caught Stealing.


	Said Jon Barker, senior vp global event production for the NFL: “Bad Bunny represents the global energy and cultural vibrancy that define today's music scene. As one of the most influential and streamed artists in the world, his unique ability to bridge genres, languages, and audiences makes him an exciting and natural choice to take the Super Bowl halftime stage. We know his dynamic performances, creative vision, and deep connection with fans will deliver the kind of unforgettable experience we've come to expect from this iconic cultural moment.”


	Added Oliver Schusser, vp Apple Music, sports and Beats: “The Halftime Show is the ultimate celebration of music and culture, and few artists embody that intersection more perfectly and authentically than Bad Bunny. At Apple Music, we've had the privilege of working closely with Bad Bunny over the years and watching his meteoric rise into one of the most influential artists of our time has been truly incredible. His music has not only broken records but has elevated Latin music to the center of pop-culture and we are thrilled to once again partner with the NFL and Roc Nation to deliver this historic performance to millions of fans worldwide. We know this show will be unforgettable.”

	











	Super Bowl LX will air on NBC and stream on Peacock. The game will take place Sunday, Feb. 8, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers.

From 'Parasite' to 'Anora' and breakout horror hit 'Longlegs,' this year's Zurich Summit Game Changer explains how he built one of indie cinema's hottest brands: ""I love the sport of it. But at the end of the day, the legacy is the films, the art.""


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	With 39 Academy Award nominations, 11 wins, and more than $400 million at the box office in just eight years, Tom Quinn has turned Neon into one of the most disruptive forces in independent cinema. The distributor behind best picture winners Bong Joon Ho's Parasite and Sean Baker's Anora, as well as Oz Perkins' horror hits Longlegs — the top indie release of 2024 with $74 million domestic — and The Monkey, which earned nearly $40 million, has helped restore faith in the theatrical business. 


	Honored at the Zurich Summit, the Zurich Film Festival‘s industry event, with this year's Game Changer Award, Quinn sat down with CAA's Roeg Sutherland (a former Game Changer honoree) to trace an unlikely path from cataloging reels at Sam Goldwyn to building one of the premium brands in global cinema.

	Quinn's origin story doubles as a primer in entrepreneurial training. “I've been doing this for 30 years—it's gone by so quickly,” he said, noting he's worked on “something over 400” films in his career, from his Neon titles back through the decades previously at the Sam Goldwyn Company, Mark Cuban's Magnolia Pictures, and at The Weinstein Company's label Radius.


	Goldwyn for Quinn was film school and boot camp: He cataloged archives, ran a projection booth, and cycled through development, production and acquisitions. “Seven and a half years there gave me a pathway: I wanted more control over the movies we buy, in service of how they're marketed and publicized.” Magnolia, under Cuban, became the proving ground. “Cuban essentially gave me free rein to go buy 40 movies a year… there was no censorship, just operating within a financial model.” Doing all his own modeling, negotiating, and pitching, “as executives we were cross-trained,” he said, shaped Quinn approach to the business.

	











	The leap from executive to founder began with a nudge from friend, and future business partner, Jason Janego: To stop “playing amateur ball” and go pro. The result was Radius, a boutique label at The Weinstein Company, that embraced simultaneous VOD releases at a time when that was still taboo. Snowpiercer, Quinn's first collaboration with Bong Joon Ho, provided proof of concept. The film grossed $4.5 million in theaters despite having a simultaneous VOD release. David Robert Mitchell's horror breakout It Follows became a case study in adaptive windowing. “The plan was: We take it theatrical in 20 markets, with no announced VOD window, and let the audience decide the next window,” Quinn said. “The Thursday night at the Arclight [in L.A.] did $6,000; that told us it should be a wide release. We canceled the VOD window and went wide.”


	Quinn and Janego left Weinstein in 2015 to “raise money for a company that would right the wrongs of previous places I'd worked, built on better business practices,” said Quinn. “Where we would only work on films we could sell with a straight face, that we truly believed in 100 percent.”


	It turned out to be a big ask. It took two years to raise the start-up capital. Quinn credits Sutherland with helping secure Neon's first backer, SR Media, which put in $15 million. Janego ultimately stepped away from the company before Neon launched in 2017.


	Those first years were scrappy, partly by design. “It was six people inside a WeWork—basically like a chef on a cook line,” Quinn recalled. An early success was Matt Spicer's dark comedy Ingrid Goes West (acquired via CAA). Margot Robbie took note of Neon's campaign for the film, which earned a respectable $3 million. When Robbie's I, Tonya came to market, Neon was among the bidders.

	











	“By then, we were maybe 15 people, and we had just enough money to buy I, Tonya,” Quinn said. Neon “plunked down $6 million,” and got the movie, despite a deep-pocketed bid by Netflix (“who came in with three times our offer”). 


	Two weeks later, Neon launched the film's Oscar campaign, coaching I, Tonya to a $30 million domestic release and 3 Academy Award nominations (with a best supporting actress win for Allison Janney). “Everything changed after that,” said Winn. “Filmmakers started looking and saying, ‘Theatrical is not dead. Look at what you can do when you do it right.'”


	From there, Neon's brand cohered around curatorial conviction and the art of marketing. For Parasite, Neon's trailer foregrounded the film's only two lines of English “we put them front and center in the trailer to give audiences comfort,” said Quinn. For Justine Triet's Anatomy of a Fall, Neon's hook wasn't the courtroom drama — a large portion of the film — but a whodunit prompt: “Did she do it?” which “aimed higher than what a film like this would traditionally gross.”


	Neon's in-house ethos, said Quinn, is a form of non-groupthink. When Jason Wald, VP of production, pitched him on Longlegs with a two-minute clip, his instinct was to give the film a hard no. “I said: ‘You've got to be kidding—we're not doing this.'” But Wald convinced him. “When Oz [Perkins] delivered the movie, I thought: I get it! This is a beautifully-made horror film.”

	











	The Longlegs campaign is part of the Neon legend. Their underground campaign ditched the standard teaser, trailer, poster and TV spots approach for a single cryptic billboard, a mysterious telephone number, and a trail of online breadcrumbs to entice fans to figure out the mystery of the film.


	“We saw, day to day, the interaction and validation across materials and world-building,” said Quinn. “The marketing isn't simply selling the film, it's additive; its own artifact. It was fun and very effective.”


Longlegs opened at number 2 at the U.S. box office, behind only Despicable Me 4 in its sophomore frame, grossing $22.4 million. It went on to earn $74 million and is still Neon's all-time box office champ.


	But Neon has remained true to its arthouse roots. Quinn paid $1.6 million for North American rights to Céline Sciamma's Portrait of a Lady on Fire, an unusually aggressive move for a French-language title, on personal conviction that “this was a once-in-a-lifetime movie.” When Quinn and acquisitions head Jeff Deutchman read Julia Ducournau's script for Titane, they made her an offer on the spot. The film went on to win Cannes' Palme d'Or, Neon's second Palme (after Parasite), and the start of a six-film winning streak at the world's number-one film festival, which continued this year with Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident.


	“Brand identity matters. Inside the company, we have painstaking discussions and we do not compromise,” said Quinn. “That commitment attracts filmmakers. Not everything works, but every year we try to put out the perfect ‘ten-film' catalog: If you like one of our movies, I think I can convince you to check out the other nine—and maybe the rest of our 125-film catalog.”

	











	Quinn addressed the widespread rumors that he's looking to sell that catalog, and all of Neon, to the highest bidder. “We're all for sale in some way,” he admitted, but said, “creating a company just to exit was never my goal. The incoming interest we get is validating, it shows we're a real, sustainable business, nine years in, without taking much outside investment.”


	Whatever happens with Neon, this year's Zurich Summit Game Changer said he'll “never stop going into screenings and trying to buy movies…My favorite thing is sending an offer during the screening and closing the deal before the credits roll. I love the sport of it. But at the end of the day, the legacy is the films, the art. Céline Sciamma said something that always stuck with me: If your art isn't political, is it actually art? That's something I firmly believe.”

The KPop Demon Hunters smash also ties for the second-most weeks at No. 1 for a hit by an all-woman group.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's smash film KPop Demon Hunters, tops the Billboard Hot 100 for a seventh week — becoming one of the 10 longest-leading No. 1s from a movie over the chart's 67-year history.


	Meanwhile, “Golden” ties TLC's “Waterfalls,” from 1995, as the second-longest-leading Hot 100 hits ever by all-women groups. The only such song with more time at No. 1: Destiny's Child's “Independent Women Part I” dominated for 11 weeks in 2000-01.


	Previously, “Golden,” which first glowed atop the Hot 100 in August, made HUNTR/X — the singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, in the roles of KPop Demon Hunters characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey — the first female group associated with Korean pop to rule the chart. “Golden” is also the sole longest-leading hit by an animated group in the Hot 100's archives, while KPop Demon Hunters became the first soundtrack to spin off four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Oct. 4, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Sept. 30. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.






	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 33.8 million official streams (up 5% week-over-week), 33.9 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 11%) — new weekly highs for the song in each metric — and 8,000 sold (up 2%) in the United States Sept. 19-25. (Helping its profile in the tracking week: contestant Jourdan Blue covered “Golden” in the final round of the latest season of NBC's America's Got Talent on Sept. 23.)


	The track adds a 10th week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; jumps 16-9 on Radio Songs; and rebounds 3-2 after two weeks atop Digital Song Sales. Since Streaming Songs began in 2013, “Golden” is just the 20th of 170 total No. 1s to lead for double-digit weeks. Plus, it's the first Radio Songs top 10 ever by an animated act, having outperformed cartoon tunes that hit the chart's top 40 by Gorillaz in the 2000s and (hopefully he doesn't have a cow if learning this) Bart Simpson in the ‘90s.


	With a seventh week leading the Hot 100, “Golden” ties two other hits as the ninth-longest-ruling No. 1s from movies all-time, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, start.


	Here's a look at the longest-leading movie songs in the Hot 100's history (as defined by qualifications used for Billboard's Top 75 Movie Songs of All Time recap, which is based on weekly performance on the chart):




	Plus, “Golden” ties TLC's “Waterfalls” for the second-longest Hot 100 command by an all-female group (of three or more members).


	Here's a recap of the 10 longest-ruling songs by that measure:




	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2, after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It tacks on a 15th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (75.6 million in audience, down 1%).


	Also from KPop Demon Hunters, Saja Boys' “Soda Pop” buzzes 5-3 for a new Hot 100 high and their “Your Idol” rises 6-5, after reaching No. 4. (Both are sung by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.) Thanks to “Golden” and those songs, three tracks from the film chart in the Hot 100's top five simultaneously for a fourth week. (The only other soundtrack to generate three concurrent top five hits, Saturday Night Fever, did so for two weeks in 1978.)


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, is steady at No. 4 on the Hot 100, after it led in its first week in May. It adds a 19th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild,” which topped the Hot 100 in its debut week in June, drops 3-6.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and went on to become last year's No. 1 song, rises 9-7. It logs a record-extending 110th week on the chart overall and a record-furthering 79th week in the top 10.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” climbs 10-8 on the Hot 100; Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” descends 7-9, after hitting No. 5; and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” bumps 11-10, following five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.

A spokesperson for the White House attempted to refute Grande's reshared claims in a statement.

Pride Editor


	After Ariana Grande slammed Donald Trump's administration on her Instagram Stories Sunday (Sept. 29), a spokesperson for the president fired back at the Grammy-winning singer. 


	In a statement provided to TMZ, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai responded to Grande's post, attempting to refute the points she shared about the Trump administration's actions during the president's second term.

	











	“Save your tears, Ariana, because President Trump's actions ended Joe Biden's inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investments,” Desai claimed. “He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande's concert-going fans. Get well soon, Ariana!” 


	While Desai claims that the president “ended” the inflation crisis, a report earlier this month from the U.S.  Department of Labor showed that inflation increased to 2.9% in August, marking the biggest increase to consumer prices since January. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission did announce a lawsuit aimed at Live Nation and Ticketmaster for misleading consumers about resale ticket prices. 


	In her original post, Grande reshared a recent infographic from activist Matt Bernstein, who questioned Trump voters over the current state of political affairs. “It's been 250 days. now that immigrants have been violently torn from their families and communities have been destroyed, now that trans people have been blamed for virtually everything and live in fear, now that free speech is on the brink of collapse for us all — has your life gotten better?” the post asked. “Has the widespread suffering of others paid off for you in the way he promised it would, or are you still waiting?”

	There's a new Simpsons movie, and it's coming out on July 23, 2027. 


	The second Simpsons movie to hit the screen will fill a date for Disney that's simultaneously being vacated by an untitled Marvel movie.


The Simpsons Movie was released in July 2007 and it was a hit, opening to $74 million and making $183M domestic and more than $536 million worldwide. It was at a time when TV properties, even if they were still on television, could excel on the big screen at the same time. David Silverman directed The Simpsons Movie. We'll apprise you when we have more intel on what the new movie is about, etc.

	











The Simpsons TV series, which first premiered in 1989, is currently in its 37th season. The series is co-created by James L. Brooks, Matt Groening and Sam Simon. The working class family of Homer, Marge and kids Bart, Maggie and Lisa, who live in the town of Springfield surrounded by a ton of kooky personalities, first made their premiere as a short on the 1987 sketch comedy series The Tracy Ullman Show, which was also co-created by Brooks.

The Simpsons features the voices of Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Yeardly Smith (Lisa), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Nancy Cartwright (Bart) as well as Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer in multiple roles.

EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, A24 has boarded Hotel Hotel Hotel Hotel, the sci-fi thriller from Together writer-director Michael Shanks. Shanks, who wrote the script that appeared on the 2021 Black List, will also direct and produce.


	The sci-fi thriller follows a man wakes up trapped in a mysterious hotel room. All alone in a mind-bending prison, his only chance for escape is teamwork — with himself.


	The film will be produced by Mike Cowap of Princess Pictures and Adam McKay and Todd Schulman of HyperObject Industries.


	Shanks was one of the big winners at this year's Sundance Film Festival, where his body horror comedy Together earned rave reviews and became one of the bigger acquisition deals of the fest when Neon came in to land distribution rights.

	The film bowed in the summer and grossed $32 million at the global box office, strong results for an indie horror pic in the thick of the summer tentpole season. When Shanks declared that Hotel Hotel Hotel Hotel would be next up, A24 moved fast to make sure it was the home of his next film, and are now moving fast to get it up and running as Shanks begins the casting process.


	Shanks is repped by WME and Untitled Entertainment.

	“With rapid-fire gags and a game cast trying hard to play it all completely straight, this nakedly hilarious Naked Gun is a welcome return in a time where we can use a few good laughs,” wrote Deadline's Pete Hammond in his review. “This one has more than a few if sight gags, literal humor and characters short a few cards of a full deck are your idea of a good time.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","J.K. Rowling suggests Emma Watson is ""ignorant of how ignorant she is"" because she grew up rich","https://www.avclub.com/jk-rowling-emma-watson-rift-post-x","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:23:14 GMT","

The whole situation with J.K. Rowling and Emma Watson keeps getting worse. Based on Rowling's latest, nearly 700-word post, one might think Watson gleefully cast the Cruciatus curse on the Harry Potter author's family. In reality, she just said the following in an interview on the On Purpose With Jay Shetty podcast last week: “I think it's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with.” Rowling clearly does not share this wish, nor does she seem to have retained a lot of love for the actor she's known since Watson was 11. Last week, Rowling reposted a video mocking Watson's comments on X. Today's post only doubled down on her earlier suggestion that she'd never forgive Watson (or her co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint) for their public dissent. 

“I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created,” Rowling opened, before reiterating that “Emma Watson and her co-stars have every right to embrace gender identity ideology.” What she takes issue with, however, is the fact that “Emma and Dan in particular have both made it clear over the last few years that they think our former professional association gives them a particular right – nay, obligation – to critique me and my views in public.” Watson has arguably done this very little. In 2020, Watson posted, “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are,” without mentioning Rowling by name as the author's transphobia ramped up online. Two years later, she said she was here for “all the witches” in a BAFTA speech Rowling directly referenced in today's post. 

That speech, which again, did not mention Rowling by name, was apparently a “turning point” for the author, but it “had a postscript that hurt far more than the speech itself.” “Emma asked someone to pass on a handwritten note from her to me, which contained the single sentence ‘I'm so sorry for what you're going through' (she has my phone number),” Rowling's post continued. “This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family's safety. Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”

Rowling then went on to imply that Watson is “ignorant of how ignorant she is” because “like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life.” To Rowling, that life Watson hasn't experienced includes “mixed sex public hospital ward[s]” and the possibility of “sharing a prison cell with a male rapist who's identified into the women's prison.” These are all things Rowling understands, of course, because she “wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen” and “lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous.”

“Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother,” Rowling's post concluded. “Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public – but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.” It doesn't seem like this spat will be over any time soon.

Season 34 “Dancing with the Stars” contestant Hilaria Baldwin and her family are feeling the love from DWTS fans after revealing a difficult loss. 

On September 27, Baldwin shared the sad news in an Instagram post. The initial photo she included in her carousel showed her husband, actor Alec Baldwin, posing with two small dogs. Additional photos showed highlights from the family's time with both dogs over the years, and it was the white dog Baldwin was mourning.

A post shared by Hilaria Thomas Baldwin (@hilariabaldwin)

In the caption of her post, she wrote, “Rest in peace, sweet Dama. You brought so much joy to our lives.” 

She continued, “You were that dog that slept on my pregnant belly. Your life was long and happy. I know you are running through fields and eating all the cookies you want.”

“We are sad but grateful that we had you in our lives,” Baldwin added. 

One of the pictures Baldwin included in her post showed Dama as a small puppy, indicating she was a part of the family for many years. 

The post quickly received nearly 35,000 “likes” and almost 2,200 comments in the day after it was shared. Several comments came from people who wrote that they remembered when the Baldwin family got Dama initially and noted she was well-loved. 

“I remember when you got her. I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending you and the fam all the love,” one fan wrote.

“Oh nooo. Dama!!!! Sending you guys all the love,” read another comment.

Someone else added, “I'm so sorry about your loss. Such a heartbreaking time. Sending hugs!!!”

An additional comment read, “She had years of peanut butter/sticky fingers hugs and kisses. What more could one pup want. Warm hugs to the family.”

Next up for Baldwin and her partner, Gleb Savchenko, on “Dancing with the Stars” is “TikTok Night.” The third week of the season 34 competition airs on September 30 and viewers will see Baldwin and Savchenko dance a samba to “Shake It to the Max (FLY) [Remix].”

During the second week of the competition, Baldwin and Savchenko did a tango and received a total of 21 out of 30 points from the judges. They were one of three couples left at risk of elimination after others were called safe, and “Dancing with the Stars” fans knew that two of the three would be eliminated.

Ultimately, Baldwin and Savchenko were called safe while Britt Stewart and Baron Davis, along with Jenna Johnson and Corey Feldman, were eliminated.

Robert Irwin is quickly becoming a fan favorite on “Dancing With the Stars,” and part of his charm is his excitement while performing. For the show's first two dances, Irwin could be seen singing along to the music while dancing, and now he's sharing why.

“I [have] no idea about dance, but I do know I love music,” Irwin told Us Weekly following his performance on the show's second episode of season 34. He also explained that his pro partner Witney Carson tells him to “feel that music” while he's on the ballroom floor.

“For me, singing it, getting into it, and just giving every fiber of my being to this experience, that's why I'm here,” the wildlife photographer explained. And he's grateful that his partner is so good at helping him harness his energy.

“I'm so lucky that I have someone like Witney to direct all of this ridiculous tornado of passion and energy into some semblance of skill,” Irwin shared.

A post shared by Robert Irwin (@robertirwinphotography)

For the show's premiere episode, Irwin and Carson performed a fun jive number set to “Born to Be Wild” and earned an impressive score from the judges. Derek Hough even called it the “best first dance” in the history of “DWTS.”

Irwin and Carson followed up that performance with a tango to “Move Your Feet” which also garnered plenty of praise. Hough used the Aussie slang term “crikey” when giving his positive feedback, which Irwin appreciated.

“I think it is the most fitting response anyone could ever give,” the nature conservationist told Us Weekly. “Crikey is a great word. It sums up everything, and if my dance was crikey-level, mate, I'm happy.”

A post shared by Robert Irwin (@robertirwinphotography)

Irwin and Carson make a great team, and the dance pro is super supportive of her celeb partner. “Honestly, I'm so grateful for him and we're just going to keep doing what we're doing and hopefully we can just stay on top,” she shared.

As far as the pressure to stay on top, Carson is doing all she can to bring out the best in Irwin. “The hardest part is just trying to better yourself, right? We try to top ourselves and I always try and make the best choreography that I can,” the dancer explained, adding, “I always try and teach him the best way that I can.”

Carson has also taken on the job of playing matchmaker for Irwin, who is currently single. On September 27, Irwin shared a hilarious Instagram post of him and Carson getting ready to look at his likely overflowing DMs. “Witney taking the wingman job very seriously,” Irwin captioned the reel.

When Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt” premiered at the Venice Film Festival in late August, it was greeted with some of the most divided reviews of the filmmaker's career. Critics (candidly, including myself) were impressed by the performances and filmmaking but left bewildered by first-time screenwriter Nora Garrett's muddled screenplay that tackles post-#MeToo society, privilege, and power in the academic world. Reviews were, generally speaking, mixed to negative, with a few standouts.

A month later, the film arrived as the opening night gala at the New York Film Festival. So how did his topical drama, about a Yale philosophy professor (Julia Roberts) tied up in her Black student's (Ayo Edebiri) sexual assault accusation against a white colleague (Andrew Garfield), play at NYFF?

It opened the highbrow two-week program, overseen by artistic director and former film critic Dennis Lim and managing director Matt Bolish, last Friday at Alice Tully Hall. Past Guadagnino films to play NYFF include “Queer,” “Bones and All,” and “Call Me by Your Name” — all of which scored better receptions throughout their run than “After the Hunt” has so far.

But can new word-of-mouth — not necessarily good, but at the very least new — boost “After the Hunt” at this point?

A sampling of mostly millennial critics and journalists at Friday night's “After the Hunt” premiere that I spoke with at the official after-party at Tavern on the Green on the edges of Central Park, were also left cold by the movie. It runs long at just shy of 2 hours and 20 minutes, and one journalist I talked to said that, while the film wasn't necessarily boring, its length led them to feel the pains of an incoherent narrative. There are plot elements that don't always add up or seem easily ascribed to recognizable human behavior (such as why Julia Roberts' character Alma keeps a picture that's extremely revealing about a past secret taped under her bathroom vanity, rather than in the pied-à-terre she maintains as a private office).

But a colleague I'd spoken to who'd had a look at an earlier draft of the screenplay said that many elements were different in that script — including that very one. So we're curious to hear from screenwriter Garrett about what changed and why.

The film, however, has its admirers, including another critic who appreciated what they felt was its astute look at how trauma is processed differently across generations. (Alma, it's implied, is twice Edebiri's character's age.) “After the Hunt,” intended as Amazon MGM Studios' big horse in the Oscar race this year, might not make it all the way to the Academy Awards despite hopes for Julia Roberts returning to the Best Actress category since she won in 2001 for “Erin Brockovich.” (Her last Oscar nomination altogether was for Supporting Actress in 2014 for “August: Osage County.”)

 










But where the movie could remain a player is the HFPA-dismantled Golden Globes, a handful of whose international spectrum of voters attended a packed press conference during the film's weekend global junket. There, journalists (both in the room and joining via Zoom) asked engaging questions that Roberts and her cast and creative team praised — she was not having it at the Venice Film Festival, particularly when the first question asked at that Italian presser was, “Why does this movie undermine feminism?”

Roberts is a Globes darling, nominated most recently in 2023 for TV's similarly on-topic “Gaslit” as Martha Mitchell. She's won three times from 10 nominations, and the capaciousness of having two categories (Musical/Comedy and Drama) for Best Actress gives her room to play in. “After the Hunt” has a shot at playing better for two core audiences — the international coterie, and the Gen X or boomer audiences who didn't necessarily come of age with such proximity to the topics investigated in this American film — many of which reflect the makeup of the 300-some Golden Globes body.

Amazon MGM Studios opens “After the Hunt” in select theaters on Friday, October 10 followed by a nationwide release on Friday, October 17. How it plays for non-trade critics will factor into its eventual theatrical business. And when the film eventually reaches Amazon's Prime Video streaming service, fans of Edebiri, Roberts, Garfield, and Guadagnino can tune in with little risk, and share thoughts and soundbites and viral clips of the movie on social media, where it may well find an entirely new life.

Why is Glen Powell so determined to hide his handsome face? The Tom Cruise-approved action star has two professional writing credits to his name — co-writer Richard Linklater's 2023 film “Hit Man” and co-creator Michael Waldron's 2025 series “Chad Powers” — and both require Powell, a man once described on this very site as “plainly one of the most handsome and charismatic human beings on planet Earth,” to disguise himself as a goofy nobody. For all the debate over the state of movie stardom, which often centers discussion around Powell's ticket-selling muscles, it's clear, at least, he's not a nobody. He's a charming bad boy. A versatile beefcake. A cerebral bro (cerebro? no, that's something else) who can showcase his style on the cover of GQ in a half-lifted tank and pop two buttons too many for the suits who subscribe to The Hollywood Reporter. 

 








Related Stories ‘The Simpsons' Are Coming Back to the Big Screen with a New Movie in 2027 ‘Gavagai' Review: A Racist Incident Mars a Berlin Movie Premiere in Ulrich Köhler's Patchy but Provocative Meta-Drama 

“Hit Man,” at least, gives Powell ample opportunity to flex his range. As Gary, a nerdy professor pretending to be an assassin-for-hire in order to help the police expose real people's murder plots, each new “job” requires a new personality, and Powell's transformations provide plenty of hoots and hollers, a dash of heat, and a dab of human drama. But Chad Powers — the puffy-faced hillbilly persona assumed by disgraced quarterback Russ Holliday so he can reenter college football — actively gets in the way of “Chad Powers.” He's all disguise and no character, stranding Hulu‘s half-hour sports comedy in an implausible premise it doesn't know how to manage. Rather than bring out Powell's good side(s), “Chad Powers” gets stuck in the same identity crisis as its subject.

 










Before Chad, there was Russ. And Russ is an asshole. He drives a Cybertruck. He's got “buddies in crypto.” He believes conspiracy theories, most notably that Osama bin Laden is still alive. All of these personality traits are introduced within the first hour of “Chad Powers,” and while they're largely played for jokes, they also establish just how deep a moral hole ol' Russ has to climb out of by pretending to be someone else — someone nice or, at least, someone better.

You see, Russ hasn't recovered from his spectacular collapse eight years earlier. As the star quarterback of the Oregon Ducks, he led his team to the national championship and was inches away from winning it when he dropped the ball on the 1-yard-line. Just like that, everything changed. He went from athletic icon to laughing stock, from a first-round NFL draft pick with sponsorship deals to a former “Masked Singer” contestant who's too toxic for the XFL.

He didn't have to crash and burn quite so garishly, but Russ didn't handle his fall from grace with any, well, grace. The second he loses the big game, a young fan in a wheelchair shouts to Russ, “You're still my favorite player.” But Russ is too wrapped up in his own failure to recognize an outstretched arm as anything but an annoyance, and his reaction is ugly enough to “haunt him … for the rest of his life.”

 










Or that's what play-by-play announcer Chris Fowler says on TV, and his pointed prophecy is proven out by the disastrous decisions Russ makes in the present. Watching videos on his phone while driving through Los Angeles, he sees South Georgia University is holding open tryouts for their football team. Just then, he pulls up to the Fox lot, where he's supposed to drop off a set of prosthetics his father (Toby Huss) made for the new Michael Bay movie. But as Stephen A. Smith complains about open try-outs, shouting, “This isn't a movie,” Russ looks up and sees the “Mrs. Doubtfire” poster hanging above the studio entrance. He thinks for a second. An idea sparks. Then he looks directly into the camera… and smiles.

From that point on, any inkling that the TV show based on an Eli Manning sketch is meant to have both cleated feet rooted in reality vanishes. The premise is just there to set up jokes about Chad Powers' weird looks and absurd backstory (Russ likes to improvise answers, despite being terrible at it), while establishing a unique starting point for a conventional sports redemption story. Russ doesn't know who he is without football (other than a big ol' jerk), so maybe walking a football field in someone else's shoes will help him figure it out.

 










…except Chad's jokes are redundant and shallow, his prosthetics are an impediment to a good time, and the premise refuses to get out of its own way. First, the jokes: Russ is instinctually hesitant to talk about himself, which makes sense considering the more he says about Chad, the more opportunities there are for him to get caught in a lie. But establishing your lead funnyman as someone who just shuts up and stares blankly ahead isn't a recipe for sustainable comedy. He'll occasionally mumble made-up excuses, but those are too out-there to laugh at, and his coaches and teammates' confused conclusions aren't all that humorous either (especially when they involve the word “retard,” which continues its frustrating cultural comeback). 

As a commentary on how much leeway athletes are given in America, Chad's inability to string sentences together is disturbingly accurate, but “Chad Powers” isn't trying to make a point. It's trying to be funny, and the laughs only come elsewhere. Namely, they stem from Steve Zahn as Chad's oft-bewildered head coach, Clayne Crawford as Chad's bluntly entitled quarterbacks coach, and Frankie A. Rodriguez as Chad's unpaid assistant, roommate, and team mascot, Danny.

The colorful supporting cast gels well enough, taking pressure off Chad to score laughs and lending the series a “Ted Lasso” niceness. (Team-building through sports! Huzzah!) But a lot of the jokes are too crass to fit the forced inspirational tone, let alone a series about a douchebag learning to be less douchey. Plus, at least one cast member's side plot feels too much like a minefield. Perry Mattfeld plays Ricky, a talented assistant coach who's routinely overlooked because she's a) the coach's daughter and b) a woman. But Ricky also provides ample reasons of her own to negate moving up the ranks, as she forms a “will they, won't they” romance with Chad despite their perceived age-gap and very real coach-player dynamic.

 










In a show that so clearly wants you to just go along with its story, these kind of emotional (st)ick-ing points act as road blocks toward relaxed fun. There are too many unanswered questions — how is Chad passing his classes? does he even go? — and too many missed opportunities. (The cold opens are… rough.) But worst of all, “Chad Powers” manages to waste Glen Powell. Saddled with an uninteresting jerk half the time and a muzzled non-entity the other half, there's only a handful of moments in the first six episodes where Powell's star power shines through. That the majority of them arrive in the later episodes may be a sign for optimism, but “Chad Powers” has a lot more work to do if it's ever going to become its best self. 

“Chad Powers” premieres Tuesday, September 30 on Hulu. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on October 28.

Bad Bunny is at the peak of his powers. The Puerto Rican artist just finished a sold-out, month-long residency at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, and on Sunday DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS became the first album of 2025 to surpass 7 billion streams on Spotify. The NFL announced the same day that Benito will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. 


	It's going to be loud, it's going to be Latin, it's going to be (mostly) in Spanish, and it's already driving right-wingers insane. 


	Prominent Republicans are already fuming at the possibility that Bad Bunny's halftime performance in February will feature critiques of President Donald Trump and his targeting of immigrant communities, and that it may require them to turn on English subtitles. 


	Earlier this month, Bad Bunny canceled the U.S. dates of the DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS tour over concerns that large gatherings of Latinos in the U.S. could be magnets for the Trump administration's anti-immigration efforts. “There was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said of the decision. 

	











	The announcement that a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's agenda will play the Super Bowl sparked immediate outrage from the MAGA base. 


	“The NFL is self-destructing year after year,” MAGA slop YouTuber Benny Johnson wrote on X. “Massive Trump hater. Anti-ICE activist. No songs in English,” he added.

	











	Conspiracy theorist and right-wing commentator Jack Posobiec suggested that the selection was a conspiracy orchestrated by former President Barack Obama. 


	“Barack Obama's best friend Jay-Z runs the Super Bowl selection process through his company Roc Nation which has an exclusive contract with the NFL. This is who chooses the halftime show, the most-watched musical performance in America,” he wrote.  


	Conservative commentator Greg Price noted that “the NFL chose Bad Bunny to perform the Super Bowl halftime show despite the fact that he recently said he wouldn't perform in the continental United States again because ICE is deporting illegal aliens.”

	Some of the criticism was a little more stylistic. The right wing account “Redheaded Libertarian” described Bad Bunny as “demonic Marxist who has been granted the largest stage with the greatest audience in the middle of a Christian revival.” Podcaster Trish Regan complained that Bad Bunny's music contained Spanish-language slang and explicit language, even halftime show performers typically edit out any explicit content. “This is a rapper with a catalog of vulgar lyrics in Spanish and English — including calling a president a “mamabicho” (translation: vile insult),” she wrote.


	The account “End Wokeness,” which boasts almost 4 million followers on X, suggested that a Harper's Bazaar photoshoot in which Bad Bunny wore a skirt should have weighed against his selection for the performance. Commentator Mario Nawfal wrote that “maybe someone should let the NFL know that the average halftime viewer in Des Moines doesn't speak fluent reggaeton […]  Enjoy the show, America. Just don't ask for subtitles.” Right wing filmmaker Robby Starbuck complained that “the guy literally says he isn't touring the US because of Trump's ICE raids and just released a video mocking President Trump.”

	“Also, most of his songs aren't even in English,” Starbuck griped. “This is not a pick designed to unite football fans or let people just enjoy the show. It was a pick designed to divide fans and no doubt Bad Bunny will find some way to push a woke message.” Starbuck also suggested that team owners were either “in on this idiocy” or “just culturally that disconnected from reality.”


	Starbuck and the nativist right are speaking to a mirror. The reality is that public approval of the Trump administration's handling of immigration enforcement continues to slip as the Department of Homeland Security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement continue to use authoritarian tactics. The reality is that Latin and South America are two of the largest and fastest-growing viewership markets for the NFL. The reality is that Bad Bunny, a vocal Trump critic, is one of the most popular artists in the world — whether conservatives like it or not.

Madonna is approaching the first anniversary of the death of her younger brother, Christopher Ciccone, who died this past October at the age of 63. At times, the singer's relationship with her sibling was tumultuous, leading to periods during which they rarely spoke. During her first podcast appearance, on Jay Shetty's On Purpose, Madonna details a spiritual encounter she had while in a medically-induced coma (during her four-day hospitalization in the ICU in June 2023 for a serious bacterial infection) that led to her reconnecting with Ciccone. 


	“I was almost there on the other side and I had a conscious moment and my mother appeared to me and she said, ‘Do you want to come with me?' And I said, ‘No,'” Madonna said. “My assistant was in the room with me, but I was still unconscious, but she heard me say, ‘No.' And then when I did eventually wake up, I realized that the ‘No' was about me needing to forgive and make good with people that I still held grudges against.” 


	Soon after, Madonna wrote a song about her brother and another about forgiveness. The unreleased tracks, titled “Fragile” and “Forgive Yourself,” center around the idea of accountability and responsibility. “We have to forgive others but we also have to forgive ourselves and stop beating up on ourselves about things, choices we've made in the past that haven't worked out for ourselves or other people,” she said.

	For a while, Madonna added, she pushed off forgiving with Ciccone because she assumed she'd have more time to do so. “Your ego dances around it like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get to it. I'll get to calling him up or talking to him or being his friend or helping him,'” she said. “But eventually I did. And, I know I'm being mysterious, if someone you love deeply betrays you and does something that shows that they have no consciousness in that moment that they made that choice to do that, it's a bitter pill for me to swallow.” 

	











	She continued, “For my brother, I didn't speak to him for years, years, and years. It was him being ill and reaching out to me and saying, ‘I need your help,' and me having that moment like, ‘Am I going to help my enemy?' That's how it felt. And I just did. I felt so relieved. It was such a load off my back, such a weight that was removed, baggage that I could put down to finally be able to be in a room with him and holding his hand — even if he was dying — and saying, ‘I love you and I forgive you.'”

Rowling Dismisses Emma Watson's Nuanced Take on Their Relationship, Calls Her 'Ignorant'","https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jk-rowling-responds-emma-watson-ignorant-1235437512/","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:56:12 GMT","


							By 

	Jon Blistein



	After Emma Watson offered a thoughtful and nuanced account of her relationship with J.K. Rowling in light of the Harry Potter creator's anti-trans stances, Rowling responded by lambasting the actress as “ignorant.” 


	During a recent podcast appearance, Watson described how she's still able to value Rowling as a person, and the time the two spent together, saying, “I really don't believe that by having had that experience, and holding the love and support and views that I have, means that I can't and don't treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with. I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person I don't get to keep and cherish. I just don't think these things are either/or.”


	Rowling, however, dismissed Watson's assessment in a lengthy retort on X. “Like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is,” the author said. 

	











	The author did acknowledge she's “not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created.” And even said that, for a while, she retained a “certain protectiveness” for Watson and her co-star Daniel Radcliffe (who'd also spoken out against Rowling's views).


	But with Watson, she cited the actress' remarks at the 2022 BAFTA awards (“I'm here for all of the witches”) as a “turning point.” She alleged that the actress had “publicly poured more petrol on the flames” when the backlash and threats against Rowling were at their fiercest. 

	











	Rowling also revealed that, around the same time, Watson allegedly asked someone to pass on a handwritten note, which Rowling said read, “I'm so sorry for what you're going through.” Rowling dismissed this as well, suggesting Watson “thought a one line of expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness.”

	As for what prompted such a fierce response this time, Rowling blamed Watson, “The greatest irony here is that, had Emma not decided in her most recent interview to declare that she loves and treasures me — a change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was — I might never have been this honest. Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother. Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public – but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it.”


	That's in sharp contrast to what Watson herself said in her original interview — though, it's unclear if Rowling heard or read Watson's comments in full, or just regurgitated the bits contained in the clip from the British right-wing TV news station that accompanied her post.

	Watson, for her part, said she remained open to reconnecting with Rowling, especially because “a conversation was never made possible.” And she stressed her own desire to be careful about her comments regarding Rowling going forward, likely out of concern for what the author had endured in the past.


	“I just don't want to say anything that continues to weaponize a really like toxic debate and conversation,” Watson said. “It is why I don't comment or continue to comment. Not because I don't care about her or about the issue, but because the way that the conversation is being had feels really painful to me.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Aliens may be hiding in five or six underwater UFO bases US congressman claims","https://www.the-express.com/news/weird-news/185411/us-congressman-claims-aliens-hiding-underwater-bases","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 15:08:19 GMT","



According to an American congressman, there may be ""five or six"" undersea bases off the US coast where aliens could be hiding.

According to Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee, alien ""entities"" are already residing in Earth's deep waters. Social media was rocked by the assertions made by the member of the House Oversight Committee that deals with UFO cases.

Burchett made the suggestion that intelligent alien entities or civilizations might have been lurking beneath the water for ""millennia"" in a now-viral video that was uploaded to X on September 17.

“There have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft in about five or six specific deep sea areas,” Burchett stated in a sidewalk interview with Red Panda Koala, a UFO researcher and documentary maker.

""We have naval personnel telling me that we have sightings ... of these underwater crafts that they're chasing,"" he said.



""[The underwater crafts] they're chasing are doing hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we've got is something that does maybe just a little bit under 40 miles an hour"".

""I've got a lot of questions about that stuff,"" he added. He added in the brief video that humans know more about the moon's surface than the ocean floor.

Despite these assertions, the public has not been provided with any substantiating proof, such as artifacts or unobscured video of these crafts.

The claims are questioned, according to critics, because they are based on anecdotal stories from military personnel and lack peer-reviewed scientific data.

After Burchett's disclosures, Dr. Michael Salla said that one of the purported UFO bases was located in an area of the Atlantic Ocean close to the Bahamas.

The author and researcher who specializes in extraterrestrial phenomena claimed to have also had conversations with reliable informants who verified the existence of these undersea outposts, including high-ranking military and executive branch personnel.

According to Dr. Salla, AUTEC, a top-secret undersea facility run by the US Navy, is comparable to Area 51. That particular area of the Atlantic Ocean was home to the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Centre, or AUTEC.

""Just to the right of it is the Tongue of the Ocean, which is a very deep part of the ocean there in the Bahamas,"" he said on the Redacted podcast on September 19. It drops off immediately around 3000 ft.""

""So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater crafts coming into and leaving the water.""

Dr. Salla claimed to have spoken with two eyewitnesses, one of which was a US Army whistleblower who went by the moniker JP, who claimed to have visited these covert bases.

While some of these towns are truly vanished ""ghosts,"" some remnants linger of others. Here is a look at ghost towns of Montana. 

A group of believers and some folks who are just plain curious met in Butte over the weekend to discuss all things paranormal.

The Bozeman Paranormal Society had its fourth annual Big Sky Paranormal Conference on Saturday at the Clark Chateau.

It featured nearly two dozen speaking guests, ghost-busters, classes, lectures a séance and workshops. Ghost tours were provided by the Spooks and Spirits Tours.

Elies Adams, president and founder of Bozeman Paranormal Society

Among those attending was Justine LaBreche of Butte, who said it was something of a honeymoon present for her and her husband, Johnathan.

“It's interesting,” she said as she stood in front of the chateau. “I like the paranormal stuff and the spirits.”

She said she had just attended a discussion by Richard O'Connor of Clancy, with the Crop Circles Research Foundation Inc., on crop circles. 

“That was actually pretty cool,” she said.

She laughs when asked if people think she's a little wacky for believing in the paranormal.

“My mom and I, we both believe in spirits. My dad on the other hand, is kind of iffy on that kind of stuff,” she said. “I think they're kind of cool. I believe in that stuff.”

Her husband said he was enjoying the conference and said it was good to have it at this time of year as Halloween approaches and the vibe is spooky.

He thinks paranormal activity “could be possible,” adding he goes “back and forth” on how he feels.

Among those at the show was Kathleen Johns, a psychic medium who was selling her book “Echoes of the Afterlife.“

Kathleen Johns, a psychic medium from Bozeman, holds a copy of her book ""Echoes from the Afterlife"" at the Big Sky Paranormal Conference on Saturday.

She said she was going to speak later at the conference about “mediumship,” in which she delivers a message from someone on the afterlife to someone in the audience.

Johns, who is based in Bozeman, said the messages from beyond are great, and that she has found that people in the afterlife do not hold on to grudges.

She said she hoped to make “connections” on Saturday as the chateau, like many other buildings in Butte, is great for making connections with those not in this dimension.

“I think people are just curious, they just want to know,” Johns said, adding statistics show that 75% of Americans believe they have had some kind of encounter with a dead loved one.

“I don't generally run into skeptics in my work,” said Johns, whose grandmothers were also mediums.

Elies Adams, president and founder of Bozeman Paranormal Society, which has been around for about 13 years, said they like coming to Butte.

She said the conference was originally in Philipsburg, but they outgrew that location. She said they partnered with the Clark Chateau and moved it to Butte. Last year was the first year in town “and we had great success,” she said, adding nearly 60-70 people attended.

Bobby Brown of Baker talks Saturday at the Big Sky Paranormal Conference about investigating paranormal activity. 

“We decided it was very thriving in Butte and we decided to stay in Butte,” Adams said.

She said the conference could handle as many as 80 people.

“The more the merrier, but 80 is always a good number,” Adams said.

She said the growing numbers show that people have an interest in learning more about the paranormal, learning more about the unknown and learning more about passion of the paranormal.

When people ask her about paranormal activity in Montana she points out the state has a lot of history and a lot of ghost towns.

Adams said the event brings people together to find out more about the paranormal, but ""we want to make it where other paranormal enthusiasts learn from each other.”

“A lot of people are like me, they want to know more about the paranormal and other aspects of the paranormal,” she said.

She realizes some people are skeptical.

“They want a scientific answer to everything,” Adams said. “It isn't a bad thing, it just tells you they are trying to get answers and trying to figure out what is going on.”

By MICHAEL GINGOLD

The ghost hunters in this one are rumored to be cousins of the famed Ed and Lorraine Warren.

Black Mandala has released the trailer and poster for the Australian production NIGHTFALL: A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION. Directed by Myles McEwen and Ripley Stevens, who also co-star, from a script by McEwen, who served as cinematographer, it also features Selwyn G. Stevens, Selwyn R. Stevens, Lorenzo Marte and Bill McEwen. The synopsis: “The year is 1988. Paranormal investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth have built their careers confronting the unexplained across Northern Europe. But when a desperate call draws them to the isolated home of Elizabeth Blair, they encounter a presence unlike anything they have ever faced. Over the course of seven days, this force unravels their sanity, twists their perception of reality, and threatens to destroy their bond.

“This is no ordinary haunting. This is Case 13.”

Video posted on Truth Social touts CBD as a ‘gamechanger' and promotes Medicaid coverage of CBD products

Cannabis stocks are on a high after Donald Trump shared a video on Sunday promoting cannabis use for seniors and Medicaid coverage of CBD products.

The nearly three-minute-long video, posted on the president's Truth Social platform, touts the usage of hemp-derived CBD as a “gamechanger” that is a pain and stress reliever for seniors.

Stocks for cannabis companies, including Canopy Growth, Tilray and Cronos Group jumped Monday when stocks opened for the week. MSOS, an AdvisorShares Cannabis exchange-traded fund (ETF), also soared on Monday, after Trump posted the video.

The video was produced by the Commonwealth Project, a group promoting cannabis use for senior healthcare, and praised Trump for his 2018 farm bill that legalized industrial hemp.

“Now it's time to educate doctors … provide Medicare coverage for CBD and give millions of seniors the support they deserve,” the video said.

The cannabis industry has long hoped the White House would take further steps to decriminalize cannabis at a federal level.

Under Joe Biden's administration, the Department of Health and Human Services requested that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reclassify cannabis as a lower-risk substance. Marijuana is now classified as a Schedule I drug in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, which means it has no accepted medical use and has a high risk for abuse.

But the Trump administration had been silent about decriminalizing marijuana until August, when Trump told reporters that his administration is “looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks”.

“I've heard great things have to do with medical, and I've heard bad things having to do with just about everything else,” Trump said. “It's a very complicated subject.”

Currently, 40 states allow the use of medical cannabis products, and 24 states allow non-medical cannabis use.

Tilray led a rally by industry stocks in New York on Monday, surging by more than 40% in the wake of Trump's video.

Advocates for cannabis for medical use say legalizing marijuana at a federal level will allow for better investment into research and broaden access.

“While the DEA plans to reschedule cannabis, today it is still a Schedule I drug – a controlled Substances Act classification for the most dangerous drugs such as heroin and LSD,” the Commonwealth Project says on its website. “As a result, studying cannabis is challenging and not integrated into comprehensive medical care, depriving millions of Americans aged 65 and older of potential life-changing alternative therapies for medical ailments.”

But it's unclear where Terrance Cole, Trump's DEA administrator, stands on reclassifying cannabis. Advocates pointed out that upon Cole's appointment in July, he did not mention cannabis reclassification among his priorities, instead focusing on cracking down on fentanyl.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports the latest on the investigation into the suspect Nigel Max Edge. 

A weekend shooting that left three people dead and five others injured was ""highly premeditated"" and targeted a waterfront North Carolina restaurant, officials said.

The shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 27, at American Fish Company in Southport, a maritime town in the southeastern part of the state. The popular spot is known locally not only as a waterfront bar and restaurant, but also as a filming location for ""Safe Haven,"" the 2013 romantic thriller based on the Nicholas Sparks novel.

Investigators allege that 40-year-old Nigel Max Edge positioned himself in a white, center-console boat just off the restaurant's deck before opening fire. At the time, live music was playing, and patrons were gathered along the bar's waterfront area.

Authorities said chaos broke out as bullets struck people on the deck as patrons scrambled to safety. Edge, police said, sped away.

SUSPECT IN NC RESTAURANT SHOOTING IDENTIFIED, CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER 3 KILLED, AT LEAST 5 WOUNDED

""This was not random. It was highly premeditated,"" Police Chief Todd Coring said at a press briefing Sunday.

Edge, an Oak Island resident and military veteran, has not yet entered a plea. He appeared for his first court hearing Monday afternoon, logging in by video at 2 p.m. from the neighboring sheriff's office jail.

A judge denied bond, citing him as both a flight risk and a danger to the community. Edge is scheduled to return to court on Oct. 13 for a probable cause hearing. He requested a public defender.

Prosecutors said in court that Edge used a .300 Blackout Sig Sauer rifle outfitted with a suppressor and scope, and also had a .380 handgun tucked in his waistband when he was arrested. Some of the rifle ammunition was tipped for maximum ballistic impact, authorities noted.

Two deputies responded on a sheriff's department boat after the shooting, later spotting Edge as he walked to retrieve his boat trailer. Deputies moved in and apprehended him as he backed the trailer in to pull his vessel from the water.

Officials said the attack may have originally been planned for Friday. Witnesses, prosecutors said, saw Edge with his boat lights off that night before he suddenly fled when approached.

The police chief said that Edge said he has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Coring said that he ""self-identifies"" as a veteran. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment. 

""We understand this suspect identifies as a combat veteran. He self-identifies. Injured in the line of duty is what he's saying, he suffers from PTSD,"" Coring said.

In a 2024 federal lawsuit dismissed earlier this year, Edge made sweeping claims that included references to what he called ""a Hate Crime (LGBQT toward a straight man (me)) who was raised as a straight male for (LGBTQ) purposes in an illegal pedophile sex ring."" 

He also accused his parents of being ""LGBQT White Supremacist Pedophiles"" who falsified his birth certificate, drugged him and tried to profit from him, while tying his alleged mistreatment to the Iraq War, the Abu Ghraib scandal and the Jeffrey Epstein case.

On March 12, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina dismissed the case. Judge Louise W. Flanagan ruled that Edge failed to state any viable constitutional or tort claims, noting that his filings were filled with extraordinary accusations but lacked legal grounding. The case was formally closed with all counts dismissed.

ACTIVE SHOOTER REPORTED AT NORTH CAROLINA DOCKSIDE WITH RESTAURANTS AND BARS

District Attorney Jon David said Sunday ""a lot"" of the victims were on vacation and were not Southport locals. 

""Sadly, a lot of the victims in this case appear to be not members of our community, but people who are here on vacation,"" David said.

The filings also identify five victims by initials – JS, WP, JB, LB, and TL – tied to counts of attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. In addition to those victims, three others were fatally shot during the attack, though their names have not yet been publicly released.

In a statement, American Fish Company said that it, along with the neighboring Frying Pan restaurant, would be closed indefinitely.

""Our hearts are broken, and our prayers are with the victims, their families and everyone affected by this tragedy,"" they said. ""God bless Southport.""

In this article

OpenAI on Monday announced Instant Checkout, a new feature that allows users to buy products through its artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. 

Instant Checkout initially supports single-item purchases directly from U.S. Etsy sellers, and it's available to U.S. ChatGPT Plus, Pro and Free users. OpenAI said more than one million Shopify merchants, including Skims and Glossier, are coming soon. 

Shares of Etsy closed up nearly 16% on Monday. Shopify's stock closed up more than 6%.

OpenAI will take a fee from transactions that are completed through ChatGPT, which means Instant Checkout could become an important new revenue stream for the startup. OpenAI is not yet profitable, and is burning through cash as it works to scale up its computing infrastructure. 

The company declined to share specific details about how large the fees are since they are determined through confidential contracts with Etsy and Shopify. Instant Checkout is free to users and will not affect their prices, OpenAI said. 

""Our vision for ChatGPT — and a lot of the technology we create, but especially ChatGPT — is that it's not just providing you information, it is also helping you get things done in the real world,"" Michelle Fradin, OpenAI's product lead for ChatGPT commerce, told CNBC in an interview. 

The company plans to introduce multi-item carts and expand the regional availability of Instant Checkout moving forward. 

OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months and introduced product recommendations as part of its search experience in April. ChatGPT surfaces products from across the web, and the results are ranked by relevance to the user and not influenced by partnerships with OpenAI, Fradin said.

Following the launch of Instant Checkout, if users are browsing and come across a product from an Etsy seller, for instance, they'll be able to purchase that item directly through ChatGPT instead of clicking out to the merchant's site.

Instant Checkout is powered by OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol, which is the underlying technology that allows users to complete a transaction directly with a merchant through ChatGPT. OpenAI built the framework in partnership with the fintech company Stripe, which powers ChatGPT subscriptions.

""If you are already a subscriber, you're already using your card in ChatGPT, then when you go to buy something from Etsy, you don't have to redo that work,"" Fradin said.

OpenAI initially decided to use Agentic Commerce Protocol for e-commerce, but Fradin said the company thinks it could be used to facilitate other types of purchases or payments as well. OpenAI is open-sourcing the framework to help merchants build integrations more quickly, and so that developers can explore different use cases, she said. 

ChatGPT surpassed 700 million weekly active users in August, and Fradin said ""a huge portion"" of the questions people are asking are related to shopping and commerce in some capacity. The questions can be specific, such as asking for help finding a pair of black boots, or more broad, such as how to plan a birthday party for 12 kids.  

""What we wanted to do is make it even easier for users to complete their journey in ChatGPT, and for merchants and developers to convert those conversations into checkouts,"" Fradin said.

It's just a few short months until Disney returns to Zootopia once more, and after our last couple looks at the sequel have focused on smoothing over the cracks in Judy and Nick's relationship, this latest one actually tells us just what's going on in the film.

Today Disney released the final trailer for Zootopia 2, focusing on the plight of its mysterious new snake character, Gary De'Snake (played by Indiana Jones and Everything Everywhere icon Ke Huy Quan). Initially thinking they're on a case for the ZPD to prove that Zootopia's first fox and rabbit police officers can truly work together, the duo instead discover a conspiracy about Zootopia's lack of reptile civilians—leading them on an adventure out of the hustle and bustle of the city and across swamps, deserts, and more to bring the truth to light.

As well as actually just showing us what the film is about instead of largely focusing on a single scene like the last trailer did, this new look also sees the sequel trying for musical virality once more after Shakira's turn as the pop starlet Gazelle singing “Try Everything” in the original film. Now, she's back with “Zoo,” which we get to hear a bit of in this trailer. The new song, releasing ahead of the film on October 10, is produced and written by Ed Sheeran and Blake Slatkin, who will appear in the movie as a pair of sheep named—brace yourselves—Ed Shearin and Baalake Lambkin, respectively.

It definitely seems like Zootopia 2 is hoping lightning strikes twice when it comes to replicating the success of the original—we'll see if it succeeds when the sequel slithers into theaters November 26

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Intel aims at AMD's Threadripper with its new Granite Rapids-WS CPU — chip armed with core count approaching the flagship AMD Threadripper 9995WX, boasts a 4.8GHz boost clock","https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-aims-at-amds-threadripper-with-its-new-granite-rapids-ws-cpu-chip-armed-with-core-count-approaching-the-flagship-amd-threadripper-9995wx-boasts-a-4-8ghz-boost-clock","Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:47:59 GMT","

Granite Rapids-WS has the chance to outdo Threadripper 9000WX in core count, similar to what the architecture has done for Intel on the server side.



When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


It looks like Intel is getting ready to launch a new branch of Granite Rapids processors designed to compete directly with AMD's Ryzen 9000WX series parts based on Zen 5. Resident X poster Momomo_us found an openbenchmark.org listing featuring an 86-core CPU codenamed Granite Rapid-WS.

The only specs we have are the cores, threads, and clock speed, featuring the aforementioned 86 cores and 172 threads operating at up to 4.8GHz. But being based on the Granite Rapids architecture, it is very likely that this chip is a much higher clocking offshoot of the Xeon 6787P, which also boasts 86 cores across two compute tiles, but peaks at a 3.8GHz peak turbo clock speed.

At 86 cores, this new chip is approaching the core count of AMD's current Threadripper flagship, the 9995WX with 96 Zen 5 cores. This SKU might not even be the flagship part since Granite Rapids can scale up to 128 cores. Only time will tell if this is the case — to reach 128 cores, Intel has to use three compute dies, whereas with its 86-core Granite Rapid SKUs, it only needs to use two. Limiting Granite Rapids-WS to 86 cores has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs for Intel.

Rumors have been circulating about a workstation-offshoot of Granite Rapids for months. In February, we covered a Granite Rapids-W leak, allegedly stating these new workstation parts will come with up to 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes, feature eight-channel DDR5 memory support, and support Intel's outgoing W890 chipset.

Granite Rapids is Intel's latest generation server architecture, and one of its most competitive yet, featuring core count parity with AMD EYPC processors for the first time since 2017, when it launched in the Xeon 6900P series late last year. Similar to Arrow Lake-S, Granite Rapids is based on a tile-based architecture, featuring several I/O and compute tiles to reach previously untouchable core counts.

Intel hasn't had a serious CPU lineup that has been able to compete with AMD's Threadripper WX-series parts over the past two generations. Its outgoing W-3500 Sapphire Rapids Refresh chips only scale up to 60 cores, while AMD has had 96-core trims since the Threadripper 7000WX series and 64-core chips dating all the way back to the Threadripper 3000 series. With Granite Rapids-WS, Intel has its first opportunity in years to approach or outpace AMD on core count in the HEDT/workstation segment, similar to the server market.

The U.S. Women's National Team player pool had some big moments from the NWSL to abroad. 

Stateside, Trinity Rodman and the Washington Spirit clinched a playoff berth. Meanwhile, overseas Korbin Shrader came up huge for her new club OL Lyonnes against her old squad PSG. 

Let's rewind through the biggest USWNT moments over the last week:

The Washington Spirit became the second team in the NWSL to clinch a playoff spot in a 4-0 victory over the Houston Dash. Trinity Rodman contributed two assists to Gift Monday's hat trick. 

The Kansas City Current was the first squad to punch a postseason ticket, having already claimed the NWSL Shield with the best overall record. The Spirit ranks second, 16 points behind the Current and four points above the third-ranked Gotham FC. The Spirit made it to the title game in 2024 but fell to the Orlando Pride. 

Korbin Shrader shined in OL Lyonnes 6-1 win over PSG. Shader recorded a hat trick along with an assist to fellow USWNT player Lindsey Heaps. Heaps got on the scoreboard in the 58th minute with a header off a curling pass from Shrader. 

Then, Shrader scored three goals in 15 minutes in the 70th, 74th and 85th minutes. It marked the first hat trick of the 21-year-old's career. Shrader transferred from PSG in the summer, and in her second match and first start with her new club, she came up big. 

Two USWNT talents created magic in Gotham FC's 3-0 victory over the Portland Thorns. Rose Lavelle scored in the 43rd minute. It was her third goal of the season after she returned from injury in late June. USWNT midfielder Jaedyn Shaw flipped a one-touch pass to a Lavelle cutting up field, and the Cincinnati native netted a left-footed shot past the Thorns goalkeeper's outstretched reach.

The World Cup champion Lavelle and the young talent Shaw became NWSL teammates when Shaw transferred from the North Carolina Courage earlier this month. In four matches, Shaw has contributed a goal and an assist. Now, the two stars continue to gear up for a playoff run as Gotham holds onto the No. 3 spot in the league. 

Alyssa Thompson transferred to Chelsea FC in the Women's Super League from Angel City FC earlier this month. After recovering from an arm injury, the winger made her debut off the bench on Sept. 14. Thompson made her first start in the 4-0 win over West Ham on Sunday. She played 60 minutes after two 45-minute appearances as a substitute.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

It was another standout week for U.S. Men's National Team players on their club sides. 

From Christian Pulisic staying red hot with a goal and assist to keep AC Milan near the top of Serie A to Alex Zendejas powering Club América with three goals in two matches in Liga MX, the USMNT player pool continued to deliver strong performances across the globe. 

Let's take a closer look at the top USMNT highlights from the week:

The USMNT's leading scorer amongst active players, Christian Pulisic has been on a brilliant scoring streak for his club AC Milan. Pulisic has recorded six goals — two of which he scored in Coppa Italia — and two assists in seven total appearances early this season across all competitions. He leads Serie A in goal contributions with six. 

Most recently in the 2-1 win over Napoli, Pulisic racked up a goal and an assist. First, he assisted Alexis Saelemaekers in the third minute of the match after creating space with a great run to get past a defender. He escaped a tackle before finding Saelemaekers in stride on the right side. His score came in the 31st minute with a strike off a short pass from teammate Youssouf Fofana. 

Since returning from USMNT September camp, Alex Zendejas has put up productive performances for Club América. He has scored four goals, three of which he netted in the last week. Zendejas bagged a brace Sunday in a 4-1 victory over Pumas and recorded another a few days prior on Sept. 25 in the Liga MX Apertura Round 10 when he scored the game-winning goal in the 89th minute. 

Zendejas recorded the two goals Sunday in a 10-minute span, scoring the first goal in the 73rd minute with a high-arching golazo from the top of the box far above legendary Pumas goalkeeper Keylor Navas' reach. He capped off the brace with a penalty kick from the spot. Overall, this season he's tallied six goals and three assists in 19 matches across all competitions.

Tanner Tessmann netted his first goal of the early Ligue 1 season last week with Lyon, and he followed it up by scoring another in the Europa League in a 1-0 win against the Eredivisie side, FC Utrecht.

Tessmann launched a right-footed shot from outside the box in the 75th minute to call the game. Teammate Rachid Ghezzal kept alive a loose cross and teed up Tessmann with the short pass, which he slammed home. It marked Tessmann's tenth goal in the UEFA competition.

Alex Freeman delivered in a dramatic 1-1 finish in the Orlando City vs. FC Cincinnati matchup on Sunday Night Soccer. With Orlando down a goal past the 90-minute mark, the referees added seven minutes of stoppage time on the clock. It was just enough time for Freeman, who headed home a score off a cross from teammate Tyrese Spicer in the 90+6th minute.

The goal marked Freeman's sixth of the MLS season, underscoring a breakout campaign where the defender also added five assists and was selected for his first MLS All-Star game. Freeman earned his side a valuable point against No. 2-ranked Cincinnati as City clinched a playoff spot.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

GOAL reviews the major takeaways from Americans playing in Europe, including Pulisic's continued dominance

There's no slowing Christian Pulisic right now, and we're running out of superlatives for the American star. Simply put, he's a man in form.

Pulisic was once again the headliner in this weekend's slate of Americans Abroad, as the AC Milan star added a goal and an assist to his recent tally. With that, he's up to four goals and two assists in just four Serie A matches. Make no mistake about it: the U.S. men's national team star has been the league's best player to start this 2025-26 season.

He wasn't the only one with an assist this weekend, which turned out to be a fairly productive one for the USMNT stars in Europe. Gladbach's Joe Scally put on a show in the weekend's most chaotic game. Patrick Agyemang added another helper to his tally, too. And then there was Brenden Aaronson, who set up a goal, too, to silence some of the critics over in Leeds.

With USMNT camp looming, several Americans stepped up as the European season really gets into full swing heading into October.

EXCLUSIVE: Lisa, the internationally recognized Thai rapper, singer, dancer and actor born Lalisa Manobal, has signed with WME for representation in her acting endeavors as she continues to build out a career in film and television.


	This comes following her breakout debut turn as Mook, the wellness professional love interest of Tayme Thapthimthong's non-violent Buddhist security guard Gaitok, in the recent Thailand-set season of HBO's hit series The White Lotus. Released in February, the show's third season earned 23 Emmy nominations, including in the category of Outstanding Drama Series.

	Lisa launched her own management company, LLOUD Co., in 2024, in an effort to create a platform to showcase her overall vision in music and entertainment. Her first solo single, released in a partnership between LLOUD Co. and RCA Records, was “Rockstar,” produced by Ryan Tedder and Sam Homaee. She then joined forces with Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Rosalía to release her second single, “New Woman,” followed by her third single, “Moonlit Floor.” She released her debut solo album, Alter Ego, on February 28, seeing it debut at number seven on the Billboard 200 chart and also debut at number one on the Billboard Top Album Sales chart. The artist made her Coachella debut in April.


	Also a prominent force in the global fashion industry, Lisa currently serves as an ambassador for Bulgari and Louis Vuitton.
