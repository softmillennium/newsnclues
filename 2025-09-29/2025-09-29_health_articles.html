                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Resuscitation Care Units (RCUs) provide intensive, comprehensive and immediate medical care for critically ill patients with life-threatening conditions, such as cardiac arrest, requiring specialized monitoring and rapid intervention from a multidisciplinary team. Many studies have shown that creating these special high-acuity areas in an emergency department, can save lives and improve patient outcomes. However, questions about financial sustainability have slowed adoption of these units. A new study by researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and UMass Chan Medical School has found these dedicated units not only benefitted patients, but resulted in improved efficiency, documentation and reimbursement costs for the hospital. "For patients, RCUs mean that the sickest people in the emergency department receive faster, more focused care from specially trained teams. For the health system, it means this approach can pay for itself, because the billing better matches the real work being done; which makes it more likely that hospitals will be willing to adopt these units, which in turn can improve emergency care for everyone," explains corresponding author Michael Sherman, MD, MA, FACEP, assistant professor of emergency medicine & critical care medicine at the school. The researchers performed a retrospective review of approximately 75,000 emergency visits at According to the researchers, RCU's are known to decrease the need for ICU admission, shorten hospital and intensive care unit stays and cut direct costs by preventing illness from worsening. "By centralizing care for the sickest patients, RCUs help doctors and nurses deliver antibiotics, fluids and other lifesaving treatments faster, while freeing ICU beds for patients who need longer-term care," adds Sherman who also is an emergency & critical care physician at Boston Medical Center. "It shows that small changes in workflow (like staffing ratios and dedicated space) can have a big impact without building a whole new department or building," says Sherman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California nurses with doctorates do not have the right to call themselves doctors, a federal court ruled, upholding a state law that regulates what titles health professionals can use in advertisements. The use of “Dr” by nonphysicians in clinical settings is “inherently misleading” commercial speech and is not protected by the First Amendment, District Judge Jesus G. Bernal wrote in his ruling. “Instead of reining in the state's power to censor professionals who accurately describe their credentials, the decision emboldens it,” Matias said in an email to Medscape Medical News. “The First Amendment does not allow the government to silence truthful speech simply because some listeners may be confused — especially when disclosure can address any concerns short of a total ban.”The defendants in the case, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and California Medical Board President Kristina Lawson, did not return messages seeking comment. “This decision protects patients by providing clarity and transparency about the level of training and education of the person providing their care,” CMA President Shannon Udovic-Constant, MD, said in a statement. Before learning about the law, plaintiff Jacqueline Palmer testified she introduced herself to patients as “Dr” but always added she was a nurse practitioner. A third plaintiff intended to use the title when he opened his esthetics clinic but put the opening and its website on hold after he learned about the law, according to court documents. They argued their use of “Dr” is not misleading and that the state law “regulates more extensively than necessary.” In his ruling, Bernal wrote the harms cited by the state over DNPs calling themselves doctors are “real” and that evidence shows such titles by DNPs can confuse patients. “The Court finds that it is reasonable to infer that some consumers will assume that plaintiffs are licensed physicians or surgeons if they use ‘Dr' or ‘doctor' in healthcare settings and in advertising materials promoting medical services, even if plaintiffs also identify themselves as DNPs,” Bernal wrote. The nurses have an economic motive for engaging in this kind of speech, which is “to solicit and retain a patient base and improve their professional brand,” Bernal said. The American Nurses Association did not return messages seeking comment. Brown, RN, JD, Indianapolis-based attorney who represents nurses and health providers, said she was surprised by the ruling. If a nurse obtains a DNP, it's reasonable that they should be able to refer to themselves as “Dr,” she said, adding that other professionals with doctorates do not face the same scrutiny. “So, I guess Dr Jill Biden can still use her [EdD] title, but yet nurses who have the same level of degree can't use the title, I think that's unfair. All of your hard work and education, you can't even use the title that you earn, at least in California.”Brown said the ruling could have broader implications outside of California, including other courts citing the ruling when title disagreements arise among nurses and physicians. The ruling could also lead to other states enacting similar statutes, she said, adding that California is often seen as a leader in legislation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that reducing air pollution not only improves children's eyesight but could also play a crucial role in tackling the soaring rates of myopia worldwide. Study: Benefits of clean air for school children's vision health. A recent PNAS Nexus study used a large sample of school-aged children to investigate the potential benefits of cleaner air for vision and to identify the primary factors influencing visual acuity. Myopia or short-sightedness has become a significant global public health concern, with prevalence rates reaching 80-90% in school-leavers in East Asia. Well-known risk factors of myopia include intensive screen use, having myopic parents, and other behavioral habits that lower exposure to natural light. Recent research has shown that children in regions with worse air quality are more likely to have poorer visual health. Air pollution may increase oxidative stress and exacerbate ocular surface inflammation. This suggests that myopia risk may be increased with chronic pollution exposure. However, the direct evidence linking cleaner air and better visual acuity is limited, and the problem is being able to satisfactorily account for confounding influences from other factors that also affect vision. Traditional regression models like logistic or linear regression have difficulty making sense of the complex patterns in large health datasets. This problem is solved by automated machine learning (AutoML), which does not require any prior specification of the relationships between variables and can automatically model nonlinear influences and interactions. This study used an explainable AutoML framework to identify the primary drivers of childhood myopia, evaluate age- and severity-specific variations in risk factor profiles, and quantify the benefits of cleaner air. The sample comprised approximately 30,000 primary, middle, and high school students from Tianjin, China, recruited from March 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023, in Tianjin, China. School nurses or trained healthcare professionals conducted myopia screening. Each eye's uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was measured at 5m, and noncycloplegic autorefractions were also used to determine spherical equivalent refraction, which was part of the myopia diagnosis. Approximately 11.0% of all students slept with lights on, and there was heterogeneity in sleep duration by grade. Parental myopia prevalence was 64.5% with one myopic parent. About 79% of the students consumed 4–6 grams of salt per day, and about 82% consumed desserts ≤3 times per week. Thirty machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict UCVA in the given sample, including parental myopia, school type, nighttime light, NO₂ levels, and PM₂.₅ levels, in order of importance. Attendance at primary school was generally associated with higher UCVA, whereas middle and high school attendance was associated with negative UCVA outcomes. Similarly, coherent patterns were seen for environmental factors. Greener surroundings were linked to better UCVA; conversely, poorer UCVA was seen in areas with heavier pollution. A key point is that the factors influencing myopia often interact, sometimes offsetting and sometimes amplifying individual impacts. Studying a single factor in isolation can misrepresent its true weight. Other important contributors included sex, sleep duration, homework burden, and sports participation, highlighting that daily behaviors also shaped UCVA outcomes. On average, primary school children exhibited better vision than senior students. Demographic/genetic influences explained about 81.0% of the total UCVA variation among children with high myopia. In children with less severe myopia, about 12% and 14% of UCVA variation were explained by environmental factors and behavioral habits, respectively. A trend was noted whereby high myopia prevalence increased with age. NO2 was a more influential predictor in less severe myopia. These findings suggest that demographic factors are most important in high myopia, while differences in pollution exposure have a stronger impact on less severe myopia. Primary school students benefited the most, with their average UCVA improving by about 0.09 units, roughly double the overall population average; hence, younger students would benefit more from cleaner air. This study uses an explainable machine learning tool to demonstrate the significant association between air pollution and decreased UCVA, particularly among younger school-age participants. This implies that expanding green spaces, enhancing air quality around schools, and fostering healthy lifestyle practices may safeguard children's visual health. The authors highlight practical intervention strategies to reduce daily exposure, such as air purifiers in classrooms and establishing clean-air zones near schools. This study's findings were limited by using self-reported data on lifestyle habits, which can introduce bias. Ambient air quality was used as a proxy for individual exposure; however, indoor exposures can be very challenging to measure accurately. Future research could conduct more in-depth causal analysis to assess the effectiveness of targeted strategies in managing myopia risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals just how much greener plant-based kibble is compared to meat-based dog food, from saving football fields of farmland to the carbon cost of long-haul flights. Study: Environmental impact of feeding plant-based vs. meat-based dry dog foods in the United Kingdom. Dry dog foods in the United Kingdom may be classified as plant-based or animal-based. A recent paper in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems breaks down, for the first time, the environmental costs of each type of dog food. Plant-based foods have multiple health and environmental benefits when used as a main or sole part of the diet. Compared with animal-based foods, they generate far fewer greenhouse gases, cause less deforestation, and put less strain on soil fertility and biodiversity. In 2018, the global dog population was about 471 million. While dogs are natural omnivores, meat-heavy diets drive significant greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, making up an estimated 2.5% to 8% of China's total emissions. Prior research suggests that pet food production uses up 41 to 58 million hectares of farmland, or twice as much land as the entire area of the UK. Most of this comes from animal-based pet food manufacturing. According to human food supply chain statistics, plant protein production requires much less resource than animal meat production, but direct comparisons for pet food in the UK are lacking. In each case, lifecycle assessments were carried out, which are systematic assessments of the impact of each stage of the manufactured product's life on the environment, from raw material extraction through processing, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste disposal. Plant- and animal-based pet foods had similar proportions of protein, fat, and fiber, except for veterinary food, which had less protein but more fat, by design, as these were all renal diets. Other grains, raw chicken meat, meat and bone meal, pea, potato, and textured vegetable protein were relatively common. Plant-based diets were the most environmentally friendly for all types of dog food. Poultry-based and veterinary diets ranked next in sustainability, while red meat, unsurprisingly, placed the heaviest burden on the environment. For plant-based diets, land use was below 3 square meters per 1,000 kcal, similar to poultry. Veterinary diets were a little higher at ~13 square meters. In contrast, lamb- and beef-based dog food used over 100 square meters of land per 1,000 kcal. Lamb meals required ~93 square meters per 1,000 kcal, meat and bone meal was 47 square meters, and beef liver approximately half of that. Plant-based foods included mainly soy, at 1.7-1.8 square meters per 1,000 kcal, depending on the formulation. Similar trends were seen with greenhouse gas production, where plant-based, poultry-based, and veterinary foods had comparably low emissions. Lamb produced ~4.6 times and beef ~11 times higher emissions than plant-based foods at ~13 and 32 kg CO2eq, respectively, vs ~2.8 kg CO2eq for plant-based foods. The same picture was obtained with acidifying and eutrophying emissions. Lamb-based dog food used the most freshwater (irrigation, livestock production, industrial use) at ~684 L/1,000 kcal, while beef used ~575 L/1,000 kcal. Overall, a Labrador retriever, eating about 280g of food a day, would use up approximately 350,000 square meters of land (about 52-57 football fields) if fed on lamb- or beef-based food for the nine years of its adult life, vs 1.4 and 2.7 football fields with plant-based or veterinary foods, respectively. The greenhouse gas emissions would correspond to those of a Boeing 747 passenger taking 2.8 round-trips between New York and London, for a plant-based diet. With a veterinary or poultry-based diet, it would be nearer about five round-trips, soaring to 31 with lamb-based foods. For multiple reasons, feeding dogs on animal byproducts did not make animal-based pet foods more sustainable. “Higher inclusion of plant-based ingredients in pet feed provides a major opportunity for pet food companies to mitigate the environmental footprint of companion animal food.” They also highlight that while poultry and veterinary foods had a lower impact than beef or lamb, in some measures, their impacts overlapped with plant-based diets, meaning they were not always significantly different. Nonetheless, they remain substantially less sustainable than plant-based alternatives. Using animal by-products does not close the sustainability gap, and circular food system approaches may be needed to reduce the sector's overall impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real-time monitoring of key biomarkers is a critical prerequisite for early disease diagnosis and personalized therapy. However, conventional methods, including electrochemical, colorimetric, and fluorescence-based assays, often suffer from operational complexity, high cost, and limited sensitivity, making them inadequate for "rapid, real-time, and low-cost" detection needs in clinical intraoperative monitoring or home-based health management. Therefore, the development of a novel, convenient, and highly sensitive ALT detection strategy holds significant clinical value and application potential. Recently, the research team led by Prof. Hanyang Li at Harbin Engineering University has integrated functionalized liquid crystal (LC) microcavities with whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) laser technology to establish a novel real-time biosensing platform (Figure 1), enabling highly sensitive detection of ALT. Leveraging its pH-responsive properties, the system can generate a pronounced optical response to pH variations induced by the ALT-catalyzed enzymatic reaction. These pH changes alter interfacial anchoring conditions, driving reversible transitions of LC molecules between radial and bipolar configurations. This mechanism allows for real-time, label-free optical sensing of ALT enzymatic activity. The normal reference range for ALT is typically 0-40 U/L, with critical thresholds at 40, 80, and 200 U/L being particularly relevant for early liver injury diagnosis. Based on both the reaction completion time and spectral peak dynamics, the platform enables graded evaluation of mild (40-80 U/L), moderate (80-200 U/L), and severe (>200 U/L) liver injury, providing a quantitative framework for more refined liver function assessment. To further validate the clinical applicability of the proposed ALT biosensing approach, in vivo tests were conducted using mouse serum. The results showed excellent agreement with commercial ALT assay kits, further demonstrating the platform's practicality and potential for clinical translation. Wang, J., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first detailed analysis of unplanned births that occurred outside the hospital setting in Austria has shown that, although such deliveries are rare, they pose challenges for emergency teams that attend, especially if babies are born prematurely. In a study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress today (Monday), the researchers found that between 2017 and 2024 there were 173 unplanned, out-of-hospital births in the Styria region of Austria, of which 16 (9%) were premature (less than 37 weeks' gestation). We concluded that standardised emergency protocols and early involvement of specialised neonatal transport teams are crucial for improving outcomes. Although these scenarios are rare, emergency teams must be adequately trained and prepared to handle them. Furthermore, appropriate equipment for treating newborns, particularly premature or critically ill neonates, should be available on all emergency vehicles." "We also plan to use these findings to improve training for emergency personnel and to recommend what neonatal emergency equipment should be made available and standardised on all Austrian emergency vehicles, ensuring consistent care nationwide." Ms Leonhartsberger decided to research this topic after she attended an out-of-hospital birth as a paramedic during her first year of training. "I was unprepared for the situation, but fortunately, everything went well," she said. "This led me to study pre-hospital deliveries of premature infants, aiming to explore how emergency teams can be better prepared for such high-risk situations and improve outcomes for these vulnerable patients." Among the four babies that died, no resuscitation was attempted in two. One premature baby underwent successful pre-hospital resuscitation and intubation. Of the 12 surviving preterm infants, one required initial bag-mask ventilation and subsequent nasotracheal intubation by a neonatal intensive care team, and another received oxygen via face mask. Ms Leonhartsberger said: "Admission temperature is a key prognostic factor, yet this was not documented for all the babies, and when it was, the babies were often found to be hypothermic. "Our findings underscore the need for national preparedness, not only through standardised protocols but also through ongoing training and appropriate equipment on all emergency vehicles. They also highlight the importance of public awareness, reinforcing that, while planned home births may be safe under ideal conditions, complications can arise quickly and unpredictably. This is why the researchers now plan to analyse data in other regions. Dr Felix Lorang is a member of the EUSEM abstract selection committee. He said: "Premature deliveries always require careful medical supervision in hospital and will be performed by a highly trained and diverse team of experienced professionals to reduce any serious risk to both mother and baby. When these premature births take place out of the hospital setting in the unprepared environment of a household or an ambulance with a smaller team they present an even more significant challenge. Even though they are rare, they require preparation and the training that is part of the so-called HALO procedures: High-Acuity Low Occurrence. In this highly stressful setting, unfortunately only six out of the 13 babies admitted to hospital had their temperatures recorded, despite the importance of this intervention. It is crucial to identify the incidence and management of premature, unplanned, out-of-hospital deliveries, not just in other areas of Austria but also in other countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may suffer worse symptoms if they live in areas with higher levels of air pollution, according to a multi-national study presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Not only does this cause excessive sleepiness, but it can also increase the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. OSA is very common, but many people do not realize they have the condition. He told the Congress: "We know that OSA is more common in people who are older or overweight, but there's growing concern that air pollution also might make the condition worse. However, previous studies, mostly focused on just one country, have produced mixed results. We wanted to look at this on a larger scale, across several European cities, to better understand if and how air pollution affects OSA." The study included data on 19,325 patients with OSA from 25 different cities in 14 countries [2]. All patients are taking part in a larger research project called the European Sleep Apnoea Database. Researchers combined this patient data with records of PM10 concentration in the air where each patient lives, taken from the Europe-wide Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. The analysis revealed that, overall, for every one unit increase in PM10, there was a modest but measurable increase in the patients' apnea hypopnea index (AHI). For example, among patients with low AHI (less than five) the average PM10 in the area where they live was relatively low (around 16 micrograms per cubic meter of air). We confirmed a statistically significant positive association between average long-term exposure to air pollution, specifically fine particles known as PM10, and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. Even after we took account for other factors that we know have an effect on OSA, we still found an average increase in the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep of 0.41 for every one unit increase in PM10. This effect may seem small for an individual, but across entire populations it can shift many people into higher-severity categories, making it meaningful from a public health perspective." These regional differences might be due to things like local climate, the type of pollution or even how healthcare systems detect OSA." The researchers say they want to understand why the effects vary between cities and whether some people are more affected by pollution than others. They also hope to explore whether reducing pollution can improve sleep apnea symptoms. People who have OSA may know that they snore or wake up often in the night, and they may also feel sleepy during the day. There are also serious health risks associated with this condition. For people with OSA, especially those living in cities with high levels of air pollution, this study is important as it suggests pollution could be making their condition worse. This study strengthens the connection between environmental health and sleep medicine. It reminds us that tackling air pollution isn't just good for the planet, it's also vital for our lungs and our sleep quality too."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hypnosis can significantly improve patients' tolerance of masks to help them breathe when they are suffering from acute respiratory failure, according to a pilot study presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress today (Monday). People who come to hospital with breathing problems are often given non-invasive ventilation (NIV) via a mask and tubes connected to a machine in order increase the amount of oxygen in their blood and lower carbon dioxide levels. However, some patients are unable to tolerate a tight-fitting mask over their mouth and nose and have to be sedated or given anti-anxiety medication. Dr Tobi Hamza, a resident emergency medicine doctor at the Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital (HMIMV) in Rabat, Morocco, told the Congress: "We decided to conduct this study in response to the significant anxiety, discomfort, and poor tolerance often observed in patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation, particularly those with acute respiratory distress. Given the increasing interest in non-pharmacological techniques to improve patient comfort and compliance, we wanted to explore whether medical hypnosis could improve NIV tolerance and outcomes." There are a number of causes, including heart failure, lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia, infections and injuries to the chest or ribs. Between December 2023 and May 2024, Dr Hamza and colleagues recruited 20 patients who came into the HMIMV emergency department with acute respiratory distress to a prospective pilot study. They randomised them into two groups: ten patients received the standard care of NIV and anti-anxiety medication if needed – the control group; a further ten patients received a hypnosis session and NIV. A doctor trained in medical hypnosis conducted all the sessions." Dr. Tobi Hamza, Resident Emergency Medicine Doctor, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital (HMIMV) The researchers assessed how well the patients tolerated the masks using a comfort score with a scale from 0 to 10, by assessing changes in oxygen, carbon dioxide and acidity levels (pH) in the arterial blood after one and four hours, any requirement for sedation and anti-anxiety medication, and whether or not NIV had to be discontinued [2]. "Eight out of ten patients, 80%, in the hypnosis group successfully completed non-invasive ventilation sessions without requiring sedation or switching to invasive ventilation, compared to only five out of ten, 50%, in the control group. For clinicians it offers a low-cost, non-invasive, drug-free adjunct to support respiratory care." "To our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective studies evaluating hypnosis as a supportive technique during NIV in emergency settings. While hypnosis has been explored in pain, procedural anxiety and chronic disease management, its application in acute respiratory distress with NIV is still very novel. Although it was a small study, the findings suggest a substantial clinical benefit and we are conducting a larger, multi-centre study to validate our findings and explore the long-term impact of hypnosis on outcomes, such as hospital stay, intubation rate and mortality," he concluded. Limitations include that it was a single-centre study, it was difficult to obtain consent for hypnosis, especially when it would jeopardise immediate vital prognoses or patients were confused, and patients were excluded from the study if they presented as an extreme emergency; a doctor trained in hypnosis administered it to patients, which might limit the generalisability of the findings until more staff are trained in the technique; and the doctors and patients were not 'blinded' to which patients received which treatment. Dr Felix Lorang is a member of the EUSEM abstract selection committee. He said: "We do know that in the setting of non-invasive ventilation, verbal guidance is of utmost importance to ensure therapy adherence, especially in emergency settings. Hypnosis is a step further in intensifying the interaction, and this study suggests that hypnosis not only can help patients to tolerate non-invasive ventilation more easily and make them comfortable, but also can improve the clinical efficacy of the ventilation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Serine serves as a metabolic nexus in tumors, coordinating one-carbon metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, and redox regulation. In recent years, targeting the serine metabolic pathway, particularly the rate-limiting enzyme PHGDH, has attracted considerable attention as a promising anticancer strategy. Nevertheless, tumor cells preserve serine homeostasis through the coordinated regulation of endogenous synthesis and exogenous uptake, which often limits the efficacy of single-enzyme inhibition approaches. Notably, the function of serine transporters (SerTs) is intimately linked to their nanoscale spatial organization on the plasma membrane. However, owing to the lack of highly specific probes and ultra-resolution imaging techniques, the mechanisms underlying their assembly and functional relevance remain largely unexplored.Researchers from Wuhan University of Science and Technology and the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences have jointly published a paper in Research entitled "Mechanistic Insight into Serine Flux Regulation through Nanoscale Organization of Glucose and Serine Transporters by Substrate Probe-based dSTORM Imaging." This chemical probe not only exhibits high binding specificity and a one-to-one binding ratio with serine transporters (SerTs), but also possesses an extremely small molecular size. Compared with traditional biological probes such as antibodies, it offers significant advantages in terms of compactness, enabling highly efficient labeling of densely distributed target proteins on the cell surface. Leveraging the superior labeling performance of this probe combined with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), the researchers achieved super-resolution imaging and quantitative analysis of multiple serine transporters (SerTs). Through precise chemical modification of the serine molecule, the research team preserved its transporter-binding moiety and conjugated it with a fluorophore, thereby successfully synthesizing Ser-probe. Competitive experiment demonstrated that its binding can be completely inhibited by free serine, which confirms its ability to specifically label SerTs under physiological conditions. The development of this probe provides a novel tool for super-resolution imaging of membrane transporters.Using dSTORM imaging, it was observed that from normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) to low-malignant MCF7 cells and highly malignant MDA-MB-231 cells, the point density on the cell membrane, average cluster area, and cluster coverage of SerTs all increased significantly. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the average cluster area of SerTs reached twice that of MCF10A cells, and the cluster coverage increased by 4.6-fold. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that cells with stronger SerT clustering exhibited higher uptake capacity of fluorescently labeled serine, indicating a positive correlation between the clustering tendency of these transporters and their transport function. By employing dual-color dSTORM imaging, the study revealed significant colocalization of SerTs with glucose transporters (GluTs) on the plasma membrane, which was particularly pronounced in MCF7 cells with high PHGDH expression. These findings suggest that cells with strong endogenous serine synthesis capacity are more prefer to forming SerT/GluT functional microdomains, thereby coordinately regulating glucose uptake and serine metabolism.Cholesterol depletion (MβCD treatment) or glycosidase digestion (PNGase F treatment) significantly disrupted the clustered assembly and colocalization of SerTs and GluTs, indicating that lipid raft microdomains and glycoprotein cross-linking networks constitute the physical basis for maintaining the stability of these transporter nanoclusters. The PHGDH inhibitor CBR-5884 induced enhanced clustering at low concentrations, whereas at high concentrations its cytotoxic effects led to cluster disassembly. Combined interventions (inhibitor in combination with low glucose or free sialic acid) synergistically disrupted the protein cluster structures and significantly enhanced the anticancer effect.
