                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Individuals with multiple long-term conditions are two and a half times more likely to die following COVID-19 infection than others. When children were assessed separately the risk for mortality among those with multiple long-term conditions increased to almost three times (2.8) the risk of those without. The authors are calling for patients with multiple long-term conditions to be prioritised in healthcare policies. This systematic review is believed to have considered the largest ever cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a study investigating the impact of multiple long-term conditions. The review synthesised evidence from 111 observational studies of patients with confirmed COVID-19 published between January 2020 and May 2023. These studies were conducted across 51 countries and most involved high risk or hospitalized patient cohorts with COVID-19, which could account for the high rates of mortality found in the study. While previous research has identified risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease - such as older age, male sex, socioeconomic deprivation, being from an ethnic minority background and having a pre-existing condition - there has been limited research into, or reporting of, the outcomes for patients with multiple long-term conditions. The authors say this should be a matter of growing concern as a third of adults globally - and more than a quarter in England - have two or more long-term health conditions. This major review found that following COVID-19 infection, and relative to people with a single or no long-term condition, patients with multiple long-term conditions have: "Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that there is a significantly higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes for people living with multiple long-term conditions, compared with those without. Furthermore, relative to those without pre-existing long-term conditions, children and young people with multiple long-term conditions experienced more adverse COVID-19 outcomes. This may suggest that increased vulnerabilities could be associated more with the extremes of age rather than simply older age, as has been previously reported. "We hope that health policies will prioritise people with multiple long-term conditions, especially in times of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multicenter Phase II clinical trial led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center demonstrated significant tumor shrinkage and disease control in patients with advanced pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), two rare and potentially life-threatening neuroendocrine tumors. The results of this study, led by Camilo Jimenez, M.D., professor of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented concurrently at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress (Abstract 1705O). The trial demonstrated that the HIF-2α inhibitor belzutifan showed meaningful antitumor activity with a 26% objective response rate, a significant achievement particularly for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers. These effects lasted an average of more than 20 months, indicating a sustained clinical benefit for those who responded to treatment. It's notable that nearly one-third of patients (32%) who were taking blood pressure medication were able to reduce their dosage by half for at least six months. This is an important finding, as PPGL tumors often produce excess hormones that raise blood pressure. These results suggest that belzutifan may have also helped manage symptoms related to hormone-secreting tumors. The primary significance of this study is demonstrating that HIF-2α inhibition with belzutifan can achieve meaningful clinical benefit in patients with advanced, progressive PPGL. Camilo Jimenez, M.D., Professor of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders HIF-2α inhibitors, such as belzutifan, have been successful in shrinking tumors and slowing disease progression in other cancers driven by HIF-2α overactivity, such as kidney cancer and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Building on this knowledge, researchers evaluated the effectiveness of these inhibitors in patients with advanced PPGL. On the LITESPARK-015 Phase II trial, 72 patients with locally advanced, metastatic, unresectable PPGL who had exhausted all other standard-of-care treatment, were treated with belzutifan. Belzutifan is the first oral and only approved therapy for this disease, making it a new standard of care for this patient population. As an oral treatment, it has been shown to shrink tumors, reduce symptoms, and improve quality of life with low toxicity. It represents a meaningful step forward in care for people living with these rare cancers," Jimenez said. 2021 - FDA approves belzutifan for adults with von Hippel‑Lindau (VHL) disease who require treatment for associated tumors (RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors), when surgery is not immediately necessary Wyatt Technology's DynaPro Plate Reader 4 integrates advanced light scattering techniques, optimizing workflows in biotherapeutic and nanoparticle research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Results from a trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center showed that a targeted therapy combination improved outcomes for patients with metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) – a type of kidney cancer – whose disease progressed following immunotherapy. Data from the LenCabo Phase II trial were presented today by Andrew W. Hahn, M.D., assistant professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2025 (Abstract LBA94). The randomized study found that patients whose disease got worse after immunotherapy and who were treated with the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus lived longer without disease progression compared to those who received cabozantinib. "This is the first randomized trial to directly compare these two commonly used second-line treatments," Hahn said. "These findings offer insights into treatment sequencing and the importance of generating head-to-head data to guide clinical decisions." Those treated with lenvatinib plus everolimus had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 15.7 months compared to 10.2 months for those receiving cabozantinib. This trial was designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of second-line therapies to identify the regimen that provides longer PFS and improved patient outcomes. The findings suggest that lenvatinib plus everolimus may offer a more meaningful benefit as second-line treatment and may guide future treatment selection for patients in need.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a landmark moment at the ESMO Congress 2025, pivotal studies have unveiled compelling evidence that a new class of anti-cancer agents-antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)-can dramatically improve outcomes for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. The results from the phase III DESTINY-Breast05 and DESTINY-Breast11 trials, presented in a Presidential Symposium, mark a paradigm shift in breast cancer treatment, positioning ADCs not only as powerful therapeutic agents when the disease has already progressed but also as potential new standards of care in patients with early disease. There is a particular need for therapies to ensure patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer achieve pathological complete response following neoadjuvant therapies-i.e., delivered before surgery-, and a high unmet need to treat residual disease in those who do not, to prevent the development of metastasis." Dr. Evandro de Azambuja from the Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium Currently, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is the only ADC approved for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who show residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant therapy and are at a high risk of recurrence. In the DESTINY-Breast05, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a new-generation ADC delivering a topoisomerase I inhibitor, showed to improve invasive disease-free survival and disease-free survival by 53% compared with T-DM1 (for both: hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34–0.66; p<0.0001). The cycles of T-DXd, sequenced with THP, led to a significant increase in the rate of pathological complete response at surgery (67.3% versus 56.3%; p=0.003). "In conjunction, these two studies establish T-DXd as a critical treatment option for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, ultimately providing a new tool for treatment tailoring for what was once considered the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and which today represents the one with the highest chance of cure," highlights Dr Paolo Tarantino from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. However, their use presents new challenges that need to be addressed. toxicity profiles must be carefully defined and substantial effort to prevent permanent or fatal toxicities is required. Dosing, duration and sequencing of ADCs must also be optimised to achieve maximal efficacy with the least side-effects, and equally critical is the identification of predictive biomarkers that may allow better tailoring of ADC therapy and minimise overtreatment," clarifies Tarantino. With ADCs now demonstrating superiority in both pre- and post-surgical settings, the oncology community stands at the threshold of a new chapter-one defined by smarter targeting, earlier intervention and deeper biological understanding. This is a therapeutic strategy with tremendous potential, which we are only just starting to unleash, promising to reduce rates of recurrence and improve survival across multiple cancers in the years to come," concludes Tarantino.
