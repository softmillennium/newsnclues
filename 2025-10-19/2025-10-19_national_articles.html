                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a major gas processing plant in southern Russia, sparking a fire and forcing it to suspend its intake of gas from Kazakhstan, Russian and Kazakh authorities said Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that Kyiv may have to give up territory in exchange for an end to Moscow's more than 3 1/2-year invasion, in the latest of apparent reversals on how to pursue peace. The Kazakh Energy Ministry on Sunday said, citing a notification from Gazprom, that the plant was temporarily unable to process gas originating in Kazakhstan, “due to an emergency situation following a drone attack.” Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement Sunday that a “large-scale fire” erupted at the Orenburg plant, and that one of its gas processing and purification units was damaged. Kyiv has ramped up attacks in recent months on Russian energy facilities it says both fund and directly fuel Moscow's war effort. Meanwhile, Ukrainian prosecutors claim that Moscow is modifying its deadly aerial-guided bombs to strike civilians deeper in Ukraine. Local authorities in Kharkiv said Russia struck a residential neighborhood using a new rocket-powered aerial bomb for the first time. Kharkiv's regional prosecutor's office said in a statement that Russia used the weapon called the UMPB-5R, which can travel up to 130 kilometers (80 miles), in an attack on the city of Lozava on Saturday afternoon. At least 14 five-story buildings and a store were damaged, said acting regional Gov. Ukraine's General Staff also claimed a separate drone strike hit Russia's Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery, in the Samara region near Orenburg, sparking a blaze and damaging its main refining units. The Novokuibyshevsk facility, operated by Russian gas major Rosneft, has an annual capacity of 4.9 million tons, and turns out over 20 kinds of oil-based products. Russian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the Ukrainian claim or discuss any damage. In turn, Ukraine's air force reported Sunday that Russia during the night launched 62 drones into Ukrainian territory. It said 40 of these were shot down, or veered off course due to electronic jamming. Asked in a Fox News interview conducted Thursday whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be open to ending the war “without taking significant property from Ukraine,” Trump responded: “Well, he's going to take something.” “They fought and he has a lot of property. “We're the only nation that goes in, wins a war and then leaves.” The interview was aired on Sunday on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” but was conducted before Trump spoke to Putin and Zelenskyy last week. In recent weeks, Trump had shown growing impatience with Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war. In Thursday's interview, he was noncommittal about sending Tomahawk missiles requested by Ukraine, saying “I'm looking at it” but expressing concern about depleting U.S. weapons stocks. “We need them for ourselves too,” Trump said. “We can't give all our weapons to Ukraine. Russians and Ukrainians interviewed by The Associated Press last week voiced hopes for progress at an upcoming summit between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary, but said they anticipated no major breakthrough. The missiles would be the longest-range weapons in Ukraine's arsenal and would allow it to strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow, with precision. Deliveries of Tomahawks could provide leverage to help push the Kremlin into negotiations, analysts say, after Trump expressed frustration over Putin's refusal to budge on key aspects of a possible peace deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colombian President Gustavo Petro addresses supporters during a rally in Ibague, Colombia, Friday, Oct. 3, 2025. PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country's leader “does nothing to stop” drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America. In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as “an illegal drug dealer” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” He warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.” Colombia's defense minister, Pedro Sánchez, defending Petro and the nation's drug-fighting commitment, said, “If there's a country that has used all its capabilities and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking ... it's Colombia.” Trump, while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, wrote on his Truth Social platform that Petro is “strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields” across Colombia, which the Republican president initially misspelled as Columbia before deleting his post and replacing it the correct spelling of the country. “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,” Trump said. “AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA,” Trump said. He also said Petro had “a fresh mouth toward America.” Hours later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. strike in the waters off South America, this time against a vessel he said was associated with a Colombian rebel group — the National Liberation Army, or ELN — and was carrying “substantial amounts of narcotics,” but did not say how that was known to U.S. intelligence agencies. He said on social media that three men aboard were killed in the Friday attack. Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after a U.S. strike Thursday in Caribbean waters. The U.S. said on Saturday it was repatriating to Colombia and Ecuador two survivors from that attack, the sixth since early September. With Hegseth's announcement, at least 32 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers. There was no immediate reaction from the ELN, with which Petro suspended peace talks in January after a violent incursion on the border with Venezuela. More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump's commands. He said that Carranza has no ties to drug trafficking and that his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote on X. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. Petro said that he has alerted the attorney general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing. “The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar's homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,” Petro wrote. Meanwhile, Noticias Caracol, a Colombian news program, reported that the man injured in the most recent strike was hospitalized after he was repatriated and remains in serious condition. It quoted Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti as saying that the Colombian “will be prosecuted, he will be received — forgive the harsh expression — as a criminal, because so far what is known is that he was carrying a boat full of cocaine, which in our country is a crime, and despite the fact that it was in international waters, his repatriation will be as if he were being prosecuted in the United States.” Petro said the man had been aboard a “narco submarine.” Associated Press writer Astrid Suárez in Bogotá, Colombia, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US conducted a strike Friday on a ship that American intelligence officials believed was involved in illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean. Hegseth wrote in a post on X that the vessel was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and had “substantial amounts of narcotics” on board. He said the three men on the ship were all killed and no US forces were harmed. It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.” The president recently authorized the CIA to operate in Venezuela and has been weighing military action inside of the country as part of a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro. Trump has also clashed publicly with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US last week of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of its Caribbean ship strikes. Trump announced Sunday he would be canceling all US payments and subsidies to the country. This story is breaking and will be updated.</p>

It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board.

Trump has also clashed publicly with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US last week of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of its Caribbean strikes. Trump announced Sunday he would cancel all US payments and subsidies to the country. Petro responded on X, calling Trump “ignorant” and denying his involvement in illegal drug trade. The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it appears to give grounds for the president designating drug traffickers as enemy combatants and having them summarily killed without legal review. Historically, people involved in drug trafficking have been considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski were the only Republican lawmakers to cross party lines and support the resolution. It's a terrible idea,” Paul, who joined with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine to force a vote on reining in Trump's war powers, told CNN on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Santos, who had been serving a seven-year term for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress, said he had just been released from solitary confinement when his fellow inmates saw news of the commutation on television and told him. Some Republicans from New York weren't happy with the president's decision. Rep. Nick LaLota posted on social media that Santos “didn't merely lie — he stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.” LaLota added that Santos should “devote the rest of his life to demonstrating remorse and making restitution to those he wronged.” Rep. Andrew Garbarino, in a statement to the Washington Times, said Santos “has shown no remorse. The less than three months that he spent in prison is not justice.” Santos said on Sunday his former colleagues are “entitled to their opinion.” I'm pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. He claimed he had received a “a seven-year disproportionate sentence that is anything but political if you talk to anybody who really looks at these kinds of cases.” Santos is no longer required to pay any further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions, according to a copy of his clemency grant which was posted on social media by US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin. Asked whether he will pay his donors back, Santos said Sunday he will “do my best to do whatever the law requires of me.” Santos said his experience in prison, especially in solitary confinement, has inspired him to focus on helping with prison reform efforts, something he had spoken with the president about. “I told this to the president, that I'd love to be involved with prison reform, and not in a partisan way.” Santos said he did not see himself returning to politics in the next 10 years.</p>

Robinson, Commander of the 89th Airlift Wing, from Marine One to board Air Force One, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, at Joint Base Andrews, Md., for a trip to Florida. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are growing increasingly concerned about their ability to find a good job under President Donald Trump, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll finds, in what is a potential warning sign for Republicans as a promised economic boom has given way to hiring freezes and elevated inflation. High prices for groceries, housing and health care persist as a fear for many households, while rising electricity bills and the cost of gas at the pump are also sources of anxiety, according to the survey. Some 47% of U.S. adults are “not very” or “not at all confident” they could find a good job if they wanted to, an increase from 37% when the question was last asked in October 2023. Just more than one-half said the cost of groceries are a “major” source of financial stress, about 4 in 10 said the cost of housing and health care were a serious strain and about one-third said they were feeling high stress about gasoline prices. Instead, Trump's popularity on the economy has remained low amid a mix of tariffs, federal worker layoffs and partisan sniping that has culminated in a government shutdown. Linda Weavil, 76, voted for Trump last year because he “seems like a smart businessman.” But she said in an interview that the Republican's tariffs have worsened inflation, citing the chocolate-covered pecans sold for her church group fundraiser that now cost more. “I think he's doing a great job on a lot of things, but I'm afraid our coffee and chocolate prices have gone up because of tariffs,” the retiree from Greensboro, North Carolina, said. That overall number was a little higher than Trump's, primarily because of independents — 29% approved of how Biden was handling the economy, compared with the 18% who currently support Trump's approach. The job market was meaningfully stronger in terms of hiring during Biden's presidency as the United States was recovering from pandemic-related lockdowns. But hiring has slowed sharply under Trump with monthly job gains averaging less than 27,000 after the April tariff announcements. Four years ago, 36% of those in the survey were “extremely” or “very” confident in their ability to get a good job, but that has fallen to 21% now. Biden's approval on the economy steadily deteriorated through the middle of 2022 when inflation hit a four-decade high, creating an opening for Trump's political comeback. In some ways, Trump has made the inflation problems harder by choosing to cancel funding for renewable energy projects and imposing tariffs on the equipment needed for factories and power plants. Those added costs are coming before the anticipated construction of data centers for AI that could further push up prices without more construction. Even though 36% see electricity as a major concern, there are some who have yet to feel a serious financial squeeze. In the survey, 40% identified electricity costs as a “minor” stress, while 23% said their utility bills are “not a source” of stress. Kevin Halsey, 58, of Normal, Illinois, said his monthly electricity bills used to be $90 during the summer because he had solar panels, but have since jumped to $300. Halsey, who works in telecommunications, voted Democratic in last year's presidential election and described the economy right now as “crap.” At a fundamental level, Trump finds himself in the same economic dilemma that bedeviled Biden. The sense of economic precarity is coming from many different directions, with indications that many think middle-class stability is falling out of reach. In the survey, 47%, say they are “not very” or “not at all” confident they could pay an unexpected medical expense while 52% have low confidence they will have enough saved for their retirement. Young adults are much less confident about their ability to buy a house, though confidence is not especially high across the board. About 8 in 10 U.S. adults under age 30 say they are “not very confident” or “not at all confident” they would be able to buy a house, compared with about 6 in 10 adults 60 and older. Unique Hopkins, 36, of Youngstown, Ohio, said she is now working two jobs after her teenage daughter had a baby, leaving Hopkins with a sense that she can barely tread water as part of the “working poor.” She voted for Trump in 2016, only to switch to Democrats after she felt his ego kept him from uniting the country and solving problems. The AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted Oct. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The San Jose Sharks have apologized after an apparent offensive message seeming to praise Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was displayed on the arena's scoreboard during the team's Hispanic heritage celebration on Saturday night against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Video shared with CNN showed the scoreboard displaying: “SJ SHARKS FANS LOVE ICE ! GET ‘EM BOYZ !” Some fans at SAP Center in San Jose, California,﻿ can be heard booing in response. Sharks fan Jessica Clark told CNN she and her group were “appalled” by the message. “They're my favorite team — I even have tattoos — but this was something that should've been caught,” she said. In a statement posted on X later, the NHL team said: “During the first intermission of tonight's game, an offensively worded message which had been externally submitted was inadvertently displayed on the in-arena scoreboard.” Sharks Sports & Entertainment said the message did not reflect the organization's values and had not been detected during its standard review process. The incident occurred during “Los Tiburones Night,” the Sharks' ninth annual celebration of “the team's commitment to the Bay Area's vibrant Hispanic community,” according to the club's website. The Sharks would go on to lose to the Penguins 3-0. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

Actor John Cusack attended a "No Kings" protest in Chicago on Saturday, telling CNN he was frustrated by ICE operations in the City. Actor John Cusack sent a message to President Donald Trump during a "No Kings" protest in Chicago on Saturday during an interview with CNN, telling the president to "go to hell." "What's interesting is that he doesn't understand that all the labor rights around the world came from this town, this place," Cusack told CNN. "So if he thinks this place is going to be a fascist hub — no chance." "Go to hell," he said, saying that was the message from Chicago when prompted by a reporter. Cusack, an outspoken progressive, told CNN that the country was founded on "no kings." Actor John Cusack during the Wizard World Chicago Comic-Con at Donald E. Stephens Convention Center on August 26, 2017, in Rosemont, Illinois. So, that's what he's doing, and we have masked goons roaming the streets, hiding their faces, abducting people." The movement gained national prominence in June, when Trump held a military parade honoring the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, which also fell on his 79th birthday. Actor John Cusack speaks during a Chicago Teachers Union Strike Authorization Vote Rally in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019. Kimmel defended the planned "No Kings" rallies, saying the cause reflects what those who fought for American independence believed in. "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration are expected to be held in cities nationwide on Oct. 18, 2025. "There is nothing more American than a political protest. The American Revolution was a ‘No Kings' protest," Kimmel said. Fox News' Emma Colton and Gabriel Hays contributed to this report. Hanna Panreck is an associate editor at Fox News.

Ann Marie Lawrence, a Maryland mother and women's weight-loss coach, shares her quick-and-easy recipe for a one-pot Philly cheesesteak pasta dish that contains 32 grams of protein. Diners already concerned about the cost of eating out may be disappointed to learn that many restaurants are considering raising prices to keep up with inflated food and drink costs. Restaurant management software company Toast recently released its 2025 Voice of the Restaurant Industry Survey, revealing that improving profitability was the top concern for operators headed into next year. Operators ranked inflation (20%), marketing (16%) and hiring (16%) as their top three business pain points. Nearly half of all 712 restaurant decision-makers surveyed (48%) said they plan to increase menu prices if inflation continues to be a factor. The National Restaurant Association estimates that, to maintain a 5% profit margin, the average restaurant needs to raise prices by 31%, according to data compiled by the D.C.-based industry trade group earlier this year. "Raising menu prices is typically a last resort for restaurant operators, but with the rising costs of food and labor, their operating math still has to work," Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Restaurant Association, told Fox News Digital. Small business owners like Michael Brafman, who operates The Sandwich Board in New York City, are concerned about it. "The basic math is whatever product you have, you divide it by .3, and that's what the product should cost to the consumer to operate at that healthy margin," Brafman told Fox News Digital. "If the prices continue to increase, there's only [so much] that the consumer will be willing to pay." "I held out a long time to raise the [price] of our egg sandwiches," Brafman said. Menu prices that are too high can scare off customers — which is a concern for restaurant operators. He added, "You can only get away with charging so much for an egg sandwich. Nobody's spending $17 on an egg sandwich just so you can keep your margins." Increasing menu prices can be an added challenge when the business is new. "Nobody's spending $17 on an egg sandwich just so you can keep your margins," a New York City restaurant owner told Fox News Digital. "It's always a tenuous line to walk," Brafman said. "Proteins are increasing exponentially — eggs, dairy, meat, poultry, all of the core parts of the sandwich," he said. "When a steak per pound goes from $7 to $11, that's an unrealistic price increase." Passing that off to customers could spell bad news for cost-conscious diners. "I have people [who] come here repeatedly per week, and that's the fear," said Brafman. "How many times will they stop coming because the cost is prohibitive?" Prices for proteins like eggs, dairy and meat are "increasing exponentially," a sandwich shop owner said. John Loeffler, innkeeper and chef at The Inn at Gristmill Square and Waterwheel Restaurant in Virginia, said he's been watching similar trends play out, just at a different price tier. It is one of our more popular items," Loeffler told Fox News Digital. As costs climb, keeping guests happy becomes about more than the food alone, Loeffler said. "How do you make money, sell people something that they feel good about and feel a value, even at a higher price point?" "I think that's the challenge facing all restaurants — adding value as menu prices go up." John Loeffler, chef at The Inn at Gristmill Square's Waterwheel Restaurant in Virginia (shown at left), told Fox News Digital the rising cost of beef has forced him to consider other ways to provide value to his customers. (Forged Film Company for The Inn at Gristmill Square and Waterwheel Restaurant.) After 30 years in the business, Loeffler said he's learned to think differently about profit. "I think about margins less than percentages," he said. "At the end of the day, we're in the business of taking care of people, nourishing them, making them feel good … and making them feel good about spending money.

Maye Musk, mother of Elon Musk, details why she left the Democratic Party and responds to criticism against her son, on 'The Ingraham Angle.' FIRST ON FOX: A Trump-aligned political consulting firm set out to investigate the ideological swing of affluent, college-educated white women who were once considered moderate, but have since moved farther to the left, uncovering what researchers describe as a new voting bloc of left-wing women: "Resistance Grandmas." "We are so knowledgeable about everything," one woman said in a Northern Virginia focus group video reviewed by Fox News Digital, referring to herself and the other women who joined the session while slamming President Donald Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill." "When [Trump voters] start being personally impacted, that's when I'm hopeful that a little bit of something is gonna change." "It's gonna be a catastrophe," another woman chimed in, as another middle-aged woman added, "However, they will find a way to blame Democrats." Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a report conducted by the National Public Affairs (NPA), the polling arm of Trump campaign-aligned American Made Media Company, in September, as well as the full two-hour focus group session in northern Virginia that showcased the beliefs of 10 white, liberal, middle-aged, college-educated, upper–middle-class suburban women. A 2024 billboard in Hastings, Minnesota, informing voters to "trust women and vote Democratic." The women who participated in the focus group were not informed it was conducted by a Trump-aligned polling firm, they were only told that they were brought in to discuss political topics for a focus group commissioned by another research firm. The focus group was conducted to study how affluent middle-aged and older white women have increasingly shifted to the political left in recent years, and was sparked by a racist sign displayed outside a Northern Virginia school board meeting in August targeting Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears. "In the year since President Trump's historic victory, commentators have obsessed over what they call the radicalization of young white men. But a quieter, just as revealing transformation has swept another group once known for moderation and civility: older, affluent white women. This change came into sharp focus last August in Arlington, Virginia," NPA's report outlines. The Virginia gubernatorial cycle is at a fever pitch, with the election just over two weeks away pitting ex-CIA agent and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger against Republican Earle-Sears. In August, a white woman was spotted holding a Jim Crow-era-reminiscent sign targeting Earle-Sears, who is Black, when the candidate attended a school board meeting. "Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then blacks can't share my water fountain," the sign read, igniting outrage from conservatives and others who called it racist. Winsome Earle-Sears was the subject of a sign condemned by Virginia leaders as offensive and inappropriate. The women in the focus group overwhelmingly characterized the sign as written in poor taste, describing its words as "ugly," but also justified it by arguing Republicans have "already taken it too far with their trans bans." "What's the best analogy for a trans person not being able to use a particular bathroom in our recent modern history?" Another woman chimed in: "You used to have hotels that said 'No n----rs, no Jews, no dogs at these hotels. Is that… I don't know if that's the same thing." "Like, I don't think I would feel uncomfortable, and I definitely wouldn't hold up that sign," the first woman said in response. "But this person, I think, was just trying to find an appropriate analogy." The NPA report explained that polling data since the 2012 election, which pitted former Democrat President Barack Obama against Republican Mitt Romney, showed that "voting patterns among white voters and women haven't moved much in a decade." "In 2012, college graduates leaned Republican, 51-47, while postgraduates favored Democrats 55-42. High-school grads and those with some college, once evenly split, gave Trump a 56-43 lead," the report found. The report took issue with the media asking and diving into explanations on "what ‘broke' young white men" to move farther to the right and help re-elect Trump in 2024, but argued the question should instead be: "What radicalized rich white women, and whether they even realize it." Former Vice President Kamala Harris is seen as a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on July 31, 2025. The women in the focus group overwhelmingly presented themselves as arbiters of knowledge, reporting that they have the "luxury" of reading news articles from different outlets, while other voters are more concerned about costs of living and putting food on the table. One woman in the group recounted that her cousin living in a Heartland state was a lifelong Democrat who announced ahead of the 2024 election that he was leaning towards voting for Trump, which the woman said made her nearly fall "off my chair." The cousin, a male farmer, reported to her that the Biden administration had not helped U.S. farmers. And so I don't think they're paying attention." "I think a lot of times people are just very focused on … how it impacts them on that day and not reading The Washington Post or The New York Times or other things that we all have access to and, you know, have the luxury of doing," she added. The FBI launched a tip line shortly after Jan. 6, 2021, where people could report those who were "instigating violence in Washington, D.C." "And I said, 'It wasn't a f---ing open house. And finally, I just went on and said 'she was there, and I don't know what role she had, what it was,'" she said. "She was in that building by her own admission." A new report published by a Trump-aligned pollster examined how educated, wealthy White women have moved more to the left. "As the session ended, they voiced a small hope that the country might still find a way back to calm and common purpose. Whether that hope can survive a culture built on outrage is uncertain. But their conversation left one clear lesson Beneath polls and party lines, the real contest for the nation's future is over how Americans think, speak, and live with one another," the report concluded. "Democrats need to stop primarying for the lesser Republican. So what's happening is … Democrats are voting between two Republican primary candidates, and they're voting for the idiot, crazy, right-wing guy so that they don't have to compete against this actual intelligent person. And that's where we're getting these nutcases," one woman said. Another woman said the DNC should combat everything Trump says, including when the president pinned blame on radical liberal violence for the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September. "I think it comes from the DNC. I think they need a cohesive message. I think they need to be vocal every time Trump says something, even about Charlie Kirk. No one should be killed for what they believe in. But they are turning him into a martyr," one woman said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. There's a remarkable new report from the CNN Investigates team about crypto ATMs, devices that may be at your corner store and which allow people to exchange money for cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. I was struck by the detail that CNN documented at least a dozen potential fraud cases tied to a single ATM. Shame at being duped may keep many people from reporting that they've fallen victim to fraud, and when they do, authorities are frequently at a loss to help. But now, by using crypto ATMS — there's probably one near your house — scammers have changed the way things work. And companies that operate the machines are profiting from it. The companies behind these crypto ATMs strongly disputed allegations that they profit from scams and listed various efforts to protect consumers. There's more about all of that in the story. I talked to three of the CNN reporters who worked on the investigation, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Curt Devine, and Majlie de Puy Kamp. What made you realize these crypto ATMS were a story? We previously wrote about state attorneys general attending lavish foreign trips paid for by the industries they oversee, including a luxury trip to Rome earlier this year. This person appeared younger than other attendees and was not a recognizable official or lobbyist. This turned out to be Ben Weiss, the CEO of CoinFlip, a crypto ATM company that had been sued by the state of Iowa for allegedly profiting from scams (which the company disputes). We didn't know much about crypto ATM companies at the time, but we realized this was an industry that was both gaining influence among government officials and coming under scrutiny. These scams seem to go by a script where the victim is intimidated by a threatening phone call and an urgent demand for money. Rather than sending victims to buy a bunch of gift cards for $500 each, for example, scammers can send them to one machine to deposit thousands of dollars at one time and then funnel the currency overseas. From our experience reporting this story, many people aren't familiar with crypto ATMs or how they work. They send often elderly victims to these machines under the assumption that the crypto ATM is a legitimate way to pay off (made up!) In one incident, a scammer referenced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Donald Trump established to make a victim more comfortable with stuffing cash into ones of these machines. Many people probably figure out it's a scam before handing over money. That is difficult to answer, but given how prevalent these scam texts are, we have to assume they are lucrative for criminals. What's interesting is that we've seen people from all walks of life fall for these scams, including doctors and CEOs. And these days there is so much information on people available online that it doesn't take much for a scam to be targeted enough to be believable. In most local cases we reviewed, the scammer's identity remains a mystery. But in some cases, specific people have been charged — like a citizen of India indicted last year, who prosecutors called “a high-level member of a sophisticated, organized, transnational fraud ring.” That case remains pending and much of it is sealed. We also know there are scam compounds in places like Myanmar, where thousands of people are held against their will and forced to work for low wages to carry out financial scams that target Americans. So it's certainly possible that some of the scammers who try to push people in the US to transfer them cash through crypto ATMs are themselves victims of crimes. Is there a way for people to figure out if ATMs near them have been used in scams? It took us about four months to receive the records and log more than 700 cases. It was in that process of manually reading through every report that we started to notice recurring addresses for the same location or store. Once we put everything together, the spreadsheet became a trove of information allowing us to see how much money people had lost, what sort of scam had targeted them and which ATMs they used. It would be time-consuming to replicate that process, and the point is not whether a particular crypto ATM has been repeatedly used by scammers. The point is that these scams are now rampant, so if someone says you need to deposit money into one of these machines to pay a fine or avoid a penalty, that's almost certainly a scam. Is there any data to back up that claim? Some of the companies have pointed to a report by the analytics group TRM Labs, which found that 1.2% of cash-to-crypto transactions were illicit in 2023. But some law enforcement investigations that have obtained data from particular crypto ATM companies and interviewed customers have alleged scams account for much higher percentages of those companies' business. The DC attorney general alleged that more than 90% of deposits in one company's ATMs came from fraud over the span of months, which that company disputes. One thing that sticks out is that there appears to be little law enforcement can do after a person uploads cash to the crypto ATM. Once you insert cash into a crypto ATM, that currency can rapidly be transferred just about anywhere in the world. The problem with recovering the money afterward is that scammers often direct the funds to cryptocurrency exchanges outside of US jurisdiction that are less likely to cooperate with US law enforcement. Are lawmakers talking about some kind of regulation? More than a dozen states have passed laws that seek to blunt crypto ATM scams. They impose requirements like daily transaction limits on the machines, which seek to reduce what scam victims may lose. In Missouri, for example, legislators passed regulations this year that matched model legislation passed along by CoinFlip in another state nearly word-for-word, with no transaction limits. Some federal lawmakers have pushed for tighter rules, but remember, the Trump administration has relaxed oversight of the crypto industry. So these regulation debates may play out for years to come.</p>

A Rutgers University professor nicknamed "Dr. Antifa," who fled the U.S. for Spain after saying his home address had been doxxed, and his family threatened, portrayed doxxing as a legitimate tactic for use against political opponents in his seminal work. Mark Bray, who now teaches his history courses for the public New Jersey university online from abroad, is best known for his book, "Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook," published in 2017. That book, which is based on 61 interviews with "current and former anti-fascists from seventeen countries in North America and Europe," references doxxing in a positive light three times. On page 87, Bray quoted a Danish Antifa interviewee named Rasmus Preston, who said doxxing is "'a very important tool to create conflict within far-right movements' by causing a ‘constant mental burden.'" In another instance, Bray relayed the story of Antifa Nebraska scoring a "major victory" by doxxing a political opponent, noting that the far-left group "printed thousands of flyers with his name, photo, and information on his Nazism and plastered them around town, forcing him to drop out of college, take down his social media, and go into hiding." The book offers an appendix where Bray invited his interview subjects to provide advice to fellow or prospective Antifa members. A source named Brett A advocated in favor of doxxing as one of many tools in Antifa's political war. "Ideally, you want a diverse squad with members who have different talents," Brett said. "Some folks will be best used on the front lines in confrontations (usually strong, fit people who can fight if need be), some folks need to be really good with intel gathering (monitoring right-wing pages, doxxing, etc. ), some folks need to be good at graphic design for flyer campaigns, some folks need to be well-versed in security culture, etc. Brett alluded to another tactic supported in Bray's book: violence. Antifascism is not just one tactic, but many, and those include "combinations of physical confrontations, doxxing, infiltration." Mark Bray, a Rutgers assistant professor of history, and his wife, Yesenia Barragan, a Rutgers associate professor of history, wait in their hotel room in Newark, N.J., before a planned flight to Spain on Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025. Fascists are defined ambiguously as the "Far Right," which Bray speculated could evolve into something worse than fascism. Bray openly praised the violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown's death involving police. "Moreover, these riots pushed police brutality and black oppression to the forefront of the national consciousness in a way that ‘nonviolent' tactics could not have achieved on their own," he wrote. He described those groups as "militants wearing ski masks and bandannas, armed with clubs, iron bars, Molotov cocktails, and sometimes handguns." He justified the groups' violent outbursts with a talking point often used in far-left circles in the U.S. today. Rioters celebrate as a business burns after it was set on fire following the grand jury announcement in the Michael Brown case on Nov. 24, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri. "While the expressed purpose of such marches may have been opposition to fascism, the state and the entire capitalist system were implicated in fascist violence, and therefore legitimate targets for widespread looting and property destruction," Bray wrote. The book later claims that "anti-fascism must necessarily be anticapitalist." Later, he described the Autonomen in Germany, a group descended from Autonomia Operaia. He fawned over the group for inventing black bloc, the now-ubiquitous black head-to-toe uniform Antifa groups wear worldwide. He described a "direct action" where the group "dressed in black with their faces covered by motorcycle helmets, balaclavas, or other masks to create a uniform, anonymous mass of revolutionaries prepared to carry out militant actions, sometimes involving weapons such as flagpoles, clubs, projectiles, and Molotov cocktails." Censorship is viewed as a powerful tool in fighting the people Bray calls fascists, too. His book roundly rejects free speech absolutism, and rages against "liberal anti-fascists" whom he characterizes as being too stalwart in their defense of open debate. "When militant anti-fascists successfully deprive fascists or white supremacists of a platform to promote their agenda, ‘liberal anti-fascists' often argue that shutting them down is counterproductive because it only gives them more attention.… Anti-fascists argue that any rhetorical benefit gained from such confrontations is outweighed by their reduced ability to disseminate it," Bray wrote. Bray even briefly touched on internet censorship, which he favors. "The Internet is a platform that anti-fascists cannot completely contest, though efforts to persuade Reddit and other forums to ban racist threads have borne some fruit," he said. The history professor fled the U.S. to Spain after President Donald Trump announced that he would designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. After that, the Turning Point USA chapter started a petition to have Bray fired. Multiple groups, including Rose City Antifa and the Proud Boys protest in downtown Portland, Ore., Saturday, June 29, 2019. Bray said he received threats and was doxxed, prompting his move overseas. He did not return a request for comment. Previously, he was a politics reporter at The Tennessee Star. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden take an aerial tour on Marine One over areas devastated by the Maui wildfires, Aug. 21, 2023, in Lahaina, Hawaii. A sign for the Federal Emergency Management Agency is pictured at FEMA headquarters, April 20, 2020, in Washington. “Every day we remain in this grant purgatory reduces the time available to responsibly and effectively spend these critical funds,” said Kiele Amundson, communications director at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. The uncertainty has led some emergency management agencies to hold off on filling vacant positions and make rushed decisions on important training and purchases. Experts say the developments complicate state-led emergency efforts, undermining the Republican administration's stated goals of shifting more responsibility to states and local governments for disaster response. In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the new requirements were necessary because of “recent population shifts” and that changes to security grants were made “to be responsive to new and urgent threats facing our nation.” State emergency managers say that money has become increasingly important because the range of threats they must prepare for is expanding, including pandemics and cyberattacks. But the next day, it told states the money was on hold until they submitted new population counts. The new requirement forcing states to submit revised counts “is something we have never seen before,” said Trina Sheets, executive director of the National Emergency Management Association, a group representing emergency managers. “It's certainly not the responsibility of emergency management to certify population.” With no guidance on how to calculate the numbers, Hawaii's Amundson said staff scrambled to gather data from the 2020 census and other sources, then subtracted he number of “noncitizens” based on estimates from an advocacy group. They are not sure the methodology will be accepted. But with their FEMA contacts furloughed and the grant portal down during the federal shutdown, they cannot find out. Other states said they were assessing the request or awaiting further guidance. In its statement, DHS said FEMA needs to be certain of its funding levels before awarding grant money, and that includes updates to a state's population due to deportations. Experts said delays caused by the request could most affect local governments and agencies that receive grant money passed down by states because their budgets and staffs are smaller. That could prevent agencies from taking on longer-term projects. Bryan Koon, president and CEO of the consulting firm IEM and a former Florida emergency management chief, said state governments and local agencies need time to adjust their budgets to any kind of changes. In another move that has caused uncertainty, FEMA in September drastically cut some states' allocations from another source of funding. The $1 billion Homeland Security Grant Program is supposed to be based on assessed risks, and states pass most of the money to police and fire departments. Meanwhile, some territories received unexpected windfalls, including the U.S. Virgin Islands, which got more than twice its expected allocation. The National Emergency Management Association said the grants are meant to be distributed based on risk and that it “remains unclear what risk methodology was used” to determine the new funding allocation. That forced FEMA to rescind award notifications and refrain from making payments until a further court order. In Hawaii, where a 2023 wildfire devastated the Maui town of Lahaina and killed more than 100 people, the state, counties and nonprofits “face the real possibility” of delays in paying contractors, completing projects and “even staff furloughs or layoffs” if the grant freeze and government shutdown continue, he said. The myriad setbacks prompted Washington state's Emergency Management Division to pause filling some positions “out of an abundance of caution,” communications director Karina Shagren said. Emergency management experts said the moves have created uncertainty for those in charge of preparedness. The Trump administration has suspended a $3.6 billion FEMA disaster resilience program, cut the FEMA workforce and disrupted routine training. A Manhattan federal judge last week ordered DHS and FEMA to restore $34 million in transit security grants it had withheld from New York City because of its immigration policies. Taken together, the turbulence surrounding what was once a reliable partner is prompting some states to prepare for a different relationship with FEMA. “Given all of the uncertainties,” said Sheets, of the National Emergency Management Association, states are trying to find ways to be “less reliant on federal funding.”</p>

Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest on what's happening in Gaza after Hamas agreed to a peace deal with Israel on ‘The Story.' The Israeli military conducted strikes against Hamas in Gaza after accusing the terrorist organization of repeatedly violating its ceasefire agreement on Sunday. An Israeli military official confirmed the strikes to Fox News on Sunday, pointing to attacks by Hamas since Friday. The IDF later confirmed that it was taking actions in Gaza. Military vehicles are gathered near the Israel-Gaza border, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in southern Israel on Oct. 12, 2025. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says he has instructed the minister of defense and other security heads to "act forcefully" in reaction to the attacks. Hamas claims it has "no knowledge" of any attacks against Israeli forces, releasing a statement on Sunday saying it was still abiding by the terms of the agreement. "We affirm our full commitment to implementing everything that has been agreed upon, foremost among which is the ceasefire in all areas of the Gaza Strip. We have no knowledge of any events or clashes taking place in the Rafah area," the group wrote. "We have no connection to any events occurring in those areas, nor can we communicate with any of our fighters there if any of them remain alive," it added. The reported attacks on Israeli troops come after Hamas spent days fighting Palestinian rival groups after the ceasefire went into effect. In this still from a verified social media video confirmed to Reuters by a Hamas source, seven men are forced to their knees and shot from behind by Hamas gunmen during public executions in Gaza on Oct. 14, 2025. According to Reuters, Hamas executed at least 33 people in recent days in what officials described as a campaign to "show strength" after the ceasefire. Israeli sources say most of those killed belonged to families accused of collaborating with Israel or supporting rival militias. The U.S. Department of State warned on Saturday that Hamas may break the peace agreement with a "planned attack" on Palestinian civilians. "This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts," the department said in a statement on social media. Members of the Hamas militant group searching for bodies of the hostages in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. President Donald Trump warned Hamas on Friday that continued attacks on Palestinians would force the U.S. and Israel to intervene. "If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them," he wrote on X. Fox News' Brie Stimson contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prince Andrew says he is giving up his royal title of the Duke of York after his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein returned to the headlines. Prince Andrew looks round as he leaves after attending the Easter Matins Service at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, England, April 20, 2025. Britain's Prince Andrew and Princess Eugenie arrive ahead of the coronation of King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort, in London, May 6, 2023. A selection of British national newspapers showing the front pages and their reaction to Prince Andrew announcing that he will relinquish his Duke of York title and the Order of the Garter, amid ongoing problems in his personal life, in London, Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. Britain's Prince Andrew looks on during an event at the residence of the British Ambassador in New Delhi, India, March 10, 2010. LONDON (AP) — London police are probing whether Prince Andrew asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre. The Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” media reports that Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear Giuffre by asking an officer on the force to find out if she had a criminal record. The report by the Mail on Sunday followed Buckingham Palace's announcement Friday that Andrew agreed to relinquish use of Duke of York and other remaining royal titles after emails emerged showing he had remained in contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he previously admitted. Giuffre's family welcomed news of the duke's demise but said King Charles III should go further and strip Andrew's title as prince. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41. The move to insulate the monarchy from Andrew's scandals has been ongoing since November 2019 when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles after a disastrous interview when he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his dukedom demotion when emails emerged last week showing he emailed Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. The Mail reported that in 2011, as the newspaper was about to publish a now-infamous photo of the prince with his arm around the partly bare midriff of Giuffre, Andrew provided his bodyguard with Giuffre's date of birth and confidential social security number to find out if she had a checkered past. Giuffre's family said she didn't have a criminal record. With that report and Giuffre's posthumous memoir being published Tuesday, the scandal will not soon evaporate. British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who was serving as the government's representative on the Sunday morning news programs, said a police officer should not be enlisted in a smear campaign. “These are deeply concerning allegations,” Miliband told the BBC. “I think people want to look at those allegations and what the substance is behind them. In his statement Friday, Andrew said he continues to “vigorously deny” the accusations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pivotal question in November's New Jersey and Virginia governor races may be whether the outcome is shaped more by President Donald Trump's electoral strengths or by his weaknesses. Four years ago, the GOP candidates in both races benefited from one of Trump's most important political gains: improving the GOP vote among working-class racial minorities. But they were able to minimize the impact of his most conspicuous political vulnerability: a shift away from the Republican Party in white-collar suburbs. “The question for Republicans is: Are those very unique Trump voters that got him closer in New Jersey and Virginia and some other blue states (only) Trump voters or are they Republican voters?” said Mike DuHaime, a longtime New Jersey Republican strategist. On the other, the Republican candidates could face much larger deficits next month in white-collar suburbs such as Fairfax County, Virginia, and Bergen County, New Jersey, than they did in 2021, when Joe Biden occupied the White House and Trump was much less visible. “We know through a lot of conversations and organizing … that those voters are frustrated and upset with what they are seeing from the Trump administration,” said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a pro-abortion rights group. Both sides believe New Jersey is a more competitive race than Virginia, partly because Ciattarelli is a stronger candidate than Earle-Sears, but also because Virginia more acutely feels the impact of the sweeping cutbacks in the federal workforce and contracting ranks engineered by Trump and by the formerly Elon Musk-fronted DOGE project. Virginia is also easier for Democrats because Spanberger is running to replace Glenn Youngkin, the term-limited Republican governor whose approval rating has sagged somewhat, while Sherrill is trying to succeed Phil Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor, whose ratings have also drooped. “If you've got a president of your own party at minus 13 to minus 15 (job approval) in an off-off-year, it's always significant,” said Democratic activist Terry McAuliffe. McAuliffe should know: He narrowly won election as Virginia's governor in 2013 while Barack Obama's approval was faltering amid the rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act, and then lost a comeback bid to Youngkin in 2021 as Biden's rating cratered in the aftermath of the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Inevitably, local issues have shaped the outcome of these contests. On several recent occasions, that has made them an early gauge of tremors that rumble through the next midterm and even presidential elections. “To a great extent, both parties look at (these elections) as kind of spring training, but also as a harbinger,” said Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee during his years in the chamber. That role is evident in the oscillating recent signals from these governors' races in the well-educated suburbs of both states. In Virginia, Northam carried the four big suburban Northern Virginia jurisdictions — Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties — by a crushing 242,000-vote margin. That was more than double McAuliffe's advantage in those same places four years earlier. Northam also comfortably carried Henrico and Chesterfield, two big previously Republican-leaning counties outside Richmond, where McAuliffe had only narrowly prevailed. And in 2020, Biden posted enormous margins over Trump in such places around the country; for instance, Biden carried the big four suburban Northern Virginia jurisdictions by over 450,000 votes, and soared past Murphy's 2017 performance in the well-educated New Jersey suburbs. With Trump no longer occupying center stage, Republicans regained ground among well-educated voters by connecting with them on hot-button cultural issues including crime and education. Both Youngkin and Ciattarelli (who was also the Republican nominee that year), ran hard against Covid-19 lockdowns and how teachers taught race-related issues while championing “parents' rights” in schools. But in 2024, as concern about inflation eclipsed the focus on abortion, the suburban trend evident three years earlier in New Jersey and Virginia resurfaced. Vice President Kamala Harris still won most white-collar suburban counties outside the South. But she didn't match Biden's share of the vote four years earlier in any of the big well-educated New Jersey counties, and she carried the four big Northern Virginia jurisdictions by nearly 100,000 fewer votes than he did. The 2021 governor results, especially in New Jersey, confirmed another negative trend for Democrats. Trump somewhat improved his showing in 2020 over 2016 among minority voters nationwide, especially those without a four-year college degree. He significantly narrowed Murphy's advantage from 2017 in Passaic and Hudson, the two New Jersey counties with the largest share of Hispanic residents, and improved even in Essex, the county centered on Newark, which has a large Black population. Similar trends across the 2021 and 2024 elections were evident in some Virginia communities with large nonwhite populations, such as Prince William County. Budget cuts that have hurt both federal workers and contractors, compounded by the ongoing government shutdown, have created a unique headwind for Republicans in Virginia. “There is no other state that gets so impacted and touched by the federal government,” said McAuliffe. Spanberger and Sherrill are both centrist Democrats with national security backgrounds who were elected to the House of Representatives as part of the 2018 blue wave. Both have run careful, disciplined campaigns that have drawn criticism from some Democrats for failing to ignite much enthusiasm or passion, but also praise from analysts in both parties for avoiding missteps. “They are running a race where they believe … that if she doesn't make a mistake she'll win,” DuHaime, the New Jersey Republican strategist, said of Sherrill. Sherrill and Spanberger have each maintained a predominant focus on the cost of living. That contrasts with their Republican opponents, who have attempted to revive several of the wedge issues that have benefited the GOP in recent years. Those include immigration enforcement, resistance to climate policies that they say will raise energy costs, and especially in Virginia, stoking concern about policies affecting transgender students. Earle-Sears “is obviously running that playbook, but nobody thinks she is in the driver's seat of the election,” said Democratic strategist Bradley Komar, who ran Northam's winning 2017 Virginia campaign. Jesse Ferguson, a longtime Democratic strategist working in Virginia, argued that Trump's 2024 ad hitting Harris on transgender issues (whose famous tag line was, “Kamala's for they/them, President Trump is for you”) was so effective not only because of Harris' stance on those questions, but because the ad crystallized Trump's argument that Democrats were focused on esoteric concerns, not the daily financial struggles of ordinary families. Now, Ferguson said, Trump has inverted that equation by devoting so much of his presidency to retribution against perceived enemies and crackdowns against blue states and cities. Both Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears have embraced Trump almost unreservedly. In his recent debate with Sherrill, Ciattarelli insisted, in an answer reminiscent of Harris' damaging comments about Biden last year on The View, “I think he's right about everything that he's doing.” Earle-Sears has avoided criticizing Trump even over the big federal layoffs that have pounded Northern Virginia. In those contests, neither Ciattarelli nor Youngkin repudiated Trump, but both kept some distance. “Youngkin … was able to walk that tightrope very effectively in amplifying the conservative base turnout while also winning independent voters that he needed,” said Mark Rozell, Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University in Virginia. Republicans in both states say Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears probably have no choice but to hug Trump tightly for fear of discouraging turnout from his base supporters. But that strategy has helped Democrats lash them to a president whose disapproval rating stood at 55% in both a recent Schar School/Washington Post Virginia poll and a September Quinnipiac University survey in New Jersey (the last time that poll measured Trump's approval there). The Republican nominees were carrying comparable majorities among voters who approved of Trump's performance — but that was only a little more than 4 in 10 in each state. The Schar/WP and most recent Quinnipiac surveys have found each woman carrying a majority of white college graduates, as did a Fairleigh-Dickinson University poll of New Jersey released Friday . Political strategists in both states are less certain about how much ground Democrats can regain with minority communities. But Rafael Collazo, executive director of the Unidos US Action Fund, which focuses on Latino voters, said “the door is open” for Democrats to begin reversing their losses because of discontent over high prices and Trump's aggressive deportation policies. “There is definitely buyer's remorse” among some of Trump's 2024 Latino supporters, Collazo says, “but that doesn't necessarily mean Democrats are automatically going to recruit those voters.” The controversy over recently revealed threatening 2022 text messages from Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Attorney General in Virginia, has provided Republicans in this year's races “a focus they haven't had before,” Rozell said. Murphy, particularly over rising electricity costs, has provided Ciattarelli with probably his best asset in the race. Yet in both states, in both parties, most analysts would be surprised if those local factors allowed the GOP to surmount a national current that is once again primarily flowing away from Trump. (Ciattarelli has stayed more competitive than Earle-Sears, but even his support has almost never exceeded 45% in any poll — the level around which New Jersey Republicans often tap out.) A victory for Republicans in either race would be an ominous sign for Democrats that discontent with Trump may not be enough to overcome their own substantial image problems, even in favorable states. But solid wins in both places would give Democrats hoping for a wave in 2026 — the first reliable indication that one may be approaching the shore.</p>
