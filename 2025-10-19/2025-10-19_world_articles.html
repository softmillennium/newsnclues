                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has accused the Trump administration of assassination.RODRIGO ARANGUA/AFP/Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country's leader “does nothing to stop” drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America. In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as “an illegal drug dealer” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” He warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.” Colombia's defence minister, Pedro Sánchez, defending Petro and the nation's drug-fighting commitment, said, “If there's a country that has used all its capabilities and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking ... it's Colombia.” “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,” Trump said. He also said Petro had “a fresh mouth toward America.” Hours later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. strike in the waters off South America, this time against a vessel he said was associated with a Colombian rebel group – the National Liberation Army, or ELN – and was carrying “substantial amounts of narcotics,” but did not say how that was known to U.S. intelligence agencies. He said on social media that three men aboard were killed in the Friday attack. Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after a U.S. strike Thursday in Caribbean waters. With Hegseth's announcement, at least 32 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers. There was no immediate reaction from the ELN, with which Petro suspended peace talks in January after a violent incursion on the border with Venezuela. More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump's commands. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote on X. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. Petro said that he has alerted the attorney-general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing. This is Bolívar's homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,” Petro wrote. Meanwhile, Noticias Caracol, a Colombian news program, reported that the man injured in the most recent strike was hospitalized after he was repatriated and remains in serious condition. It quoted Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti as saying that the Colombian “will be prosecuted, he will be received – forgive the harsh expression – as a criminal, because so far what is known is that he was carrying a boat full of cocaine, which in our country is a crime, and despite the fact that it was in international waters, his repatriation will be as if he were being prosecuted in the United States.” Petro said the man had been aboard a “narco submarine.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Guardian investigation finds the US soda and snack-food industries, threatened by RFK Jr's movement to change Americans' eating habits, have turned to a group of well-connected strategists, shadowy pollsters and ‘anti-woke' influencers Major US soft-drink and snack-food corporations are waging a coordinated campaign that aims to pit Donald Trump's Maga faithful against Robert F Kennedy Jr's Make America Healthy Again movement, a Guardian investigation in partnership with environmental watchdog Fieldnotes has found. In the process, the industry has also been aided less directly by a loose coalition of free-market ideologues who have previously worked to advance Trump's deregulatory agenda. The effort features Maga influencers hired by a firm that promotes “anti-woke” movies; an obscure research group Lee Zeldin was working for when Donald Trump picked him to lead the US Environmental Protection Agency; and a media outlet backed by rightwing billionaires Leonard Leo and Charles Koch, among others. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper, the three largest soft-drink corporations in the United States, as well as packaged-food conglomerates like General Mills, Kraft Heinz, Mondelēz and Nestlé, are among those that pay dues for the right to have a say in either or both of the trade groups' strategies. All three soda-makers identified the Maha efforts as significant threats to their bottom lines in their most recent annual reports, delivered to investors after Trump nominated Kennedy to be secretary of US Health and Human Services. Coke and Dr Pepper went as far as to suggest such risks would be compounded if unnamed “government officials” were to voice health concerns about their products. The companies' most pressing political concerns are two related RFK Jr-backed efforts: one to ban schools from serving foods with petroleum-based dyes, and the other to bar individuals receiving Snap benefits from using the federal nutrition assistance to purchase soft drinks. Their not-so-subtle message to conservative lawmakers, delivered directly by lobbyists and indirectly via both an industry front group and paid social media influencers: oppose the Maha efforts or face a Maga backlash. “Working-class families and individuals across America rose up to vote for President Trump on the promise of a new era that would lift them up, not leave them behind again,” the beverage lobby declared earlier this year in an unsigned memo as some of the first Maha-themed nutrition efforts were gaining conservative support in places like Utah and Arkansas. A dozen states have already requested, and received, waivers from the US Department of Agriculture allowing them to restrict how Snap benefits can be used, and roughly a half dozen have passed legislation restricting food dyes in school meals. The Utah state representative Kristen Chevrier, a Republican whose Snap and school-meals bills were signed into law by her governor in March, says that's likely because the industry's influence is concentrated in the nation's capital. “It's easier for the big food industries to control the federal government then it is for them to control a whole bunch of different states,” she said in an interview. Chevrier, who describes herself as “a Maha mom before Maha was a thing”, said the lobbyists who approached her focused far more on their own profits than any political backlash she might face. Their priority was “how much money they were going to lose if people stopped buying soda with Snap dollars”, she said. “The lobbyists were sitting there at the table with me and I said: ‘Do you have any idea what this sounds like? And they've done so with veteran GOP strategists serving as middle operatives, creating the appearance of distance between the companies and their preferred narrative. In late February, for instance, as two Maha bills were moving through the Arizona legislature, soda lobbyist Michael Gardner reached out to lawmakers to make his client's case against the Snap legislation, which was ultimately vetoed by the governor. Bolger and his firm are also part of a larger, formal network of political shops run by Phil Cox, who was once a top executive at Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family's primary dark-money group, and who is currently on the board of the Senate Leadership Fund and WinRed. Cox's network, GP3 Partners, includes more than a dozen other firms and boasts online of its “proven ability to play with lethal precision at scale”. Despite claiming to be a provider of “high-quality statehouse and statewide news”, it has been identified by journalism experts at Columbia University as a purveyor of “pink slime”, meaning, partisan talking points presented as objective journalism. In a March email to one of the bill's sponsors, Raden argued against the legislation and then, much as Gardner had, closed by pointing to an article posted by a rightwing news outlet that suggested Trump voters wanted such decisions left to the president. “I know you are hosting a town hall tomorrow and thought it might come up,” Raden wrote to the Republican senator Janae Shamp, who had introduced the bill in Arizona's upper chamber. Unlike Public Opinion Strategies, which is well-known within certain Washington DC circles and publicly discloses its ties to GP3, Tyson Group has a far smaller and less transparent public presence. However, the firm doesn't disclose publicly that all five of those individuals also work at P2 Public Affairs, a much larger and more prominent conservative consulting firm – one that, like Public Opinion Strategies, is also part of Cox's GP3 umbrella organization. The metadata on an internal memo for subsequent Tyson polling likewise shows that document was created by Katherine Swetman, who is not listed on Tyson's site as an employee but is listed on P2's as a marketing manager specializing in “targeted messaging”. (P2 and Tyson did not respond to questions about their structure or involvement in the campaign. The group, also known as PUP Research, describes itself online as a 501(c)6 non-profit, but there is currently no record of it in the Internal Revenue Service database of such tax-exempt organizations. The group did not respond to questions about its leadership and staff. While PUP Research doesn't disclose its leadership or employees, an apparent sister organization known as Plymouth Union Public Advocacy, or PUP Advocacy, does. The advocacy firm's website suggests it launched earlier this year with a seven-figure paid campaign in support of Trump's agenda, and that it is led by a trio of GOP veterans. (The American Beverage Association's CEO, Kevin Keane, has undertaken a tour of conservative podcasts and conferences, pushing a similar line that the government shouldn't be “making decisions for people” when it comes to nutrition.) The post drew a swift rebuke from Rollins's X account. “It's disappointing that the American Beverage Association's leadership dragged its entire membership–and the patriotic American workers and their families they employ and represent–into direct conflict with this Administration's priorities for American health, well-being, and taxpayer protection,” she wrote. “These priorities–which those same American workers voted to endorse–will prevail.” She tagged Kennedy in her response. As industry lobbyists were making their case to lawmakers directly, an industry-funded front group, Americans for Food and Beverage Choice, was running a small-dollar Facebook ad campaign featuring the industry's Snap-related polling in at least nine states, according to the Meta ad library database. Meanwhile, a group of Maga-aligned influencers were taking the same pro-soda message nationwide by posting client-approved talking points on Elon Musk's X – all while not disclosing they were being paid to do so. “We cannot allow ‘Make America Healthy Again' messaging to be used to force needy Americans into not buying certain things,” tweeted conservative influencer Eric Daugherty, adding: “President Trump literally has a Diet Coke button in his Oval Office.” After being called out by Sortor, Daugherty and at least one other influencer deleted their posts. Influenceable LLC is run by Camron and Liam Rafizadeh, brothers who have made a name for themselves by trafficking in anti-LGBTQ+ memes and pro-Trump talking points online. While Influenceable's website does not list any specific political campaigns it has worked on, IRS filings show that it was paid $110,000 in 2023 by the Center for Renewing America, a Christian-nationalist organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump's current director of the office of management and budget. “Polling shows,” the final talking point given to the influencers reads, “a majority of Trump voters oppose restrictions on soda purchases through SNAP.” Josh Voorhees is an investigative editor at Fieldnotes, a watchdog organization focused on the oil and gas industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US consumers say price rises caused by president's tariffs contradicts his promise to make life more affordable Harris, 38, lives and works as a teacher's assistant in Stella, North Carolina, and is one of almost 40 people who spoke to the Guardian about how they've been coping with the price of goods in the six months since Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariffs. On Thursday, a study from S&P Global revealed that companies were expected to pay at least $1.2tn more in 2025 expenses than was previously anticipated. They calculated that two-thirds of the “expense shock”, more than $900bn, will be absorbed by Americans. Last month, the Yale Budget Lab estimated tariffs would cost households almost $2,400 more a year. Harris says the tariffs' impact on her daily life contradicts promises from the Trump administration to “cut prices and make living affordable for everyone”. I mostly shop at Costco and buy as little as possible anywhere else,” said Jean Meadows, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Huntsville, Alabama. I think people are really afraid of what is coming.” “The bread I buy has doubled in price within a year. We live on a fixed income that doesn't keep up with inflation,” said Myron Peeler, who is also retired and is the sole caregiver for his wife, who suffers from debilitating arthritis. The only saving grace, he said, is that his house and car are paid off. Trump shows few signs of backing away from his tariff policy – a move the White House maintains will reinvigorate American manufacturing and increased revenue from trade partners. This came after China moved to restrict exports of rare earth minerals needed for several everyday items from electric vehicle batteries to hospital equipment, a decision that Trump branded as “very hostile”. In an interview with Fox News, the president has admitted that the proposed tariff hike was “not sustainable”, but said he was left with little choice: “They forced me to do that”. “We need to buy new tires for a car, and can't, because affordable tires are no longer in stock and we can't afford $250 a tire,” she said. Several people echoed Michele's feelings about availability, describing the situation as “empty shelves, higher prices”. Natalie, who lives in New Hampshire, said she hasn't seen certain pantry staples “for months”. She said: “The store shelves have become more and more bare … instead of multiple choices there may only be one or two, and name brands are being replaced by store brands.” At 55, Natalie is semi-retired but is due to start part-time work at a supermarket, and she has seen a price rise in nearly everything she buys regularly. “Any brand of cat food has increased anywhere from 25% to double the price. One wet food my cats like went from $1.79 to $2.49 per can,” she said. The new normal many Americans are bracing for, or already feeling, is not just the cost of groceries, for those such as Minnie, a food writer in Portland, Oregon, it's a change in lifestyle. No fall shopping trips for a new sweater or jeans. And we'll make all our Christmas presents this year,” said Minnie, 55. Cassie has a strict $65 per week budget for groceries, but since Trump first announced his tariffs, she's been priced out of her normal routine, which included doing most of her weekly shopping at Walmart. “Now I must visit at least four different stores in the area and other towns, often driving longer distances to find the best prices,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Moscow steps up its hybrid onslaught against the Baltic states, local Russian-speaking populations present a potential weak spot to exploit. Adopting a "wartime" mentality — fueled by the war in Ukraine and Russian aerial incursions — Tallinn and Riga increasingly see this minority as a potential risk, says Vendula Kazlauskas, an expert on the Baltic region at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs. Seeking to curb Moscow's influence, Latvia and Estonia are phasing out the Russian language in education, tightening immigration rules, and targeting Russian-linked organizations. These steps are driven both by security concerns and by the need for a "greater integration of the Russian-speaking minority," Kazlauskas explains. Analysts say Russia has long been employing propaganda to target Russian speakers in the Baltics — some of whom have little knowledge of local languages — to sway public opinion and sow division. "Russia persistently seeks to influence Estonia's Russian-speaking community," Igor Gretskiy, a researcher at the Tallinn-based International Center for Defense and Security (ICDS) think tank, told the Kyiv Independent. "To that end, Russia weaponizes virtually every sphere of human activity: language, culture, sports, and so on." Marek Kohv, a former Estonian defense official and a security expert at the ICDS, adds that Russia is using social media and online portals to promote narratives about the "decline of the West" and alleged oppression of Russian speakers. These efforts only gained pace when Moscow launched its all-out aggression against Ukraine. "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we have seen a significant intensification of (Russian) influence activity in Estonia," Joosep Kaasik, the deputy secretary general for Internal Security at Estonia's Interior Ministry, told the Kyiv Independent. Reacting to this development, Russia "seeks to engage Estonia's Russian-speaking youth and draw them into its informational and value sphere," Kohv told the Kyiv Independent. This propaganda campaign aligns with other hybrid operations, including cyberattacks, bomb threats, espionage, and vandalism, acts sometimes carried out by local Russians. Recent weeks saw tensions surge in the region after three Russian fighter jets violated Estonian airspace on Sept. 19, just 10 days after Poland downed several Russian drones over its territory. Russian drones have also "strayed" into the Lithuanian and Latvian airspace during past attacks on Ukraine. As Western officials raise alarms about a possible open clash between Moscow and NATO in the coming years — a conflict where the Baltics would be at the front line — Riga and Tallinn try to ensure their entire populations are on their side. After the all-out war in Ukraine broke out, both Latvia and Estonia took steps to better integrate their Russian-speaking minorities — a strategy that drew ire from Moscow. Estonia, in turn, barred non-EU citizens from voting in local elections, a move that primarily affected Russian citizens who did not have local passports. "However, the steps taken by both countries are a double-edged sword," Kazlauskas says. "While understandable given their internal situation, security concerns, and historical experience," Russian propaganda can use them to "justify the need to 'protect' oppressed Russian-speaking compatriots — potentially serving as a pretext for aggression." But local authorities say firmly that these efforts are aimed at safeguarding national security and social cohesion. "We cannot – and we should not – simply ignore the fact that our population (or part of it) is systematically targeted by propaganda and disinformation by the Russian regime," Estonia's Kaasik told the Kyiv Independent. "For our small nation, countering this long-term threat is a question of self-preservation." As Russia ramps up its aggression in Ukraine, it also seeks to sow division and doubt abroad — including among Ukraine's closest allies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A day after insisting on Fox News that he is “not a king”, the US president posted the video of himself in a fighter jet emblazoned with the phrase “King Trump” while millions of Americans marched in “No Kings” protests against his government's policies. In the clip, which was posted on his Truth Social media platform and the official White House communications X account, Mr Trump wears a green military jumpsuit and a golden crown encrusted with jewels as he flies the jet over New York City. More than seven million people across the US participated in “No Kings” protests on Saturday to demonstrate against what they saw as Mr Trump's growing authoritarianism. Senior Republican figures, including Mike Johnson, the house speaker, have derided the peaceful protests as “hate America” rallies and accused demonstrators of being linked with Antifa. Mr Trump also pushed back against being characterised as a king during an interview with Fox News on Friday. But that position appeared to change within 24 hours as he posted the “King Trump” video on social media. JD Vance also posted an AI video depicting Mr Trump as a King on Saturday. The video posted by the US vice-president showed Mr Trump donning a crown and cape before drawing a sword, with the camera then panning to a Kente cloth-clad Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats kneeling in submission. The latter video was a reference to a widely mocked photo of Ms Pelosi and several dozen other Democrats wearing the traditional African textiles and taking the knee in tribute to George Floyd after he was killed by police in 2020. The US president also referred to himself as a king in February, when he posted an AI-generated Time Magazine cover of himself wearing a crown, with the text, “long live the king”.

But his expression changed when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump, who came to Israel last week as Hamas returned the final living hostages, who had been held captive for more than two years. If it was someone other than Trump, I'm not sure all of this would have happened.” Thousands of years from now, the Jewish people will remember you,” he said, as Mr. Trump listened, nodding.

Mr. Trump's popularity has leapt across the deep political schisms that have riven Israeli society between those who favour Benjamin Netanyahu and those who have mounted street-filling protests against his agenda. Mr. Trump is something else; a man who has shown that “when push comes to shove, he's going to be there,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. A U.S. President who shows himself able to bring deliverance from hostile forces touches something existential, said Mr. Plesner. Lawrence Martin: Trump's big triumph in the Middle East will make him more autocratic than ever But Mr. Trump has also established an unusual relationship with Israelis. “Trump, the most undemocratic leader in American history, provided a responsiveness to Israeli desires that its own government refused to do,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, a public opinion researcher and political advisor based in Israel. But the current love of Mr. Trump “gives him more leverage and influence in Israel than any U.S. president I've ever known. More even than Clinton, who was truly loved by centre and left, but not by right,” said John Lyndon, executive director of Alliance for Middle East Peace, an advocacy group. The U.S. President has used language that suggests he alone will dictate what future course of action Israel chooses in Gaza. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” he said this week, when asked what would happen if Hamas refuses to disarm. Inside Gaza, local militias struggle to break free from Hamas rule For Israel, one important question is how much Mr. Trump will continue to care. “The biggest parameter is what he wants, and whether he is willing to spend his political capital and attention on the issue,” Mr. Plesner said. If not, history holds numerous examples of other failed attempts. Yet for many Israelis, there is faith that Mr. Trump can do it. “I think the guy's a moron and in some respect, he might be,” said Ilan Cohen, a former Israeli official who now lives in the U.S. Benjamin Givon, a retired mechanical engineer who lives north of Tel Aviv, believes real change is possible if Mr. Trump keeps focus on the Middle East, although he worries about what will happen if the President turns to other issues. Still, he added, “we are lucky that the crazy guy is on our side.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

This includes everything from the restoration of direct flights to sports and cultural contacts," she said. She added that both sides have about "14 days to prepare the relevant documents.

BUENOS AIRES, October 19. /TASS/. Colombian President Gustavo Petro demanded an explanation from the United States after the US military struck a boat in the territorial waters of the South American republic.

"Representatives of the U.S. government have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in our territorial waters. Fisherman Alejandro Caranza had nothing to do with drug trafficking, his daily activity was fishing," he wrote on X.

The Colombian president also appealed to the country's Prosecutor General's office to immediately provide protection to the victims' relatives and consider their participation in international trials.

On October 18, US President Donald Trump said that the US military had destroyed a large drug submarine that was heading towards the United States.</p>

The survey further found that 66% of those polled are against paying citizens' benefits to Ukrainian war refugees. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on another Trump–Zelensky meeting in Washington, following Russian President Vladimir Putin's intervention to dissuade the U.S. from supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles. Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine hand over full control of Donetsk Oblast to Russia as a condition for ending the war during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump this week, The Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials. Vienna had previously held up the sanctions over a demand that the EU compensate Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International for losses inflicted by Russian penalties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of killing an innocent fisherman during what President Donald Trump described as a strike on a drug-smuggling vessel. The US military has destroyed several boats in the Caribbean since September as part of Trump's campaign to eliminate “narcoterrorists” trafficking cocaine and fentanyl. According to Petro, a Colombian “lifelong fisherman” was killed on September 16. Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to drug traffickers and his daily activity was fishing,” Petro wrote on X on Saturday. He added that the boat was drifting due to an engine failure and sent a distress signal. “We are waiting for an explanation from the US government,” he wrote. Petro has a longstanding feud with Trump, who he accused of violating human rights during his crackdown on illegal immigrants. Last month, the US revoked Petro's visa after he called on US soldiers to disobey Trump's orders. On Saturday, Trump said a Colombian national and an Ecuadorian national picked up from a “drug-carrying submarine” would be deported to their home countries “for detention and prosecution.” He said earlier that the US destroyed the vessel, killing two of the four “known narcoterrorists” on board.
