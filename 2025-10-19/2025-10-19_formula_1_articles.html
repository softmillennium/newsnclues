GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen will start the United States Grand Prix from pole position after dominating the session.

Max Verstappen secured pole position for the United States Grand Prix, backing up his lights-to-flag victory in the Sprint, despite a timing error from Red Bull denying him a second timed effort in Q3.

The four-time World Champion set a 1m 32.510s with his first effort in Q3 to position himself at the front of the field for the second time this weekend, seeing off Lando Norris by 0.291s. Championship leader Oscar Piastri will start from sixth, after struggling throughout the session.

Q1 provided a frantic start to the action, with Isack Hadjar crashing at Turn 6 and causing the red flags to fly. Bookending the drama in the opening phase, both Lance Stroll and Alex Albon saw their times deleted for exceeding track limits, relegating them to the rear of the grid.

Need to get around Turn 1 – as we saw today, anything's possible.” Having started from P5 in the Sprint, Russell was then pushed on whether his climb up to a final result of P2 gave him confidence that he could possibly convert his fourth place on Sunday's grid into a much higher position. “Well, the Sprint ended up only being about 10 laps long and tomorrow we've got 50-odd laps, and we didn't see McLaren, so I'm not going to say I've got uber amounts of confidence going into tomorrow, but I don't think we're in a bad place,” the 27-year-old explained. The Italian ultimately claimed seventh place and, when quizzed later on what may have prevented him from going even further, answered: “Lap 1, I had on the main straight… We need to see what happened with the DRS but it didn't open, so I did the whole straight without DRS and lost a couple of tenths. It's a shame because I was hoping for better, but we look forward to tomorrow. “We didn't change so much [between the Sprint and Qualifying], to be honest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix Yuki Tsunoda was irked by perceived blocking from Liam Lawson in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, leading him to accuse the Racing Bulls driver of causing such instances "on purpose". Yuki Tsunoda has hit out at Liam Lawson for “always doing something on purpose” after complaining of being blocked by the Racing Bulls driver in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix. Their previous flashpoints included an earlier incident this weekend in Sprint Qualifying, when the two battled through the first corners in a failed bid to set a last-gasp time. Added tension exists with speculation that the two are battling for a single seat on the 2026 grid, with rumours that Isack Hadjar will join Red Bull and Formula 2 driver Arvid Lindblad could make the step up to F1 with Racing Bulls. Tsunoda, who will start the United States Grand Prix in 13th – one place behind Lawson – was further irked by blocking from one of the Alpine drivers, although he brushed this off as “maybe just miscommunication from their side”. So far, I just can't have normal Qualifying. “I think traffic is always a little bit tough around here, to be honest. “I can't possibly think where I could have been to be in front of him, but it's just one of those things.” Racing Bulls have shown strong pace across the weekend so far, but a heavy crash for Hadjar in Q1 and Lawson's Q2 exit leaves plenty of work to be done on Sunday if the team is to add to its points haul. Of his final effort, Lawson added: “We had a very fast car, we just got hit by a massive gust of wind at the start of the lap and then, from there, you're trying to make up lap time. We're all dealing with it, but we get hit at different points and unfortunately, it's cost us quite a lot of lap time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton delivered a strong Qualifying performance for Ferrari, with both drivers set to start the United States Grand Prix from the top five positions. Charles Leclerc was surprised by Ferrari's pace in Qualifying at the United States Grand Prix, as he and team mate Lewis Hamilton secured third and fifth places for Sunday's race. “I think everything will be down to the start and having free air,” he said. “If we are behind other cars after Turn 1, it is going to be tough. If we are in front of everybody, it is going to be easier, so flat out into Turn 1 tomorrow.” After battling through a difficult first year with Ferrari, the seven-time World Champion is yet to stand on a Grand Prix podium in his new colours, something which he hopes to change on Sunday. “It's the closest I've been in God knows how long,” said Hamilton. Ferrari is engaged in a finely poised battle with Mercedes and Red Bull for the Teams' Championship. With Max Verstappen on pole and both George Russell and Kimi Antonelli qualifying inside the top seven, Sunday is likely to provide another tense chapter in this fight.</p>
