Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of killing an innocent fisherman during what President Donald Trump described as a strike on a drug-smuggling vessel.

The US military has destroyed several boats in the Caribbean since September as part of Trump's campaign to eliminate “narcoterrorists” trafficking cocaine and fentanyl.

According to Petro, a Colombian “lifelong fisherman” was killed on September 16.

“US government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in our territorial waters. Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to drug traffickers and his daily activity was fishing,” Petro wrote on X on Saturday.

He added that the boat was drifting due to an engine failure and sent a distress signal. “We are waiting for an explanation from the US government,” he wrote.

Petro has a longstanding feud with Trump, who he accused of violating human rights during his crackdown on illegal immigrants. Last month, the US revoked Petro's visa after he called on US soldiers to disobey Trump's orders.

On Saturday, Trump said a Colombian national and an Ecuadorian national picked up from a “drug-carrying submarine” would be deported to their home countries “for detention and prosecution.” He said earlier that the US destroyed the vessel, killing two of the four “known narcoterrorists” on board.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday said it carried out large-scale strikes against Hamas targets in Rafah in southern Gaza following alleged violations of the ceasefire reached earlier this month.

According to the IDF, militants on Sunday fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire toward troops operating to dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” in the area “in accordance with the ceasefire agreement.” Israeli troops responded with several airstrikes on what it called terror targets.

“The IDF has begun striking in the area to eliminate the threat and dismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity,” the military said in a statement. It also claimed that several attacks by alleged Hamas militants took place on Friday and Saturday. “These terrorist actions constitute a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, and the IDF will respond firmly.”

According to a military source cited by The Times of Israel, more than 20 targets have been struck so far since the alleged attack in Rafah in the morning.

After being briefed on the situation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the IDF “to take firm action against terror targets in the Gaza Strip,” according to a statement from his office.

Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that “Hamas will learn today the hard way that the IDF is determined to protect its soldiers and to prevent any harm to them.” According to a military source, more than 20 targets have been struck so far since the attack in Rafah this morning.

“Hamas will pay a heavy price for any shooting and violation of the ceasefire, and if the message is not understood, the intensity of the responses will increase,” Katz said in a statement carried by Israeli media.

Hamas' military wing denied involvement in the Rafah incident. In a statement on social media, it said it lost ties with factions in the area last March.

“We have no information about any incidents or clashes in Rafah, which is under [Israeli] occupation control,” it said. Separately, senior Hamas official Izzat al-Risheq said the group remains committed to the ceasefire, accusing the Israeli “occupation” of violating it and “seeking excuses for its crimes.”

Gaza's Health Ministry said on Sunday that Israeli attacks had killed at least eight people in the last 24 hours.

Israel and Hamas reached a tentative ceasefire in early October as part of US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace initiative. The first phase required Hamas to free all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in return for Palestinian prisoners.

Earlier this week, the group released the final 20 surviving captives and handed over the remains of 12 others, but cited difficulties in recovering all bodies due to widespread destruction in Gaza and continued Israeli control of some areas. West Jerusalem, however, accused Hamas of failing to return the remains of 16 more hostages, while both sides are exchanging accusations of violating the truce.

Ukraine has no chance of defeating Russia even with massive Western support because it lacks the necessary manpower and does not have NATO troops on the ground, a former UK chief of the Defense Staff has said.

In an interview published on Saturday by The Independent, Field Marshal David Richards – who held his post from 2010 to 2013 and earlier commanded NATO forces in Afghanistan – accused Ukraine's backers of failing the country.

Western countries, he argued, encouraged Kiev to fight, but they have “not given them the means to win.”

“My view is that they would not win,” even if Ukraine were given all the necessary resources, he said. “They haven't got the manpower.”

According to Richards, the only scenario in which Ukraine could hope to win is a direct NATO intervention, “which we won't do because Ukraine is not an existential issue for us.”

He added that while the West is “in some sort of hybrid war” with Russia, it is “not the same as a shooting war in which our soldiers are dying in large numbers.”

“Ukraine is not an existential issue for us. It clearly is for the Russians, by the way,” Richards said.

The Ukrainian army has been on the back foot for months, with Russian forces making advances in Donbass and into Ukraine's Dnepropetrovsk Region. Russian officials have said that Ukraine would collapse within weeks if it were cut off from Western military support.

However, Russia has stated that it remains open to a diplomatic resolution of the conflict, provided its national security interests are taken into account, adding that a sustainable peace would require Ukraine to stay out of NATO, agree to demilitarization and denazification, and recognize the territorial realities on the ground.

MOSCOW, October 19. /TASS/. The signing of an agreement between Moscow and Washington would be the best outcome of a meeting of Presidents of Russia and the United States, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Budapest, former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, now head of the G.O.R.K.I. Center at St. Petersburg State University, told TASS in an interview.

""In any case, bilateral relations will also be on the agenda.

TEL AVIV, October 19. /TASS/. With the mediation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Israeli military in the Gaza strip has received two more coffins with remains of hostages who died in the enclave, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

According to the statement, the coffins will be delivered to the Israeli territory for identification.

""The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned,"" the premier's office said.

On the morning of October 13 this year, radicals from the Palestinian movement Hamas, in accordance with the peace settlement agreements in Gaza, released 20 Israeli hostages who had remained in the enclave after two years. Later that evening, through the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Israeli side received the first four coffins with the remains of the deceased abductees. Israeli authorities immediately expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that only four bodies out of 28 were returned in the first phase. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called this a deviation from the agreement and warned that further delays by the radicals would have consequences. On October 14, four more coffins were handed over to Israel.

Netanyahu announced on October 18 that the Rafah crossing on the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will remain closed ""until further notice,"" with the issue of its reopening to be considered after Hamas implements the terms of the agreement on the return of the remains of deceased hostages,.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

US consumers say price rises caused by president's tariffs contradicts his promise to make life more affordable

As a mother of two, Paige Harris has noticed a change in the way she shops for her family.

“Items that I have bought regularly have gone up in price steadily,” she said. “From hair dye to baby formula, our grocery list has gotten smaller while our budget has had to increase. Meats like steak are a no-go for our household.”

Harris, 38, lives and works as a teacher's assistant in Stella, North Carolina, and is one of almost 40 people who spoke to the Guardian about how they've been coping with the price of goods in the six months since Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariffs.

On Thursday, a study from S&P Global revealed that companies were expected to pay at least $1.2tn more in 2025 expenses than was previously anticipated. But the burden, according to the researchers, is now shifting to US consumers. They calculated that two-thirds of the “expense shock”, more than $900bn, will be absorbed by Americans. Last month, the Yale Budget Lab estimated tariffs would cost households almost $2,400 more a year.

Harris says the tariffs' impact on her daily life contradicts promises from the Trump administration to “cut prices and make living affordable for everyone”. She said: “You see prices soaring. It has become very clear that this administration did not and does not care about the everyday lives of Americans.”

Several Americans told the Guardian their weekly budgets had been drastically altered with the introduction of Trump's tariffs.

“Prices are way too high. I mostly shop at Costco and buy as little as possible anywhere else,” said Jean Meadows, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Huntsville, Alabama. “I can't imagine that stores haven't noticed the change. I think people are really afraid of what is coming.”

That sense of apprehension is reflected in a recent poll, exclusively conducted for the Guardian, where respondents identified the tariffs as the second biggest threat to the economy.

“The bread I buy has doubled in price within a year. We live on a fixed income that doesn't keep up with inflation,” said Myron Peeler, who is also retired and is the sole caregiver for his wife, who suffers from debilitating arthritis. The only saving grace, he said, is that his house and car are paid off.

Trump shows few signs of backing away from his tariff policy – a move the White House maintains will reinvigorate American manufacturing and increased revenue from trade partners.

Most recently, the president reignited a trade war with China by threatening a 100% tariff on Beijing as soon as November. This came after China moved to restrict exports of rare earth minerals needed for several everyday items from electric vehicle batteries to hospital equipment, a decision that Trump branded as “very hostile”. In an interview with Fox News, the president has admitted that the proposed tariff hike was “not sustainable”, but said he was left with little choice: “They forced me to do that”.

Currently, the average US tariffs on Chinese exports hovers around 58%, according to the Peterson Institute for Economics. It's a levy that is already taking a toll on Americans such as Michele, from north-eastern Pennsylvania.

“We need to buy new tires for a car, and can't, because affordable tires are no longer in stock and we can't afford $250 a tire,” she said.

Several people echoed Michele's feelings about availability, describing the situation as “empty shelves, higher prices”. Natalie, who lives in New Hampshire, said she hasn't seen certain pantry staples “for months”. She said: “The store shelves have become more and more bare … instead of multiple choices there may only be one or two, and name brands are being replaced by store brands.”

At 55, Natalie is semi-retired but is due to start part-time work at a supermarket, and she has seen a price rise in nearly everything she buys regularly. “Any brand of cat food has increased anywhere from 25% to double the price. One wet food my cats like went from $1.79 to $2.49 per can,” she said.

The new normal many Americans are bracing for, or already feeling, is not just the cost of groceries, for those such as Minnie, a food writer in Portland, Oregon, it's a change in lifestyle.

“I don't shop for non-essentials. No fall shopping trips for a new sweater or jeans. And we'll make all our Christmas presents this year,” said Minnie, 55. “We used to dine out once a week. Now we never eat out. Even fast-casual is insanely pricey. Everything is twice what it used to cost and we're very afraid of what's next, financially speaking.”

While the US inflation rate hovers around 2.9% – a substantial drop from the spikes of the Covid era – the tariffs haven't helped ease the impact on Americans' wallets. Richard Ulmer, 81, who has lived in Florida for 35 years, said this year has been “the worst from a financial standpoint”, adding that “everything” from his groceries to the electric bill has become more expensive.

For Cassie, a 25-year-old consultant based in Siler City, North Carolina, costs have shot up quickly compared to the “gradual price increases” during the first two years of the pandemic. Cassie has a strict $65 per week budget for groceries, but since Trump first announced his tariffs, she's been priced out of her normal routine, which included doing most of her weekly shopping at Walmart.

“Now I must visit at least four different stores in the area and other towns, often driving longer distances to find the best prices,” she said. “During the summer months and the Mexico/Latin America tariff announcement, Walmart and other stores in the area ran out of bananas for around two weeks. No one could get bananas in my area.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Connor Weston, 27, reportedly declared himself a ‘non-offending pedophile' and threatened to kill himself

An Ohio man is facing criminal charges after he allegedly stormed a stage at a Wikipedia conference in New York City with a gun – as well as a sign declaring himself a “non-offending pedophile” – and threatened to kill himself.

Connor Weston, 27, was reportedly tackled by organizers of WikiConference North America 2025, thwarting tragedy, before police said officers booked him on counts of criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment.

The Dayton resident had evidently paid to attend the four-day conference when he disrupted its opening ceremony at 9am Friday in Manhattan's Civic Hall. He jumped on to a stage at the venue, pointed a gun at his head and the ceiling, and expressed a desire to take his life while a sign draped around his neck declared him to be an “anti-contact non-offending pedophile”, police and multiple media reports said.

According to the New York Times, conference safety team member Richard Knipel rushed the stage and clutched Weston from behind amid the chaos.

The Times wrote that another conference safety team member, Andrew Lih, soon went up to help Knipel.

“I grabbed his arm,” Lih told the outlet. “He was still clutching his gun pretty hard. I pried his fingers away from it, removed it from his hands and put it down.”

A police spokesperson said that officers took Weston into custody after receiving multiple 911 calls. There were no injuries reported.

The Times reported that conference attenders thanked Knipel by lavishing him with Barnstars, which are Wikipedia's official tokens of appreciation.

The chief of the non-profit group that runs Wikipedia, Maryana Iskander, reportedly told the crowd that Knipel and Lih “have been very busy”. “I thank them for saving my life,” she added.

Knipel works for City University of New York, tasked with making its research more publicly accessible while contributing to Wikipedia and sites that are related to the famed online encyclopedia curated in real time by volunteers. Cuny in March referred to Knipel on its website as its first “Wikemedian-in-residence”, saying his job is funded by philanthropic funding from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark.

Meanwhile, the Times described Lih as a digital strategist who works with museums and libraries.

Wikipedia canceled the rest of the conference's events Friday. The gathering resumed Saturday.

Friday was apparently not the first time Weston had publicly labeled himself an “anti contact, non offending pedophile”. A social media video circulated in July shows a man providing Weston's name, age and home town; applying that term to himself; and saying he can “choose not to harm minors … but can't choose to stop being attracted to them”.

The man in the clip matched the likeness of Weston as seen in a photo taken Friday while police put him in the back of a patrol car after his arrest. In both Friday's photo and the earlier video, he had the same “anti-contact non-offending pedophile” sign.

As NBC News noted, Johns Hopkins University defines non-offending pedophiles as “a unique population of individuals who experience sexual interest in children, but despite common misperceptions, have neither had sexual contact with a child nor have accessed illegal child sexual exploitation material”.

Wikipedia has a rule indefinitely blocking and banning from the platform any editors “who identify themselves as pedophiles”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A Guardian investigation finds the US soda and snack-food industries, threatened by RFK Jr's movement to change Americans' eating habits, have turned to a group of well-connected strategists, shadowy pollsters and ‘anti-woke' influencers

Major US soft-drink and snack-food corporations are waging a coordinated campaign that aims to pit Donald Trump's Maga faithful against Robert F Kennedy Jr's Make America Healthy Again movement, a Guardian investigation in partnership with environmental watchdog Fieldnotes has found. Their goal is to stymie the Maha-led effort to curb Americans' consumption of soda and ultra-processed foods.

To carry out the plan, the companies have turned to a partially formalized network of for-hire pollsters, strategists and political financiers with deep ties to the national Republican party – several of whom have taken steps that obscure their connection to the effort and to one another. In the process, the industry has also been aided less directly by a loose coalition of free-market ideologues who have previously worked to advance Trump's deregulatory agenda.

The effort features Maga influencers hired by a firm that promotes “anti-woke” movies; an obscure research group Lee Zeldin was working for when Donald Trump picked him to lead the US Environmental Protection Agency; and a media outlet backed by rightwing billionaires Leonard Leo and Charles Koch, among others.

The ongoing influence campaign is being spearheaded by the American Beverage Association with help from the Consumer Brands Association, two prominent trade groups in the food industry. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper, the three largest soft-drink corporations in the United States, as well as packaged-food conglomerates like General Mills, Kraft Heinz, Mondelēz and Nestlé, are among those that pay dues for the right to have a say in either or both of the trade groups' strategies.

All three soda-makers identified the Maha efforts as significant threats to their bottom lines in their most recent annual reports, delivered to investors after Trump nominated Kennedy to be secretary of US Health and Human Services. Coke and Dr Pepper went as far as to suggest such risks would be compounded if unnamed “government officials” were to voice health concerns about their products. The three soda makers did not respond to questions about the lobbying effort.

The companies' most pressing political concerns are two related RFK Jr-backed efforts: one to ban schools from serving foods with petroleum-based dyes, and the other to bar individuals receiving Snap benefits from using the federal nutrition assistance to purchase soft drinks.

Their not-so-subtle message to conservative lawmakers, delivered directly by lobbyists and indirectly via both an industry front group and paid social media influencers: oppose the Maha efforts or face a Maga backlash.

“Working-class families and individuals across America rose up to vote for President Trump on the promise of a new era that would lift them up, not leave them behind again,” the beverage lobby declared earlier this year in an unsigned memo as some of the first Maha-themed nutrition efforts were gaining conservative support in places like Utah and Arkansas. Supporting the Snap restrictions, the group continued, “would betray those voters and that promise”.

To date, the Maha nutrition efforts have largely stalled inside the Beltway but found far more success outside of it. A dozen states have already requested, and received, waivers from the US Department of Agriculture allowing them to restrict how Snap benefits can be used, and roughly a half dozen have passed legislation restricting food dyes in school meals.

The Utah state representative Kristen Chevrier, a Republican whose Snap and school-meals bills were signed into law by her governor in March, says that's likely because the industry's influence is concentrated in the nation's capital. “It's easier for the big food industries to control the federal government then it is for them to control a whole bunch of different states,” she said in an interview.

Chevrier, who describes herself as “a Maha mom before Maha was a thing”, said the lobbyists who approached her focused far more on their own profits than any political backlash she might face. Their priority was “how much money they were going to lose if people stopped buying soda with Snap dollars”, she said. “The lobbyists were sitting there at the table with me and I said: ‘Do you have any idea what this sounds like? That you're more concerned about the money you're going to lose than you are about the health of the vulnerable population that you're serving?”

Communications obtained via a public records request confirm that industry lobbyists attempted to use the Maga-versus-Maha messaging in their bid to derail the nutrition bills at the state level. And they've done so with veteran GOP strategists serving as middle operatives, creating the appearance of distance between the companies and their preferred narrative.

In late February, for instance, as two Maha bills were moving through the Arizona legislature, soda lobbyist Michael Gardner reached out to lawmakers to make his client's case against the Snap legislation, which was ultimately vetoed by the governor. He closed by directing the elected officials' attention to a then-recent article headlined “Trump voters want SNAP users to be able to buy soda”. The underlying source for that claim was a poll paid for by the American Beverage Association itself.

The firm hired to conduct the survey, Public Opinion Strategies, is owned by Glen Bolger, who previously worked for the National Republican congressional committee, the House GOP's main campaign arm. The American Beverage Association paid Bolger's firm nearly $2m in 2023, the most recent year for which the trade group's tax filings are publicly available.

Bolger and his firm are also part of a larger, formal network of political shops run by Phil Cox, who was once a top executive at Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family's primary dark-money group, and who is currently on the board of the Senate Leadership Fund and WinRed. Cox's network, GP3 Partners, includes more than a dozen other firms and boasts online of its “proven ability to play with lethal precision at scale”.

Completing this particular lobbying spin-cycle – from industry-funded poll to news coverage the industry's lobbyists could use to pressure lawmakers – was the outlet in which the article about the survey appeared, the Center Square. Despite claiming to be a provider of “high-quality statehouse and statewide news”, it has been identified by journalism experts at Columbia University as a purveyor of “pink slime”, meaning, partisan talking points presented as objective journalism. The Center Square is run by the Franklin News Foundation, a conservative non-profit that has received substantial funding from Donors Trust, Leonard Leo's primary dark-money vehicle, and that is part of the State Policy Network of rightwing thinktanks backed by Leo and the Koch family. (Chris Krug, the publisher of the Center Square, said in an email: “The Center Square maintains editorial independence, free from any external influence.”)

As Gardner was working to derail Arizona's Snap bill on behalf of the soda makers, a second industry lobbyist, the Consumer Brands Association's Erin Raden, was waging a similar, albeit more convoluted, effort in opposition to the state's school-meal bill, the records show.

In a March email to one of the bill's sponsors, Raden argued against the legislation and then, much as Gardner had, closed by pointing to an article posted by a rightwing news outlet that suggested Trump voters wanted such decisions left to the president. “I know you are hosting a town hall tomorrow and thought it might come up,” Raden wrote to the Republican senator Janae Shamp, who had introduced the bill in Arizona's upper chamber.

This time, the underlying poll on which the article was based was conducted by the Tyson Group on behalf of Plymouth Union Public Research. Unlike Public Opinion Strategies, which is well-known within certain Washington DC circles and publicly discloses its ties to GP3, Tyson Group has a far smaller and less transparent public presence. Its website lists just five employees. However, the firm doesn't disclose publicly that all five of those individuals also work at P2 Public Affairs, a much larger and more prominent conservative consulting firm – one that, like Public Opinion Strategies, is also part of Cox's GP3 umbrella organization.

The metadata on an internal memo for subsequent Tyson polling likewise shows that document was created by Katherine Swetman, who is not listed on Tyson's site as an employee but is listed on P2's as a marketing manager specializing in “targeted messaging”. (P2 and Tyson did not respond to questions about their structure or involvement in the campaign. The Consumer Brands Association said in a statement that it did not pay for the poll but believes “most voters across the country” would prefer a national standard for food additives.)

Plymouth Union Public Research is even more opaque. The group, also known as PUP Research, describes itself online as a 501(c)6 non-profit, but there is currently no record of it in the Internal Revenue Service database of such tax-exempt organizations. The group did not respond to questions about its leadership and staff. The firm does, however, show up in the ethics paperwork Zeldin filed in January as part of his confirmation process. In that filing, Zeldin disclosed serving as a director at the research firm from October 2024 to the time he filed the report on 11 January 2025.

While PUP Research doesn't disclose its leadership or employees, an apparent sister organization known as Plymouth Union Public Advocacy, or PUP Advocacy, does. The advocacy firm's website suggests it launched earlier this year with a seven-figure paid campaign in support of Trump's agenda, and that it is led by a trio of GOP veterans.

The Trump administration at times pushes back on the idea that Maha's nutrition agenda is an affront to its base. Earlier this year, after the Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders applied for one of the Snap waivers, the American Beverage Association labeled Sanders and the head of the USDA, Brooke Rollins, as the “food police” on X. (The American Beverage Association's CEO, Kevin Keane, has undertaken a tour of conservative podcasts and conferences, pushing a similar line that the government shouldn't be “making decisions for people” when it comes to nutrition.)

The post drew a swift rebuke from Rollins's X account. “It's disappointing that the American Beverage Association's leadership dragged its entire membership–and the patriotic American workers and their families they employ and represent–into direct conflict with this Administration's priorities for American health, well-being, and taxpayer protection,” she wrote. “These priorities–which those same American workers voted to endorse–will prevail.” She tagged Kennedy in her response.

As industry lobbyists were making their case to lawmakers directly, an industry-funded front group, Americans for Food and Beverage Choice, was running a small-dollar Facebook ad campaign featuring the industry's Snap-related polling in at least nine states, according to the Meta ad library database. The non-profit bills itself as a grassroots organization, but according to its 2023 tax filing, the most recent available, each of the four individuals who served as either a director or officer of the organization that year also was employed at the American Beverage Association, including Keane himself.

Meanwhile, a group of Maga-aligned influencers were taking the same pro-soda message nationwide by posting client-approved talking points on Elon Musk's X – all while not disclosing they were being paid to do so. “We cannot allow ‘Make America Healthy Again' messaging to be used to force needy Americans into not buying certain things,” tweeted conservative influencer Eric Daugherty, adding: “President Trump literally has a Diet Coke button in his Oval Office.”

The paid-influencer campaign was first documented by Nick Sortor, a conservative journalist and podcaster, who obtained internal documents from the social media marketing agency behind the effort, Influenceable LLC.

“This campaign highlights the dangers of government overregulation, with a specific focus on current efforts to restrict soda purchases through food-aid programs,” the company's instructions to the influencers read. “The narrative emphasizes how such regulation is an overreach that unfairly targets consumer choice, especially considering the president himself is a Diet Coke enthusiast.” For good measure, the influencers were also encouraged to share a photo of Trump drinking a soda while riding in a golf cart.

After being called out by Sortor, Daugherty and at least one other influencer deleted their posts. “Yeah, that was dumb of me,” Daugherty posted. “Massive egg on my face. In all seriousness, it won't happen again.”

Influenceable LLC is run by Camron and Liam Rafizadeh, brothers who have made a name for themselves by trafficking in anti-LGBTQ+ memes and pro-Trump talking points online. In 2019, the pair founded Today Is America Inc, which describes itself as “the fastest-growing pro-America Gen Z, Anti-woke company”.

While Influenceable's website does not list any specific political campaigns it has worked on, IRS filings show that it was paid $110,000 in 2023 by the Center for Renewing America, a Christian-nationalist organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump's current director of the office of management and budget.

Keane has denied that the American Beverage Association was behind the Influenceable campaign. Nonetheless, the proposed talking points strongly echo the industry's – including one that appears to cite the very poll the group paid for and then used to lobby state officials in Arizona and cited in the Facebook campaign run by the front group that Keane leads. “Polling shows,” the final talking point given to the influencers reads, “a majority of Trump voters oppose restrictions on soda purchases through SNAP.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine hand over full control of Donetsk Oblast to Russia as a condition for ending the war during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump this week, The Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials.

According to the report, Putin indicated he was willing to give up parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for complete control over Donetsk.

Some White House officials described the proposal as “progress,” while a senior European diplomat cautioned that Ukraine would likely view the proposal in a very different light.

“It's like selling them their own leg in exchange for nothing,” the diplomat said.

Trump has not publicly addressed the Kremlin's demand but, following his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, urged both sides to “stop the killing and make a deal.”

This development marks a shift from Putin's earlier position in April, when he rejected a U.S. proposal to freeze hostilities along current front lines and instead insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

Putin and Trump are expected to continue discussions at a planned summit in Hungary, which is set to take place in the coming weeks.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Oct. 17 that he had spoken with Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, adding that preparations for the U.S.—Russia summit are ongoing.

As Moscow steps up its hybrid onslaught against the Baltic states, local Russian-speaking populations present a potential weak spot to exploit.

Russian is the mother tongue of roughly one-quarter and one-third of the populations of Estonia and Latvia, respectively, two small nations at NATO's eastern frontier.

Adopting a ""wartime"" mentality — fueled by the war in Ukraine and Russian aerial incursions — Tallinn and Riga increasingly see this minority as a potential risk, says Vendula Kazlauskas, an expert on the Baltic region at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs.

Seeking to curb Moscow's influence, Latvia and Estonia are phasing out the Russian language in education, tightening immigration rules, and targeting Russian-linked organizations.

These steps are driven both by security concerns and by the need for a ""greater integration of the Russian-speaking minority,"" Kazlauskas explains.

After enjoying three decades of independence, the Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Following the end of World War II, while not recognized by the West, it remained in place until the 1990s.

The large Russian-speaking and ethnically Russian populations in the Baltic states are primarily the result of forced resettlement, immigration, and Russification policies implemented during the Soviet era.

Many Russian speakers in Latvia and Estonia remain stateless or hold Russian passports. Roughly 40,000 people in Latvia are Russian citizens, and over 80,000 in Estonia.

It's their own choice.

Those living in Latvia and Estonia can obtain a local passport and integrate if they pass the citizenship test, which narrows down to language proficiency and knowledge of the country's history.

Analysts say Russia has long been employing propaganda to target Russian speakers in the Baltics — some of whom have little knowledge of local languages — to sway public opinion and sow division.

""Russia persistently seeks to influence Estonia's Russian-speaking community,"" Igor Gretskiy, a researcher at the Tallinn-based International Center for Defense and Security (ICDS) think tank, told the Kyiv Independent.

""To that end, Russia weaponizes virtually every sphere of human activity: language, culture, sports, and so on.""

Marek Kohv, a former Estonian defense official and a security expert at the ICDS, adds that Russia is using social media and online portals to promote narratives about the ""decline of the West"" and alleged oppression of Russian speakers.

These efforts only gained pace when Moscow launched its all-out aggression against Ukraine.

""After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we have seen a significant intensification of (Russian) influence activity in Estonia,"" Joosep Kaasik, the deputy secretary general for Internal Security at Estonia's Interior Ministry, told the Kyiv Independent.

In both Estonia and Latvia, attitudes toward the war in Ukraine vary notably between Russian-speaking and national-language communities.

Surveys showed that the Russian-speakers are less likely to blame Russia for the start of the war and are more skeptical about Ukraine's chances to liberate its territory than their compatriots.

Yet the Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltics are far from monolithic.

The 2025 yearbook by KAPO, Estonia's internal security agency, says that the Kremlin's support base in the country is primarily composed of older residents and is dissipating rapidly.

Reacting to this development, Russia ""seeks to engage Estonia's Russian-speaking youth and draw them into its informational and value sphere,"" Kohv told the Kyiv Independent.

This propaganda campaign aligns with other hybrid operations, including cyberattacks, bomb threats, espionage, and vandalism, acts sometimes carried out by local Russians.

Recent weeks saw tensions surge in the region after three Russian fighter jets violated Estonian airspace on Sept. 19, just 10 days after Poland downed several Russian drones over its territory.

Russian drones have also ""strayed"" into the Lithuanian and Latvian airspace during past attacks on Ukraine.

As Western officials raise alarms about a possible open clash between Moscow and NATO in the coming years — a conflict where the Baltics would be at the front line — Riga and Tallinn try to ensure their entire populations are on their side.

After the all-out war in Ukraine broke out, both Latvia and Estonia took steps to better integrate their Russian-speaking minorities — a strategy that drew ire from Moscow.

The Latvian parliament amended its immigration laws in 2022 and again in 2024, mandating that Russian nationals living in the country pass a basic language test and undergo a security check.

Around 2,600 Russian citizens left the country in response, while 841 who failed to meet the requirements are facing deportation.

Estonia, in turn, barred non-EU citizens from voting in local elections, a move that primarily affected Russian citizens who did not have local passports.

Latvia passed a law on the separation of the Latvian Orthodox Church from the Russian Orthodox Church in 2022, while Estonia approved similar legislation three years later.

The two countries are also phasing out Russian as the language of instruction in education to improve national language skills.

""However, the steps taken by both countries are a double-edged sword,"" Kazlauskas says.

""While understandable given their internal situation, security concerns, and historical experience,"" Russian propaganda can use them to ""justify the need to 'protect' oppressed Russian-speaking compatriots — potentially serving as a pretext for aggression.""

Criticism came even from the West, as the Council of Europe chastised both countries over their new language laws.

But local authorities say firmly that these efforts are aimed at safeguarding national security and social cohesion.

""We cannot – and we should not – simply ignore the fact that our population (or part of it) is systematically targeted by propaganda and disinformation by the Russian regime,"" Estonia's Kaasik told the Kyiv Independent.

""For our small nation, countering this long-term threat is a question of self-preservation.""

Ukrainian soldier and chess grandmaster Ihor Kovalenko won the individual gold medal at the European Team Chess Championships, The Guardian reported on Oct. 17, citing tournament organizers.

Kovalenko, 36, had not competed in chess for three years while serving on the front lines. He returned to competitive playing just a month ago, and is currently ranked world No. 48.

His performance, 6.5 points out of 8, secured him the highest percentage score of the entire event and helped Ukraine win team gold in the open category and silver in the women's event.

Kovalenko achieved key victories, including one over Serbia's reigning European champion Aleksander Indjic, and held England's Gawain Jones to a draw in the final round.

According to a chess.com feature, Kovalenko serves as a radio operator in Ukraine's army, enduring frequent 12-hour shifts in trenches. 

For his service, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded him the order “For Courage” in 2023.

Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has accused the Trump administration of assassination.RODRIGO ARANGUA/AFP/Getty Images

U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country's leader “does nothing to stop” drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America.

In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as “an illegal drug dealer” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” He warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.” Colombia's defence minister, Pedro Sánchez, defending Petro and the nation's drug-fighting commitment, said, “If there's a country that has used all its capabilities and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking ... it's Colombia.”

Trump, while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, wrote on his Truth Social platform that Petro is “strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields” across Colombia, which the Republican president initially misspelled as Columbia before deleting his post and replacing it the correct spelling of the country. “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,” Trump said.

“AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA,” Trump said. He also said Petro had “a fresh mouth toward America.”

Hours later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. strike in the waters off South America, this time against a vessel he said was associated with a Colombian rebel group – the National Liberation Army, or ELN – and was carrying “substantial amounts of narcotics,” but did not say how that was known to U.S. intelligence agencies. He said on social media that three men aboard were killed in the Friday attack. A brief video clip he attached showed a boat in flames after an explosion. The State Department designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.

Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after a U.S. strike Thursday in Caribbean waters. The U.S. said on Saturday it was repatriating to Colombia and Ecuador two survivors from that attack, the sixth since early September. With Hegseth's announcement, at least 32 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers.

There was no immediate reaction from the ELN, with which Petro suspended peace talks in January after a violent incursion on the border with Venezuela. The group has denied involvement in drug trafficking, but Colombian authorities regularly report the dismantling of cocaine laboratories and the seizure of drugs believed to belong to the guerrillas.

U.S. strike on Caribbean boat leaves survivors, official says

In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to co-operate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia is the world's largest exporter of cocaine, and the cultivation of the critical ingredient of coca leaves reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations.

More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump's commands. “I ask all the soldiers of the United States' army, don't point your rifles against humanity” and “disobey the orders of Trump,” Petro said.

Petro said a Colombian man was killed in a Sept. 16 strike and identified him as Alejandro Carranza, a fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He said that Carranza has no ties to drug trafficking and that his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit.

“U.S. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote on X. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. We await explanations from the US government.”

Petro said that he has alerted the attorney-general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing.

“The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar's homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,” Petro wrote.

Meanwhile, Noticias Caracol, a Colombian news program, reported that the man injured in the most recent strike was hospitalized after he was repatriated and remains in serious condition.

It quoted Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti as saying that the Colombian “will be prosecuted, he will be received – forgive the harsh expression – as a criminal, because so far what is known is that he was carrying a boat full of cocaine, which in our country is a crime, and despite the fact that it was in international waters, his repatriation will be as if he were being prosecuted in the United States.”

Petro said the man had been aboard a “narco submarine.”

Ecuador's Ministry of the Interior confirmed in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Sunday that the U.S. had repatriated an Ecuadorian man injured in the most recent strike. Officials identified him as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila and said a doctor found him to be in good health.

The ministry noted that two prosecutors met with Tufiño Chila and determined he had not committed any crimes within the country's borders and that there was no evidence to the contrary.

Two tear-stained years have weighed heavy on Jojo Rabia. Nearly every day since his two sons were killed by Hamas-led militants, he has come to a memorial built at the site of a desert music festival where hundreds died.

“Every day is like this. The same,” Mr. Rabia said this week, his face grim. 

But his expression changed when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump, who came to Israel last week as Hamas returned the final living hostages, who had been held captive for more than two years.

“Oh, he's the man,” Mr. Rabia said with a wide grin. 

“Look, he brought back all the hostages. It's unbelievable. If it was someone other than Trump, I'm not sure all of this would have happened.”

Mr. Trump has grown accustomed to flattery, the language employed by friends and foes alike as they seek to gain favours and avoid his wrath.

But perhaps nowhere else on earth is the U.S. President as universally adored as he is in Israel, where his recent success in negotiating the release of the hostages has won him the ability to shape the future of the country like few other presidents – and heroic status. 

At the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, he was lauded by Speaker Amir Ohana as “a giant of Jewish history,” a “colossus who will be enshrined in the pantheon of history. Thousands of years from now, the Jewish people will remember you,” he said, as Mr. Trump listened, nodding.

For many in Israel, this was a fitting description, not hyperbole. Mr. Trump's popularity has leapt across the deep political schisms that have riven Israeli society between those who favour Benjamin Netanyahu and those who have mounted street-filling protests against his agenda.

In Israel, Mr. Netanyahu is a mere politician. Mr. Trump is something else; a man who has shown that “when push comes to shove, he's going to be there,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.

The support of the U.S. has always been fundamental to the national interests of a Jewish state in a primarily Muslim region. A U.S. President who shows himself able to bring deliverance from hostile forces touches something existential, said Mr. Plesner.

“People feel it on a personal level.”

Lawrence Martin: Trump's big triumph in the Middle East will make him more autocratic than ever

But Mr. Trump has also established an unusual relationship with Israelis. He and his envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff, lent an ear to those who suffered from the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. They personally engaged with families of hostages when those families complained that they struggled to communicate with their own leadership in Israel. 

“Trump, the most undemocratic leader in American history, provided a responsiveness to Israeli desires that its own government refused to do,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, a public opinion researcher and political advisor based in Israel.

Israelis have felt affection for other U.S. leaders before.

But the current love of Mr. Trump “gives him more leverage and influence in Israel than any U.S. president I've ever known. More even than Clinton, who was truly loved by centre and left, but not by right,” said John Lyndon, executive director of Alliance for Middle East Peace, an advocacy group. 

With that comes the ability to have an effect on the future of the Middle East, if Mr. Trump so chooses. The U.S. President has used language that suggests he alone will dictate what future course of action Israel chooses in Gaza. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” he said this week, when asked what would happen if Hamas refuses to disarm. 

“Here we are, basically handing over the reins over whether Israel can go to war or not to the American president,” said Ms. Scheindlin. “It's rather remarkable that Trump gets to decide. But that's the reality.”

Inside Gaza, local militias struggle to break free from Hamas rule

For Israel, one important question is how much Mr. Trump will continue to care. The release of the hostages was a dramatic moment. Seeking middle ground between Israelis and Palestinians, by contrast, is a problem that has resisted a satisfactory solution for many generations.

“The biggest parameter is what he wants, and whether he is willing to spend his political capital and attention on the issue,” Mr. Plesner said. “If he is, we can really witness a historic change in a positive way.”

If not, history holds numerous examples of other failed attempts. Yet for many Israelis, there is faith that Mr. Trump can do it. 

“I think the guy's a moron and in some respect, he might be,” said Ilan Cohen, a former Israeli official who now lives in the U.S. But, he said, “in view of what he did, I give a lot of respect to his skill.”

Benjamin Givon, a retired mechanical engineer who lives north of Tel Aviv, believes real change is possible if Mr. Trump keeps focus on the Middle East, although he worries about what will happen if the President turns to other issues.

“I know what will happen, which is that after a while, maybe two months, he will go on to the next thing. And we will have to stay here to solve the problem ourselves,” Mr. Givon said.

Still, he added, “we are lucky that the crazy guy is on our side.”

Thieves used a basket lift to enter the Louvre, the world's most visited museum, on Sunday morning.Thibault Camus/The Associated Press

In a minutes-long strike Sunday inside the world's most-visited museum, thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre 's façade, forced a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said.

The daylight heist about 30 minutes after opening, with visitors already inside, was among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory and comes as staff complained that crowding and thin staffing are straining security.

The theft unfolded just 250 meters (270 yards) from the Mona Lisa, in what Culture Minister Rachida Dati described as a professional “four-minute operation.”

One object was later found outside the museum, Dati said. French media identified it as the emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III's wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds. It was reportedly recovered broken.

Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine. No one was hurt.

Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing façade near a construction zone, since removed – the thieves' entry point and, observers said, a striking vulnerability for a palace-museum.

Around 9:30 a.m., several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the vitrines, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift.

Their target was the gilded Apollon Gallery – where the royal collection and the Crown Diamonds are displayed, including the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia.

Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said thieves broke into two display cases and fled on scooters. Among nine pieces reportedly taken were a parure with matching necklace and earrings, a brooch and two crowns – an imperial suite prized for 19th-century craftsmanship and provenance, French media reported.

“It's a major robbery,” Nuñez said, noting that security measures at the Louvre had been strengthened in recent years and would be reinforced further as part of the museum's upcoming overhaul plan.

Famous museum heists from around the world

The thieves are believed to have approached via the riverfront façade, where construction is under way, used a freight elevator to reach the hall with a 23-item collection, according to French media.

The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday for the forensic investigation to begin as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine.

Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre – with visitors present – ranks among Europe's most audacious in recent history, and at least since Dresden's Green Vault museum in 2019.

It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.

The heist reportedly focused on the museum's Gallerie d'Apollon, pictured here in 2020.STEPHANE DE SAKUTIN/AFP/Getty Images

Security around marquee works remains tight – the Mona Lisa sits behind bulletproof glass in a climate-controlled case – but Sunday's theft also underscored that protections are not uniformly as robust across the museum's more than 33,000 objects.

The theft is a fresh embarrassment for a museum already under scrutiny.

“How can they ride a lift to a window and take jewels in the middle of the day?” said Magali Cunel, a French teacher from near Lyon. “It's just unbelievable that a museum this famous can have such obvious security gaps.”

The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence. Another notorious episode came in 1956, when a visitor hurled a stone at her world-famous smile, chipping paint near her left elbow and hastening the move to display the work behind protective glass.

Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo's Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi's carved laws; Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People; Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa. The objects – from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe's masters – draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.

Thieves used a basket lift to break into the Louvre on Sunday morning, forced a window, smashed display cases and escaped with jewels of 'inestimable value,' France's interior minister said, as the world's most visited museum closed for the day during the investigation.

The heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament.

“The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,” Bardella wrote on X. “This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?”

The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long “Louvre New Renaissance” plan – about €700 million ($760 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.

Forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of “inestimable” historical value.

Recovery may prove difficult. “It's unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,” said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds. “Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.”

Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter.

Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.

France's Interior Ministry said jewels of ""inestimable value"" were taken from the world-renowned museum in a seven-minute heist. 

A break-in at the Louvre in the French capital Paris on Sunday saw suspected criminals make off with ""priceless"" jewelry, according to France's culture minister.

Rachida Dati said the incident occurred as the museum, one of the world's most famous, opened its doors Sunday morning.

""A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,"" she wrote on X. The museum confirmed it would be closed for the day ""for exceptional reasons.""

On Sunday evening, the culture ministry said nine objects had been stolen from the Paris museum. One of the items was recovered nearby, most likely after being dropped by the alleged thieves as they fled.

""Two high-security display cases were targeted, and eight objects of invaluable cultural heritage were stolen,"" the ministry said. 

One of the stolen items is an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon gave his wife Empress Marie Louise. 

Interior Minister Laurent Nunez described the incident as a ""major robbery.""

He said the burglars, armed with small chainsaws, used a basket lift to reach the targeted room. They fled on motorbikes with the stolen jewelry.

""The investigation has begun, and a detailed list of the stolen items is being compiled. Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value,"" the French Interior Ministry said.

The Louvre's most notorious theft occurred in 1911, when the Mona Lisa was stolen by a former employee. Recovered two years later in Florence, the heist helped turn Leonardo da Vinci's portrait into the world's best-known artwork.

Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors.

The JCPOA imposed significant restrictions on Iran, in exchange for sanctions relief, to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.

Iran says it is no longer bound by restrictions on its nuclear program, as a landmark 2015 deal with world powers officially expired.

From now on, ""all of the provisions (of the deal), including the restrictions on the Iranian nuclear program and the related mechanisms, are considered terminated,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, capped Iran's nuclear activity, uranium stockpiles and research efforts in exchange for sanctions relief.

The agreement officially expired Saturday, 10 years after its adoption by the UN Security Council.

""Iran firmly expresses its commitment to diplomacy,"" the Foreign Ministry said.

Over the years, Western powers accused Iran of obstructing UN inspections and enriching uranium close to weapons-grade levels.

President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the agreement during his first term in 2018.

Since then, there have been stop-and-start talks between Iran and Western powers to revive the deal, but negotiations have stalled.

Iran suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after the United States and Israel bombed Iran's nuclear facilities in June.

In August, Britain, France and Germany jointly notified the UN Security Council that Iran was in significant violation of the nuclear deal, triggering the reinstatement of suspended international sanctions.

The three European powers announced last week they would resume discussions aimed at finding a ""comprehensive, durable and verifiable agreement.""

However, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran does ""not see any reason to negotiate"" with the Europeans, given they triggered the snapback mechanism to automatically reimpose sanctions.

Beijing is standing firm in its trade dispute with Washington — and finding new partners along the way. The higher the tariffs, the more China's confidence seems to grow.

A recent picture that's gone viral in the United States captures the prevailing mood among Americans: a clear plastic bag containing an American flag, labeled ""Made in China.""

For supporters of US President Donald Trump, it's proof that something is deeply wrong with the US economy. They've called on ""patriots"" to boycott Chinese goods.

But can America really afford to cut ties? Is the free flow of mutually traded goods like rare earths, smartphones, soybeans and microchips at risk of becoming a victim of the fight for geopolitical dominance?

Were all trade between the two world powers to cease, experts say the US economy would struggle more than Chinese economy. Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) in Washington D.C. said the mutual dependence of both sides ""remains quite high.""

""Despite economic security concerns, both sides still gain significantly from trade,"" he told DW.

However, the US-China trade gap is quite significant. Over the past decade, the US trade deficit with China has widened from $295 billion (€252 billion) to $382 billion. In 2024, China exported goods worth $526 billion to the US — more than triple what it imported.

Chinese products are part of everyday life in America. Of those imports, $127 billion were smartphones and computers. Any new tariffs would hit US consumers directly.

Trump's 100% tariffs have angered Beijing, but unlike Europe, China is responding with defiance. Government officials in Beijing have vowed to ""fight to the end"" and urged Washington to ""correct its approach,"" warning in an October 13 statement on social media platform X that ""threatening high tariffs is not the right way to deal with China.""

Beijing has already retaliated by imposing counter-tariffs and export restrictions, including on the rare-earth minerals critical to electric vehicles, semiconductors and defense technology. The US depends on imports for more than 90% of its rare earth supply — over 80% of which comes from China. Beijing controls about 60% of global rare-earth production and nearly 90% of refining capacity.

The US-China rift extends beyond minerals. Since May, China hasn't bought a single soybean from the US, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Last year, those exports were worth nearly $13 billion. Now, China buys from Brazil and Argentina instead.

The soybean boycott and rare-earth restrictions are Beijing's response to Washington's tightening chip export controls, first imposed in 2022 to curb China's access to advanced technology and artificial intelligence (AI).

Christina Otte from the German state-run foreign investment agency, Germany Trade & Invest (GTAI), argues the US is likely more dependent on China than the other way around.

""While the US remains a key market for Chinese goods, its importance has steadily declined since Trump's first term,"" she told DW.

According to news agency Bloomberg, China has successfully redirected exports once bound for the US to other regions.

Between September 2024 and September 2025, shipments to Africa rose 56%, the agency reported — to Southeast Asia 16%, to the EU 14%, and to Latin America 15%.

""The US now ranks behind ASEAN [Southeast Asian trade bloc] and roughly on par with the EU,"" said Otte. ""In the first half of 2025, bilateral trade fell more than 10% year over year.""

Chinese firms are also ""expanding production in countries like Vietnam and Malaysia to keep supplying the US market indirectly,"" she added.

In addition, China is also cutting financial ties to the heavily indebted US. Its holdings of US Treasury securities have dropped from $1.3 trillion in 2013 to $765 billion this year, according to data from the US Federal Reserve. China now ranks behind Japan and the UK among foreign holders of US debt.

Despite this slow disengagement, trade remains crucial for the two superpowers.

""China still relies on US supplies in aerospace, high-performance chips and semiconductors,"" said Kennedy, adding that Chinese products, in turn, remain deeply embedded in American supply chains.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are expected to meet later this month at the APEC Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. Both sides hope to ease tensions before the tariff spiral spins further out of control.

Kennedy is optimistic, stressing that the US-China relationship is ""still quite resilient.""

""Chimerica"" is the term he uses to describe US-Chinese interdependency, which may be ""bruised, but it's not dead — and it won't disappear easily.""

Donald Trump has shared an AI-generated video of himself as a fighter pilot wearing a crown and bombing protestors with a brown liquid.

A day after insisting on Fox News that he is “not a king”, the US president posted the video of himself in a fighter jet emblazoned with the phrase “King Trump” while millions of Americans marched in “No Kings” protests against his government's policies.

In the clip, which was posted on his Truth Social media platform and the official White House communications X account, Mr Trump wears a green military jumpsuit and a golden crown encrusted with jewels as he flies the jet over New York City.

With the song “Danger Zone” by Kenny Loggins blaring in the background, the jet bombs unsuspecting “No Kings” protesters marching through Times Square with what appears to be faeces.

More than seven million people across the US participated in “No Kings” protests on Saturday to demonstrate against what they saw as Mr Trump's growing authoritarianism.

Senior Republican figures, including Mike Johnson, the house speaker, have derided the peaceful protests as “hate America” rallies and accused demonstrators of being linked with Antifa.

Mr Trump also pushed back against being characterised as a king during an interview with Fox News on Friday.

“They say they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,” he said.

But that position appeared to change within 24 hours as he posted the “King Trump” video on social media.

JD Vance also posted an AI video depicting Mr Trump as a King on Saturday.

The video posted by the US vice-president showed Mr Trump donning a crown and cape before drawing a sword, with the camera then panning to a Kente cloth-clad Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats kneeling in submission.

The latter video was a reference to a widely mocked photo of Ms Pelosi and several dozen other Democrats wearing the traditional African textiles and taking the knee in tribute to George Floyd after he was killed by police in 2020.

The US president also referred to himself as a king in February, when he posted an AI-generated Time Magazine cover of himself wearing a crown, with the text, “long live the king”.

Protesters in hundreds of US cities marched against Mr Trump's broad expansion of presidential powers, including the deployment of the National Guard and ICE in Democrat-led cities.

Left-wing politicians, including Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker, delivered speeches and posted videos of themselves in attendance.

Despite fears of violence and multiple states mobilising Guard troops, organisers said the protests were largely peaceful.

The speakers are all New Yorkers, all women, and all black or Hispanic. It is no great surprise they each voted for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist member of Congress, last year.

“She's like that sister that will always defend you,” says Roselyn in a focus group, explaining the appeal of the young, outspoken progressive campaigner who is tipped for big things in the Democratic Party.

“She'll fight, she'll scream till a bloody pulp if she had to. You know, she's truly a fighter.”

And then comes the kicker: that part of a New York spirit that she shares with Donald Trump?

“Oh yes. So much so that they could be brother and sister,” says Roselyn, who lives in a New York district that not only elected hard-Left Ms Ocasio-Cortez – known as AOC – but also saw Mr Trump's share of the vote surge by 11 points.

The four women, interviewed by JL Partners, cited immigration and the cost of living as two policy areas that were important to them.

At the same time, sheer star power was key to the candidates' popular appeal.

“They're very outspoken,” said Margaret. “They really have, I think, no filter.”

Whether by design or accident, it is just the latest example of how Democratic politicians are shaping the policy and style playbook developed by Mr Trump during his tumultuous 10 years in politics.

It has generated a wave of copycat leaders around the world and upended politics at home.

Nine months into his second presidency, Mr Trump is at what could be the pinnacle of his power. He is facing down Democratic opponents in Washington, where the federal government has been shut down, and has delivered a ceasefire and prisoner-swap deal in Gaza.

Where he was stymied and stalled by infighting, investigations and the courts during his first presidency, this time around he has rebuilt the administration in his own pugilistic image, staffed by the uber loyalists who rallied around him after his 2020 election defeat.

And where once Michelle Obama fired up supporters with the motto, “When they go low, we go high,” Democrats are increasingly relying on a different approach: If you can't beat them, join them.

Gavin Newsom, the California governor and likely 2028 presidential contender, has adopted a more confrontational social media presence.

His office posted the below message, as it reacted to efforts to create more Republican congressional districts.

DONALD TRUMP, THE LOWEST POLLING PRESIDENT IN RECENT HISTORY, THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!! (THE NEXT ONE IS THE LAST ONE!). STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES. PRESS CONFERENCE COMING — HOSTED…

Followers have backed him with AI-generated memes, just like Mr Trump's supporters have done. There are pictures of the governor riding a dinosaur, shirtless, firing pistols in the air, or receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, trolling the president's aspiration.

In a similar vein, Jasmine Crockett, a congresswoman from Texas, was recently branded “A Democrat for the Trump era,” by The Atlantic.

When conservative rival Marjorie Taylor Greene ridiculed her lavish fake eyelashes during a committee hearing, Ms Crockett hit straight back. She blasted Ms Greene's “bleach-blond, bad-built, butch body” in a clip that soon went viral.

And of course there is merchandise. She now sells B6 T-shirts from her “clap back collection” for $25.

On another occasion, she deployed a Trumpian nickname. She called Greg Abbott, the Texas governor who uses a wheelchair, as “Governor Hot Wheels”.

Poll after poll has suggested that Democrats, rocked by losing both houses of Congress and the White House, are hungry for strong leadership.

Their model is built around economic populism, complete with tariffs and an industrial policy, and an appetite for publicly shaming corporations, free markets and billionaires.

Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic socialist who is odds-on to be the next New York mayor in a few weeks, has propelled himself from an outlier to frontrunner by leaning into this new flavour of politics.

This time last year nobody had heard of the 33-year-old, but through a combination of slick social media videos and pithy campaign promises Mr Mamdani defied the polls and trounced Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary.

So impressive was his ability to use tools like TikTok to connect with voters, he won praise from Republican loyalists including Tucker Carlson and Mrs Taylor Greene.

Like Mr Trump, Mr Mamdani positioned himself as the outsider, the anti-establishment candidate, an image that only grew as billionaire donors and the US president coalesced around Mr Cuomo after he re-entered the race as an independent.

In this week's mayoral debate Mr Mamdani painted himself as the only candidate willing to stand up to Mr Trump, emulating some of the Republican leader's fighting talk.

Calling his opponent Mr Cuomo a “puppet”, Mr Mamdani vowed that if Mr Trump continued to verbally attack New York, “he's going to have to get through me as the next mayor of the city”.

The parallels are striking, according to Susan Del Percio, a Republican strategist in New York who was critical of the Trump campaign.

“He is running on a populist economic theme, certainly, but it is also one of personality, of strong personality that is totally focused on winning but not too concerned about whether or not you can deliver, because winning is what matters,” she said.

The style is a marked shift from the sort of measured, consultative approaches favoured by traditional corporate management models, according to leadership expert Laura Bouttell, the managing director of Quarterdeck.

Instead she called it “personality as strategy”.

“It's very interesting because despite being an unlikeable character in many ways, he creates an enormous following,” she said. “He's got huge charisma. He is incredibly self serving, but he also manages to get a big, loyal following.”

In a recent analysis, she set out the three main aspects of his personality identified by psychologists and how they could be helpful.

His “ambitious and self-serving” side can be seen as an unshakeable confidence that inspires people around him to push on despite, for example, market uncertainty.

His “dominant and controlling” side is well-suited to crises, delivering quick decisions and clear messaging, even if it can also mean autocratic behaviour and ill-considered outcomes.

And his “outgoing and gregarious” side is seen in an informal, dynamic and at times grandiose style that helps him connect with audiences in ways that other leaders cannot match.

She told The Telegraph it was a style well-suited to the US in the short-term but is less sustainable in the longer term.

“I think those ambitious, self-serving and dominant controlling behaviours, they're only working for him at the moment because of the context that America finds itself in,” she said, referencing global uncertainty, conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, and domestic tension.

Mr Trump's influence around the world was on display at the White House this week when he entertained Javier Milei, his Argentinian counterpart on Wednesday.

“It's a great honour to have the leader of Argentina... he's Maga all the way, it's ‘Make Argentina Great Again,'” said Mr Trump as he sat across the table from the Argentinian president in the Cabinet Room.

“I think he's really on the verge of tremendous economic success.”

In recent years, Right-wing leaders across the world have been emulating Mr Trump's success.

Politicians once dismissed as outsiders have seen their embrace of the Republican leader's brand of politics translate into votes.

Japan's far-Right Sanseito party had a resounding success in this year's election.

After campaigning on a nationalist “Japan First” platform and warning of a “silent invasion of foreigners” the party went from holding one to 15 seats in the 248-seat chamber.

Launched in 2020 during the Covid pandemic, the party began by spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations on YouTube but broke into mainstream politics this year.

Sohei Kamiya, Sanseito's leader, previously said he had drawn inspiration from Mr Trump's “bold political style”. The party now has an international arm which is trying to woo allies in Mr Trump's orbit such as Steve Bannon.

Days before he was assassinated in Utah, Charlie Kirk attended an event hosted by Sanseito in Tokyo and Mr Kamiya had been in talks to appear at Kirk's AmericaFest conference.

In 2022 Giorgia Meloni swept to power after her hard-Right Brothers of Italy party transformed from a fringe movement to winning 26 per cent of the vote.

Her campaign promise to establish a naval blockade across the Mediterranean Sea to prevent migrants reaching Italy echoed the sentiment of Mr Trump's wall to keep migrants from crossing the US border with Mexico.

The first female prime minister of Italy is regarded as one of Europe's top Trump whisperers.

During his visit to Egypt last week Mr Trump turned to Ms Meloni, called her “beautiful” and later praised her as “an inspiration to all”.

In the UK, Nigel Farage's hardline immigration stance and pledge to “make Britain great again” has seen him flip the applecart of national politics with Reform UK.

Once written off as a fringe party, Reform, which currently holds four parliamentary seats, has for months been polling ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives.

Mr Farage has for years boasted of his friendship with Mr Trump, having attended his election party in Mar-a-Lago and appeared at rallies. Testifying to Congress about free speech in Britain last month Mr Farage described the US president as a figure he “greatly admired”.

Arguably, nobody has charted Mr Trump's political trajectory more closely than Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who mimicked the Republican's meteoric political rise, fall and conviction.

The far-Right politician won a resounding victory in 2018 despite lacking the political machinery of his opponents by running as an outsider bent on smashing what he claimed was a corrupt political system.

He used social media to promote his fiery rhetoric, often using slurs against minorities, thrilling his followers who viewed him as an authentic straight shooter.

After losing the next election, Bolsonaro refused to concede to his opponent Lula da Silva and last month was sentenced 27 years in prison after being found guilty of plotting a military coup.

Foreign leaders, or at least their advisers, sat up and took notice of Mr Trump's direct communications style during his first presidency.

Both his “Twitter diplomacy” and his habit of directly appealing to his audience to shape debates were groundbreaking innovations, according to a former No 10 strategist who worked for Theresa May.

“When I was in Downing Street during Trump 1.0, we were trying to do direct to camera messages. And I think people had done formal, say, Easter messages and so on, but no one had thought to do it with messages shaping the agenda.”

Polls indicated that the media were even less trusted than politicians, he added, so it made sense to go straight to voters.

But while Mr Trump's 2016 victory helped usher in a wave of Right-wing populism, the nationalist movement that has taken shape in Europe over the past decade was gaining ground before the Republican's defeat of Hillary Clinton.

It was three years earlier that David Cameron attempted to appease Eurosceptics by promising a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.

The UK voted for Brexit in June 2016, five months before Mr Trump was elected.

Recommended

While some Right-wing figures have seen their popularity swell in the wake of Mr Trump's political success, some Left-wing politicians have won key elections in a rejection of Trumpism.

In Canada, Mark Carney beat his Conservative Party opponent Pierre Poilievre in what was largely seen as a referendum on which politician could best protect the country from Mr Trump's ambitions to turn it into the 51st state.

In Australia, Anthony Albanese's centre-Left government was re-elected in May after voters rejected his conservative rival Peter Dutton, who was branded a “Temu Trump” for a campaign that hinged on migration.

And in the UK, Sir Keir Starmer became the first Labour leader to win an election since Tony Blair with a landslide victory over Rishi Sunak.

As a moderate centrist, the Labour Prime Minister has little in common with Mr Trump. He looked deeply uncomfortable when he sat beside the president at his Scottish golf course and was lectured on how to win the next UK election with policies of halting immigration, abandoning wind power and cutting taxes.

Yet, Sir Keir has adopted elements of the American president's communications style at times.

He promised to “build baby build” as he announced plans to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales – a play on the president's “drill baby drill” oil policy.

And when he visited the White House in February, he delivered the sort of hyperbole and theatrics that is out of keeping with his usual middle-of-the-road lawyerly manner.

“This is really special,” he said after presenting the president with an invitation from the King for a second state visit.

“This has never happened before. This is unprecedented.”

It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board.
    


            “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”
    


            The strikes are a part of the Trump administration's hardening stance against South American countries involved in smuggling illicit drugs into the US. The president recently authorized the CIA to operate in Venezuela and has been weighing military action inside of the country as part of a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro.
    


            Trump has also clashed publicly with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US last week of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of its Caribbean ship strikes. Trump announced Sunday he would be canceling all US payments and subsidies to the country.

            There's a remarkable new report from the CNN Investigates team about crypto ATMs, devices that may be at your corner store and which allow people to exchange money for cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin.

Crypto crime scene: How the companies behind crypto ATMs profit as Americans lose millions to scams



            I was struck by the detail that CNN documented at least a dozen potential fraud cases tied to a single ATM. That's an indication not just that one ATM has a problem, but that these cases of fraud are rampant in the US.
    


            Shame at being duped may keep many people from reporting that they've fallen victim to fraud, and when they do, authorities are frequently at a loss to help. But now, by using crypto ATMS — there's probably one near your house — scammers have changed the way things work. And companies that operate the machines are profiting from it.
    


            The companies behind these crypto ATMs strongly disputed allegations that they profit from scams and listed various efforts to protect consumers. There's more about all of that in the story.
    


            I talked to three of the CNN reporters who worked on the investigation, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Curt Devine, and Majlie de Puy Kamp. They answered my questions by email. Our conversation is below:
    


What made you realize these crypto ATMS were a story? Was it something specific?



            We previously wrote about state attorneys general attending lavish foreign trips paid for by the industries they oversee, including a luxury trip to Rome earlier this year. Our colleagues traveled to Italy to document the trip and noticed someone stand out among the attendees. This person appeared younger than other attendees and was not a recognizable official or lobbyist. This turned out to be Ben Weiss, the CEO of CoinFlip, a crypto ATM company that had been sued by the state of Iowa for allegedly profiting from scams (which the company disputes). We didn't know much about crypto ATM companies at the time, but we realized this was an industry that was both gaining influence among government officials and coming under scrutiny.
    


These scams seem to go by a script where the victim is intimidated by a threatening phone call and an urgent demand for money. What have the crypto ATMs changed?



            Crypto ATMs have made it easier to quickly send large volumes of currency to places out of reach of US law enforcement. Rather than sending victims to buy a bunch of gift cards for $500 each, for example, scammers can send them to one machine to deposit thousands of dollars at one time and then funnel the currency overseas.
    


            Scammers also prey on the average person's lack of knowledge about the machines themselves. From our experience reporting this story, many people aren't familiar with crypto ATMs or how they work. Scammers tend to exploit this, especially when they are pretending to be law enforcement or government officials. They send often elderly victims to these machines under the assumption that the crypto ATM is a legitimate way to pay off (made up!) fines, fees, or debts to companies or the government. In one incident, a scammer referenced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Donald Trump established to make a victim more comfortable with stuffing cash into ones of these machines.
    


So many people — including me — have gotten these phishing calls from people who have personal information about you. They're scary. Many people probably figure out it's a scam before handing over money. How often are the calls successful?



            That is difficult to answer, but given how prevalent these scam texts are, we have to assume they are lucrative for criminals. The FBI told us Americans lost around $240 million to crypto ATM scams in the first half of this year. What's interesting is that we've seen people from all walks of life fall for these scams, including doctors and CEOs.
    


            It's easy to blame the scam victim for falling for the ruse, but the fact of the matter is, if the scam is targeted right, you will probably fall for it too. And these days there is so much information on people available online that it doesn't take much for a scam to be targeted enough to be believable.
    


Is there evidence that there is an organized effort behind these? What do we know about the people doing the targeting?



            In most local cases we reviewed, the scammer's identity remains a mystery. But in some cases, specific people have been charged — like a citizen of India indicted last year, who prosecutors called “a high-level member of a sophisticated, organized, transnational fraud ring.” That case remains pending and much of it is sealed. Some Americans have also been charged. We also know there are scam compounds in places like Myanmar, where thousands of people are held against their will and forced to work for low wages to carry out financial scams that target Americans. So it's certainly possible that some of the scammers who try to push people in the US to transfer them cash through crypto ATMs are themselves victims of crimes.
    


You tied multiple scams to a single ATM. How long did that process take? Is there a way for people to figure out if ATMs near them have been used in scams?



            We requested records from police departments, the Federal Trade Commission and state offices across the country and went through each incident report to log the details in a spreadsheet. It took us about four months to receive the records and log more than 700 cases. It was in that process of manually reading through every report that we started to notice recurring addresses for the same location or store. Once we put everything together, the spreadsheet became a trove of information allowing us to see how much money people had lost, what sort of scam had targeted them and which ATMs they used.
    


            It would be time-consuming to replicate that process, and the point is not whether a particular crypto ATM has been repeatedly used by scammers. The point is that these scams are now rampant, so if someone says you need to deposit money into one of these machines to pay a fine or avoid a penalty, that's almost certainly a scam.
    


The crypto ATM owners say most of the transactions are legitimate. Is there any data to back up that claim?



            That is a great question, with a bit of a convoluted answer. Some of the companies have pointed to a report by the analytics group TRM Labs, which found that 1.2% of cash-to-crypto transactions were illicit in 2023. That's a relatively small figure.
    


            But some law enforcement investigations that have obtained data from particular crypto ATM companies and interviewed customers have alleged scams account for much higher percentages of those companies' business. The DC attorney general alleged that more than 90% of deposits in one company's ATMs came from fraud over the span of months, which that company disputes.
    


One thing that sticks out is that there appears to be little law enforcement can do after a person uploads cash to the crypto ATM. What are the roadblocks to recovering money?



            Once you insert cash into a crypto ATM, that currency can rapidly be transferred just about anywhere in the world. The problem with recovering the money afterward is that scammers often direct the funds to cryptocurrency exchanges outside of US jurisdiction that are less likely to cooperate with US law enforcement.
    


Are lawmakers talking about some kind of regulation? What are some of the remedies being discussed?



            More than a dozen states have passed laws that seek to blunt crypto ATM scams. They impose requirements like daily transaction limits on the machines, which seek to reduce what scam victims may lose. As lawmakers have sought to crack down, crypto ATM companies have hired lobbyists across the country and have even pushed their own model legislation with fewer protections. In Missouri, for example, legislators passed regulations this year that matched model legislation passed along by CoinFlip in another state nearly word-for-word, with no transaction limits. Some federal lawmakers have pushed for tighter rules, but remember, the Trump administration has relaxed oversight of the crypto industry. So these regulation debates may play out for years to come.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","These are the signals to watch from the New Jersey and Virginia governor races","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/19/politics/virginia-new-jersey-governor-elections-trump-analysis","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:00:51 GMT","


            The pivotal question in November's New Jersey and Virginia governor races may be whether the outcome is shaped more by President Donald Trump's electoral strengths or by his weaknesses.
    


            Four years ago, the GOP candidates in both races benefited from one of Trump's most important political gains: improving the GOP vote among working-class racial minorities. But they were able to minimize the impact of his most conspicuous political vulnerability: a shift away from the Republican Party in white-collar suburbs.
    


            This year, though, the equation seems reversed. Heading into the final weeks, that dynamic has provided a consistent mid-single-digit edge in polls for Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and a wider advantage for Abigail Spanberger in Virginia.
    


            On the one hand, in this off-off-year election, most experts agree that Republican nominees Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey and Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia face uphill climbs to activate the low-propensity voters — often younger and nonwhite — whom Trump mobilized in surprising number last year.
    


            “The question for Republicans is: Are those very unique Trump voters that got him closer in New Jersey and Virginia and some other blue states (only) Trump voters or are they Republican voters?” said Mike DuHaime, a longtime New Jersey Republican strategist. “That is what will be answered this year.”
    


            On the other, the Republican candidates could face much larger deficits next month in white-collar suburbs such as Fairfax County, Virginia, and Bergen County, New Jersey, than they did in 2021, when Joe Biden occupied the White House and Trump was much less visible. “We know through a lot of conversations and organizing … that those voters are frustrated and upset with what they are seeing from the Trump administration,” said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a pro-abortion rights group.
    


            Both sides believe New Jersey is a more competitive race than Virginia, partly because Ciattarelli is a stronger candidate than Earle-Sears, but also because Virginia more acutely feels the impact of the sweeping cutbacks in the federal workforce and contracting ranks engineered by Trump and by the formerly Elon Musk-fronted DOGE project.
    


Virginia is also easier for Democrats because Spanberger is running to replace Glenn Youngkin, the term-limited Republican governor whose approval rating has sagged somewhat, while Sherrill is trying to succeed Phil Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor, whose ratings have also drooped. If Sherrill wins, it will mark the first time since the 1960s that the same party has won three consecutive New Jersey gubernatorial elections.Even so, in recent decades, both states have almost always chosen governors from the party that lost the White House the year before — especially when the new president faces as much disapproval for his job performance as Trump does now.
    


“If you've got a president of your own party at minus 13 to minus 15 (job approval) in an off-off-year, it's always significant,” said Democratic activist Terry McAuliffe. McAuliffe should know: He narrowly won election as Virginia's governor in 2013 while Barack Obama's approval was faltering amid the rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act, and then lost a comeback bid to Youngkin in 2021 as Biden's rating cratered in the aftermath of the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.
    


            McAuliffe's close win in 2013 was the only time since 1973 that Virginia elected a governor from the party that won the White House the previous year. The pattern hasn't been quite as inviolate in New Jersey, but the only gubernatorial candidates from the same party as the president who have won there in recent decades were Murphy in 2021 and moderate Republican Tom Kean during Ronald Reagan's presidency in 1981 and 1985.
    


            Inevitably, local issues have shaped the outcome of these contests. But on many occasions, the New Jersey and Virginia contests have prefigured shifts in both the national arguments between the parties and the allegiances of key voter blocks. On several recent occasions, that has made them an early gauge of tremors that rumble through the next midterm and even presidential elections.
    


            “To a great extent, both parties look at (these elections) as kind of spring training, but also as a harbinger,” said Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee during his years in the chamber.
    


            That role is evident in the oscillating recent signals from these governors' races in the well-educated suburbs of both states.
    


            In the 2017 governor races, against the backdrop of Trump's tumultuous first year in office, those places played a key role in the resounding victories of Democrats Ralph Northam in Virginia and Phil Murphy in New Jersey. In Virginia, Northam carried the four big suburban Northern Virginia jurisdictions — Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties — by a crushing 242,000-vote margin. That was more than double McAuliffe's advantage in those same places four years earlier. Northam also comfortably carried Henrico and Chesterfield, two big previously Republican-leaning counties outside Richmond, where McAuliffe had only narrowly prevailed.
    


            Up the coast in New Jersey, Murphy reached nearly 57% of the vote in Bergen County and posted huge gains compared with the Democratic performance in the 2009 and 2013 governor elections in Somerset, Morris and Monmouth counties (though he still fell short in the latter two). All four rank among the most highly educated counties in the state.
    


            The momentum Democrats displayed in 2017 across the white-collar suburbs of Virginia and New Jersey carried forward. In 2018, about three-fourths of the 40 Republican House seats that Democrats flipped contained more college graduates than the national average, according to a CNN analysis of census data at the time. And in 2020, Biden posted enormous margins over Trump in such places around the country; for instance, Biden carried the big four suburban Northern Virginia jurisdictions by over 450,000 votes, and soared past Murphy's 2017 performance in the well-educated New Jersey suburbs.
    


            Both the atmosphere and the outcome were very different in these places in the 2021 governor's races. With Trump no longer occupying center stage, Republicans regained ground among well-educated voters by connecting with them on hot-button cultural issues including crime and education. Both Youngkin and Ciattarelli (who was also the Republican nominee that year), ran hard against Covid-19 lockdowns and how teachers taught race-related issues while championing “parents' rights” in schools. Looming behind all those GOP messages was the decline in Biden's approval rating that began late that summer.
    


            Boosted by all those forces, the two Republicans notably recovered ground in well-educated suburbs in the 2021 governor contests. The full implications of that recovery were blunted in the 2022 midterm election by the powerful backlash among many well-educated voters to the Supreme Court's decision that summer rescinding the constitutional right to abortion.
    


            But in 2024, as concern about inflation eclipsed the focus on abortion, the suburban trend evident three years earlier in New Jersey and Virginia resurfaced. Vice President Kamala Harris still won most white-collar suburban counties outside the South. But she didn't match Biden's share of the vote four years earlier in any of the big well-educated New Jersey counties, and she carried the four big Northern Virginia jurisdictions by nearly 100,000 fewer votes than he did.
    


            In retrospect, McAuliffe said, it's clear that the Democratic suburban erosion in the 2021 governor races was the true signal and the 2022 midterms were “the anomaly,” tied to abortion. Biden and other Democrats, McAuliffe said, “took the wrong message out of that” about the challenges the party would face in 2024.
    


            The 2021 governor results, especially in New Jersey, confirmed another negative trend for Democrats. Trump somewhat improved his showing in 2020 over 2016 among minority voters nationwide, especially those without a four-year college degree. In 2021, Ciattarelli in particular advanced further from those beachheads. He significantly narrowed Murphy's advantage from 2017 in Passaic and Hudson, the two New Jersey counties with the largest share of Hispanic residents, and improved even in Essex, the county centered on Newark, which has a large Black population. In 2024, Trump ran even better than Ciattarelli in all three of those counties, even becoming the first GOP presidential nominee in the 21st century to win Passaic.
    


            Similar trends across the 2021 and 2024 elections were evident in some Virginia communities with large nonwhite populations, such as Prince William County. Like the slight Democratic dip with white-collar suburbanites, the more substantial shift among minority populations that fully blossomed in 2024 was already budding in the 2021 Virginia and New Jersey governor races.
    


            The underlying political environment in the two states has diverged more than usual this year. Budget cuts that have hurt both federal workers and contractors, compounded by the ongoing government shutdown, have created a unique headwind for Republicans in Virginia. “There is no other state that gets so impacted and touched by the federal government,” said McAuliffe. Davis, the former Republican representative, agreed: “I think the energy up here in the blue parts of the state is going to be very, very high.” In New Jersey, no single issue has focused discontent with the Trump administration in the same manner.
    


            But the similarities between the contests are more notable. Spanberger and Sherrill are both centrist Democrats with national security backgrounds who were elected to the House of Representatives as part of the 2018 blue wave. Both have run careful, disciplined campaigns that have drawn criticism from some Democrats for failing to ignite much enthusiasm or passion, but also praise from analysts in both parties for avoiding missteps. “They are running a race where they believe … that if she doesn't make a mistake she'll win,” DuHaime, the New Jersey Republican strategist, said of Sherrill. Virginia Republicans describe Spanberger in virtually identical terms.
    


            Sherrill and Spanberger have each maintained a predominant focus on the cost of living. That contrasts with their Republican opponents, who have attempted to revive several of the wedge issues that have benefited the GOP in recent years. Those include immigration enforcement, resistance to climate policies that they say will raise energy costs, and especially in Virginia, stoking concern about policies affecting transgender students. (Reproductive Freedom for All has mounted a robust campaign to reach pro-choice voters in both races — these are the only states that have not elected a governor since the Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022 — but the candidates have not stressed the issue.)
    


            Yet Democrats are almost uniformly confident those attacks are not landing as powerfully this year. Earle-Sears “is obviously running that playbook, but nobody thinks she is in the driver's seat of the election,” said Democratic strategist Bradley Komar, who ran Northam's winning 2017 Virginia campaign.
    


            Jesse Ferguson, a longtime Democratic strategist working in Virginia, argued that Trump's 2024 ad hitting Harris on transgender issues (whose famous tag line was, “Kamala's for they/them, President Trump is for you”) was so effective not only because of Harris' stance on those questions, but because the ad crystallized Trump's argument that Democrats were focused on esoteric concerns, not the daily financial struggles of ordinary families.
    


            Now, Ferguson said, Trump has inverted that equation by devoting so much of his presidency to retribution against perceived enemies and crackdowns against blue states and cities. “The fundamental problem Republicans will have in ‘25 and ‘26 is that they no longer look like they are focused on costs and the economy; they look like they are focused on retribution and revenge and culture wars,” said Ferguson.
    


            Both Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears have embraced Trump almost unreservedly. In his recent debate with Sherrill, Ciattarelli insisted, in an answer reminiscent of Harris' damaging comments about Biden last year on The View, “I think he's right about everything that he's doing.” Earle-Sears has avoided criticizing Trump even over the big federal layoffs that have pounded Northern Virginia.
    


            That deference tracks the overall shift within the GOP toward Trump, but it contrasts sharply with the 2021 governor races. In those contests, neither Ciattarelli nor Youngkin repudiated Trump, but both kept some distance. “Youngkin … was able to walk that tightrope very effectively in amplifying the conservative base turnout while also winning independent voters that he needed,” said Mark Rozell, Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University in Virginia. “Earle-Sears has not shown that same strategic skill.”
    


            Republicans in both states say Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears probably have no choice but to hug Trump tightly for fear of discouraging turnout from his base supporters. But that strategy has helped Democrats lash them to a president whose disapproval rating stood at 55% in both a recent Schar School/Washington Post Virginia poll and a September Quinnipiac University survey in New Jersey (the last time that poll measured Trump's approval there). In those polls, slightly more than 9 in 10 of Trump disapprovers were backing Spanberger, while Sherrill was carrying nearly 9 in 10 of them, according to results provided to CNN by both pollsters. The Republican nominees were carrying comparable majorities among voters who approved of Trump's performance — but that was only a little more than 4 in 10 in each state.
    


            The discontent with Trump gives Spanberger and Sherrill a good chance to rebuild the margins for Democrats that eroded in white-collar suburbs across the two states in 2021 and 2024. The Schar/WP and most recent Quinnipiac surveys have found each woman carrying a majority of white college graduates, as did a Fairleigh-Dickinson University poll of New Jersey released Friday .
    


            Political strategists in both states are less certain about how much ground Democrats can regain with minority communities. But Rafael Collazo, executive director of the Unidos US Action Fund, which focuses on Latino voters, said “the door is open” for Democrats to begin reversing their losses because of discontent over high prices and Trump's aggressive deportation policies. “There is definitely buyer's remorse” among some of Trump's 2024 Latino supporters, Collazo says, “but that doesn't necessarily mean Democrats are automatically going to recruit those voters.”
    


            Democrats still face localized challenges in each contest. The controversy over recently revealed threatening 2022 text messages from Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Attorney General in Virginia, has provided Republicans in this year's races “a focus they haven't had before,” Rozell said. And widespread discontent with New Jersey's outgoing Gov. Murphy, particularly over rising electricity costs, has provided Ciattarelli with probably his best asset in the race.
    


            Yet in both states, in both parties, most analysts would be surprised if those local factors allowed the GOP to surmount a national current that is once again primarily flowing away from Trump. (Ciattarelli has stayed more competitive than Earle-Sears, but even his support has almost never exceeded 45% in any poll — the level around which New Jersey Republicans often tap out.) A victory for Republicans in either race would be an ominous sign for Democrats that discontent with Trump may not be enough to overcome their own substantial image problems, even in favorable states. But solid wins in both places would give Democrats hoping for a wave in 2026 — the first reliable indication that one may be approaching the shore.

            To celebrate her 70th birthday, retired government worker Peggy Cole says she and a friend drove nearly 10 hours from her hometown of Flint, Michigan, to join a protest in Washington, DC, on Saturday.
    


            Cole said she felt compelled to mark the milestone at the large demonstration because it's a “scary time” for Americans and democracy is at stake.
    


            “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don't do anything about it,” Cole said.
    


            The event was one of more than 2,700 “No Kings” rallies held across the country on Saturday, protesting what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's “authoritarian” agenda. That's hundreds more events than were planned for the first go-round in June, when about 5 million people across the country took to the streets to protest Trump's administration as he held a military parade in Washington.
    


            Nearly 7 million people showed up for Saturday's rallies – including more than 100,000 people in New York, organizers and officials said. Along with larger events in major cities, small pockets of “No Kings” protesters cropped up along busy thoroughfares, in small town squares and at municipal parks in red and blue states alike.
    


            The largely peaceful protests followed a tumultuous summer of mass immigration raids, demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal troops into Democratic-led cities.
    


            Police in Portland and New York City reported that the protests concluded with no arrests.
    


            Trouble came later in the day when some individuals targeted protesters: A woman in South Carolina was arrested for brandishing a firearm while driving near a demonstration and a man in Georgia was seen on video taking a protester's flag and pushing another demonstrator to the ground.
    


            While the Trump administration and some GOP officials have painted anti-Trump protests as the work of “violent left-wing radicals,” the organization behind the “No Kings” events, the Indivisible Project, says it is committed to “nonviolent action” and had trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation. That became especially important amid growing political violence across the country, some organizers said.
    


            Some demonstrators wore yellow – a symbol of unity and a reference to other nonviolent resistance movements, according to organizers. “Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings,” reads a flyer on the “No Kings” website.
    


            Other protesters wore costumes, including inflatable chickens, frogs and dinosaurs, which some said emphasized the peaceful nature of the demonstrations. “It's really hard to call something a war zone, when you look at something and it's just a block party and people in Halloween costumes,” said a Los Angeles protester who wore a unicorn costume as he danced to music.
    


            Protesters could be heard loudly cheering and chanting slogans into megaphones, including, “This is what democracy looks like,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” They waved American flags along with signs opposing ICE, authoritarianism and billionaires.
    


            CNN field teams spoke with attendees at rallies across the country. Here's what protesters had to say:
    


            Many protesters emphasized the importance of democracy – an institution they fear is eroding with Trump's attempts to expand executive power.
    


            “We're a democracy. And that, in a democracy, people can stand up and voice their opinions. And that we are not going to be silenced,” Joan Press told CNN at a protest in Atlanta.
    


            A rally that kicked off the Atlanta protest featured high-profile speakers, including Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.
    


            “In this moment, in which we are seeing a president and an administration arrogating to himself power that doesn't belong to him, our message is very clear,” Warnock later told CNN. “This is not about the people in power, it's about the power in the people.”
    


            Kimberly Diemert, an organizer and communications director for the Georgia chapter of 50501, a “decentralized” movement that has helped lead the wave of nationwide protests, reminded the crowd about the city's civil rights legacy.
    


            “Atlanta is the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement as well as democracy … we don't want to lose that,” Diemert said.
    


            In New York City, one demonstrator held a sign reading: “We protest because we love America, and we want it back.”
    


            The protester, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, said she's been protesting since the 1960s, but this time feels different.
    


            “In the 60s we wanted to expand rights – women's rights, gay rights, minority rights, voting rights,” she said. “But all that's being taken away now. Now our entire democracy is being threatened, the basic tenets, the press, the judiciary.”
    


            She described feeling “very sad, a sense of loss, fear” under the Trump administration.
    


            “I'm hoping together, we can all save democracy,” she said.
    


            Dressed in Revolutionary War-era clothing and wigs, members of the group All in for Democracy attended the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC.
    


            “I just see all of our institutions changing, and I don't want us to change as a country and as a people,” said DC resident Lee Ayres, sporting a coat, wig and hat. “I want all of America to realize the Declaration of Independence is about no kings.”
    


            Many demonstrators called out what they feel is a threat to freedom of expression in the US.
    


            “It doesn't seem like we're able to peacefully or safely (express ourselves) right now, without fear of repercussions” from the government, work or families, said Bobbie Castillo, who traveled hours from her hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, to DC for her first protest ever.
    


            Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” rallied the crowd at the DC protest, arguing that Trump and his associates “cannot tolerate dissent.”
    


            “To them, our free speech is frightening. They are arresting people and denying due process in courts. They tried to silence television hosts,” Nye, a former TV host, said.
    


            Participants in smaller cities and towns said they were struck by the size of the turnout Saturday.
    


            In Ashland, Oregon, Joel Lesko said the day was about “joyfully celebrating our love for America, for free speech, for the importance of community and using our voices for diversity and inclusion and democracy.”
    


            After attending a protest in ruby-red Hendersonville, North Carolina, author Lynn Ames told CNN, “If you love this country, saving democracy is a priority no matter where you live, including in small-town America. Maybe especially in small-town America.”
    


            Many protesters connected their attendance to the ongoing immigration crackdown and the federal government's forceful response to anti-ICE protests that first erupted in Los Angeles following local raids. The demonstrations have since spread to numerous other cities, including Chicago, New York City, Dallas and Portland.
    


            Trump's attempts to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-controlled cities – which he argues is necessary to quell violence and support his deportation initiatives – have drawn legal challenges by state and local officials.
    


            Demonstrators in Los Angeles – where federal immigration raids triggered massive protests in June and led to Trump sending in the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes – emphasized rights for immigrants and called for a stop to the Trump administration's deportation campaign.
    


            Sitting in front of LA's City Hall, Gilberto Beas told CNN the protest is “a message for ICE to stop doing what they're doing.”
    


            Maria Rivera Cummings, who was born in Los Angeles and is of Mexican descent, said: “We're all immigrants and everyone has rights here.”
    


            At a demonstration in DC, Michael Langfeldt said he was protesting what he sees as “hatred” toward immigrants and the deployment of the military to US cities.
    


            “I feel like there's a lot of overreach in the federal government, specifically in like the executive branch,” he told CNN. “Congress doesn't do anything about it.”
    


            Hailey, a 24-year-old demonstrator in an inflatable frog suit, told CNN that she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland, who have faced off against federal law enforcement for weeks. Protesters there have donned inflatable costumes at rallies outside an ICE facility — in part to dispute Trump's characterization of the city as “war-ravaged.”
    


            “I think it's hard to see a country that you love descend into fascism,” Hailey told CNN.
    


            In Chicago, which has been an epicenter for the resistance to Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, many carried Mexican flags and signs like “Hands off our Democracy” and “ICE OUT!”
    


            Actor John Cusack, a Chicago resident known for being outspoken about Hollywood and the US government, said the city's message to the Trump administration is: “Go to hell!”
    


            “No, you can't put troops on our streets. You can't create enough chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act so you can stay in power,” the actor said, addressing the president.
    


            Dakota Englert, from Coal City, Illinois, said she came to stand up for basic humanity.
    


            “We all bleed the same color … I feel for the people that are being separated from their families, the people that are being hurt, killed,” Englert said.
    


            Other protesters expressed concerns about cuts to federal programs — particularly health care.  The protests come as the federal government is shut down, with GOP lawmakers and the White House locked in a standoff with Democrats over a funding bill.
    


            Danielle Guinto, a mother of two, said she worries about the major federal changes to Medicaid and other health-related policies that could impact her children's health, as well as the rising cost of living.
    


            “I just don't understand how you can rip food out of people's mouths, how you can separate, rip people out of their homes,” she told CNN at the Chicago demonstration. “How can you look at a family with fear in their eyes and you're just going to go take them away?”
    


            Anthony Lee, who works at the Food and Drug Administration and was one of many federal workers who were furloughed following the shutdown, said he came to the demonstration to protect public services. Lee, president of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter in DC, attended the event with a group of unionized federal workers.
    


            “I've been a public servant for over 20 years, and to see the destruction, really, of our government, our public services, over the last several months has been really scary,” Lee said.
    


            Another federal government employee who was furloughed said she joined the DC protest because the Trump administration has affected her livelihood and “demonized” federal workers.
    


            “The elimination of all these jobs are creating mass threats (for people to be able) to keep their home, to keep a roof over their head, send their kids to college and the hope of the American dream,” said Monica, who declined to share her last name out of fear of retaliation.
    


            Elizabeth Nee, a 25-year-old social worker from Maryland, told CNN she's seeing an impact at the psychiatric hospital she works at in Baltimore.
    


            “We have a lot of people who are coming in and they're unhoused, a lot of people on Medicaid. Everything's at risk right now,” she said.
    


            Speaking at the DC protest, Sen. Bernie Sanders called out Trump and his billionaire allies, like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.
    


            “This moment is not just about one man's greed, one man's corruption or one man's contempt for the Constitution,” Sanders said. “This is about a handful of the wealthiest people on Earth who, in their insatiable greed, have hijacked our economy and our political system in order to enrich themselves at the expense of working families throughout this country.”

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country's leader “does nothing to stop” drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America. 

In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as “an illegal drug dealer” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” He warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.” Colombia's defense minister, Pedro Sánchez, defending Petro and the nation's drug-fighting commitment, said, “If there's a country that has used all its capabilities and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking ... it's Colombia.”

Trump, while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, wrote on his Truth Social platform that Petro is “strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields” across Colombia, which the Republican president initially misspelled as Columbia before deleting his post and replacing it the correct spelling of the country. “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,” Trump said.

“AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA,” Trump said. He also said Petro had “a fresh mouth toward America.”

Hours later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. strike in the waters off South America, this time against a vessel he said was associated with a Colombian rebel group — the National Liberation Army, or ELN — and was carrying “substantial amounts of narcotics,” but did not say how that was known to U.S. intelligence agencies. He said on social media that three men aboard were killed in the Friday attack. A brief video clip he attached showed a boat in flames after an explosion. The State Department designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.




Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after a U.S. strike Thursday in Caribbean waters. The U.S. said on Saturday it was repatriating to Colombia and Ecuador two survivors from that attack, the sixth since early September. With Hegseth's announcement, at least 32 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers.

There was no immediate reaction from the ELN, with which Petro suspended peace talks in January after a violent incursion on the border with Venezuela. The group has denied involvement in drug trafficking, but Colombian authorities regularly report the dismantling of cocaine laboratories and the seizure of drugs believed to belong to the guerrillas.

In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia is the world's largest exporter of cocaine, and the cultivation of the critical ingredient of coca leaves reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations. 

More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump's commands. “I ask all the soldiers of the United States' army, don't point your rifles against humanity” and “disobey the orders of Trump,” Petro said.

Petro said a Colombian man was killed in a Sept. 16 strike and identified him as Alejandro Carranza, a fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He said that Carranza has no ties to drug trafficking and that his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit.

“U.S. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote on X. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. We await explanations from the US government.”

Petro said that he has alerted the attorney general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing.

“The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar's homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,” Petro wrote.

Meanwhile, Noticias Caracol, a Colombian news program, reported that the man injured in the most recent strike was hospitalized after he was repatriated and remains in serious condition. 

It quoted Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti as saying that the Colombian “will be prosecuted, he will be received — forgive the harsh expression — as a criminal, because so far what is known is that he was carrying a boat full of cocaine, which in our country is a crime, and despite the fact that it was in international waters, his repatriation will be as if he were being prosecuted in the United States.”

Petro said the man had been aboard a “narco submarine.”

Ecuador's Ministry of the Interior confirmed in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Sunday that the U.S. had repatriated an Ecuadorian man injured in the most recent strike. Officials identified him as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila and said a doctor found him to be in good health.

The ministry noted that two prosecutors met with Tufiño Chila and determined he had not committed any crimes within the country's borders and that there was no evidence to the contrary.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are growing increasingly concerned about their ability to find a good job under President Donald Trump, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll finds, in what is a potential warning sign for Republicans as a promised economic boom has given way to hiring freezes and elevated inflation.

High prices for groceries, housing and health care persist as a fear for many households, while rising electricity bills and the cost of gas at the pump are also sources of anxiety, according to the survey.

Some 47% of U.S. adults are “not very” or “not at all confident” they could find a good job if they wanted to, an increase from 37% when the question was last asked in October 2023.

Electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults at a time when the expected build-out of data centers for artificial intelligence could further tax the power grid. Just more than one-half said the cost of groceries are a “major” source of financial stress, about 4 in 10 said the cost of housing and health care were a serious strain and about one-third said they were feeling high stress about gasoline prices.

The survey suggests an ongoing vulnerability for Trump, who returned to the White House in January with claims he could quickly tame the inflation that surged after the pandemic during Democratic President Joe Biden's term. Instead, Trump's popularity on the economy has remained low amid a mix of tariffs, federal worker layoffs and partisan sniping that has culminated in a government shutdown.

Linda Weavil, 76, voted for Trump last year because he “seems like a smart businessman.” But she said in an interview that the Republican's tariffs have worsened inflation, citing the chocolate-covered pecans sold for her church group fundraiser that now cost more.

“I think he's doing a great job on a lot of things, but I'm afraid our coffee and chocolate prices have gone up because of tariffs,” the retiree from Greensboro, North Carolina, said. “That's a kick in the back of the American people.”

The poll found that 36% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy, a figure that has held steady this year after he imposed tariffs that caused broad economic uncertainty. Among Republicans, 71% feel positive about his economic leadership. Yet that approval within Trump's own party is relatively low in ways that could be problematic for Republicans in next month's races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, and perhaps even in the 2026 midterm elections.

At roughly the same point in Biden's term, in October 2021, an AP-NORC poll found that 41% of U.S. adults approved of how he was handling the economy, including about 73% of Democrats. That overall number was a little higher than Trump's, primarily because of independents — 29% approved of how Biden was handling the economy, compared with the 18% who currently support Trump's approach.

The job market was meaningfully stronger in terms of hiring during Biden's presidency as the United States was recovering from pandemic-related lockdowns. But hiring has slowed sharply under Trump with monthly job gains averaging less than 27,000 after the April tariff announcements.

People see that difference. 

Four years ago, 36% of those in the survey were “extremely” or “very” confident in their ability to get a good job, but that has fallen to 21% now.

Biden's approval on the economy steadily deteriorated through the middle of 2022 when inflation hit a four-decade high, creating an opening for Trump's political comeback.

In some ways, Trump has made the inflation problems harder by choosing to cancel funding for renewable energy projects and imposing tariffs on the equipment needed for factories and power plants. Those added costs are coming before the anticipated construction of data centers for AI that could further push up prices without more construction.

Even though 36% see electricity as a major concern, there are some who have yet to feel a serious financial squeeze. In the survey, 40% identified electricity costs as a “minor” stress, while 23% said their utility bills are “not a source” of stress.

Kevin Halsey, 58, of Normal, Illinois, said his monthly electricity bills used to be $90 during the summer because he had solar panels, but have since jumped to $300. Halsey, who works in telecommunications, voted Democratic in last year's presidential election and described the economy right now as “crap.”

“I've got to be pessimistic,” he said. “I don't see this as getting better.”

At a fundamental level, Trump finds himself in the same economic dilemma that bedeviled Biden. There are signs the economy remains relatively solid with a low unemployment rate, stock market gains and decent economic growth, yet the public continues to be skeptical about the economy's health.

Some 68% of U.S. adults describe the U.S. economy these days as “poor,” while 32% say it's “good.” That's largely consistent with assessments of the economy over the past year.

In addition, 59%, say their family finances are “holding steady.” But only 12% say they're “getting ahead,” and 28% say they are “falling behind.”

The sense of economic precarity is coming from many different directions, with indications that many think middle-class stability is falling out of reach.

The vast majority of U.S. adults feel at least “minor” stress about the cost of groceries, health care, housing, the amount they pay in taxes, what they are paid at work and the cost of gas for their cars. 

In the survey, 47%, say they are “not very” or “not at all” confident they could pay an unexpected medical expense while 52% have low confidence they will have enough saved for their retirement. Also, 63%, are “not very” or “not at all” confident they could buy a new home if they wanted to.

Young adults are much less confident about their ability to buy a house, though confidence is not especially high across the board. About 8 in 10 U.S. adults under age 30 say they are “not very confident” or “not at all confident” they would be able to buy a house, compared with about 6 in 10 adults 60 and older.

For 54% of U.S. adults, the cost of groceries is a “major source” of stress in their life right now. 

Unique Hopkins, 36, of Youngstown, Ohio, said she is now working two jobs after her teenage daughter had a baby, leaving Hopkins with a sense that she can barely tread water as part of the “working poor.” She voted for Trump in 2016, only to switch to Democrats after she felt his ego kept him from uniting the country and solving problems.

“It's his way or no way,” she said. “Nobody is going to unite with Trump if it's all about you, you, you.”

LONDON (AP) — London police are probing whether Prince Andrew asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre.

The Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” media reports that Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear Giuffre by asking an officer on the force to find out if she had a criminal record.

The report by the Mail on Sunday followed Buckingham Palace's announcement Friday that Andrew agreed to relinquish use of Duke of York and other remaining royal titles after emails emerged showing he had remained in contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he previously admitted.

Giuffre's family welcomed news of the duke's demise but said King Charles III should go further and strip Andrew's title as prince. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41.

The emails were the last straw for the House of Windsor after years of tawdry headlines about Andrew's dodgy friends and suspicious business deals. 

The move to insulate the monarchy from Andrew's scandals has been ongoing since November 2019 when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles after a disastrous interview when he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. 

Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein's victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier. 




The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his dukedom demotion when emails emerged last week showing he emailed Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew told Epstein in the note that they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it.”

The Mail reported that in 2011, as the newspaper was about to publish a now-infamous photo of the prince with his arm around the partly bare midriff of Giuffre, Andrew provided his bodyguard with Giuffre's date of birth and confidential social security number to find out if she had a checkered past. 

It's not clear if the officer complied with the request. Giuffre's family said she didn't have a criminal record.

With that report and Giuffre's posthumous memoir being published Tuesday, the scandal will not soon evaporate.

British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who was serving as the government's representative on the Sunday morning news programs, said a police officer should not be enlisted in a smear campaign.

“These are deeply concerning allegations,” Miliband told the BBC. “I think people want to look at those allegations and what the substance is behind them. But if that is correct, that is absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used.”

Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn't admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre's suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.

In his statement Friday, Andrew said he continues to “vigorously deny” the accusations.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a major gas processing plant in southern Russia, sparking a fire and forcing it to suspend its intake of gas from Kazakhstan, Russian and Kazakh authorities said Sunday. 

U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that Kyiv may have to give up territory in exchange for an end to Moscow's more than 3 1/2-year invasion, in the latest of apparent reversals on how to pursue peace. 

The Orenburg plant, run by state-owned gas giant Gazprom and located in a region of the same name near the Kazakh border, is part of a production and processing complex that is one of the world's largest facilities of its kind, with an annual capacity of 45 billion cubic meters. It handles gas condensate from Kazakhstan's Karachaganak field, alongside Orenburg's own oil and gas fields.

According to regional Gov. Yevgeny Solntsev, the drone strikes set fire to a workshop at the plant and damaged part of it. The Kazakh Energy Ministry on Sunday said, citing a notification from Gazprom, that the plant was temporarily unable to process gas originating in Kazakhstan, “due to an emergency situation following a drone attack.” 

Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement Sunday that a “large-scale fire” erupted at the Orenburg plant, and that one of its gas processing and purification units was damaged. 

Kyiv has ramped up attacks in recent months on Russian energy facilities it says both fund and directly fuel Moscow's war effort.




Meanwhile, Ukrainian prosecutors claim that Moscow is modifying its deadly aerial-guided bombs to strike civilians deeper in Ukraine. Local authorities in Kharkiv said Russia struck a residential neighborhood using a new rocket-powered aerial bomb for the first time.

Kharkiv's regional prosecutor's office said in a statement that Russia used the weapon called the UMPB-5R, which can travel up to 130 kilometers (80 miles), in an attack on the city of Lozava on Saturday afternoon. The city lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of Kharkiv, a considerable distance for the weapon to fly. 

Russia continued to strike other parts of Ukraine closer to the front line. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, at least 11 people were injured after Russian drones hit the Shakhtarske area. At least 14 five-story buildings and a store were damaged, said acting regional Gov. Vladyslav Haivanenko.

Ukraine's General Staff also claimed a separate drone strike hit Russia's Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery, in the Samara region near Orenburg, sparking a blaze and damaging its main refining units. 

The Novokuibyshevsk facility, operated by Russian gas major Rosneft, has an annual capacity of 4.9 million tons, and turns out over 20 kinds of oil-based products. Russian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the Ukrainian claim or discuss any damage. 

Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement early Sunday that its air defense forces had shot down 45 Ukrainian drones during the night, including 12 over the Samara region, one over the Orenburg region and 11 over the Saratov region neighboring Samara. 

In turn, Ukraine's air force reported Sunday that Russia during the night launched 62 drones into Ukrainian territory. It said 40 of these were shot down, or veered off course due to electronic jamming. 

Trump appeared to edge back in the direction of pressing Ukraine to give up on retaking land it has lost to Russia, in exchange for an end to Moscow's aggression. 

Asked in a Fox News interview conducted Thursday whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be open to ending the war “without taking significant property from Ukraine,” Trump responded: “Well, he's going to take something.”

“They fought and he has a lot of property. He's won certain property,” Trump said. “We're the only nation that goes in, wins a war and then leaves.”

The interview was aired on Sunday on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” but was conducted before Trump spoke to Putin and Zelenskyy last week. 

The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by the U.S. leader. In recent weeks, Trump had shown growing impatience with Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war.

In Thursday's interview, he was noncommittal about sending Tomahawk missiles requested by Ukraine, saying “I'm looking at it” but expressing concern about depleting U.S. weapons stocks.

“We need them for ourselves too,” Trump said. “We can't give all our weapons to Ukraine. We just can't do that.”

Russians and Ukrainians interviewed by The Associated Press last week voiced hopes for progress at an upcoming summit between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary, but said they anticipated no major breakthrough. 

The two leaders agreed in a phone call Thursday to meet in the coming weeks, according to Trump, who also sat down with Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. 

Contrary to Kyiv's hopes, Trump did not commit to providing it with Tomahawks following that meeting. The missiles would be the longest-range weapons in Ukraine's arsenal and would allow it to strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow, with precision.

Deliveries of Tomahawks could provide leverage to help push the Kremlin into negotiations, analysts say, after Trump expressed frustration over Putin's refusal to budge on key aspects of a possible peace deal.

State officials on the front lines of preparing for natural disasters and responding to emergencies say severe cuts to federal security grants, restrictions on money intended for readiness and funding delays tied to litigation are posing a growing risk to their ability to respond to crises.

It's all causing confusion, frustration and concern. The federal government shutdown isn't helping.

“Every day we remain in this grant purgatory reduces the time available to responsibly and effectively spend these critical funds,” said Kiele Amundson, communications director at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.

The uncertainty has led some emergency management agencies to hold off on filling vacant positions and make rushed decisions on important training and purchases. 

Experts say the developments complicate state-led emergency efforts, undermining the Republican administration's stated goals of shifting more responsibility to states and local governments for disaster response.

In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the new requirements were necessary because of “recent population shifts” and that changes to security grants were made “to be responsive to new and urgent threats facing our nation.”




Several DHS and FEMA grants help states, tribes and territories prepare for climate disasters and deter a variety of threats. The money pays for salaries and training, and such things as vehicles, communications equipment and software. 

State emergency managers say that money has become increasingly important because the range of threats they must prepare for is expanding, including pandemics and cyberattacks.

FEMA, a part of DHS, divided a $320 million Emergency Management Performance Grant among states on Sept. 29. But the next day, it told states the money was on hold until they submitted new population counts. The directive demanded that they omit people “removed from the State pursuant to the immigration laws of the United States” and to explain their methodology.

The amount of money distributed to the states is based on U.S. census population data. The new requirement forcing states to submit revised counts “is something we have never seen before,” said Trina Sheets, executive director of the National Emergency Management Association, a group representing emergency managers. “It's certainly not the responsibility of emergency management to certify population.”

With no guidance on how to calculate the numbers, Hawaii's Amundson said staff scrambled to gather data from the 2020 census and other sources, then subtracted he number of “noncitizens” based on estimates from an advocacy group.

They are not sure the methodology will be accepted. But with their FEMA contacts furloughed and the grant portal down during the federal shutdown, they cannot find out. Other states said they were assessing the request or awaiting further guidance.

In its statement, DHS said FEMA needs to be certain of its funding levels before awarding grant money, and that includes updates to a state's population due to deportations.

Experts said delays caused by the request could most affect local governments and agencies that receive grant money passed down by states because their budgets and staffs are smaller. At the same time, FEMA also reduced the time frame that recipients have to spend the money, from three years to one. That could prevent agencies from taking on longer-term projects.

Bryan Koon, president and CEO of the consulting firm IEM and a former Florida emergency management chief, said state governments and local agencies need time to adjust their budgets to any kind of changes.

“An interruption in those services could place American lives in jeopardy,” he said.

In another move that has caused uncertainty, FEMA in September drastically cut some states' allocations from another source of funding. The $1 billion Homeland Security Grant Program is supposed to be based on assessed risks, and states pass most of the money to police and fire departments.

New York received $100 million less than it expected, a 79% reduction, while Illinois saw a 69% reduction. Both states are politically controlled by Democrats. Meanwhile, some territories received unexpected windfalls, including the U.S. Virgin Islands, which got more than twice its expected allocation.

The National Emergency Management Association said the grants are meant to be distributed based on risk and that it “remains unclear what risk methodology was used” to determine the new funding allocation.

After a group of Democratic states challenged the cuts in court, a federal judge in Rhode Island issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 30. That forced FEMA to rescind award notifications and refrain from making payments until a further court order.

The freeze “underscores the uncertainty and political volatility surrounding these awards,” said Frank Pace, administrator of the Hawaii Office of Homeland Security. The Democratic-controlled state received more money than expected, but anticipates the bonus being taken away with the lawsuit.

In Hawaii, where a 2023 wildfire devastated the Maui town of Lahaina and killed more than 100 people, the state, counties and nonprofits “face the real possibility” of delays in paying contractors, completing projects and “even staff furloughs or layoffs” if the grant freeze and government shutdown continue, he said.

The myriad setbacks prompted Washington state's Emergency Management Division to pause filling some positions “out of an abundance of caution,” communications director Karina Shagren said.

Emergency management experts said the moves have created uncertainty for those in charge of preparedness.

The Trump administration has suspended a $3.6 billion FEMA disaster resilience program, cut the FEMA workforce and disrupted routine training.

Other lawsuits also are complicating decision-making. A Manhattan federal judge last week ordered DHS and FEMA to restore $34 million in transit security grants it had withheld from New York City because of its immigration policies.

Another judge in Rhode Island ordered DHS to permanently stop imposing grant conditions tied to immigration enforcement, after ruling in September that the conditions were unlawful — only to have DHS again try to impose them.

Taken together, the turbulence surrounding what was once a reliable partner is prompting some states to prepare for a different relationship with FEMA.

“Given all of the uncertainties,” said Sheets, of the National Emergency Management Association, states are trying to find ways to be “less reliant on federal funding.”

BEIJING (AP) — China on Sunday accused the U.S. National Security Agency of carrying out cyberattacks on its national time center following an investigation, saying any damage to related facilities could have disrupted network communications, financial systems and power supply. 

The Ministry of State Security alleged in a WeChat post that the U.S. agency had exploited vulnerabilities in the messaging services of a foreign mobile phone brand to steal sensitive information from devices of the National Time Service Center's staff in 2022. It did not specify the brand.

The U.S. agency also used 42 types of “special cyberattack weapons” to target the center's multiple internal network systems and attempted to infiltrate a key timing system between 2023 and 2024, it said.

It said it had evidence but did not provide it in the post. 

It said the time center is responsible for generating and distributing China's standard time, in addition to providing timing services to industries such as communications, finance, power, transport and defense. It had provided guidance to the center to eliminate the risks. 

“The U.S. is accusing others of what it does itself, repeatedly hyping up claims about Chinese cyber threats,” it said. 

Western governments in recent years have alleged hackers linked to the Chinese government have targeted officials, journalists, corporations and others. The ministry's statement could fuel tensions between Washington and Beijing, on top of trade, technology and Taiwan issues. 

The U.S. Embassy did not immediately comment.

A shooting at an Oklahoma State University (OSU) residence hall left multiple victims hospitalized on Sunday, authorities said.

Officers responded around 3:40 a.m. to reports of a shooting at Carreker East residential hall, OSU Police Department said in a statement.

OSU Police Chief Michael Beckner said there were multiple victims, including at least one confirmed OSU student.

All victims are being treated at hospitals in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, according to police, though they did not immediately provide updates on their conditions.

Ann Marie Lawrence, a Maryland mother and women's weight-loss coach, shares her quick-and-easy recipe for a one-pot Philly cheesesteak pasta dish that contains 32 grams of protein.

Diners already concerned about the cost of eating out may be disappointed to learn that many restaurants are considering raising prices to keep up with inflated food and drink costs.

Restaurant management software company Toast recently released its 2025 Voice of the Restaurant Industry Survey, revealing that improving profitability was the top concern for operators headed into next year.

Operators ranked inflation (20%), marketing (16%) and hiring (16%) as their top three business pain points.

Nearly half of all 712 restaurant decision-makers surveyed (48%) said they plan to increase menu prices if inflation continues to be a factor.

The National Restaurant Association estimates that, to maintain a 5% profit margin, the average restaurant needs to raise prices by 31%, according to data compiled by the D.C.-based industry trade group earlier this year.

""Raising menu prices is typically a last resort for restaurant operators, but with the rising costs of food and labor, their operating math still has to work,"" Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Restaurant Association, told Fox News Digital.

Small business owners like Michael Brafman, who operates The Sandwich Board in New York City, are concerned about it.

VEGAS TIPPING DROPS DRASTICALLY AS VISITORS SAY SERVICE DOESN'T MATCH HIGHER COSTS

""The basic math is whatever product you have, you divide it by .3, and that's what the product should cost to the consumer to operate at that healthy margin,"" Brafman told Fox News Digital. ""If the prices continue to increase, there's only [so much] that the consumer will be willing to pay.""

The sandwich shop owner said he wrestled with this issue during the egg crisis.

""I held out a long time to raise the [price] of our egg sandwiches,"" Brafman said.

Menu prices that are too high can scare off customers — which is a concern for restaurant operators. (iStock)

He added, ""You can only get away with charging so much for an egg sandwich. . . . Nobody's spending $17 on an egg sandwich just so you can keep your margins.""

He tacked on an extra dollar, he said, ""which was very marginal, but people were concerned.""

Increasing menu prices can be an added challenge when the business is new.

""Nobody's spending $17 on an egg sandwich just so you can keep your margins,"" a New York City restaurant owner told Fox News Digital. (iStock)

""It's always a tenuous line to walk,"" Brafman said. ""It is a game of chicken.""

Since opening The Sandwich Board last year, Brafman said he's seen a spike in the cost of proteins.

""Proteins are increasing exponentially — eggs, dairy, meat, poultry, all of the core parts of the sandwich,"" he said. ""When a steak per pound goes from $7 to $11, that's an unrealistic price increase.""

Passing that off to customers could spell bad news for cost-conscious diners.

""I have people [who] come here repeatedly per week, and that's the fear,"" said Brafman. ""How many times will they stop coming because the cost is prohibitive?""

John Loeffler, innkeeper and chef at The Inn at Gristmill Square and Waterwheel Restaurant in Virginia, said he's been watching similar trends play out, just at a different price tier.

""Beef is always a huge, huge seller for us. It is one of our more popular items,"" Loeffler told Fox News Digital. 

In June, a whole loin of certified Angus ribeye cost $14.75 a pound, he said. Today, it's $17.99.

As costs climb, keeping guests happy becomes about more than the food alone, Loeffler said.

""How do you make money, sell people something that they feel good about and feel a value, even at a higher price point?"" he said. ""I think that's the challenge facing all restaurants — adding value as menu prices go up.""

John Loeffler, chef at The Inn at Gristmill Square's Waterwheel Restaurant in Virginia (shown at left), told Fox News Digital the rising cost of beef has forced him to consider other ways to provide value to his customers.

After 30 years in the business, Loeffler said he's learned to think differently about profit.

""I think about margins less than percentages,"" he said.

His approach often means absorbing part of the cost to preserve the dining experience.

""At the end of the day, we're in the business of taking care of people, nourishing them, making them feel good … and making them feel good about spending money. That's our job.""

Child psychiatrist Andrew Clark joins Americas Newsroom to discuss his study on the ability of AI therapy bots to set limits with distressed young people, which found that chatbots endorsed harmful actions 32% of the time across 60 scenarios. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just helping students with homework. A new survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that nearly one in five high school students in the United States say they or someone they know has used AI to have a romantic relationship. The results shocked researchers and raised big questions about how deeply AI tools are affecting young minds. The report, which surveyed 1,000 students, 1,000 parents and 800 teachers, reveals how AI has quietly become a companion in students' personal lives.

TEENS INCREASINGLY TURNING TO AI FOR FRIENDSHIP AS NATIONAL LONELINESS CRISIS DEEPENS

Teens say they feel safer opening up to chatbots than real people, a growing emotional shift researchers didn't expect. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Nearly half of the students said they use AI to talk about emotions, friendships or mental health. Many admit they feel more comfortable opening up to a chatbot than to a parent or friend. Even more alarming, two-thirds of parents said they have no idea how their kids are using AI. Experts warn that while AI can simulate empathy, it has no real understanding or care. According to researchers, students need to remember that they are not actually talking to a person. They are interacting with a programmed tool that has clear limitations and cannot truly understand human emotions.

AI tools are everywhere in schools. About 85% of teachers and students said they used AI during the last school year. While schools introduce AI to boost learning, this exposure may have a downside. Students who use AI more often in class are also more likely to turn to it for emotional or personal reasons. Teachers and parents are worried that regular chatbot use could weaken important skills such as communication, empathy and critical thinking.

OPENAI LIMITS CHATGPT'S ROLE IN MENTAL HEALTH HELP

Students using AI for classwork are now turning to it for advice on emotions, relationships and mental health. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

Some AI systems meant to help can actually cause harm. Therapists have warned that chatbots sometimes break their own safety rules and give dangerous advice to teens in distress. Some have been caught encouraging self-harm, giving diet tips for eating disorders or pretending to be romantic partners. The CDT survey also revealed that 36% of students heard about AI-created deepfakes of classmates. Some involved fake explicit photos used for bullying or revenge. This new wave of harassment shows how fast technology can spiral out of control.

It's hard to keep up with AI, but there are ways to stay informed and protect your child.

Ask your teen how they use AI. Keep it calm and curious, not confrontational.

Talk about what's appropriate to share online, and explain that AI chatbots cannot keep secrets or replace human relationships.

Many devices and apps now include AI activity tracking and chat history settings. Learn how to use them.

Promote offline activities, social events and family time to help teens build stronger emotional ties in the real world.

Follow trusted sources like CyberGuy.com or your local school district's tech guidelines to understand how AI is being used in classrooms.

If you're a parent or teacher, awareness is key. AI literacy should go beyond typing prompts. Kids need to learn emotional awareness and online safety too. Encourage honest discussions about how these tools work and where they fall short. Remind students that while AI can sound friendly, it's not a real companion. It's a programmed system that mirrors what people type into it.

AI is transforming how teens learn, talk and even form relationships. What started as a study tool has turned into an emotional outlet for many. The lesson here is balance. Technology can teach and entertain, but human connection still matters most. Parents, educators and tech companies all share the responsibility of helping kids see AI for what it is: a tool, not a friend.

Actor John Cusack attended a ""No Kings"" protest in Chicago on Saturday, telling CNN he was frustrated by ICE operations in the City.

Actor John Cusack sent a message to President Donald Trump during a ""No Kings"" protest in Chicago on Saturday during an interview with CNN, telling the president to ""go to hell.""

""What's interesting is that he doesn't understand that all the labor rights around the world came from this town, this place,"" Cusack told CNN. ""So if he thinks this place is going to be a fascist hub — no chance.""

""Go to hell,"" he said, saying that was the message from Chicago when prompted by a reporter.

""No Kings"" demonstrations broke out across the country on Saturday to protest the Trump administration. 

Cusack, an outspoken progressive, told CNN that the country was founded on ""no kings.""

REPUBLICANS TORCH ANTI-TRUMP 'NO KINGS' PROTESTS, SAY DEMS FEAR ANGERING LEFTISTS IN SHUTDOWN FIGHT

""Everyone knows the score, right? The authoritarians divide and conquer, and they create an ‘other,' and then they pick on it, pick on the person, harass them, jail them, and that's all used as a direction so they can steal as much as they can [and] maintain power,"" Cusack said. ""We all know history. So, that's what he's doing, and we have masked goons roaming the streets, hiding their faces, abducting people.""

The ""No Kings"" protests first mobilized back in February on President's Day to denounce the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and cuts to the federal government. 

The movement gained national prominence in June, when Trump held a military parade honoring the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, which also fell on his 79th birthday.

MILLIONS EXPECTED TO FLOOD STREETS AT ‘NO KINGS' PROTESTS TARGETING TRUMP ACROSS ALL 50 STATES

Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel compared the ""No Kings"" protests to the American Revolution on Thursday.

Kimmel defended the planned ""No Kings"" rallies, saying the cause reflects what those who fought for American independence believed in.

Professors from Rutgers University and beyond have flocked to an online fundraiser to donate money to fellow academic Mark Bray, who recently fled to Spain after President Donald Trump announced a crackdown on Antifa and its financiers. 

A Rutgers University professor nicknamed ""Dr. Antifa,"" who fled the U.S. for Spain after saying his home address had been doxxed, and his family threatened, portrayed doxxing as a legitimate tactic for use against political opponents in his seminal work. 

Mark Bray, who now teaches his history courses for the public New Jersey university online from abroad, is best known for his book, ""Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook,"" published in 2017. 

That book, which is based on 61 interviews with ""current and former anti-fascists from seventeen countries in North America and Europe,"" references doxxing in a positive light three times.

'DR. ANTIFA'S' MEDITERRANEAN MOVE PARTIALLY FINANCED BY FELLOW RUTGERS PROFESSORS, OTHER AMERICAN ACADEMICS

On page 87, Bray quoted a Danish Antifa interviewee named Rasmus Preston, who said doxxing is ""'a very important tool to create conflict within far-right movements' by causing a ‘constant mental burden.'""

In another instance, Bray relayed the story of Antifa Nebraska scoring a ""major victory"" by doxxing a political opponent, noting that the far-left group ""printed thousands of flyers with his name, photo, and information on his Nazism and plastered them around town, forcing him to drop out of college, take down his social media, and go into hiding.""

The book offers an appendix where Bray invited his interview subjects to provide advice to fellow or prospective Antifa members. A source named Brett A advocated in favor of doxxing as one of many tools in Antifa's political war. 

""Ideally, you want a diverse squad with members who have different talents,"" Brett said. ""Some folks will be best used on the front lines in confrontations (usually strong, fit people who can fight if need be), some folks need to be really good with intel gathering (monitoring right-wing pages, doxxing, etc.), some folks need to be good at graphic design for flyer campaigns, some folks need to be well-versed in security culture, etc. The more diverse your organization is, the better equipped it will be at effectively organizing and staying safe.""

Brett alluded to another tactic supported in Bray's book: violence. 

Antifascism is not just one tactic, but many, and those include ""combinations of physical confrontations, doxxing, infiltration.""

VETERAN JOURNALIST FLIPS SCRIPT ON MEDIA 'RUNNING COVER' FOR ANTIFA VIOLENCE: 'ANARCHIST COMMUNISM'

Fascists are defined ambiguously as the ""Far Right,"" which Bray speculated could evolve into something worse than fascism. Throughout the book, though, he referenced the MAGA movement and opposition to the Trump administration. 

Bray openly praised the violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown's death involving police.  

""Moreover, these riots pushed police brutality and black oppression to the forefront of the national consciousness in a way that ‘nonviolent' tactics could not have achieved on their own,"" he wrote. ""Yes, most Americans were repulsed by the sight of looting and burning, but for once they were forced to take note of the scale of injustice. Subsequently, Black Lives Matter cultivated a very significant base of popular support despite having a ‘violent flank.'""

On page 64 of the book, Bray relayed the story of Italian Antifa groups Autonomia Operaia and Lotta Continua from the 1970s. He described those groups as ""militants wearing ski masks and bandannas, armed with clubs, iron bars, Molotov cocktails, and sometimes handguns.""

He justified the groups' violent outbursts with a talking point often used in far-left circles in the U.S. today.

""While the expressed purpose of such marches may have been opposition to fascism, the state and the entire capitalist system were implicated in fascist violence, and therefore legitimate targets for widespread looting and property destruction,"" Bray wrote. 

The book later claims that ""anti-fascism must necessarily be anticapitalist.""

Later, he described the Autonomen in Germany, a group descended from Autonomia Operaia. He fawned over the group for inventing black bloc, the now-ubiquitous black head-to-toe uniform Antifa groups wear worldwide.

He described a ""direct action"" where the group ""dressed in black with their faces covered by motorcycle helmets, balaclavas, or other masks to create a uniform, anonymous mass of revolutionaries prepared to carry out militant actions, sometimes involving weapons such as flagpoles, clubs, projectiles, and Molotov cocktails."" 

Censorship is viewed as a powerful tool in fighting the people Bray calls fascists, too. 

His book roundly rejects free speech absolutism, and rages against ""liberal anti-fascists"" whom he characterizes as being too stalwart in their defense of open debate.

‘DR ANTIFA' RUTGERS PROFESSOR ANNOUNCES MOVE TO EUROPE AFTER TPUSA PETITION CALLS FOR HIS FIRING

""When militant anti-fascists successfully deprive fascists or white supremacists of a platform to promote their agenda, ‘liberal anti-fascists' often argue that shutting them down is counterproductive because it only gives them more attention.… Anti-fascists argue that any rhetorical benefit gained from such confrontations is outweighed by their reduced ability to disseminate it,"" Bray wrote.

""Liberal anti-fascists,"" Bray complained, have too much ""faith in the inherent power of the public sphere to filter out fascist ideas, and in the institutions of government to forestall the advancement of fascist politics.""

Bray even briefly touched on internet censorship, which he favors. 

""The Internet is a platform that anti-fascists cannot completely contest, though efforts to persuade Reddit and other forums to ban racist threads have borne some fruit,"" he said. 

The history professor fled the U.S. to Spain after President Donald Trump announced that he would designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. After that, the Turning Point USA chapter started a petition to have Bray fired.

Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest on what's happening in Gaza after Hamas agreed to a peace deal with Israel on ‘The Story.'

The Israeli military conducted strikes against Hamas in Gaza after accusing the terrorist organization of repeatedly violating its ceasefire agreement on Sunday.

An Israeli military official confirmed the strikes to Fox News on Sunday, pointing to attacks by Hamas since Friday. The IDF later confirmed that it was taking actions in Gaza. 

""Earlier today, terrorists fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire toward IDF troops operating to dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the Rafah area, in southern Gaza, in accordance with the ceasefire agreement,"" the IDF said in a statement.

""In response, the IDF has begun striking in the area to eliminate the threat and dismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity,"" it continued.

Israel has responded by striking areas in the north and south of the Gaza Strip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says he has instructed the minister of defense and other security heads to ""act forcefully"" in reaction to the attacks.

Hamas claims it has ""no knowledge"" of any attacks against Israeli forces, releasing a statement on Sunday saying it was still abiding by the terms of the agreement.

""We affirm our full commitment to implementing everything that has been agreed upon, foremost among which is the ceasefire in all areas of the Gaza Strip. We have no knowledge of any events or clashes taking place in the Rafah area,"" the group wrote.

""We have no connection to any events occurring in those areas, nor can we communicate with any of our fighters there if any of them remain alive,"" it added.

The reported attacks on Israeli troops come after Hamas spent days fighting Palestinian rival groups after the ceasefire went into effect.

According to Reuters, Hamas executed at least 33 people in recent days in what officials described as a campaign to ""show strength"" after the ceasefire. Israeli sources say most of those killed belonged to families accused of collaborating with Israel or supporting rival militias.

The U.S. Department of State warned on Saturday that Hamas may break the peace agreement with a ""planned attack"" on Palestinian civilians.

""This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,"" the department said in a statement on social media. ""The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms.""

""The United States and the other guarantors remain resolute in our commitment to ensuring the safety of civilians, maintaining calm on the ground and advancing peace and prosperity for the people of Gaza and the region as a whole,"" the statement continued.

President Donald Trump warned Hamas on Friday that continued attacks on Palestinians would force the U.S. and Israel to intervene.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Ukraine's Underground Generation","https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/10/ukraine-youth-isolation/684365/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Addressing the isolation of young people has become an urgent priority in eastern Ukraine.

In a town called Staryi Saltiv, in northeastern Ukraine, many buildings lie in ruins after years of war, but only one has been demolished twice: the district school. Russian missiles leveled it in early 2022. The town gradually raised the money not just to reconstruct it but to enlarge and improve it, adding new facilities for disabled children. Then, just days after the work was completed in early May, the Russians sent five Shahed drones into it, leaving it a burned-out ruin.

“We don't know why,” Iryna Glazunova, the town's director of education and culture, told me. “I think the overall point is to destroy Ukraine.”

Now an enormous, colorful banner draped over the wreckage reads WE WILL CONTINUE ANYWAY.

They will continue in a reinforced-concrete bunker three stories underground, where Staryi Saltiv is digging its new school out of the earth. Similar schools are under construction across eastern Ukraine. Kharkiv, the largest city in the northeast, has seven major subterranean schools, and more are being built; the resources being poured into this effort testify to the grim expectation that such facilities will be in use for many years.

Visiting them is an eerie experience: Aboveground, schoolyards and jungle gyms are empty and silent. Only when you descend two or three stories into the bunker do you hear the familiar shrieks and laughter of children.

Russian drones have made a clear sky into a source of terror for Ukrainian young people. Most have taken instruction only by Zoom since the full-scale Russian invasion began, in 2022. They study in apartments they share with their parents, with frequent interruptions, such as when the power goes out or when the air-raid sirens send them fleeing to shelters. Many are so isolated and anxious that they are unable to imagine a future.

The plight of Ukraine's young people is a direct consequence of Russia's effort to eradicate their national identity. In a little less than four years, Russia has damaged or destroyed some 3,500 schools in an apparent campaign to demoralize the population and pave the way for its Russification. The onslaught has also reduced churches and town halls across northeastern Ukraine to rubble, and with them, much of the physical and mental infrastructure of life for the country's youth.

When I visited the Kharkiv region this summer, I heard from administrators, teachers, and military officers in town after town that the isolation of Ukrainian children presents an existential threat to the country's future. To confront it, community members are building new institutions underground and improvising new forms of social life.

Young people now spend much of their life in a subterranean world of schools, recreation centers, shelters, even malls. Some adults told me that the effort to create such spaces is as important as anything happening on the war's front lines. When Iryna Markevych, a psychologist in Kharkiv, began fundraising for a Mobile School of Resilience in 2022, “people said, ‘We only need money for the army,'” she told me. “We said, ‘If the children are all unhappy, what are you fighting for?'”

Three years later, the urgency of the task is now widely acknowledged. Ukraine's adolescents will soon grow up and be needed to defend their country's fragile civic unity. They may also have to fight in a war that could last for many more years; if they're lucky, they will then shoulder the even greater burden of rebuilding all that Russia has destroyed.



“The light temperature is adjusted to re-create the quality of natural light,” Yulia Bashkirova, the city's district-education director, told me as we descended an immaculate stairwell to visit School 105 in Kharkiv. “The technical requirements were developed by the city hall.”

She opened a heavy door to the school's main corridor, and suddenly we were surrounded by flocks of schoolchildren. It was like being inside a submarine. Every square inch of space was used for something: bookshelves, projectors, wall calendars. The kids eat lunch (provided by the school) at their desks because there is no room for a cafeteria. Colorful murals substitute for windows. Children who would once have been spread out among nine different schools now attend School 105 in shifts because so many families are desperate for an offline-school experience. Perhaps for that reason, everyone I saw seemed gleeful.

“There have been educational losses” during the years of online schooling, the school's director, Nataliya Teplova, told me. “We are trying to make up for that—additional classes during weekends, that kind of thing.”

The learning deficits are hard to measure, because testing protocols have changed in the past three years. In western Ukraine, many schools went back to in-person classes years ago. But in the eastern areas close to the front, movement of any kind is dangerous, and electricity and phone service are often disrupted. Educators spoke about 10-year-olds who have not yet learned to read. Even underground facilities are usually impossible to build in these places, because the construction sites get targeted.

The war's emotional effects are just as real but even harder to measure. “Some children have no faith in the future,” Teplova said. “They are more irritable and have more trouble dealing with their emotions. It will take a long time to deal with that.” When Staryi Saltiv opened its first underground learning center, “kids would come in and just touch another child,” said Glazunova, the town's education-and-culture director, miming a wide-eyed child reaching her hands out hungrily for contact. “They didn't have the experience of being close to others.”

Every adolescent I spoke with in Ukraine talked about the misery of isolation. “I don't remember my life without this war,” Solomiia Taranenko, a 19-year-old university student in Kyiv, told me. As a child, she said, “you'd be watching cartoons, then you change the channel and you see a city on fire” in eastern Ukraine, where Russia began a proxy war in 2014. After the 2022 invasion, she said, she spent months confined at home; later, she began bringing potassium-iodide pills everywhere, in case of a nuclear attack. “It became really normal: class, air alert, go to the bomb shelter, back to class.”

In a small farming town called Savyntsi, a group of local officials described to me a recent study showing elevated cancer rates among young people in the area. Sickness was just one of many ways, they said, in which the cumulative stress of war had permeated children's lives: anxiety, depression, reduced academic achievement. Nothing, they told me, was more important than restoring a sense of normalcy to the younger generation. In early 2022, the town's brief Russian occupation ended, leaving behind dozens of bombed-out buildings. The officials decided to delay the town's aboveground reconstruction and instead put all of their efforts into a regional underground school that would accommodate 450 students from 18 nearby hamlets.

“This school is our No. 1 priority,” Oksana Suprun, the mayor, told me. In the meantime, the school is sending teachers to give lessons in smaller underground spaces in the hamlets.

Towns like Savyntsi are getting help from a loose movement of nonprofits and zealous volunteers such as Markevych, the psychologist who founded the Mobile School of Resilience three years ago. Markevych works with about 20 colleagues and spends much of her time driving around eastern Ukraine in a van, organizing tutoring and puppet shows and handing out books. In the formerly occupied areas, she told me, the Russians removed all of the Ukrainian books from local libraries.

“Everyone needed help in the gray zone” near the front line, Markevych said about her work, which began as a one-woman volunteer effort in 2017. “Some were accused of being traitors because they stayed” during the Russian occupation. “Some kids born after 2014 never knew peace.” When she and her colleagues first began organizing summer camps in formerly occupied areas, Markevych told me, “some parents resisted because the Russians ‘invited' kids on trips and they never returned.” (Russia has abducted almost 19,000 children, according to Ukrainian authorities, and some estimates run much higher.)

Markevych briefly teared up as she described the first summer after the Russian invasion, when she helped organize a summer camp for kids from formerly occupied towns. Many were traumatized, and when they saw fireworks, “they hid inside and cried,” she said. “But the camp was important because they regained contact with friends. That allowed them to begin planning their future.”

Ukrainian educators and child advocates told me that getting children into real classrooms was only one part of their project. Another was to bolster their sense of Ukrainian identity. I attended an opening-day school ceremony in Savyntsi in early September during which every speaker—the town mayor, teachers, valedictorians—emphasized the importance of teaching Ukrainian language, history, and culture. After the speeches came Ukrainian songs, poems, tributes to soldiers, and, of course, the national anthem.

One of the groups that has done the most cultural-preservation work is Plast, the main Ukrainian Scouting organization, which has expanded its efforts to serve Ukrainian children since the 2022 invasion. Plast was founded in 1911 and banned by both the Nazis and the Soviet authorities. It has taken on a new significance in the past three years as a defender of Ukrainian traditions against the threat of Russification.

Plast has tried to downplay its aggressively nationalist past. But Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament and a former scout, told me, “We exchange instructors and knowledge with the Khartia brigade,” a large military unit based in Kharkiv. In a country where 85 percent of people identify as Christian, Plast has an unmistakable, though ecumenical, religious orientation: Every Christmas, Plast scouts make their way to the front line with a “peace flame” that has traveled all the way from Bethlehem via an Austrian cathedral. The scouts tell the soldiers, “We give this to you,” as they pass on the flame, Yurchyshyn said. “You can rely on us. You have a place to return to. You will return to a better society.”

Some youth groups work even more closely with the military. One evening in Kharkiv, I happened upon a memorial service for fallen soldiers. Dozens of adolescents stood at attention in neat rows. They all wore navy-blue shirts bearing the words Patriots 1654, the date of Kharkiv's founding and the name of a youth wing created by Kraken, a volunteer military brigade based in the city that has a reputation for recruiting bouncers and soccer ultras. One of the kids, an athletic-looking teenager named Ladislav, told me that 1654 is organized into platoons that train with Kraken commanders. Many of them go on to fight in the infantry. A number of other Ukrainian brigades have created their own youth wings.

These efforts may be essential to Ukraine's ability to maintain the pipeline of new soldiers that it needs for the war effort. Everyone is keenly aware that Ukraine is at a demographic disadvantage vis-à-vis Russia, which continues to hurl infantry soldiers into the war with little regard for their lives. Many Ukrainians also know that just across the front line, Russia is engaged in a much more extreme form of youth indoctrination.



In the occupied areas of Ukraine, Russian authorities have been remaking the schools since 2014, eliminating classes in Ukrainian language and culture and implementing military training alongside a rigid Russian-nationalist curriculum. These classes start in the first grade.

Tetiana Lychko, a documentarian at Almenda, a Kyiv-based think tank that has reported on Russia's activities in the occupied areas, told me that the classes are compulsory, and that if students do not attend, their parents are called in. Soldiers and priests visit the schools to talk to the youngest children about the importance of the “special military operation.” In a class called “Security and Defense of the Motherland,” introduced last year, seventh- and eighth-grade students learn to operate assault rifles and first-person-view drones. Some specialized “cadet schools” start the training in preschool, where 4-year-olds are taught the names of weapons and how to make camouflage nets for the front line. Outside school, authorities organize even more advanced military-training regimes, such as Zarnitsa 2.0, an open-air war game with origins in the Soviet era.

In spite of Russia's efforts, Ukrainian children regularly escape from the occupied areas, many with the help of their parents. I met one of them in Kyiv, an 18-year-old woman from a town in the Donetsk region whom I'll call Mariya; she asked that I not use her real name, because she still has family in the occupied zone. She told me that before she escaped last year, “I didn't really understand I lived in Ukraine—they said in school it was the republic of Donetsk.” Her parents were opposed to the Russian occupation but too frightened to talk about it. After Russian-backed forces seized Donetsk in 2014, Mariya told me, people loyal to Moscow “pointed to those who were pro-Ukrainian and they were taken away. So most stayed quiet. My family too.”

Mariya was 7 when the occupation began, and the changes started immediately. “I had the impression that everything went back to the '90s; there was no investment, and things decayed,” she said. “Our school was like what Grandma described.”

Credit cards disappeared, as did mobile internet access, and public transport became scarce and unpredictable. Year by year, the propaganda at her school grew more aggressive and all-encompassing, and after Ukrainian classes were abolished, Mariya's ability to speak the language faded. Eventually, she persuaded her parents to let her leave, and her mother accompanied her on a risky trip through Russia into the Kyiv-controlled part of Ukraine. Even now, her parents (who stayed to take care of a grandparent) tell anyone who asks that she is studying in Russia.

Hundreds of other children have made the same journey. I spoke with Olena Rozvadoska, the co-founder of Voices of Children, a Kyiv-based nonprofit that provides psychological support to children, including those who come from the occupied areas. “These kids are promised 1 million rubles if they stay” in the Russian-controlled areas, Rozvadoska told me. “It's nonsense. They say: ‘You will have nothing in Ukraine. It's a fake country. You will be killed.'” The children tend to be euphoric after they first arrive in Ukrainian-controlled territory, she said, but many succumb to depression afterward, especially if they have left family in the east. That is when they need help.



Behind all of the concern about the mental health of Ukrainian children lurks a bigger question regarding the generations too young to have taken part in the unifying 2014 revolt against Russia. The Revolution of Dignity brought thousands of young Ukrainians into the center of Kyiv and ultimately deposed the Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovych; the experience was formative for Ukrainian Millennials, who cast their lot with a democratic West against what many saw as a rapacious and autocratic neighbor. It was also the immediate precursor to the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and incursion into eastern Ukraine.

Today's young people have lived under martial law for three and a half years, with no near prospect of participating in meaningful elections; their political and social isolation has left many Ukrainians wondering whether they will inherit their elders' dedication to democracy. But Anton Grushetskyi, a Kyiv-based pollster, told me that he saw some encouraging signs—for instance, that 60 percent of young Ukrainians believe that a successful life is possible in their country, despite what looks to most of them like a permanent state of war.

Many in this young cohort may share the idealism that drew their predecessors to the barricades, even if they have not had much chance to show it. I met several adolescents who said they took seriously the idea that their generation could help provide a moral example to the world. One was a 19-year-old university student from Kharkiv named Anna Kovalenko, who recently organized a series of musical and artistic gatherings called Imagination Space that drew hundreds of participants. She grew up in Saltivka, an enclave in northern Kharkiv that was hit very hard during the first month of the 2022 Russian invasion. Her mother had wanted to get her out of Ukraine at the time—the family had offers of help and money from abroad—but Kovalenko told me that she'd refused to leave her father and grandparents. She hopes to become an architect and help rebuild her country after the war ends.

“Every time people could be helped, I'm overexcited; I barely explode,” she said over the din of an air-raid siren in a Kharkiv cafe. “It's amazing that I can be helpful in this place. That's why I'm still here.”

In July, thousands of young people participated in anti-corruption protests across the country. The rallies succeeded in stopping the passage of a bill that would have reduced the independence of two of Ukraine's anti-corruption bodies. Yana Sliemzina, a 29-year-old journalist who helped organize one of the street protests in Kharkiv, told me that the victory was a political rite of passage for her and many others, partly because corruption has been something of a taboo subject in recent years, thanks to its prominent role in Russian propaganda against Ukraine. Others who took part told me they were happy for any chance to assert their belief in democracy after years of feeling that their lives were permanently on hold, their horizons shrunken by a constant, anxious search for social-media tips about where the next drone would strike.

In a war that has come to seem endless, many young people told me that they prefer not to think about the future at all. Perhaps that is because they know the war's end will bring a whole new set of challenges and a different kind of heroism. They will have to restore a shattered, traumatized country full of single mothers, maimed veterans, and homeless and displaced people. The outside world may be much less willing to help them than it is today.

“It's very hard, the weight of it all,” Katya Markevych, a 15-year-old in Kharkiv, told me when I asked her to envision life after the war. “We feel like we will have to rebuild this country literally and metaphorically. It's a lot of responsibility.”

Memory defines us in so many ways, but it's not exactly what we think it is.

We tend to imagine memory almost like a filing cabinet — a faithful record of the past we can pull from when needed. But according to new research, memory is less about storing facts and more about shaping the story of our lives. It helps us make sense of the present and construct meaning out of chaos.

Dr. Charan Ranganath is a neuroscientist at University of California Davis, and the author of Why We Remember: Unlocking Memory's Power to Hold on to What Matters. His work has transformed how scientists understand the mind's most mysterious function. I invited him onto The Gray Area to talk about why forgetting is as essential as remembering, how emotion shapes what we recall, why trauma lingers, and how collective memory can bind — or divide — entire societies.

As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

You write that the most important message from memory science isn't “remember more.” So what is memory for?

It's not a vault that stores every experience. Memory is a resource we draw on to understand what's happening now, to plan, and to anticipate the future.

When people say, “I have a bad memory,” what do you think they're misunderstanding?

If someone truly had a “bad memory,” as in clinically impaired, they couldn't function independently. I've tested patients like that. What most people mean is, “I can't always recall what I want, when I want.” Often these are high-functioning people who expect to remember everything. That expectation is the mismatch.

But surely some memories are “better” than others…or is “better/worse” the wrong frame?

That's the mistake. People conflate “more” with “better.” Take highly superior autobiographical memory: Some folks can tell you what they ate on March 7, 2011, who won a game, what the weather was. You might think they have a great memory. But they don't learn a new language faster than anyone else. And many report it's a burden; they can't stop replaying minor negative moments. Some even call it a curse. So “more” isn't necessarily “better.”

So in my case, I'd say that I have a somewhat weird and annoying memory. I can remember whole chunks of certain books or random trivia, but then I routinely forget faces and names — things I actually want to remember. Why?

There are two big issues. First, competition. Memories compete with each other. If my desk is piled high with near-identical papers, it's hard to find one. Faces are like that: Most have two eyes, a nose, a mouth; they're highly similar. Names are also similar, and the mapping between a face and a name is arbitrary. “Baker” used to refer to someone who baked bread; now it doesn't. So you've got similar inputs and an arbitrary link. That's interference.

The other issue has to do with attention. When you meet someone, your attention is split: noise, small talk, your own self-consciousness. If the name doesn't get a clean “write-in,” retrieval later is shaky. It's not that you can't remember names; it's that the name was never strongly encoded in the first place.

Can you give us practical hacks so we stop embarrassing ourselves at parties?

I'll give you three quick ones and a couple bonuses:

How does memory change with age? What declines and what holds?

Separate episodic from semantic memory. Semantic is facts and knowledge — history, vocabulary, expertise. Episodic is remembering a specific event in time, like where you put your keys, details from a conversation, the unique texture of a day.

With aging, it's mostly episodic memory — forgetfulness, names, details — that declines. Semantic memory often stays solid, even grows. Another piece: retrieval control. Older adults often know the actor's name but can't pull it up; proper nouns are notorious. That's tied to executive function in the prefrontal cortex, which gradually declines starting around 30. It's not just storing memories; it's regulating attention and using strategies. That's what slips.

Give me concrete examples of episodic versus semantic in everyday life.

Semantic: you know what a mortgage is, the rules of baseball, your profession's jargon. Episodic: the first house you toured, where you parked today, the specific at-bat where your kid hit a double. When people say, “My memory is getting worse,” they usually mean, “My episodic memory is less reliable in the moment,” not “I've lost my knowledge of the world.”

So the throughline is: Memory isn't free. You have to set an intention.

Exactly. Ask: What do I want to remember from this? If your goal is to remember names, start with that intention and deploy the strategy. If you assume memories “come for free,” you'll be disappointed.

There are studies showing the happiness we get from our choices is determined less by what we experienced and more by what we remember. Why is that?

Because we forget most details quickly. Classic findings show you can lose around 60 percent of newly learned details within an hour. What remains are beginnings, endings, highs, and lows — the parts most useful for future decisions. The “remembering self,” not the “experiencing self,” often drives satisfaction later.

Can you give an example of how that plays out?

Think about a vacation. The experiencing self has 100 small moments — waiting in lines, one great sunset, one bad dinner. The remembering self condenses [it all] to a highlight reel: the perfect swim at the end (peak), the travel nightmare (low), the last night's dinner (ending). That compressed story — more than the raw sum of moments — drives whether you say, “That trip was amazing; let's go back.”

That suggests the stories we tell ourselves really matter. We're constantly updating memories — they're not etched in stone — so maybe we can deliberately remember the “right” things and be happier. 

Memory is more like a painting than a photograph. Van Gogh's church is recognizably that church, but it's also his perspective: what he emphasized, what he left out, where he stood, the light he chose. Every time we remember, we create a fresh painting — same event, different vantage point. That's why a terrible experience can become, later, a funny story. The facts don't vanish; our relationship to them changes.

What about trauma? Those memories can feel impossible to shake. How are traumatic memories different? Are they different at all?

Emotionally significant events get biochemical priority…There's also a distinction between details and the visceral punch — that surge of fear or pain. [These memories] rely on partly different systems. What makes trauma feel “photographic” is usually the emotion, not perfect detail. The goal isn't to forget. You want to remember without the punch. You want to keep the information that keeps you safe, without reliving the threat. Sleep can help “de-charge” memories; sometimes it doesn't, and that's where PTSD arises and professional care matters.

Music seems to have a special power over memory. Why does a sad song cue sad memories, and a happy song cue happy ones?

Episodic memories are organized by context — place, time, internal state. Emotion is part of that context. If you're sad now, you're effectively searching the “sad” wing of the library. Music is a potent emotional cue, and it's tied to identity across time. We pick music that matches who we are at different stages of life, so it becomes a vehicle to revisit who we were.

You write about memory shaping identity, and how our “self” is a narrative stitched together through memory. Is the self just a memory system holding a story together?

In some ways, yes. We have schemas — blueprints for weddings, basketball games, restaurant scripts — and we have self-schemas: stories about who we are. When we remember, we don't just list details; we stitch causes and effects: I felt angry, so I left. Or: She left because of an emergency. Those causal links are how we make sense of the past and plan the future. The self-schema organizes those links across time.

If someone loses their memories, can they still be themselves?

People with dense amnesia can retain a thin sense of self — preferences, traits — but there's often a flatness. Without episodic memory, there's little ability to “mentally time travel” — to enliven who you were or could be. Many amnesic patients are “stuck” at an earlier age internally; they look in the mirror and don't recognize the older face. The self can persist, but it becomes emptier without the episodic wellspring.

Do political movements do the same thing — stitch collective memory into a collective identity?

Absolutely. Families have a shared story; nations do too. When we tell each other those stories, everyone's memory changes — yours, mine, ours. That's powerful for transmitting wisdom, and dangerous because memory is selective and malleable. Authoritarian regimes know this: change the statues, rewrite the textbooks, restrict archives, and you reshape identity by reshaping memory.

As we become more segregated culturally and informationally, we end up with different memories of the same events. That feels pretty unsustainable.

It's one of the biggest threats I see, especially as AI ramps up scale and speed. We used to share a limited set of fact-checked sources. That was imperfect, but also constraining. Now it's easy to believe whatever feels good. Long-form podcasts, Substacks, YouTube — “let it all air and the truth will emerge” — doesn't account for how memory works. We remember what fits our prior beliefs and emotional states, and we forget base-rate statistics because “nothing happened” isn't memorable. Vivid anecdotes drive causal beliefs; numbers don't.

How does that play out with misinformation?

Two ways. First, salience bias: The vivid story of a vaccine side effect outweighs 100,000 uneventful vaccinations. Second, social reinforcement: When a higher-status voice in a group asserts a confident — but wrong — detail, it spreads like a social contagion. People remember the confidently expressed version later. The fix isn't one magical source of truth, it's cultivating habits that counteract memory's weaknesses: multiple sources, wait-time before sharing, explicit uncertainty, and exposure to disconfirming evidence.

How malleable is collective memory? Can a country rewrite its story as an individual can?

Collective memory magnifies the strengths and weaknesses of individual memory. That's bad news and good news. The bad news is that it's easy to steer with simple, repeated narratives. The good news is that groups can also change course if they build norms for cross-checking, include diverse perspectives, and keep an audit trail of sources. That slows the “contagion” effect and creates a richer, more accurate shared story.

So which comes first: memories or beliefs? Do memories form beliefs, or do beliefs curate memories?

Both. We build beliefs from what we've heard, done, and remembered. And beliefs filter what we can retrieve and how we reconstruct it. People tend to recall their past more positively than it was and remember themselves more favorably. Scale that up to a nation and you get, “We were great; we were wronged; we must be great again.” The narrative selects the memories, and the memories entrench the narrative.

There's a question here about memory and forgiveness. Do we have to forget to move on — individually and socially? Or is that price too high?

“Forgiving is not forgetting; forgiving is remembering without pain.” That line captures it. Truth and reconciliation processes can help — or re-traumatize — depending on how the remembering happens. Just dredging up the past doesn't heal. The work is to change your relationship to the memory: retain the information, reduce the toxicity. That's true in therapy and in society.

What does “changing your relationship” look like in practice?

There are a few elements we see across approaches. You can contextualize causes. Understanding why something happened doesn't excuse it, but it can reduce the sense of present threat. You can have different vantage points; telling the story from a future self, or from a compassionate narrator, shifts emphasis. You can add new meaning. Extracting what you learned or how it shaped your values rewires the “why this matters” tag. And you can aim for safe retrievals. Recalling in safe contexts, then returning to the present, teaches your brain the memory is not the event.

Any parting advice?

I'd add two things. First, the intention principle: memory isn't free, easy, or absolute. Decide what matters before the moment — names at a party, details of a family trip, ideas from a book — and use strategies accordingly. Second, I'd love to make a plug for science. If we want progress on Alzheimer's, trauma, learning, then we need sustained support for research. Call your representatives, express your support, make your voice heard. Those small actions matter.

The federal government shutdown has become the Grinch who stole Halloween for Johnny Jones.

Halloween is typically a big deal for the Jones family — they love to decorate, hand out candy and hot dogs, and enjoy a neighborhood shindig. But Jones, who works for the Transportation Security Administration, isn't getting a paycheck during the shutdown. That means big Halloween plans are out of the budget; so is an outing for his daughter and her friends to the new Taylor Swift movie.

""We're probably another couple of weeks from having to prepare to start selling stuff. I've already started identifying things that I could liquidate easily to get cash,"" said Jones, who is the president of local 1040 of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union.

Across the country, government workers like Jones are cutting back on subscriptions, canceling vacations, skipping car repairs, pausing kids' dance classes, and delaying credit card payments.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay amid the shutdown, while the Trump administration pushes through new staff cuts. Most employees received one final prorated check this week for the days worked immediately before the shutdown; it could be their last until Congress reaches a funding deal. The same goes for government contractors, which include people working in cafeteria and janitorial roles at federal buildings, on Capitol Hill, and at national museums and historical sites.

Business Insider interviewed more than two dozen workers across agencies and the military. Some said they are dipping into savings, while others worry they won't be able to afford medicine and rent next month. The White House has hinted that furloughed workers and those still on the job may not receive back pay. Meanwhile, thousands of federal employees who received termination notices since the start of the shutdown are left in limbo after an October 15 court ruling temporarily paused their layoffs.

Federal workers told Business Insider that one check can be the difference between paying a bill or going into debt.

A Pew analysis showed that nearly half of government employees earned under $89,000 annually as of March 2024, with 8% earning less than $50,000 — money that goes fast if families are paying for housing, childcare, groceries, and medicine.

""A lot of us are living paycheck to paycheck, like most Americans, but even more so now we have to be cognizant of where every penny is going,"" Mark Cochran, a furloughed National Park Service employee in Pennsylvania and AFGE Local 3145 president, previously told Business Insider.

One civilian Department of Defense worker has been hitting the phones: They've reached out to their mortgage company and two major banks to see if they can get a loan or forbearance. So far, prospects have been grim.

""My pay covers me through October but if the shutdown continues past October into November I won't have enough savings to pay for the bills,"" the DoD worker said. It's been a stressful time, they said, as they scramble to get last-minute credit card and loan applications together. They've already applied for a bridge loan from the United States Senate Federal Credit Union. ""I just wished that we could get more financial support from these public companies (even major ones) when it was not our fault.""

A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employee said they are trying to secure a mortgage loan approval this month, but ""that fell through because of the missing paycheck,"" and a National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee said that they're delaying repairs to their roof and car. One Internal Revenue Service worker said medical challenges would become ""drastically more expensive"" if they lost their job. Another IRS employee said they're anxious about making credit card and loan payments.

Cochran and others added that they are worried about how their diminished spending will impact small businesses in their community. A few said they are working with colleagues to organize food drives or apply for SNAP and unemployment benefits. 

Just days after the shutdown began, unemployment claims in DC started to spike, while an analysis by The Century Foundation found that around 10,500 federal workers across the country have filed for unemployment since the shutdown began.

Many are looking for stopgaps, too. USAA, which offers interest-free loans equivalent to paychecks for impacted federal workers, said that they've approved and funded nearly $243 million for around 65,000 loans in the first week of opening the program. The Maryland Department of Labor received more than 550 applications between October 6 and October 14 for its federal worker loans. And the Navy Federal Credit Union, which offers a similar program, said that they're ""seeing a significant uptick in participation.""

""It's very difficult for me to advocate to an employee, 'Hey, take a loan out so you can come to work,'"" Jones, the AFGE local 1040 president, said.

Layered on the paycheck uncertainty is whether workers will even have jobs to return to.

A filing from the Office of Management and Budget on October 10 indicated that between 4,132 and 4,232 federal workers were marked for layoffs, with some receiving RIF notices that day. Administration sources told Business Insider that the numbers in the filing are ""just a snapshot in time"" and OMB head Russell Vought said during an appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show that the layoffs will total about 10,000.

For now, those planned cuts are paused by a court order, and the administration cannot legally enforce layoffs for employees who have already received notices or continue issuing new terminations.

At one agency in particular, employees are feeling whiplash. A few hundred workers at the Centers for Disease Control received RIF notices at the end of last week, then were told over the weekend that they could remain in their posts. An HHS spokesperson told Business Insider that some employees received incorrect notifications and ""are not subject to the reduction in force."" The CDC union confirmed that ""around 700 employees received emails rescinding their illegal terminations. More than 600 workers remain unjustly fired.""

A few CDC workers told Business Insider that this lack of job security is having a tangible impact on their lives and financial planning.

""We have an emergency cushion, but I am concerned about how long it's going to go on,"" one laid-off CDC worker — who wasn't called back — said, ""We have talked about selling our house if we need to. We've also talked about tapping into retirement savings as a very last resort.""

Another CDC employee mistakenly received the layoff email. They said they're the breadwinner for their family, and have considered cutting back on activities for their kids and applying for an emergency loan. Over the past eight months of DOGE firings and the government shutdown, the employee said they have had ""pretty charged conversations about what our life is going to look like"" with their spouse.

""I guess it was a bit of relief if I still have a job and I know where my next paycheck is going to come from when the shutdown ends,"" they said, ""But the ground has been shaken beneath us.""

Over 200,000 federal workers have lost their jobs, and thousands more have left their government posts through retirement, buyouts, quits, and deferred resignations since Trump took office in January.

Senate Democrats and Republicans have not yet reached a funding agreement to end the government shutdown. ""The Trump Administration is encouraging the Democrats to stop the pain and reopen the government with the bipartisan funding proposal they supported just 6 months ago and 13 times under Biden,"" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, previously told Business Insider.

Until then, some employees are draining their bank accounts to show up for unpaid shifts until they can't afford it anymore.

""Gas stations don't take IOUs. I talked to a couple employees, they said, 'this is my last fill-up and I won't have any money,' because they don't have credit cards,"" Jones said. ""They're literally like, this is the last tank of gas I'm going to have until I get paid again. I was like, this is just too much. People are asking like, 'Hey, I'd love to come work — but may not have gas money.'""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Salvatore, 44, the founder of Heritage Hospitality Group, a company with a few bars and coffee shops in Chicago. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I own Heritage Hospitality Group in Chicago, and we've been around since 2011. It started as a bicycle manufacturing company, and I paired that with a café. I did that for a few years as I pursued my interests throughout the hospitality industry. We now have five different brands: Froth, Heritage Outpost, Heritage Bikes & Coffee, Larry's, and Bunker.

I love the customers. I love solving the problems that arise. I love experimenting with food. I love coming up with new drinks. I love my employees, and the interactions I have with everybody I get to work with.

How have tariffs or other factors affected your business? Reach out to this reporter at mhoff@businessinsider.com.

My teenager is now working at the shop as a dishwasher. That's so fun to see. We started this company when he was several months old.

It's always been about the people, it's always been about the hospitality, and that keeps me going. I love it.

COVID was one of the hardest points in my life operating a business. Everything was uncertain, and everything was shut down. We paused, we took a break, and figured it out.

Now, it feels like everything's uncertain, but no one's giving it the attention it needs. The current moment with inflation and policy uncertainty is starting to rival running a business during COVID.

Any bicycle parts, anything coming from overseas, that's getting hit, whether it's tariffs or lack of inventory at this point, because the wholesalers don't have it either. Coffee bean prices have obviously gone up. Tariffs on South America, Brazil in particular, have carried that weight of the tariffs.

Even things like cups, paper goods, anything that we rely on — essentially, nothing's manufactured in the States. It's a global economy, so everything gets hit.

The biggest issue is not knowing what is going on. You can't operate a business with uncertainty.

Every day is a win or a loss, and you can't really run a business that way. This uncertainty creates this temperature where I'm going to hold off on any major decisions because I don't know how that's going to affect my bottom line tomorrow.

The uncertainty stems from a few factors. It's tariffs, it's political, it's immigration, it's labor. We're going into the slow season. That's going to be uncertain. I'm frozen for at least six months.

It's like we're operating in a hurricane with all these things flying in our faces, and we're just trying to make sure that the kitchen's open and the coffee's warm.

Tariffs are a key reason. But we're also raising prices due to across-the-board cost increases: labor, insurance, coffee, paper goods. Everything is up. Tariffs were the tipping point.

We're raising prices in stages, starting with coffee. Next, we're looking at pastries, packaged drinks, and eventually our food menu. We're reviewing item by item over the next two months and adjusting where the margin hit is greatest. We're not taking a blanket approach — it's strategic and staged.

At Froth, we raised the price of a cappuccino from $4.50 to $4.75. A 12-ounce drip coffee went from $3.00 to $3.15. A cold brew went from $4.75 to $5.00. At Heritage Bikes & Coffee, a cortado went from $4.25 to $4.50. Most changes were in that 5% range, rounded up.

I don't want to bombard everybody, but it needs to be done. Right now, we are just increasing prices on coffee drinks, where we lost a ton of margin, and I needed to recoup some of that. So that's where the first step was. We'll continue to do that throughout the next few months and slowly but surely raise prices where it makes sense.

Raising prices is really hard for me. It's been years since I've done that for coffee. It needed to be done because I see that we're making more revenue, but we have less margin for any profit to pay our folks.

I have a hard time raising prices on my customers, who come in and spend their money on a coffee, bike, service, beer, or food. Growing up, we didn't really go out of our way to go out to coffee or go to the local restaurants. So I know how special that can be. I've always wanted that to be within striking distance of most people.

We debated announcing the increase widely by email, but ultimately decided to explain it directly when asked, which felt more aligned with how we do things.

Reactions have been surprisingly quiet. Most people haven't noticed or haven't said anything. A few regulars asked about the change, and when we explained it was tariff and cost-related, they nodded and moved on. I think people generally understand that everything is getting more expensive.

When I look at what our margins are and how thin they've become in order to operate, I've had to raise those prices.

We cut staff in September due to tariffs, but also to streamline operations in response to thinning margins.

There are some key points where we thought we could run more efficiently. Our margin for labor, it should be a certain point, a certain percentage of your income. We couldn't meet that.

We made operational changes focused on efficiency — eliminating overlapping shifts, reducing prep cook hours, and cutting a few key middle-management roles like kitchen manager, events, and social media.

I'd love to be able to have someone on social media and marketing. It would help business, but I don't think it would help it enough to make up for their salary at this point.

We implemented a hiring freeze in late September due to tariffs and economic uncertainty more broadly. We're being extremely selective so while there may be a few specific roles open (like event-based or part-time), we've halted active recruiting across the company.

People are coming in. People are buying. Even with that, even with great revenue coming in, because coffee prices went up, because paper goods went up, because labor went up, because insurance went up, every line item in our expense sheet has gone up.

When you're operating at thin margins as it is, those matter hugely. So if you're talking about every expense that's gone up throughout your QuickBooks account, no matter how much revenue comes in, unless you have an incredible year, you can't keep up with the expenses unless you raise your prices.

As a group, as a management, we talk about finances weekly. We're planning for those slower months, making sure that we are realistic about the hours we can provide for our staff. We're realistic about what we can offer, what we can buy, just trying to run a skeleton operation until we understand where the other side of this is. I'm not necessarily going to have to take out loans or anything.

I always try to operate within our revenues. As long as we can do that week to week, we keep track of what's going on week to week, we make sure we're running cost of goods, labor within line of a certain formula, we'll be OK. But it's going to get thin for sure.

When London-based Priya Sadhwani and her husband were on parental leave, they decided to take an extended trip to New York City to visit family. After searching for vacation rental options, she realized it wasn't feasible for a monthlong trip.

""New York is unaffordable to do so on Airbnb,"" she said, adding they wanted a place that was a similar size to their home. ""I just wanted that same feel with the baby and also for my parents to come and stay with us in the city.""

That's when she discovered Kindred, a membership-based home swapping network that allows users to stay in each other's homes around the world. No money is exchanged between hosts and guests. Instead, guests pay Kindred a standard cleaning fee and a service fee that averages $15 to $30 per night. Priya and her husband ended up coming to New York for six weeks and staying in three different Kindred homes. In total, they paid around $1,800 for their stays.

Not only was the home swapping experience more affordable, but it was also more personal than traditional travel stays, she said. One of the hosts even left diapers in her daughter's size and cheesecake in the fridge because the owners were starting a cheesecake business.

""It feels like I'm staying in a friend's house while they're away,"" she said.

Sadhwani and her husband are part of a growing group of travelers who are turning to home swapping instead of hotels or short-term rentals, as travel costs are on the rise and remote work has provided more flexibility.

""There's just a tremendous need and a tremendous desire for a new way to travel that's more human, way more affordable, and also more responsible for our cities,"" Justine Palefsky, cofounder and CEO of Kindred, told Business Insider.

Since its founding in 2021, Kindred has grown to over 200,000 members. Some of the most popular destinations are New York, London, Los Angeles, Paris, and Amsterdam, and over 90% of the properties on Kindred are primary residences. In 2023, Kindred raised $15 million in Series A funding led by New Enterprise Associates.

Homes of all types are accepted on the app, from studio apartments to multi-bedroom mansions, but they all must meet the minimum standards of being safe, functional, and inviting, Palefsky said.

""It doesn't need to be Architectural Digest, but it needs to have some amount of soul and personality,"" she said.

Kindred is a give-to-get marketplace. It's free to join and no money is exchanged between host and guest, but in order to stay in someone else's home, members need to offer up their own home.

Sometimes the app connects people for direct swaps — for instance, a member in Los Angeles could swap their home with a member in New York for two weeks. Members can also build up credits by offering their homes when they're out of town and not staying at another Kindred. They can then spend those credits on nights at other Kindred homes.

Palefsky said the swapping ""allows the relationship to feel much more like a social contract instead of a financial contract.""

Meagan Cignoli, a sculptor based in West Hollywood, told Business Insider that Kindred is the first option she checks when planning a trip. She's stayed in Kindred homes in Portugal, Greece, Mexico, and Joshua Tree. She's even used it locally to stay in downtown Los Angeles or Santa Monica when she has a couple of days of work on the other side of town and doesn't want to deal with commuting back and forth.

""Now, when I look at hotels or Airbnbs, I'm shocked by the price,"" she said.

""The one bad thing is it has me so spoiled by the price that it's hard to swallow other options"" when she's traveling to destinations without Kindred.

Cignoli first started home swapping nearly 20 years ago, using platforms like Craigslist. She said a major benefit of Kindred is the variety and flexibility. By offering another member a weekend at her one-bedroom apartment, she can earn credits to stay a weekend at a four-bedroom house with a pool.

And because each Kindred stay has a one-time cleaning fee regardless of how many nights they stay, guests get a better deal the longer the trip. Cignoli said it's enabled her to take much longer vacations than she would otherwise.

Palefsky said Kindred's main challenge is sustaining its growth while maintaining trust.

""This only works if people really feel comfortable joining with their primary residence, and that's a big leap,"" she said, adding that the company is ""obsessed"" with ensuring it's delivering a quality experience.

To use the app, would-be homeswappers apply. Once accepted, members' identities are verified via government IDs. New members are required to complete ""a quick home verification before their first trip,"" according to Kindred's website, to make sure ""homes on the platform are accurately represented.""

Sadhwani said she makes a point of having a video chat with anyone she's swapping with. It helps her feel more comfortable about hosting people she doesn't know, and it also makes her travel experience more personal by providing an opportunity to get recommendations from a local.

She's also been amazed at how respectful Kindred members have been when staying in her home, and how easy it's been to make friends with other members.

Kindred is now Sadhwani's preferred way to travel, and it's even dictating where her family decides to go next.

""Instead of looking for a destination, we're looking for a fun Kindred home to visit.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dave Greenlaw, a human resources executive in Washington, D.C., about why he plans to attend an HR conference later this month where conservative activist Robby Starbuck — a vocal critic of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives — is scheduled to speak.

The event is being organized by the world's largest HR association, the Society for Human Resource Management. SHRM is facing backlash over the matter, with some HR pros saying they are canceling their membership. Greenlaw, who has worked in HR for nearly 17 years and has been a member of SHRM for about four years, explained why he won't be following suit.

This interview has been edited for space and clarity.

I completely disagree with Robby Starbuck's views. But my personal take is that HR leaders need to understand the full landscape of the workforce and the workplace, even when it might be uncomfortable.

There are so many factors that go into a productive workplace, different political beliefs and walks of life. Whether it's your sexuality, the color of your skin, your religion, whatever, I think it's really important to have that full perspective, particularly as an HR professional, because you're dealing with so much.

SHRM historically has hosted speakers across the political spectrum, such as former Presidents Joe Biden, George Bush Sr., and Bill Clinton, and I think that's a good thing. It goes back to HR leaders needing to understand the full landscape, even when they might disagree with these people or their policies.

What I think is valuable about this particular talk with Starbuck is that he is going to be on a panel with [lawyer and media personality] Van Jones that will be moderated by SHRM's CEO, Johnny C. Taylor, and they're both people of color. And Starbuck's views on DEI and LGBTQ issues — even though I personally find them abhorrent — he's a voice that I think might resonate with a certain populist out there, and it's important not to silence voices, even when you don't agree with them.

Even though Starbuck might say some terrible things, I think it's so important to acknowledge it and be prepared. What if you're an HR professional and all of a sudden you're handling something internally, and there's a disagreement with two people who are speaking about politics or DEI?

Hearing Taylor, Starbuck, and Jones could give you perspective on the matter, and you can bring it back to your place of employment. A million things could come out of this conversation. It's also important to acknowledge why people are upset about this. A lot of people feel like Starbuck doesn't have a lot to add to the conversation because of certain things he's already said. And I get that, too, and I understand the anger and frustration around it. But I think I see more of a broader, bigger picture.

I am a gay man, and I know the things that Starbuck has said are almost damaging to some of the members of my community. But you have to think of the bigger picture. Not everyone in the world is gay. Not everyone identifies and believes what I do. And when you're an HR professional, that is what you really have to keep in mind.

If I'm always using my beliefs to make decisions on things — particularly when I'm an employer or an HR person — that's not necessarily fair to the other individual, and I don't think it's necessarily appropriate. So I think it's important to hear these perspectives, have different types of temperament, and work with different voices.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Zach Yadegari, an 18-year-old cofounder and CEO at Cal AI, an AI-powered nutrition and food tracking app, based in Miami. Business Insider has verified the financial claims mentioned in this article. This story has been edited for length and clarity.

I sold my first app at 16 years old for almost $100,000. It was called Totally Science, an unblocked gaming website that allowed students to play games in school. It earned me thousands a year for two years through Google AdSense before I sold it.

Every app or game I've built has been to solve a problem in my own life. I was a skinny kid growing up and tried going to the gym to put on weight, but learned very quickly that most results come from diet. My cofounders and I set out to build a calorie-tracking app that integrates AI technology.

I moved to San Francisco a couple of months after launching with one of the other cofounders, and we spent the summer of our junior year in high school there alone, just the two of us, 17-year-olds, building out the team from scratch.

Our app really took off over the next year and a half, bringing us to now, where we are a 30-person team and generating around $30 million in annual revenue.

My parents put me in a coding camp when I was 7. I didn't learn that much, but it sparked my interest and showed me what was possible. YouTube taught me the rest. I would spend hours a day watching people program different video games.

BI's Young Geniuses series spotlights the next generation of founders, innovators, and thinkers who are trying to reshape industries and solve global challenges. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Jess Orwig to share your story.

I attempted to recreate some of the most complex video games with my own small tweaks. This didn't quite pan out as a 10-year-old trying to replicate what a team of 100 people had accomplished, but I learned a great deal. After watching ""The Social Network,"" Mark Zuckerberg became a massive inspiration. He was the main reason I pursued programming past making video games.

I wasn't that different from other kids. I got really good grades in school and had a social life with my friends. However, I spent multiple hours a day outside of school working on various projects. Even in class, I would always be building projects.

My cofounder, Henry, and I started building apps in the summer of 2023. It was just the two of us trying to figure things out from scratch, learning on our own. I messaged some people who built very successful apps to find mentors, and one of our other cofounders was one of the people I messaged. He had previously scaled a couple of apps to a few million downloads, and I had reached out to him for advice. He joined the team.

After that, we started working with a few influencers on videos, and the new app took off faster than any of us could have ever imagined. I quickly became aware that we had all the pieces for success to a much greater extent than any other project I had worked on, and I put the money from my previous app sale into it.

Henry and I spent July in San Francisco working on it, and that's when Cal AI became more established. We realized this wasn't just a flash in the pan, but something we could actually scale up.

The most beautiful and proudest moments in my life so far have probably been meeting people in person who show me Cal AI on their phone. It's awesome to see that something I built is being used by people every single day.

My advice to anyone would be to get started. Ignore the noise, ignore the people telling you that it's impossible to do it at a young age, and ignore the people trying to push you down a specific path to accomplish your goals.

It's becoming easier and easier to be a founder. There's a reason the age of these entrepreneurial kids making the headlines is getting younger. I had Google, the internet, and YouTube as my tools, but for the next generation of founders, it's ChatGPT that they can use to teach themselves. Which is so much easier than watching YouTube videos, where I was limited to the content library that people have posted.

I just enrolled as a student at the University of Miami, but I'm taking a pretty light course load right now. I'm still working on Cal AI, but I'm no longer needed in the day-to-day operations as much. We've put a lot of systems in place over the last year and a half, where I now just have to oversee the vision and guide us in the right direction.

The aspect of college that consumes a lot of time is the social life. The primary reason I'm enrolled in college right now is to meet and socialize with people my age and make friends. This definitely takes up a significant amount of time and mental space. So fun in the short term, but not super productive.

The biggest challenge is finding other like-minded people to relate to. I don't want to talk about random classes. I want to talk about real-world problems, solutions, business models, and other things that most kids my age aren't interested in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Companies are blaming AI for job cuts. Critics say it's a 'good excuse'","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/19/firms-are-blaming-ai-for-job-cuts-critics-say-its-a-good-excuse.html","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 05:19:12 GMT","



From tech to airlines, large global companies have been slashing staff as the real-world impact of artificial intelligence plays out, spooking employees. But critics say AI has become an easy excuse for firms looking to downsize.

Last month, tech consultancy firm Accenture announced a restructuring plan that includes quick exits for workers that aren't first able to reskill on AI. Days later, Lufthansa said it was going to eliminate 4,000 jobs by 2030 as it leans on AI to increase efficiency.

Salesforce also laid off 4,000 customer support roles in September, saying that AI can do 50% of the work at the company. Meanwhile, fintech firm Klarna has reduced staff by 40% as it aggressively adopts AI tools.

Language-learning platform Duolingo has stated that it will gradually stop relying on contractors and use AI to fill the gaps.

The headlines are grim, but Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, said there might be more to job cuts than meets the eye.

Previously there may have been some stigma attached to using AI, but now companies are ""scapegoating"" the technology to take the fall for challenging business moves such as layoffs.

""I'm really skeptical whether the layoffs that we see currently are really due to true efficiency gains. It's rather really a projection into AI in the sense of 'We can use AI to make good excuses,'"" Stephany said in an interview with CNBC.

Companies can essentially position themselves at the frontier of AI technology to appear innovative and competitive, and simultaneously conceal the real reasons for layoffs, according to Stephany.

""There might be various other reasons why companies are having to get rid of part of their workforce ... Duolingo or Klarna are really prime candidates for this because there has been overhiring during Corona [Covid-19 pandemic] as well,"" the professor said.

Some companies that flourished during the pandemic ""significantly overhired"" and the recent layoffs might just be a ""market clearance.""

""It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying ""we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'"" he added.

This pattern has sparked conversation online. One founder, Jean-Christophe Bouglé even said in a popular LinkedIn post that AI adoption is at a ""much slower pace"" than is being claimed and in large corporations ""there's not much happening"" with AI projects even being rolled back due to cost or security concerns.

""At the same time there are announcements of big layoff plans 'because of AI.' It looks like a big excuse, in a context where the economy in many countries is slowing down, despite what the incredible performance of stock exchanges suggest,"" said Bouglé, who co-founded Authentic.ly.

Jasmine Escalera, a careers expert, said this concealment is ""feeding the fear of AI"" with employees globally concerned about their jobs being replaced as a result of AI.

""So we already know that employees are scared because companies are not being honest, open and communicative about how they're implementing AI,"" Escalera told CNBC Make It. ""Now companies are openly stating 'We're doing this [layoffs] because of AI' so it's feeding the frenzy.""

Escalera said big companies need to be more responsible as they set the tone for what's the norm in business decision making and avoid greenlighting ""bad behavior.""

A Salesforce spokesperson clarified to CNBC that the company deployed its own AI agent, Agentforce, which reduced the number of customer support cases and eliminated the need to ""backfill support engineer roles,"" they said.

""We've successfully redeployed hundreds of employees into other areas like professional services, sales, and customer success,"" the Salesforce spokesperson added.

Klarna directed CNBC to its co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's comments on X where he explained that the company shrank its workforce from 5,500 to 3,000 people in two years but ""AI is only part of that story.""

Siemiatkowski linked the workforce reduction to slimming down its analytics team to one ""success team,"" with many then leaving by natural attrition as well as the reduction of the company's customer success team.

Lufthansa and Accenture declined to comment on the matter and did not share any further details on their AI restructuring strategy. Duolingo did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center at Yale University, released a report on Wednesday which showed that U.S. labor has actually been little disrupted by AI automation since the release of ChatGPT in 2022.

The lab examined U.S. labor market data from November 2022 to July 2025 using a ""dissimilarity index"" which measured how much the occupational mix—the share of workers in different jobs—has shifted since AI's debut and compared it to other technological shifts such as the introduction of computers and the internet. It found that AI hasn't yet caused widespread job losses.

Additionally, New York Fed economists released research in early September which showed that AI use amongst firms ""do not point to significant reductions in employment"" across the services and manufacturing industry in the New York–Northern New Jersey region.

It found that 40% of service firms said they were using AI this year, up from 25% last year, while manufacturing firms saw a similar jump from 16% last year to 26% this year, but very few were using AI to layoff workers.

Only 1% of the services firm reported AI as the reason for laying off workers in the past six months, down from 10% that had laid off workers using AI in 2024. Meanwhile, 12% of services firms said AI made them hire less workers in 2025.

By contrast, 35% of services firms have used AI to retrain employees and 11% have hired more as a result.

Stephany said there isn't much evidence from his research that shows large levels of technological unemployment due to AI.

""Economists call this structural unemployment, so the pie of work is not big enough for everybody anymore and so people will lose jobs definitely because of of AI, I don't think that this is happening on a mass scale,"" he said.

He added that concerns about technology putting an end to human work can be seen throughout history.

""It reoccurred this century alone a dozen times, you can go back to ancient times where Roman emperors put hold to certain machines because they were worried about this and always the contrary happened. The machine made companies, industries more productive.

""It allowed for the emergence of entirely new jobs. If you think about the internet 20 years ago, nobody would have known what a social media influencer is, what an app developer is because it didn't exist.""

In a minutes-long strike Sunday inside the world's most-visited museum, thieves rode a basket lift to the Louvre, forced a window into the Galerie d'Apollon — while tourists pressed shoulder-to-shoulder in the corridors — smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said.

It was among the highest-profile museum thefts in recent memory and comes as Louvre employees have complained of worker and security understaffing.

One object was later found outside the museum, according to Culture Minister Rachida Dati. French daily Le Parisien reported it was the emerald-studded crown of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugénie — gold, diamonds and sculpted eagles — recovered just beyond the walls, broken.

Dati called the strike the work of ""professionals,"" describing it on TF1 TV network as ""a four-minute operation carried out without violence.""

Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine.

Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing facade near a construction zone — an extraordinary vulnerability at a palace-museum.

Around 9:30 a.m. local time, several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the vitrines, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift.

The choice of target compounded the shock. The vaulted Galerie d'Apollon in the Denon wing, capped by a ceiling painted for Louis XIV, displays a selection of the French Crown Jewels. The thieves are believed to have approached via the riverfront facade, where construction is underway, used a freight elevator to reach the hall, took nine pieces from a 23-item collection linked to Napoleon and the Empress, and made off on motorbikes, according to Le Parisien.

Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre — with visitors present — ranks among Europe's most audacious since Dresden's Green Vault museum in 2019, and the most serious in France in more than a decade.

It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.

Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa is behind bulletproof glass in a bespoke, climate-controlled case.

It's unclear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday's breach.

The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence.

Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo's Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi's carved laws; Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People; Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa. More than 33,000 works — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe's masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.

The heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament.

""The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,"" Bardella wrote on X. ""This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?""

The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long ""Louvre New Renaissance"" plan — about €700 million to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.

Forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of ""inestimable"" historical value.

Recovery may prove difficult. ""It's unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,"" said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds. ""Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.""

The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine.

Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter.

Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.

Europe's banks take center stage this week as earnings season gets underway, but with heavy losses across the sector on Friday, credit concerns appear to be making their way across the Atlantic at a particularly tricky time for the region's lenders.

Last week, the biggest names in American finance battled it out to make the most alarming quote of the week. The contenders: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Citi Group CEO Jane Fraser and Apollo boss Marc Rowan.

Dimon started the week with a stark warning about the private credit market, saying ""when you see one cockroach, there's probably more.""

Fraser was up next, warning of ""pockets of valuation frothiness."" While Rowan was more explicit, suggesting that ""there's been a willingness to cut corners,"" in a recent appearance with the Financial Times.

With the sirens sounding stateside, what does this mean for Europe, and how will the continents' bankers narrate their concerns as earnings season kicks off in earnest next week?

European earnings season kicks off

Unicredit, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and Natwest will lead the financial names reporting in Europe and the U.K.

Head of Financials for Credit at Federated Hermes, Filippo Alloatti, told CNBC that he expects CEOs to ""shift from macro to micro risk"" as a focus in their earnings calls this week, amid concerns around the private credit markets. Meanwhile, Johann Scholtz from Morningstar told CNBC that while he does not see a material deterioration of credit quality appearing in third-quarter results, ""it will be interesting how candid management teams will be when discussing the future evolution of credit quality.""

Scholtz highlighted concerns about corporate and small-to-medium sized company loan books, saying ""the market is underestimating the impact that (trade) tariffs could have on certain pockets of European banks' lending books.""

On Friday, bank stocks across Europe sold off sharply as credit concerns drove big declines for the likes of Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, UBS and its peers across the sector.

Margin of error

CNBC's Silvia Amaro will speak to Unicredit CEO Andrea Orcel as the bank publishes its latest set of earnings, with S&P Global predicting a subdued third quarter amid narrowing net interest margins and higher funding costs.

The Italian lender is continuing it's M&A ambitions, increasing its stake in Greece's Alpha Bank to 26%, with Orcel saying ""we are grateful to the Greek government, the central bank and other Greek institutions for welcoming us and encouraging our investment."" The reception to Unicredit's expansion plans in Germany remains cooler.

Car trouble

British lender Lloyds Bank will also report next week, having just announced a new £1.95 billion hit to its balance sheet following a regulatory ruling over the mis-selling of car finance loans. The Financial Conduct Authority estimates the scandal will cost U.K. lenders up to £11 billion. IG predicts this charge will offset what would have been a strong quarter for the bank, as unlike some of it European rivals, net interest income continues to rise.

Monday: China GDP data

Tuesday: L'Oreal, Coca Cola, Netflix earnings

Wednesday: U.K. inflation data, Unicredit, Barclays, Tesla earnings

Thursday: Unilever, Lloyds Banking Group, SAP, Intel earnings

Friday: France, Germany, U.K. PMI data, Natwest, Procter & Gamble earnings

On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave some hints about more interest rate cuts, mentioning the weakness in the labor market.

Bearing in mind an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and potential rate cuts, investors can consider adding some dividend stocks to their portfolios to ensure stable income. The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive dividend-paying stocks with strong fundamentals.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first dividend pick is EOG Resources (EOG), a crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company with reserves in the U.S. and Trinidad. The company recently announced a deal to buy Encino Acquisition Partners for $5.6 billion. The deal will be accretive to EOG's free cash flow, supporting its commitment to shareholder returns.

EOG raised its quarterly dividend 5% to $1.02 per share, payable October 31. With an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG offers a yield of 3.8%.

Recently, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on EOG and raised his price target to $145 from $140. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on EOG stock with a price target of $133.

Hanold updated his estimates, valuations and EOG stock price target to reflect higher oil price expectations. Notably, the 5-star analyst raised his earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow per share (CFPS) estimates for 2025 and 2026 due to his revised commodity outlook. Hanold now expects EPS of $10.07 and $9.46 for 2025 and 2026, respectively, up from the prior projections of $9.54 and $7.15. Hanold initiated EPS and CFPS estimates of $11.63 and $23.59 for 2027 and at $12.97 and $25.65 for 2028, respectively.

Hanold is bullish on EOG and expects it to outperform its peer group over the next 12 months. ""The leading-edge technological approach, strong balance sheet, low-cost operations and capital efficiency should continue to drive meaningful value and make EOG a core E&P holding,"" said Hanold.

Hanold ranks No. 79 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.5%. See EOG Resources Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.

Another dividend-paying energy company is Coterra Energy (CTRA), an exploration and production company with operations focused in the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin. Coterra paid a quarterly dividend of 22 cents per share in the  Q2 of 2025 and yields 3.4%.  

As part of his Q3 preview for oil & gas E&P companies, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Coterra, while cutting his price target to $32 from $35. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on CTRA stock with a price target of $26.

Given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, Sorbara is more cautious and selective in the near term. Based on the recent stock performance, investor positioning and expectations, he said that Coterra is one of his ""favorite names"" heading into Q3 results.

Sorbara believes that investors will continue to focus on management's oversight of the large oil production rampup in the second half of 2025 and its outlook for 2026. The analyst expects Q3 oil production to beat expectations, but lag estimates for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and free cash flow, likely due to ""stale Consensus gas pricing."" Meanwhile, Sorbara sees upside to Q4 oil production expectations due to the potential for incremental upside from the Harkey remediation wells.

""We reaffirm our Buy rating, as we continue to find CTRA attractive on valuation (trading at an EV/EBITDA discount and above average FCF yield) with the potential for strong capital returns,"" said Sorbara, referencing free cash flow.

Sorbara ranks No. 315 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See EOG Resources Financials on TipRanks.

Wireless telecom giant AT&T (T) is this week's third dividend pick. The company is scheduled to announce its third-quarter results on October 22. AT&T recently declared a quarterly dividend of 27.75 cents share, payable November 3. With an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T yields 4.3%.

Heading into Q3 results, Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins reiterated a buy rating on AT&T with a base case price target of $32, calling the company a top-ranked pick. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an ""outperform"" rating on AT&T stock with a price target of $31.

Rollins expects AT&T to deliver a strong operating performance in Q3 across its strategic products and segments. Despite intense competition in wireless, the 5-star analyst expects AT&T to report 300,000 postpaid phone net additions in the Q3, with 2.5% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenue.

Further, Rollins estimates Q3 fiber net additions of 286,000 in a seasonally stronger quarter. He expects AT&T's fixed wireless access (FWA) to continue to expand with net additions of 210,000. The analyst highlighted that his headline Q3 forecasts are slightly below the Street's consensus estimates for revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and are in line with free cash flow expectations.

""Wireless churn, upgrades and gross adds are likely to have an upward bias in 3Q given the more active replacement rates,"" noted Rollins. The analyst contends that AT&T's broadband opportunity remains an under-appreciated component of the company's annual financial growth prospects.

Rollins ranks No. 548 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.7%. See AT&T Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will remain closed until further notice, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday, adding its reopening will depend on Hamas handing over the bodies of deceased hostages as the two sides continued to trade blame over ceasefire violations.

Netanyahu's statement came shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Egypt announced that the Rafah crossing, the main gateway for Gazans to leave and enter the enclave, would reopen on Monday for entry into Gaza.

Netanyahu's government and Hamas have been trading blame over violations of the U.S.-mediated ceasefire for days. Late on Saturday in Washington, the State Department said it had received ""credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.""

The State Department said the planned attack against Palestinian civilians would be a ""direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement.""

""Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,"" the department said in a statement, without providing further details.

Hamas denied on Sunday accusations of an ""imminent attack"" or a ""violation"" of the ceasefire.

It accused Israeli authorities of forming, arming and funding ""criminal gangs"" that carried out murders, kidnappings and aided looting. 

The Palestinian militant group said police forces in Gaza were performing their duty by pursuing those gangs to hold them accountable. 

""The movement calls on the U.S. administration to stop repeating the occupation's misleading narrative,"" it added. 

Trump had said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal that he brokered.

The militant group has launched a security crackdown in urban areas vacated by Israeli forces, demonstrating its power through public executions and clashes with local armed clans.

Hamas, in a statement late on Saturday, said Netanyahu's decision ""constitutes a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a repudiation of the commitments he made to the mediators and guarantor parties.""

It also said the continued closure of the Rafah crossing would prevent the entry of equipment needed to search for and locate more hostage bodies under the rubble, and would thus delay the recovery and handover of the remains.

Israel said it received two more bodies late on Saturday, meaning 12 out of 28 bodies have been handed over under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal agreed between Israel and Hamas last week.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor confirming famine and health authorities overwhelmed.

The dispute over the return of bodies, and shipments of life-saving humanitarian aid, underlines the fragility of the ceasefire and still has the potential to upset the deal along with other major issues that are included in U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan to end the war. 

As part of the deal, Hamas released all 20 living Israeli hostages it had been holding for two years, in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners jailed in Israel.

But Israel says that Hamas has been too slow to hand over the bodies of deceased hostages it still holds. The militant group says that locating some of the bodies amid the vast destruction in Gaza will take time.

The deal requires Israel to return 360 bodies of Palestinian militants for the deceased Israeli hostages and so far it has handed over 15 bodies in return for each Israeli body it has received.  

Rafah has largely been shut since May 2024. The ceasefire deal also includes the ramping up of aid into the enclave, where hundreds of thousands of people were determined in August to be affected by famine, according to the IPC global hunger monitor. 

After cutting off all supplies for 11 weeks in March, Israel increased aid into Gaza in July, scaling it up further since the ceasefire.

Around 560 metric tons of food had entered Gaza per day on average since the U.S.-brokered truce, but this was still well below the scale of need, according to the U.N. World Food Programme.

Formidable obstacles to Trump's plan to end the war still remain. Key questions of the Hamas disarming, the governance of Gaza, the make-up of an international ""stabilization force"", and moves towards the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to be resolved.

ByClem Chambers,

Senior Contributor.

Bitcoin has crashed – not the sort of typical bitcoin meltdown, but an old-school, equity-style crash of around 25%. That kind of move is almost not big enough for bitcoiners to consider it significant, but for “grown up assets,” that would be big news.

The fall back from highs will not be easy to explain to many, especially those expecting bitcoin to hit a million – and by Christmas, no less. For them, the only way is up.

I was once a crypto enthusiast expecting BTC to moon. It did. There are, however, limits – especially if you're looking for real value increases, not just numerical gains. I agreed with the old wild predictions when bitcoin was in four figures, but not the new ones based on logarithmic appreciation. To me, bitcoin is now just another asset embedded in the flying circus of financial markets.

It is bound to liquidity, arbitrage, and hedging just like shares, commodities, and other currencies. It's in the system and is no longer an outsider destined to destroy “tradfi” and change the world of money. It is now part of tradfi.

That's an unpopular opinion – one many saw as ridiculous when bitcoin was recently at all-time highs – but not so incredible when it crashes thousand of dollars in a few moments.

So here is a chart of where we are:

The chart doesn't look too bearish, but we've seen two nose-dives in a week, triggered by tariff tantrums and tradfi issues sparked by subprime car loans. This tradfi-driven fraudulent default, built on a pile of trash bonds, might create contagion in small American banks – an echo of Silicon Valley Bank's implosion – and the markets don't like that at all. Probably a blip… maybe not. TBA.

In the old bitcoin world, this kind of narrative in tradfi wouldn't have mattered. Bitcoin's valuewasn't tied to U.S. small-bank solvency or market conniptions. Yet here we are.

So, if crypto is absorbed into tradfi, how will this normalisation affect its price or trigger negative repricing? If bitcoin is assimilated into the old system, why is it special anymore? Assimilation feels bearish to me.

So here we are right now:

Bitcoin looks fragile.

If it drops below $100,000 a coin, the chance that a crypto winter crash is underway will suddenly be much higher.

However, there is something deeper going on.

Bitcoin is driven by liquidity in the market. Let's call it what it is – cash sloshing around in banks, looking for a place to make money. The excess cash ends up in the reverse repo at the Fed.

So here's the chart of that:

But wait…

The spicy money buying the frothy assets is temporarily out of stock.

The good news? If necessary, there's more – just a few mouse clicks away.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin ETFs have fueled investor interest in the digital token.

XRP is no longer under government scrutiny as it once was, and financial firms could launch XRP ETFs very soon.

Bitcoin has had consistent demand among investors, but keep in mind that it's still a very volatile investment.

10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›

The value of many cryptocurrencies has soared over the past year, as the government takes a more hands-off approach to this market and as investors have expanded their appetite for riskier investments.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and XRP (Ripple) (CRYPTO: XRP) have come along for the ride, with Bitcoin's value rising 83% and XRP gaining 390% over the past year. If you're trying to decide between the two, here are a few things to consider -- and why you should be cautious about putting too much money into any cryptocurrency right now.

There are a few factors that drove Bitcoin's price higher over the past year, most notably the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year that make it easy for people to invest Bitcoin. These funds own the Bitcoin and then sell shares of the cryptocurrency fund to investors, making crypto ownership as easy as buying stocks.

Since their launch, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated more than $150 billion of assets under management (AUM), showing that demand is high for Bitcoin ownership.

Secondly, macroeconomic uncertainty has likely helped boost Bitcoin's value. The cryptocurrency is viewed by some investors as digital gold, in the sense that it's a safe place to put money when the economy is uncertain. The job market is showing signs of slowing down -- ADP data showed a loss of 3,000 jobs in August and a decline of 32,000 in September -- in addition to ongoing concerns about how tariffs will affect the economy.

What's more, the Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates, and economists are expecting more cuts before the end of the year. Rate cuts often encourage investors to put money into riskier investments like cryptocurrencies, which may also be helping to fuel Bitcoin's rise.

One of the main reasons why XRP has risen over the past year is that the government has taken a lighter regulatory touch toward crypto. XRP perhaps has benefited more than other cryptocurrencies because the SEC recently dropped a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the maker of the XRP coin.

The lawsuit, which began back in 2020 under President Trump's first term, stated that Ripple was selling unregulated securities. But with the Trump administration shifting its stance toward cryptocurrencies (Trump, oddly, has his own meme coin), the SEC has dropped the lawsuit, though Ripple had to pay a $125 million fine.

That positive news has been a boost to XRP, and it comes at the same time that XRP ETFs could soon launch. The SEC is in the process of approving the ETF applications for XRP funds from financial firms, and they could be approved as soon as this month. It's worth noting that the current government shutdown could delay any potential approval.

If the XRP ETFs are approved, it could give further credibility to the coin, making it just one of three (the other being Bitcoin and Ethereum) approved spot cryptocurrency ETFs. This could mean billions of dollars are invested into the new funds.

Between these two leading cryptocurrencies, I think Bitcoin is the better one to own right now. The coin's relatively longer history (15 years of existence is much longer than most cryptos, 2 years longer than XRP's story) has shown that, over time, Bitcoin tends to remain in demand among investors.

The coin has experienced some very significant boom-and-bust cycles, and yet it's always rallied back afterwards. That's no guarantee its value will go up over time, but it does indicate that there are enough investors interested in it that it's been able regain its momentum in the past.

XRP doesn't have quite the same long history, and the recent interest in the coin is exactly that: recent interest. XRP ETFs could push the coin's value higher, but to what degree and whether it's a sustainable catalyst is unknown.

Which leads me to one caveat before buying Bitcoin right now: Expectations for its growth are sky high. Investors of cryptocurrencies and stocks alike appear to have a very optimistic view of their investments right now, and it may be driving values of equities and digital coins higher than warranted.

That doesn't mean buying Bitcoin right now is a mistake. Still, if you're just starting a position, it's worth remembering that the digital coin often experiences significant price swings. Any significant shift in the crypto market could pour cold water on Bitcoin's value in the short term.

Key Points

Think about Bitcoin's long-term potential before you buy the dip.

The initial October optimism that pushed Bitcoin (BTC 1.86%) to a new high has quickly faded. On Friday, Oct. 17, Bitcoin slipped below the $105,000 mark -- a 17% drop on its Oct. 6 peak of over $126,000. Prices moved slightly higher over the weekend, but uncertainty rules as investors try to make sense of credit concerns and the largest liquidation event in crypto history.

An unexpected China tariff threat on Oct. 10 jolted markets and triggered a cascade of liquidations. CoinGlass data shows that over $19 billion in leveraged positions was wiped out in what's being called ""Crypto's Black Friday."" The flash crash, and concerns about private credit quality, are driving a wider risk-off sentiment.

For investors, this raises the question of whether it is a good time to buy. That depends a lot on your investment thesis.

When cryptocurrency prices fall, there's often a rallying social media cry to ""buy the dip."" It sounds great in theory, but it isn't always that simple in practice. For starters, it is almost impossible to know how far Bitcoin might fall so you can call the bottom. There's also no point in trying to buy the dip if you don't think Bitcoin has long-term potential.

In terms of the dip itself, it's worth noting that Bitcoin's price is still up about 60% year over year, and that cryptocurrency investors are used to dramatic price swings. That doesn't stop these big drops from being unnerving. Even so, there's solace to be taken from the fact that Bitcoin has always erased its losses and gone on to set new highs.

While there are no guarantees, Bitcoin could have long-term potential, and various institutions like ARK Invest are optimistic about its future. ARK's most bullish price target for the lead crypto is $1.5 million, based on its potential as an emerging market currency, an institutional asset class, and even as ""digital gold."" In its latest report, ARK points out that Bitcoin balances in corporate treasuries increased by 40% in 2025, and that spot Bitcoin ETF balances have reached new highs. 

One notable driver behind Bitcoin's growth in 2025 is that it appears to be maturing as an asset. The influx of institutional funds not only buoyed the price, but it also reduced volatility. That gave more credence to the argument that Bitcoin could act as a form of digital gold -- a store of value that may hold its worth over a long period.

Any hedge against uncertainty has a lot of appeal today, as people look to protect their investments against inflation and a softening dollar. It's true that Bitcoin and gold have a lot in common. For example, only a fixed amount of Bitcoin can ever be mined. Bitcoin is decentralized and can't be controlled by individual governments. The blockchain is durable and, like gold, should stand the test of time.

However, Bitcoin has yet to fully prove itself as a safe-haven asset. Take October: Gold has continued to trend upwards and reach new highs, while Bitcoin erased many of its gains from the past three months. It isn't the first time that Bitcoin has behaved more like a tech stock than a form of modern-day gold. For example, in 2022, when the Federal Reserve introduced dramatic interest rate hikes to combat inflation, Bitcoin's price tanked alongside other high-risk investments. 

Bitcoin is still a relatively new asset, and it may still develop as a form of digital gold. It may also have other potential use cases that push it upwards, particularly with a pro-crypto administration in power in the U.S. However, recent weeks have shown us that it is not there yet.

If you've been watching Bitcoin's price soar this year and wondering when might be a good time to get in, the recent drop may make it more attractive. But what counts is your long-term rationale for investing in Bitcoin. This especially matters if you're looking for a safe-haven asset. In that case, Bitcoin may not be the best choice, even at a lower price. The digital gold narrative is questionable and may not hold up under pressure.

There's also the challenge of knowing how far Bitcoin might fall. Bear in mind that it dropped almost 75% in the year that followed its Nov. 11, 2021 peak. Dollar-cost averaging -- buying smaller amounts at regular intervals -- can help to manage this type of volatility.

However, if you think it has potential in other ways -- whether that's institutional and corporate accumulation, government treasuries, or through emerging market currencies -- today may be a good time to buy. Bitcoin is maturing and regulatory changes are clearing the path for increased mainstream adoption. Bitcoin ETFs make it more accessible and take out a lot of the headaches over custody.

We've seen Bitcoin eventually recover from extreme price dips, and there's a good chance it will soar once again. What matters is to be clear about your investment rationale, and make sure that Bitcoin is a small part of a wider risk-adjusted portfolio.

Ethereum remains in a range phase following the recent market rebound, but continues to hold above key institutional demand zones. The market has entered a period of consolidation between structural supports and resistances, suggesting that the next decisive move will likely be driven by liquidity displacement from this range.Technical Analysis

By ShayanThe Daily Chart

On the daily timeframe, Ethereum continues to trade between two major zones: the institutional supply area around $4.6K–$4.7K and the institutional demand zone near $3.4K–$3.5K. After losing the channel's lower trendline support earlier this month, the asset has now retested it from below, confirming it as resistance.

The structure suggests that Ethereum is currently in a mid-range equilibrium phase, where neither buyers nor sellers have clear control. The 100-day MA, which previously provided dynamic support, has now flipped into a resistance zone near $4.1K–$4.2K, while the 200-day MA near $3.1K remains the last line of structural defence.

As long as the price remains above the $3.4K institutional demand, Ethereum's macro trend stays intact. However, failure to maintain this level could expose the market to a deeper retracement toward the $3.0K–$2.9K liquidity cluster, where the 200-day MA and prior accumulation base converge.

The 4-Hour Chart

The 4-hour structure reveals a descending wedge pattern, forming after a sharp rejection from the $4.2K breakdown zone. The repeated rejections at this confluence of descending and ascending trendlines reflect the ongoing tug-of-war between short-term buyers and sellers.

At the same time, the lower boundary of the wedge aligns closely with the broader institutional demand zone, suggesting that Ethereum is approaching a point of compression where volatility expansion is imminent.

If the price breaks above the descending trendline and closes above the $4K–$4.1K resistance, it could confirm a reversal, targeting $4.4K–$4.6K. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would likely trigger a deeper decline toward $3.4K, the same zone that underpins the broader bullish structure. Until confirmation occurs, Ethereum remains range-bound, oscillating between structural supply and demand.

Sentiment Analysis

By Shayan

Recent on-chain data points to a renewed tightening in Ethereum's market structure. Since mid-October, two significant dynamics have emerged simultaneously: exchange reserves have declined sharply, while average spot order sizes have increasingly been dominated by large whale transactions.

Following October 15, ETH's price has remained relatively stable just below the $4K level, but the underlying market composition has shifted meaningfully. Whale-sized spot orders (green clusters) have expanded, signalling renewed activity from deep-pocketed participants, while the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges, measured in USD terms, has dropped to one of the lowest levels of 2025.

This combination, shrinking exchange reserves and growing whale spot activity, has historically indicated strategic accumulation by institutional or high-net-worth investors. With liquidity thinning across exchanges, even moderate inflows of new demand could produce amplified price reactions, as reduced sell-side availability magnifies volatility to the upside.

Ethereum now appears to be entering another supply squeeze phase, echoing the quiet but powerful accumulation period of late 2020. During that cycle, consistent spot buying and exchange outflows preceded one of ETH's strongest multi-month rallies. If macro conditions stabilise and ETF-related inflows return, the current structural tightening could serve as the foundation for Ethereum's next major upward cycle.

Crypto prices remain fairly stable on Sunday as Bitcoin and Ethereum trade within ranges near break-even, a situation welcomed by traders after over $1 billion of liquidations rattled the market again on Friday, and a historic $19 billion liquidation caused upheaval the Friday before.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $106,400, while Ethereum is at $3,800. Bitcoin's price has fallen by 8.8% over the past month, and Ethereum's by 14%. However, with the market appearing to stabilize, is a bullish reversal on the horizon, or will there be more pain first?

Bitcoin price predictions suggest that bulls could soon take charge, with liquidity zones and on-chain activity signalling that selling is slowing, and short traders are at risk of being wiped out.

Ethereum's outlook is also bright, with SEC chair Paul Atkis recently acknowledging its ERC-3643 standard, a framework that encodes regulatory compliance directly into tokens. Meanwhile, a new Bitcoin Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper, has just exceeded $24 million in funding in its presale, signaling that another major player could be emerging.

Bitcoin fell to $104,000 on Friday, which was a four-month low for the market-leading asset. However, investors quickly swooped in and took advantage of the discount.

Glassnode posted on X that small Bitcoin holders (between 1 and 1000 BTC) “stepped up” to buy BTC on the dip, while large holders slowed their selling. According to the data analytics firm, this indicates “renewed confidence despite the recent shakeout.”

Adding to this outlook, data from the Glassnode platform shows a strong liquidation cluster of short positions above $113,000, with over $400 million set to be wiped out at $113,718 – $113,842 – and that's just on the Binance exchange alone.



Generally, the price moves into zones with the most liquidity, indicating that $113,000 could be the next target for BTC. However, some analysts believe the BTC uptrend will expand well beyond $113,000, with Friedrich noting that it's currently rebounding on a key long-term support level and that this could propel it to $135,000 in the weeks ahead.

In a recent speech, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins discussed how compliance requirements could be encoded into smart contracts, using ERC-3643 as an example. This marks a subtle yet significant hint about how regulators view blockchain standards as a way to ensure on-chain compliance in a typically permissionless environment. 

“These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643,” he said.

With Ethereum's ERC-3643 token standard, compliance becomes programmable – token issuers can embed regulatory-adherent code on-chain, allowing only verified and authorized wallets to hold or transfer the asset. This can ensure alignment with KYC, AML, and securities laws without relying on intermediaries. If conditions aren't met, the transaction doesn't proceed.

Coinlaw data estimates that the value of tokenized real-world assets will reach $5.5 trillion by 2029, representing a 43% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from the time the forecast was made. Ethereum's ERC-3643 standard and its support from regulators could make it a major beneficiary of this growth. 



Traditionally, Bitcoin has been excluded from such discussions due to its lack of programmability. However, projects like Bitcoin Hyper aim to change that with smart contract-enabled Layer 2 networks.

Bitcoin Hyper is creating the world's first ZK-rollup-based Bitcoin Layer 2, advancing beyond previous Bitcoin scaling solutions that used sidechains or federated bridges – and so don't fully inherit Bitcoin's base-layer security.

The project runs on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for execution, enabling smart contract support and the ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. It will periodically send its state back to the Bitcoin Layer 1, where transactions are stored, making Bitcoin Hyper as immutable and neutral as Bitcoin itself.



There's also a trustless canonical bridge that allows BTC transfers to and from the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2, providing seamless access for Bitcoin holders.

Currently in a presale to fund development, Bitcoin Hyper recently exceeded $24 million raised, marking an important milestone that shows strong community support and massive potential for demand once it lists on the open market.

This has attracted attention from top crypto analysts, with RJ from Cryptonews describing HYPER as “the next 100x project when the market recovers.”

With Bitcoin expected to rebound and Ethereum strengthening its position in the RWA space, crypto prospects look bright, so Bitcoin Hyper could be launching at just the right time.

The current HYPER presale price is $0.013135, but this won't last long as price increases are scheduled to occur throughout the campaign, and the next is in under one day.







Crypto assets that show resilience during a broad market downturn tend to have strong latent demand, making them excellent bets for when the market outlook improves. Ethena (ENA) fits the bill perfectly.  While most large-cap assets are in the red and Bitcoin is down nearly 4%, the Ethena price is up 30% over the past […]

Snorter ($SNORT), a new Solana trading bot, is closing its token presale tomorrow (20 October), having now raised over $5 million from early backers. The project aims to disrupt the trading bot space and become the leading choice for Solana meme coin traders, offering unparalleled features, easy access via Telegram, and the lowest fees on […]

For years, the idea of U.S. states investing directly in Bitcoin or crypto ETFs seemed distant, but that reality may soon change. After the first attempt failed earlier this year, Florida has introduced a revised digital asset bill that could finally open the door for institutional-level Bitcoin exposure at the state level.  The proposed legislation […]

Crypto prices have faced significant selling pressure over recent days, owing to the US-China trade war and credit and liquidity risks in the US economy.  However, top analysts continue to be bullish on large-cap assets, especially as they anticipate the US Federal Reserve to engage in emergency market-supportive actions.  Prominent crypto analyst and X influencer, […]

A new analysis from CryptoOnchain, using data shared by CryptoQuant, suggests Bitcoin may remain range-bound in the near term — but volatility risks are building fast.

Bitcoin is holding near $115,500, but traders are turning their attention to the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin Ignites Altcoin Surge Amidst a Tense Global Climate","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/bitcoin-altcoin-surge-global-climate","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:04:49 GMT","

Could the rise of Bitcoin past the $108,000 threshold herald a new chapter in the cryptocurrency saga? The markets are vibrant, with investor enthusiasm roaring back to life. Bitcoin's leap has not only ignited its own prospects but has also catalyzed a sweeping rally among altcoins, drawing fresh focus on titans like Ethereum. As the backdrop of U.S.-China relations serves as a crucial point of tension, the stakes have visibly escalated for Bitcoin and its diverse altcoin brethren.

Last weekend painted a picture of wild fluctuations for Bitcoin. After a brief stint around the $106,000 mark, the cryptocurrency shot up to over $108,000, leaving analysts buzzing with speculation. The catalyst? Ongoing negotiations with China and a simultaneous surge in trading activity. Observers are keeping a sharp eye on whether Bitcoin can sustain critical support levels above $108,500, as that could mean a rally toward the elusive $117,000 benchmark. Yet, this sector is notoriously volatile—every rise underscores the immense risk inherent in today's geopolitical scenario.

Ethereum, often seen as the heavyweight of the altcoin arena, has begun its ascent back toward the $4,000 threshold. Current market indicators depict notable activity as numerous altcoins shake off earlier price depressions. Investment-worthy tokens like TAO, ENA, and MORPHO have surged between 14% and 34%, prompting traders to recalibrate their altcoin strategies. The shift in market sentiment points toward a budding confidence among investors, signaling that while Bitcoin may lead, altcoins hold promise for substantial returns.

With Bitcoin's rebounding profitability comes an urgent call for strategic investment. Savvy investors must stay vigilant—monitoring key support levels and spotting the vital moments for short positions liquidation. As the market shows signs of balancing out, traders should be positioned for short-term gains while also crafting long-term investment blueprints. The specter of sudden price swings looms large, driven by volatility that mirrors historic highs and lows. Consequently, a diversified portfolio, particularly amidst such spectacle, may emerge as a smart way for investors to enhance performance in this fast-evolving milieu.

The intricate dance of international relations shapes not just political landscapes but the very fabric of cryptocurrency sentiment. Recent gestures of de-escalation in U.S.-China tensions have simultaneously spurred increased buying interest in digital assets. As diplomatic talks pave the way for a more inviting environment, trading volumes across various cryptocurrencies have begun to surge. This intersection of negotiation and market value illustrates how external influences can mold the crypto world—something that every investor should weigh carefully.

Yet amidst the optimism, a word of caution hangs in the air. While Bitcoin's price rally offers glimmerings of recovery, the shadows of risk loom ominously close. Challenges related to crypto-to-fiat integration, paired with sudden price shifts, can introduce chaos into the investor's decision-making journey. Proactive risk management plans become critical navigation tools in the face of potential market gyrations.

In conclusion, the ascent of Bitcoin is not just a tale of resilient technology; it underscores how intricately intertwined global events are with cryptocurrency movements. As altcoins surge alongside Bitcoin, it's an opportune moment for astute investors to consider both immediate prospects and the likelihood of market adjustments ahead. Observing crucial support levels and pursuing diversified strategies will be paramount as we traverse these uncharted waters. The outlook is promising, yet with potential pitfalls ahead, the imperative for investors remains clear: adapt, analyze, and ascend.

Trading instruments

Powerful tools

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic and ever-evolving ecosystem, characterized by sharp price movements and emerging trends. Among the most discussed phenomena are altcoin reversals and Bitcoin's stabilizing influence on the broader market. This article provides an in-depth analysis of these topics, exploring whale accumulation, technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and more to help you navigate the current crypto landscape.

Whale accumulation, where large investors or institutions purchase significant amounts of cryptocurrencies during market dips, is a critical factor in altcoin reversals. This behavior often signals confidence in a potential market rebound. Here's what you need to know:

Altcoins in Focus: Cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Cardano, and emerging tokens like Broccoli have experienced increased whale activity. This accumulation often precedes price reversals, as it reflects strong demand at lower price levels.

Market Implications: Whale activity can create upward pressure on prices, particularly for altcoins with smaller market capitalizations. This trend is frequently accompanied by higher trading volumes, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment.

Technical analysis is a powerful tool for identifying potential trend reversals in altcoins. Key metrics and patterns to monitor include:

Bullish Divergences: When an altcoin's price forms lower lows while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) forms higher lows, it often indicates a potential reversal.

Resistance Levels: Breaking through critical resistance levels can signal a shift from bearish to bullish momentum. For instance, altcoins like XRP and Solana have recently shown signs of recovery due to such technical patterns.

Moving Averages: The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are widely used to identify long-term trends. A ""golden cross"" (when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA) is often seen as a bullish signal.

Global economic conditions significantly influence the cryptocurrency market. Key macroeconomic factors currently shaping market trends include:

Federal Reserve Policies: Interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve impact market liquidity. Rate cuts often lead to increased risk appetite, benefiting cryptocurrencies.

Geopolitical Tensions: Events such as the U.S.-China trade war drive investors toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin, which are perceived as a hedge against traditional market instability.

Institutional Inflows: The growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs highlights increasing institutional participation, adding credibility and liquidity to the market.

Bitcoin often acts as a stabilizing force in the cryptocurrency market, influencing investor confidence and altcoin performance. Here's why:

Key Support Levels: Bitcoin's ability to maintain critical support levels, such as $110,000, provides a psychological anchor for the market. When Bitcoin holds strong, it boosts investor confidence, encouraging altcoin participation.

Correlation with Traditional Assets: Bitcoin's correlation with gold has weakened recently. While gold prices have declined, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, further solidifying its position as a unique asset class.

The altcoin market is buzzing with innovative projects offering unique solutions and utility-driven use cases. Notable mentions include:

Tapzi: A Web3 gaming ecosystem designed to capitalize on the growing gaming industry.

Bitcoin Hyper: A Bitcoin Layer 2 solution leveraging Solana's technology for faster and cheaper transactions.

MAGACOIN FINANCE: A project gaining attention for its presale opportunities and potential for high returns.

While these projects show promise, thorough research is essential before engaging with any emerging altcoin.

Market sentiment and on-chain data provide valuable insights into the state of the cryptocurrency market. Key indicators include:

Fear and Greed Index: Currently in the ""fear"" zone, this metric historically precedes market recoveries, suggesting a potential buying opportunity.

MVRV Ratios: The Market Value to Realized Value ratio helps identify overbought or oversold conditions. Current levels suggest the market may be nearing a bottom.

Stablecoin Dominance: Rising stablecoin market caps often indicate increased liquidity, which can drive momentum in the crypto market.

Ethereum and Solana continue to attract significant institutional interest due to their robust ecosystems and innovative partnerships:

Ethereum: The upcoming ETF inflows and its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) make Ethereum a top choice for institutional investors.

Solana: Partnerships such as the Uniswap integration highlight Solana's growing influence in the crypto space, further boosting investor confidence.

The cryptocurrency market is a complex yet rewarding space for informed investors. Altcoin reversals, Bitcoin's stabilizing role, and macroeconomic factors are just a few elements shaping the current landscape. By leveraging tools like technical analysis and on-chain metrics, you can better navigate this ever-evolving market.

While the potential for high returns exists, the crypto market remains highly volatile. Always approach with caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.","{'href': 'https://www.okx.com', 'title': 'OKX'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy as Japan's Banks Consider Joining the Bitcoin Market","https://bravenewcoin.com/partner/best-altcoins-to-soar-japans-banks-prepare-enter-crypto-market","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:18:57 GMT","

Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering a landmark reform that could let banks buy and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin – a move that might finally bring traditional finance and crypto under one roof.

KEY POINTS:
➡️ Japan's FSA is considering reforms that would let banks trade and hold Bitcoin, signaling a major step toward institutional crypto adoption.
➡️ Over 12M crypto accounts in Japan highlight strong retail demand as regulators move to make the market safer and more transparent.
➡️ Institutional entry could fuel growth for the best altcoins, especially projects with real-world utility and scalable infrastructure.
➡️ Bitcoin Hyper, Best Wallet Token, and Remittix stand out as early movers ready to benefit from Japan's upcoming crypto wave.

With over 12M crypto accounts already open in Japan (3.5x more than five years ago), the country's appetite for digital assets is undeniable.

The FSA's plan includes letting banks register as licensed crypto exchange operators and creating a new ‘Crypto Bureau' to oversee the sector.

If banks and large investors gain access to crypto, they won't just buy Bitcoin and Ethereum – they'll look for scalable, utility-driven projects with strong fundamentals.

That could put the spotlight on the best altcoins and early crypto presales poised to grow as institutional money flows in.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a real Layer-2 built to transform the world's biggest cryptocurrency from a ‘store of value' into a living, breathing ecosystem.

Using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers sub-second transactions and near-zero gas fees, creating a place where payments, DeFi, dApps, and even meme coins can finally thrive on Bitcoin.



Think of it as Bitcoin's execution layer, where speed, interoperability, and culture meet.

Developers can build directly on top of Bitcoin Hyper, while users enjoy seamless cross-chain movement between Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and beyond. It's a full-blown blockchain designed for builders, degens, and institutions alike.

And if Japan's banks start entering the crypto scene, infrastructure-grade projects like HYPER could be the first to feel the institutional lift.

Get in early on real Bitcoin innovation with Bitcoin Hyper.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the backbone of a rapidly expanding ecosystem built for the next wave of crypto adoption.

While its parent platform, Best Wallet, delivers a sleek multi-chain experience, the $BEST token powers everything inside it – from reduced transaction fees and staking rewards to early access to new crypto presales and exclusive project launches.

Holding $BEST means being part of a growing economy rather than a single app.

Token holders enjoy premium benefits and governance rights, positioning them at the center of the platform's growth.



The project's ‘Upcoming Tokens' feature, which lets users join presales safely from within the app, directly drives $BEST's demand – every new project and transaction strengthens the token's utility.

Right now, you can buy $BEST for $0.025815. With $16.5M raised in presale, $BEST is attracting both retail and institutional interest.

If Japanese banks begin entering crypto markets, tokens tied to real utility and adoption, like $BEST, could surge in relevance.

Grab $BEST now to secure your stake in the next big crypto economy.

Remittix ($RTX) is redefining how money moves across borders.

Built as a PayFi protocol, it connects crypto wallets and traditional bank accounts in over 30 countries, offering lightning-fast transfers, minimal fees, and real exchange-rate transparency.



Instead of relying on slow, outdated SWIFT networks, Remittix uses blockchain rails to settle payments in seconds – all while keeping compliance and KYC frameworks bank-friendly.

As the FSA considers letting banks trade and hold crypto, projects like Remittix could bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, turning what's now experimental into everyday financial infrastructure.

At $0.1166 per token and $27.5M raised in presale, Remittix has quickly become one of the best altcoins in the payments niche. It's a potential backbone for the next generation of cross-border finance.

Get into $RTX early and ride the wave as PayFi meets institutional crypto adoption.

If you're scanning the horizon for the best altcoins ready to benefit from the institutional wave, $HYPER, $BEST and $RTX offer distinct angles – infrastructure, utility wallet and finance-payments respectively.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","North Korean Hackers Use Blockchain to Hide Malware in New Campaign","https://coincentral.com/north-korean-hackers-use-blockchain-to-hide-malware-in-new-campaign/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:09:45 GMT","

North Korean state-sponsored hackers are now embedding malicious code into blockchain networks to avoid detection. According to Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), this new method—called EtherHiding—uses smart contracts on public blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain to store malware. The campaign allows the attackers to deliver and control harmful code through systems that are nearly impossible to block or alter.

GTIG explains that EtherHiding involves placing small code snippets into smart contracts, which are hosted on decentralized blockchain networks. These networks are immutable, meaning that once code is added, it cannot be deleted or modified. This makes it difficult for cybersecurity systems to take down or stop the malware.

The hackers start by compromising WordPress websites, often using stolen login data or unpatched software flaws. Once inside, they add a JavaScript loader into the site's code. This loader reaches out to the blockchain and pulls malware from a remote location. Since this connection is off-chain, it leaves almost no transaction record and requires little to no gas fees.

GTIG found that this method has been active since at least September 2023. The campaign began under the name CLEARFAKE, which used fake browser update alerts to trick users into installing malicious software.

One of the key features of blockchain technology is that once data is recorded, it cannot be changed. This feature is now being used to hide and spread malware in a way that security teams cannot easily stop. Because the malware is hosted inside smart contracts, blocking or deleting it would require changes to the blockchain itself, which is not possible.

GTIG reports that the use of decentralized systems allows attackers to operate without being noticed. Most anti-malware tools do not check smart contracts for harmful code, so these threats can stay active for long periods without detection.

“Although smart contracts offer innovative ways to build decentralized applications, their unchangeable nature is leveraged in EtherHiding,” GTIG noted.

Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton called EtherHiding an “early-stage experiment” and warned that it could be made more dangerous by using automation tools. He said that future versions might include code that targets blockchain systems directly, especially if those systems are linked to wallets or transaction platforms.

Cybersecurity experts believe this method shows a change in North Korea's cyber operations. Instead of only stealing cryptocurrency, hackers are now using the technology behind it to help distribute malware.

Data from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs states that North Korean hackers have stolen more than $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency this year. Investigators say that the funds are used to support military projects and avoid global sanctions.

The use of EtherHiding makes it easier for attackers to stay online and move their tools between platforms. Since the code is hosted on decentralized networks, even taking down the original website does not stop the malware from spreading.

GTIG advises users and web developers to take extra steps to secure their systems. They recommend blocking unknown scripts, disabling unauthorized downloads, and keeping WordPress plugins updated.

Security teams are also encouraged to start scanning smart contracts for malicious content. Since the code is public, researchers can label and track harmful contracts more easily if they know what to look for.

The group also stressed the need for tighter website security. Preventing the initial breach of WordPress sites is a key step in stopping these attacks before the loader can be installed.

NFT trading has emerged as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, generating millions of dollars in trading volume across various platforms and blockchains. Despite market fluctuations, the NFT space continues to thrive, driven by innovation, new trends, and increasing user adoption. This article delves into the latest developments in NFT trading, analyzes key trends, and highlights insights shaping the future of this dynamic market.

OpenSea, once recognized solely as an NFT marketplace, has evolved into a multi-chain crypto trading aggregator. This strategic transformation enables users to trade NFTs, memecoins, and other cryptocurrencies across 22 blockchains. The impact of this shift has been profound, with OpenSea reporting a resurgence in trading volume, reaching $2.6 billion in October 2023. Notably, 90% of this volume stemmed from token trading, underscoring the platform's diversification strategy.

OpenSea's multi-chain approach enhances accessibility and trading options for users.

The platform's focus on self-custodial trading simplifies the experience, making it as intuitive as traditional financial apps.

OpenSea's airdrop campaign for its upcoming token boosted low-value NFT trades, increasing sales volume by 29% in Q3 2025.

Base, Coinbase's layer-2 network, has emerged as a formidable competitor in the NFT space. Over the past 30 days, Base experienced a 70% surge in NFT trading volume, reaching $47.67 million. This growth has allowed Base to surpass established competitors like Immutable and Solana, solidifying its position as a rising star in the blockchain ecosystem.

Seamless integration with decentralized applications (dApps) has driven user engagement.

Competitive transaction fees and scalability make Base an attractive option for NFT traders.

The network's focus on fostering innovation has contributed to its rapid adoption.

The NFT market experienced significant growth in Q3 2025, with sales reaching 18.1 million—a 45% increase from Q2. This surge generated $1.6 billion in trading volume, reflecting renewed interest in the sector. Additionally, the number of unique wallets trading NFTs rose from 1.66 million in Q1 2025 to 2.14 million in Q3, with wallets doubling their trading activity.

Increased adoption of NFTs in sports, collectibles, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

Innovative trading strategies, such as NFT micro-strategies, are attracting new users.

Platforms like OpenSea and Base are making NFT trading more accessible and efficient.

While gaming-related NFTs experienced a decline in Q3 2025, with trading volume dropping by 17% and transaction numbers falling by 32%, sports NFTs have seen a remarkable resurgence. Trading volume for sports NFTs spiked by 337%, reaching $71 million, while sales increased by 143%.

Partnerships with major sports leagues and athletes are boosting visibility.

Fans are increasingly engaging with tokenized sports memorabilia and experiences.

The rise of fantasy sports and gamified NFT platforms is attracting new audiences.

Profile Picture (PFP) NFTs, such as CryptoPunks, Moonbirds, and Pudgy Penguins, have become a dominant force in the NFT market. In Q3 2025, PFP NFTs saw a 187% increase in trading volume, reaching $544 million.

Their cultural significance and community-driven value make them highly desirable.

Limited supply and high demand create a sense of exclusivity.

Integration with social media platforms enhances their utility and visibility.

The NFT market is evolving beyond collectibles, with increasing integration into decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenized real-world assets. For instance, Courtyard NFTs tokenize physical collectible cards, bridging the gap between digital and physical assets. In Q3 2025, Courtyard NFTs sold 1.55 million items, generating over $145 million in transaction volume.

Tokenized RWAs provide a new avenue for asset ownership and trading.

DeFi protocols enable automated trading strategies, such as TokenWorks' PunkStrategy, which allows exposure to high-value NFTs like CryptoPunks.

These innovations are attracting both retail and institutional investors.

Despite its growth, the NFT market faces challenges, such as the collapse of the art NFT sector. Trading volume for art NFTs has dropped by 93% since its 2021 peak, falling from $2.9 billion to $23.8 million in Q1 2025. However, this decline has prompted a shift toward sustainability and long-term value creation.

Emerging trends like NFT micro-strategies and tokenized RWAs are driving innovation.

Sports and PFP NFTs are attracting new user demographics.

Blockchain advancements, particularly on Ethereum, Polygon, and Base, are enhancing scalability and reducing costs.

NFT trading continues to generate millions in volume, driven by innovation, diversification, and user adoption. Platforms like OpenSea and Base are leading the charge, while new trends such as sports NFTs, PFPs, and tokenized RWAs are reshaping the market. As the NFT ecosystem evolves, it presents both challenges and opportunities, making it an exciting space to watch in the coming years.","{'href': 'https://www.okx.com', 'title': 'OKX'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","FIFA Faces Criminal Charges in Switzerland Over NFT Initiatives","https://forklog.com/en/fifa-faces-criminal-charges-in-switzerland-over-nft-initiatives/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 08:42:15 GMT","

The Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority (GESPA) has filed a criminal complaint against the NFT platform of the International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA).

According to a press release, an investigation initiated in early October revealed that the online platform FIFA Collect conducts various contests using “non-fungible tokens.” Participation requires placing bets, with the possibility of winning cash prizes. The outcomes depend on a draw or similar procedures.

Under current legislation, Gespa classified these offerings partly as a lottery and partly as betting. Such activities in the country require a license, meaning FIFA Collect operated illegally.

The agency stated it is obliged to notify law enforcement authorities of the violation, leaving them to decide on pursuing criminal charges.

In September 2022, the football federation announced the launch of a series of collectible tokens dedicated to the upcoming World Cup. The assets debuted on the Algorand blockchain, with which a partnership was established in May.

“Like sports memorabilia and stickers, this is an affordable opportunity for fans worldwide to connect with their favorite players, relive great moments, and more on new platforms,” commented FIFA's Chief Business Officer Romy Gai at the time.

In December, the organization announced the release of a limited collection of 100 NFTs on the L2 solution Polygon. Some tokens available through FIFA Collect offered the chance to win a ticket to the final of the next World Cup in 2026.

A total of 900 digital collectibles were planned for release on the Polygon network. The assets were to be sold on the OpenSea marketplace.

In April 2025, FIFA announced the creation of its own EVM-compatible blockchain. The network is intended to replace Algorand and Polygon as the base for FIFA Collect.

By May, the organization decided that the platform would be based on Avalanche.

Earlier, FIFA President Gianni Infantino suggested the possibility of launching a native token for engaging with the global football fan base.

Switzerland's gambling watchdog has filed a formal complaint against FIFA's NFT platform, accusing it of operating as an unlicensed gambling service. The move signals growing regulatory pressure on digital collectibles and Web3 ventures as authorities grapple with how blockchain-based reward systems fit within traditional gambling laws.

Switzerland's federal gambling regulator, GESPA, has filed a complaint against FIFA's non-fungible token (NFT) platform, FIFA Collect, alleging that it operates as an unlicensed gambling service.

GESPA stated that certain competitions and reward programs on the platform involve elements of chance, which, under Swiss law, classify them as gambling. According to the regulator, users can participate in these events only by paying a monetary stake, with prizes determined by random draws or similar methods.

Participation in the competitions is only possible in exchange for a monetary stake, with monetary benefits to be won. Whether participants win a prize depends on random draws or similar procedures.

The regulator said these activities resemble lotteries and sports betting—categories that, in Switzerland, are restricted to licensed operators Sporttip and Jouez Sport.

GESPA began investigating FIFA Collect in October over its “Right to Buy” NFTs, which grant holders the ability to purchase World Cup tickets at face value. These NFTs—tied to major teams such as Argentina, Spain, France, England, and Brazil—sold for $999 each and have all sold out, according to FIFA Collect data.

The platform, originally launched in 2022 on the Algorand blockchain, has since announced plans to migrate to its own blockchain built as a subnet on Avalanche. This shift reportedly boosted activity on the platform and introduced new distribution methods resembling lottery mechanics, drawing regulatory scrutiny.

GESPA's complaint marks the latest clash between digital collectibles and traditional gambling laws. The regulator noted that it has referred the matter to law enforcement, which will determine whether FIFA's NFT operations violate Swiss regulations.

While GESPA has not taken an official stance beyond filing the complaint, it has offered to assist in any future investigation. Observers suggest that FIFA may seek to modify its NFT distribution model or reach an agreement with regulators to avoid further legal action.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","How is OpenSea Transforming On-Chain Trading with the $SEA Token?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/opensea-transforming-onchain-trading-sea-token","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 06:29:32 GMT","

OpenSea is embarking on a new journey, moving from being a leading NFT marketplace to a platform where all on-chain assets can be traded seamlessly. The introduction of the $SEA token is a key aspect of this transformation. But what does this mean for users and the broader crypto ecosystem?

OpenSea is not just sticking to NFTs anymore; they're expanding their horizons to encompass all on-chain assets. This includes tokens, NFTs, and potentially even physical assets, all available on a single platform. The aim is to eliminate the need for users to navigate through multiple interfaces, allowing them to trade any crypto asset across various blockchains without any technical hurdles. 

This is a significant pivot from their original focus as an NFT marketplace. By broadening their range of offerings, OpenSea is trying to attract both new users and retain existing ones who are deep into the NFT space. The ambition is to become a cornerstone in the on-chain economy, responding to a growing demand for a more inclusive trading environment.

The $SEA token is set to launch in Q1 2026, and it will have a multi-faceted role. Not only will it be used for governance and staking, but it will also serve as a liquidity incentive. Interestingly, 50% of the total token supply is earmarked for the community. This is a move to instill a sense of ownership among users, which is crucial for long-term loyalty.

But here's the kicker: OpenSea plans to buy back $SEA tokens using 50% of its launch revenue. This is meant to create demand for the token while rewarding those who hold onto it. By integrating governance and staking directly into the trading platform, OpenSea is not just enhancing user engagement; they're also opening the door to a more democratic method of asset management.

Despite these ambitious plans, OpenSea finds itself in a tricky situation. The NFT market has seen a staggering decline in capitalization, plummeting from $25 billion in 2021 to around $5.2 billion. However, trading activity remains high, and OpenSea reported $2.6 billion in trading volume in October 2025, primarily propelled by token trading.

The timing of the $SEA token introduction couldn't be more critical, as competition heats up and regulatory scrutiny intensifies. As OpenSea broadens its offerings, it must also contend with complex regulatory frameworks, especially in Asia. There, fintech startups are facing increased pressure to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. The merging of NFTs with fungible tokens on a single platform is bound to attract regulatory attention and potentially prompt the creation of new rules targeting risks like fraud and market manipulation.

OpenSea's transformation into a universal trading platform raises significant questions about regulatory compliance, particularly for fintech startups in Asia. The expansion beyond NFTs to include a wider array of assets presents intricate regulatory challenges, as startups will have to navigate diverse legal frameworks across jurisdictions.

With increased regulatory scrutiny on the horizon, authorities will likely focus on token classification, investor protection, and AML compliance. OpenSea's transparent and community-centric approach could set a precedent for compliance practices among startups. By simplifying the user experience while adhering to regulations, OpenSea emphasizes the need for proactive engagement with regulators in the ever-evolving Web3 landscape.

Integrating NFTs into broader asset trading strategies offers potential rewards but also comes with risks for crypto-friendly SMEs in Europe.

Potential Rewards:
- Diversification and unique asset access.
- Market growth and mainstream adoption.
- Innovative revenue models.
- Operational efficiency.

Potential Risks:
- Market volatility and illiquidity.
- Regulatory complexity.
- Fraud and intellectual property issues.
- Money laundering risks.

In summary, OpenSea's evolution into a universal trading platform with the $SEA token signifies a monumental shift in the crypto landscape. By enhancing user engagement and grappling with regulatory challenges, OpenSea aims to redefine digital asset trading. Yet, the complexities of a saturated market and the need for compliance will be critical as they pursue long-term success.

Top crypto to buy conversations always begin with regret. How many people ignored Bitcoin (BTC) at $100 or thought Binance Coin (BNB) was just another exchange token? Fast forward to Q4 2025, and those “maybe later” people are scrolling through price charts instead of portfolios. Now, LivLive ($LIVE) has entered the spotlight and could finally be that rare second chance people wait their whole lives for.

In October 2025, crypto markets are buzzing again with new opportunities. LivLive ($LIVE) is doing more than creating a token; it's building a real-world operating system that turns everyday actions into rewards. While BNB and other major coins are in recovery mode, $LIVE is quietly setting itself up as the top crypto to buy for those tired of missing golden chances.

Back when Binance Coin (BNB) launched, few believed it could become anything valuable. Priced at just $0.10, it was seen as another “exchange-only” token. Today, that same BNB touched nearly $690, transforming early believers into millionaires. Those who bought at launch didn't just make gains, they changed their financial destiny forever.

The regret runs deep for those who dismissed it. Many called it too risky, too new, or too uncertain. Yet while doubters hesitated, a handful of bold community members quietly built life-changing wealth. That's the painful beauty of crypto: hesitation is often the most expensive choice. But the market keeps giving new chances to rewrite the story. And right now, LivLive ($LIVE) looks like the chapter that latecomers have been waiting for.

LivLive ($LIVE) isn't another pump-and-dump token. It's a real-world operating system that turns daily actions into digital rewards. Walking, shopping, attending events, or leaving reviews can now earn $LIVE tokens. Instead of scrolling aimlessly, people can earn through living actively.

This project merges AR, blockchain, and wearable tech to make engagement profitable. Every step or scan becomes proof of action that creates value. With transparent tokenomics and lifestyle-based rewards, LivLive is quickly being recognized as the top crypto to buy for those who missed earlier moonshots like BNB and now want a token tied to real-life value.

The LivLive presale already shows strong traction. Stage 1 launched at $0.02, raising over $2 million USD with 94+ holders in its first round. Stage 2 increases to $0.04, while the official launch price is projected at $0.25, signaling a potential 1,150% ROI even before public trading begins.

By using the Bonus Code: EARLY30, community members can grab an additional 30% $LIVE tokens. With 65% of supply for the people (25% presale + 40% mining) and only 5% for the team, the tokenomics scream fairness and long-term commitment.

Key benefits include:

Here's the math: a $5,000 entry during Stage 1 could grow to $62,500 at launch, not counting bonuses and mining rewards. With growing media attention and social traction, LivLive ($LIVE) proves why it's the top crypto to buy in October 2025.

It absolutely deserves that title. LivLive ($LIVE) has combined real-world functionality with blockchain efficiency. Its presale performance, fair tokenomics, and active engagement model make it stand out as the top crypto to buy in 2025. This is not another speculative token; it's a fully functioning reward economy.Stage 2 is around the corner, and bonuses like EARLY30 and Refer and Earn make early participation even more attractive. The LivLive presale proves that opportunities are not gone; they've just evolved. Instead of scrolling past another breakout, this is the moment to act while others are still watching. Those holding $LIVE today might be the ones everyone talks about tomorrow.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Sentinel Global founder warns stablecoins mirror CBDC risks","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stablecoins-mirror-cbdc-risks/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 06:03:00 GMT","

Jeremy Kranz, founder and managing partner of the venture capital firm Sentinel Global, has urged investors to exercise caution when dealing with privately issued stablecoins. 

According to Kranz, these assets carry all the risks associated with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as well as additional, unique vulnerabilities of their own.

Kranz refers to privately issued stablecoins as a “central business digital currency.” Based on his explanation, they include similar monitoring features, backdoors, programmability, and controls in CBDCs.


When asked to elaborate, Kranz noted that central business digital currencies and stablecoins are essentially alike. To illustrate this, the founder of Sentinel Global provided an example, explaining that if JP Morgan developed a dollar-pegged stablecoin and managed it under laws such as the Patriot Act or any future regulations, they could decide to freeze one's funds or stop them from utilizing banking services.

Kranz also mentioned that stablecoin issuers who provide more collateral than necessary and acquire their blockchain tokens using cash and short-term government securities could encounter “bank runs” if many holders attempt to cash in their tokens simultaneously.

Additionally, he observed that algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins rely on software or complex transactions to maintain their value in relation to the dollar. Based on his explanation, this move introduces risks, such as increasing the likelihood of losing that connection amid situations like market volatility or sudden declines in crypto derivative markets.

Kranz's remarks followed his perspective that technology is a neutral tool that can either assist in creating an enhanced financial future for individuals or be misused. 

According to him, the outcomes depend on individual investors taking the time to read the details, evaluating the risks, and making a prudent choice regarding their financial products. 

Considering the effects the swift development of stablecoins, crypto, and tokenization technologies brings about, Kranz likened the development to being “10 black swan events” because these advancements bring both chances and dangers.

DeFiLlama recently released data showing that the total market value of stablecoins rose above $300 billion in October. This demonstrated growing interest in stablecoin following the announcement that the US passed its GENIUS stablecoin bill in July.

This was after the US Senate voted 68-30 to approve the GENIUS Act, around six weeks after Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty introduced it. With this remarkable announcement, sources have highlighted the increasing likelihood that the House of Representatives may soon review the STABLE Act, the bill's companion, which may undergo various adjustments before a final vote. Notably, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act aim to regulate stablecoins. 

Regarding the approval of the GENIUS Act, lawmakers received the announcement with mixed reactions. An example of these lawmakers is Marjorie Taylor Greene, a representative from Georgia. Greene referred to the bill as a CBDC Trojan Horse. 

She further shared an X post dated July 15, stating that this bill regulates stablecoins while creating a backdoor for a central bank digital currency.

“The Federal Reserve has been planning for years to develop a CBDC, and this will lead us toward a cashless society with digital currency that an authoritarian government could use against you by controlling your ability to trade,” Greene added.

The world's biggest fintech conference just wrapped in Mumbai with over 100,000 attendees, more than 800 speakers, and one glaring omission: any meaningful discussion of cryptocurrencies or stablecoins—despite Bitcoin hitting an all-time high above $125,000 the same week.

At the three-day Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai that kicked off Oct. 7, organizers instructed speakers to steer clear of ""political, crypto, religious, or personal remarks on stage or at the venue,"" Reuters reported, citing a document containing speaker guidelines.

India is leaning towards not creating legislation to regulate the crypto sector, a stark contrast to the approach taken by Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, which have actively courted cryptocurrency and stablecoin businesses.

Instead of embracing digital currencies, Indian regulators spotlighted the country's central bank digital currency, called the e-rupee, with the Reserve Bank of India launching pilots for deposit tokenisation and a sandbox for fintechs. More than 50 products debuted at the event, including PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) global wallet platform and biometric authentication for payments, but crypto remained conspicuously absent.

“The policy ambivalence has a chilling effect on the development of commercial use cases for stablecoins in India,” Delhi-based Black Dot Public Policy Advisors Founder Mandar Kagade told Reuters.

The numbers tell a compelling story about what's at stake. U.S. dollar stablecoins have amassed a market capitalization of over $300 billion, while the overall crypto market cap has climbed to more than $4 trillion. Meanwhile, India's fintech sector raised just $3.5 billion last year, the lowest since 2020 and well off the peak of $9.2 billion in 2021.

At least six industry executives said that while entering the crypto sector could offer fresh business lines and help attract investment, there is little appetite in the absence of regulatory blessing.

“There is cause for fair degree of caution on stablecoins,” Reserve Bank of India Innovation Hub CEO Sahil Kini said while addressing the Oct. 7 session. “I don't think this kind of stance changes overnight.”

The regulatory vacuum isn't just stifling innovation—it's driving talent overseas. “It's becoming real whether we like it or not, so it's imperative to figure out how to engage with it,” independent consultant Vivekdeep Gupta told Reuters.

Gupta pointed to a “huge amount of energy but lack of regulatory clarity is also causing brain-drain,” noting a preference for companies in the sector to incorporate overseas.

Mumbai-based venture capital firm Blume Ventures Vice President Joseph Sebastian suggested a measured path forward. “Regulators need to have an iterative approach instead of the complete aversion they have towards stablecoins currently,” he told Reuters. “The first step can be allowing inward remittances via U.S. dollar stablecoins as the regulatory grey-zone also complicates the picture for startups and investors.”

The silence at India's marquee fintech event speaks volumes: while the rest of the world debates how to regulate crypto, India has effectively decided not to participate in the conversation at all. For investors watching India's massive market, that absence may prove more significant than any policy statement.

Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba's Ant Group and JD.com, have halted their stablecoin development projects following direct intervention from Beijing, according to the Financial Times.

The suspension affects yuan-based digital asset initiatives that major Chinese technology firms had been developing amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny from the central government.

Beijing recently directed brokerages and think tanks to cease promoting stablecoins, reflecting growing concern over private sector involvement in digital currency issuance and the government's desire to maintain control over monetary innovation.

The intervention aligns with broader Chinese efforts to counter foreign digital currency dominance while prioritizing state oversight of the domestic financial system.

Privately-issued stablecoins are under new scrutiny after a venture capital executive said they carry risks similar to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Jeremy Kranz, founder and managing partner of Sentinel Global, described these digital assets as “central business digital currencies,” warning they offer the same levels of surveillance, control, and vulnerability, while also adding private sector risks. His comments come as stablecoins top $300 billion in market capitalization.

Jeremy Kranz said that stablecoins, although issued by private firms, are often no different from government-issued CBDCs when it comes to user control. He noted that large financial institutions can freeze or block access to stablecoin funds under regulations like the Patriot Act.

“If JP Morgan issued a dollar stablecoin and controlled it through the Patriot Act… they can freeze your money and unbank you,” Kranz said. He emphasized that the same backdoors, surveillance tools, and programmable features exist in these digital assets, whether controlled by a government or a corporation.

Kranz said this level of control poses real challenges to financial freedom. While stablecoins are marketed as decentralized or user-first, the reality often includes centralized authority over assets, similar to traditional banks or government institutions.

Stablecoin issuers that use overcollateralization—holding cash and short-term U.S. government securities—can face pressure when too many users redeem tokens at once. Kranz warned that such scenarios can resemble a “bank run,” where liquidity may dry up fast.

Stablecoins like USDC and others aim to maintain a 1:1 dollar peg. However, if redemption volumes spike beyond available collateral, users may face delays or losses. “They are vulnerable if too many holders try to redeem at the same time,” Kranz said.

Algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins carry different risks. These tokens maintain their peg through code or complex market strategies. However, they are exposed to de-pegging events caused by market volatility, technical issues, or flash crashes in crypto markets.

Interest in stablecoins surged after the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill in the United States. The bill aims to regulate privately-issued stablecoins but has received criticism from several lawmakers. Some say it creates a legal path for a digital dollar under private control.

U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called the bill a “CBDC Trojan Horse.” In a July post on X, she said, “This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor central bank digital currency.” She warned that it could lead to a cashless society where money becomes programmable and subject to control.

The bill has intensified debate around digital currency control and privacy. Lawmakers and industry experts remain divided on whether the bill protects users or increases centralized oversight.

The total stablecoin market cap surpassed $300 billion in October, according to data from DeFiLlama. Kranz said the pace of change in crypto and tokenization is extremely fast and unpredictable. He compared it to “10 black swan events” happening all at once.

He warned that while the technology could help create new financial tools, it can also be misused. “Technology is neutral,” Kranz said, “but outcomes depend on who controls it and how it's used.”

Investors, he said, must read the fine print and understand the risks before holding or using stablecoins. He added that stablecoins are not immune to failure, market volatility, or regulatory intervention, regardless of whether they are centralized or algorithmic.

Stock Analysis

Reviewed by Kshitija Bhandaru

Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is drawing attention after reports it has dramatically boosted its bitcoin holdings, purchasing $2 billion worth and raising $2.3 billion through new stock and debt offerings. The move comes as bitcoin prices climb following Donald Trump's reelection.

See our latest analysis for Trump Media & Technology Group.

With all eyes on Trump Media & Technology Group's bitcoin pivot, momentum around the stock remains unsettled. The latest $2 billion crypto bet comes on the heels of a difficult stretch. Its most recent 30-day share price return is -4.37%, while the total shareholder return over the past year sits at -45.3%. In short, even explosive headlines have not reversed a downward trend, though some investors are eyeing potential upside if confidence builds around the company's new crypto strategy.

If this kind of dramatic shift grabs your attention, now is the perfect time to broaden your radar and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership

With such a bold pivot into cryptocurrency, the question now is whether Trump Media & Technology Group's share price reflects all the risk and potential, or if this volatility underscores a unique chance for investors to buy in ahead of possible growth.

Trump Media & Technology Group is currently trading at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2x, which anchors its valuation against comparable firms. With a last close price of $16.18, the stock appears more attractively priced than its direct peers on this metric.

The price-to-book ratio compares the company's market value to its net assets. For media and tech firms that are often asset-light and rapidly changing, this ratio remains a useful checkpoint for fair value, especially in the absence of sustained profitability or strong revenue growth.

DJT's P/B of 2x stands out as a relative bargain compared to its peer average of 2.9x. This suggests the market is either underestimating its asset value or questioning its ability to deliver returns from those assets. However, when compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry average P/B of 1.3x, DJT looks rather expensive. This raises questions about whether investors are pricing in future growth or simply paying a premium for the brand. There is insufficient data to calculate a fair ratio, so market direction may shift with new financials or catalysts.

See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.

Result: Price-to-Book of 2x (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, ongoing net losses and lack of clear revenue growth could challenge optimism, particularly if the crypto pivot fails to generate near-term profits.

At Token 2049 in Singapore, Matthew Graham, founder of Ryze Labs, delivered one of the event's most provocative keynotes: a vision of a world where every human has a digital twin, an AI version of themselves that can think and even feel like them.

In an interview with CCN fresh from that keynote, Graham explored the complex future of living with that technology.

As AI continues to enter our lives in completely unexpected ways, with Sam Altman even recently announcing that OpenAI will allow erotica soon, how can society balance the emotional boundaries and ethics when intertwining so closely with technology?

Graham believes the human factor is infiltrating AI and that people are already relating to language models as if they were sentient.

“Have you ever found yourself saying please or thank you to Google?” he asked.

“Probably not, right? But you may have, and I think many people have, found themselves communicating to LLMs … in a way that is highly personal.”

For Graham, that subtle politeness signals something deeper: a shift in how humans see and speak to technology.

“It's a fundamentally different way that we're interacting with technology, which I find super fascinating,” he said.

Beyond politeness, Graham is exploring what happens when those interactions evolve into extensions of self.

Ryze Labs has been experimenting with “digital twins,” AI versions of individuals capable of holding conversations and managing aspects of their digital lives.

“What we're talking about is extending humans into the digital realm, an extension of ourselves, a digital twin of ourselves with us being the analog twin,” he said.

Graham describes a near-term world in which a person's twin could field questions from colleagues, comfort a parent, or schedule meetings while its human counterpart sleeps.

“Your away message is your digital twin,” he said. “It'll kind of feel like me. It'll have my personality.”

To make the concept tangible, Graham has even named his own digital twin “Marty,” a joking nod to common typos of his name.

Yet the exercise reflects serious thinking about identity and control in the age of AI.

The founder views technology as “fundamentally amoral — not moral, not immoral, but amoral — having no moral characteristics until applied.”

Still, he warns that the psychological effects of constant AI interaction could be profound.

“I firmly believe AI psychosis is a real thing,” he said, citing early examples of people forming unhealthy emotional attachments to large language models.

“We're already seeing both the extraordinary and the really quite dangerous.”

Graham likens the coming wave of AI dependence to humanity's fixation on smartphones and social media.

“We're also addicted to our phones,” he said. “AI will be no different — a double-edged sword.”

On privacy, Graham remained blunt, stating most users underestimate how much they've already shared.

“Sam Altman has my nudes basically,” he joked. “It's not ideal, but if I'm being honest, he does.”

Behind the humor, however, a serious warning lay underneath.

“The stakes from a privacy perspective have never been higher,” he said.

That warning takes on new weight as OpenAI prepares  to allow erotic content on its platform, a decision that blurs the boundary between human intimacy and digital companionship.

If large language models are soon to host or simulate erotic interaction, the question of who owns and secures those data becomes far more pressing.

Graham believes blockchain technology offers one path forward: encrypting personal data and giving individuals ownership of their digital twins.

“This is again a crypto story,” he said. “All these privacy protections can be on-chain and immutable.”

For him, the convergence of AI and crypto isn't just technical; it's a matter of autonomy in an era where digital intimacy may soon be mediated and monetized by machines.

That crossover between AI and blockchain is where Ryze Labs is betting big.

“We are extremely focused at the intersection of AI and crypto,” Graham said.

He pointed to Amiko, a startup backed by Ryze Labs, which recently pivoted toward digital-twin technology and “AI social” experiences.

“They are squarely focused on digital twins and AI companions,” he said. “I think it has potential to be a smash hit.”

Despite the risks, Graham remains cautiously optimistic.

“Technology has ripped apart the fabric of society in a lot of ways,” he said. “But it can be extremely helpful to solving many of these problems as well.”

He returns to his central premise, that technology itself is neutral, but humans are not.

“It's really up to us to steer the ship,” he said. “Technology is amoral. That's my fundamental view.”

XRP$2.4143 and Solana's SOL$191.96 stand out as the major cryptocurrencies with a key sentiment gauge showing bullish momentum, while their peers bitcoin BTC$109,181.46, and ether ETH$4,014.29 remain stuck in the gloom.

This key sentiment gauge, known as the 25-delta risk reversal, is actually an options strategy involving the simultaneous purchase of a 25-delta call and sale of a 25-delta put, or vice versa. The '25-delta' refers to options that are moderately out-of-the-money, meaning their strike prices are away from the current market price and therefore relatively inexpensive.

This strategy reveals market sentiment by comparing implied volatilities of these bullish call options calls and put options, which offer downside protection. A positive risk reversal indicates traders are paying a premium for calls over puts, signaling bullish expectations, while a negative reading reflects bearish bias. Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, accounting for over 80% of the crypto options activity.

As of writing, XRP and SOL risk reversals were positive across all available expiries – Oct. 31, Nov. 28, Dec. 26 – on Deribit, indicating a bias for calls, according to data source Amberdata. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market while a put buyer is looking to hedge his portfolio against or profit from an expected price drop.

The renewed bullishness follows a spike in demand for puts following the Oct. 10 crash that saw XRP's price tank as low as $1.77 from $2.80 on some exchanges. As of writing, XRP changed hands at $2.33, according to CoinDesk data. SOL crashed to $188 from $220 on the same day and has since remained under pressure, just as XRP.

The constructive sentiment starkly contrasts bitcoin's risk reversals which shows puts trading at a premium relative to calls across all tenors, right out to the September 2026 expiry. Clearly, BTC traders remain concerned about downside risks.

In ETH's case, the bearishness prevails out to the December expiry options, followed by bullish pricing in subsequent expiry options. 

Risk reversals are widely tracked to gauge market sentiment; however, it is worth noting that while generally reliable, risk reversals tied to XRP and SOL may be less precise indicators due to the relatively smaller market size, volume, and open interest compared to the billions seen in bitcoin and ether options markets.

Besides the persistent put bias in Bitcoin options, especially in quarterly and longer-dated expiries, this can be partly attributed to the widespread practice of call overwriting, where traders sell higher-strike call options against their long spot holdings to generate additional yield. In other words, the put bias reflects yield generation efforts rather than outright bearish market sentiment.

While XRP options have flipped bullish, perpetual futures for XRP exhibit a more balanced market, consistent with the neutral funding rates and sentiment seen in perpetual futures for BTC, SOL and ETH. 

At press time, annualized perpetual funding rates (charged every eight hours) hovered near zero, indicating a neutral sentiment, according to data source Velo. This subdued demand for leveraged bullish exposure across these major cryptocurrencies is typical traders struggling to regain confidence following a price crash.

The recent market crash liquidated leveraged futures bets worth $20 billion, causing massive wealth destruction. 

Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of an asset, like cryptocurrencies, without an expiration date. These contracts use a funding rate mechanism, which is a periodic payment exchanged between traders holding long and short positions to keep the futures price aligned with the underlying asset's spot price.

When funding rates are positive, it means perpetual futures are trading at a premium to the spot price, signaling increased demand for leveraged bullish exposure. Negative rates suggest otherwise.

 BitMine has $1.5 billion worth of Ether following the market crash, as Tom Lee remained bullish despite saying the DAT bubble may have burst. 

Fundstrat's Tom Lee has echoed the sentiment that digital asset treasury hype may be coming to an end, but remains bullish on Ether, having purchased $1.5 billion worth since the market crash.

BitMine Immersion Technologies has scooped up a total of 379,271 Ether (ETH) worth almost $1.5 billion since the record crypto market liquidation event last weekend.

The acquisitions came in three separate purchases: 202,037 ETH after the weekend crash, 104,336 ETH on Thursday, and 72,898 ETH on Saturday, according to onchain data from Arkham Intelligence and ‘BMNR Bullz', which tracks the firm's purchases, though it has yet to be officially confirmed by BitMine.

BitMine is the world's largest Ether treasury company with a stash of more than 3 million ETH, or 2.5% of the entire supply, worth $11.7 billion. It is already halfway toward its target of 5% and has only started accumulating the asset in early July, when ETH was hovering around the $2,500 level. 

“Ethereum could flip Bitcoin similar to how Wall Street and equities flipped gold post 71,” Lee told ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood on Thursday in his latest bullish statement on the asset. 

The continued aggressive accumulation of Ether occurs despite Lee's opinion that the digital asset treasury bubble may have burst.

Lee stated that many DATs are trading below their net asset value (NAV), or the worth of their underlying crypto holdings. “If that's not already a bubble burst… How would that bubble burst?” he told Fortune on Thursday. 

Related: NAV Collapse Creates Rare Opportunity in Bitcoin Treasurys — 10x Research

Research firm 10x Research also reported on Saturday that major DATs such as Metaplanet and Strategy were trading near or below their NAVs. 

However, this is not all bad news as DATs with strong capital bases and trading-savvy management teams “may still generate meaningful alpha,” they said. 

Huobi founder Li Lin wants some of that alpha and has reportedly raised about $1 billion as part of a strategy to invest in an Ether treasury.   

Lee told CNBC after the trading day on Friday that investors were still “licking their wounds” from the record leverage flush, but there was also a bit of “gold envy” as the commodity has been a “huge performer this year.”

Crypto markets are currently down 15% from their record high on October 7, while gold prices have retreated almost 3% from their peak on Thursday.

Scientists at the Francis Crick Institute and Vividion Therapeutics have discovered chemical compounds that can precisely prevent the cancer-driving gene RAS from connecting with a key pathway responsible for tumor growth.

The potential treatment is now moving into its first human clinical trial. If proven safe and effective, it could become a way to treat a wide range of cancers while minimizing harm to healthy cells.

The RAS gene plays a central role in controlling how cells grow and divide, but mutations in this gene occur in roughly one in five cancers. When mutated, RAS becomes permanently active, continually sending signals that push cells to keep growing and multiplying.

Inside the cell, RAS sits on the membrane and acts as the starting signal in a chain of growth processes. Completely shutting down RAS or the enzymes it controls has proven difficult, because these same pathways are essential for normal cell function. One of the enzymes linked to RAS, called PI3K, also helps regulate blood sugar through insulin. Blocking PI3K entirely can lead to side effects such as hyperglycemia.

In their study, published on October 9 in Science, the team combined chemical screening with biological testing to identify compounds that stop RAS and PI3K from interacting, while leaving normal cell activity intact.

Researchers at Vividion Therapeutics pinpointed a set of small molecules that permanently attach to the surface of PI3K near the spot where RAS would normally bind. Using an assay created by the Crick researchers, they confirmed that these compounds successfully blocked the RAS-PI3K interaction but still allowed PI3K to perform its other roles, including those related to insulin signaling.

The Crick team and their collaborators at Vividion then tested one of the compounds in mice with RAS-mutated lung tumors. The treatment stopped tumor growth, and the researchers found no signs of elevated blood sugar levels.

Next, they tried combining the new compound with one or two additional drugs that target enzymes within the same pathway. Together, the treatments produced stronger and longer-lasting tumor suppression than any of the drugs used alone.

The scientists also tested the compound in mice with tumors carrying mutations in another cancer-linked gene, HER2, which is often overactive in breast cancer and also connects with PI3K. Tumor growth was again halted, even though the effect did not rely on RAS. This finding suggests that the new compound could potentially help stop the growth of a broader range of cancers.

The drug has now entered the first clinical trial in humans to test for safety and side effects in people with both RAS and HER2 mutations. The trial will also assess if the potential treatment is more effective in combination with other drugs targeting RAS.

Julian Downward, Principal Group Leader of the Oncogene Biology Laboratory at the Crick, said: ""Given the RAS gene is mutated across a wide range of cancers, we've been exploring how to stop it interacting with cell growth pathways for many years, but side effects have held back the development of treatments.

""Our collaborative effort has overcome this challenge by targeting the PI3K and RAS interaction specifically, leaving PI3K free to bind with its other targets. It's exciting to see these clinical trials starting, highlighting the power of understanding chemistry and fundamental biology to get to something with potential to help people with cancer.""

""This discovery is a great example of how new discovery approaches can open up completely novel ways to tackle cancer,"" said Matt Patricelli, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Vividion. ""By designing molecules that stop RAS and PI3K from connecting, while still allowing healthy cell processes to continue, we've found a way to selectively block a key cancer growth signal. It's incredibly rewarding to see this science now progressing in the clinic, where it has the potential to make a real difference for patients.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Even “diet” soda may be quietly damaging your liver, scientists warn","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251018102119.htm","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 04:47:04 GMT","

A large-scale investigation has found that people who regularly consume both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and low- or no-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs) face a significantly greater likelihood of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).1

Presented at UEG Week 2025, the research followed 123,788 adults from the UK Biobank who had no signs of liver disease at the start of the study. Participants' drink habits were recorded through repeated 24-hour dietary questionnaires, allowing researchers to explore how both SSB and LNSSB consumption related to MASLD, liver fat buildup, and deaths linked to liver disease.

Individuals who drank more than 250 grams of either type of beverage per day had notably higher risks: a 60% increased likelihood of developing MASLD for those consuming LNSSBs (HR: 1.599) and a 50% increase for those drinking SSBs (HR: 1.469). During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 1,178 participants developed MASLD and 108 died from liver-related causes. Although SSBs were not significantly connected to liver-related mortality, LNSSB consumption was. Both kinds of drinks were also associated with higher levels of liver fat.

MASLD, previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), occurs when excess fat builds up in the liver. Over time, this can trigger inflammation (hepatitis) and lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.2 Now the most common chronic liver condition worldwide, MASLD affects more than 30% of people and is rapidly becoming a leading cause of liver-related deaths.3

Lead researcher Lihe Liu explained, ""SSBs have long been under scrutiny, while their 'diet' alternatives are often seen as the healthier choice. Both, however, are widely consumed and their effects on liver health have not been well understood.""

""Our study shows that LNSSBs were actually linked to a higher risk of MASLD, even at modest intake levels such as a single can per day. These findings challenge the common perception that these drinks are harmless and highlight the need to reconsider their role in diet and liver health, especially as MASLD emerges as a global health concern.""

Liu also discussed the possible biological reasons behind the findings: ""The higher sugar content in SSBs can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin, promote weight gain and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation. LNSSBs, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings and even stimulating insulin secretion.""

The authors emphasized that these findings support limiting both SSBs and LNSSBs as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy, targeting not only liver disease but also cardio-renal-metabolic health. Replacing either beverage with water significantly reduced MASLD risk -- by 12.8% for SSBs and 15.2% for LNSSBs -- while substitution between the two types of beverages offered no risk reduction.

Liu added, ""The safest approach is to limit both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. Water remains the best choice as it removes the metabolic burden and prevents fat accumulation in the liver, whilst hydrating the body.""

The researchers now aim to explore causal mechanisms more deeply through long-term, randomized and genetic trials with a focus on how sugar and its substitutes interact with the gut microbiome and influence liver disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Einstein's overlooked idea could explain how the Universe really began","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251018102132.htm","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 03:04:52 GMT","

How did the universe come into existence, and what early processes shaped everything that followed? A new study published in Physical Review Research takes aim at this fundamental question. Scientists from Spain and Italy have introduced a model that reimagines what happened moments after the universe was born. Their approach could upend long-standing ideas about the forces and events that governed the universe's earliest evolution.

To explore these beginnings, the researchers ran advanced computer simulations that question the traditional ""inflation"" theory. According to that theory, the universe expanded at an extraordinary rate within a tiny fraction of a second after it came into existence. The inflation model relies on several interconnected variables, all of which must align to make the theory work.

The newly proposed model offers a simpler explanation. It suggests that gravitational waves -- predicted by general relativity -- may be the true driving force behind the universe's formation, giving rise to galaxies, stars, planets, and ultimately life on Earth. The researchers link this idea to a mathematical construct known as De Sitter space, named for Dutch mathematician Willem De Sitter, who collaborated with Albert Einstein in the 1920s on understanding the structure of the cosmos.

""For decades, we have tried to understand the early moments of the Universe using models based on elements we have never observed,"" said Dr. Raúl Jiménez, who studies experimental sciences & mathematics at ICREA in Spain and is a co-author on the study. ""What makes this proposal exciting is its simplicity and verifiability. We are not adding speculative elements but rather demonstrating that gravity and quantum mechanics may be sufficient to explain how the structure of the cosmos came into being.""

The concept of gravitational waves dates back to 1893 and 1905, when Oliver Heaviside and Henri Poincaré first proposed related ideas. Albert Einstein expanded on this in 1916, describing gravitational waves as ripples in the fabric of space-time in his general theory of relativity. These waves can originate from powerful cosmic events such as supernovae, merging black holes, and colliding neutron stars. Because they are incredibly faint, detecting them requires highly sensitive instruments. It was not until September 2015 that scientists at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with facilities in Washington and Louisiana, achieved the first confirmed detection.

The birth of the universe continues to be one of science's greatest puzzles. The Big Bang theory remains the prevailing explanation, yet many questions persist -- especially about what might have occurred before that explosive beginning.

Carl Sagan once reflected on humanity's deep connection to the cosmos, saying, ""The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.""

We may never know exactly how the universe began and the processes responsible for you reading this article right now. But like the simplicity this study presents, perhaps this study is simply a way for us to know the universe itself a little bit better.

What new discoveries about the origins of the universe will researchers make in the coming years and decades? Only time will tell, and this is why we science!

As always, keep doing science & keep looking up!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden gene could triple wheat yields","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251018102111.htm","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 13:07:56 GMT","

Researchers at the University of Maryland have identified the gene responsible for a rare type of wheat that forms three ovaries in each flower instead of just one. Because each ovary can grow into a grain, this finding could help boost the amount of wheat produced per acre. The study appeared on October 14, 2025, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The unusual trait was first seen in a naturally occurring mutant of common bread wheat, but scientists did not know which genetic change caused it. To find out, the Maryland team created a detailed genetic map of the multi-ovary wheat and compared it with that of ordinary wheat. They found that a usually inactive gene called WUSCHEL-D1 (WUS-D1) had become active in the mutant plants. When WUS-D1 is turned on early in the formation of wheat flowers, it enlarges the developing floral tissue, allowing extra female structures such as pistils or ovaries to form.

If plant breeders can learn to trigger or replicate this activation of WUS-D1, it may be possible to create new wheat varieties that produce more kernels per plant. Even small increases in kernel number can make a major difference in overall food production around the world.

""Pinpointing the genetic basis of this trait offers a path for breeders to incorporate it into new wheat varieties, potentially increasing the number of grains per spike and overall yield,"" said Vijay Tiwari, Associate Professor of Plant Sciences and co-author of the study. ""By employing a gene editing toolkit, we can now focus on further improving this trait for enhancing wheat yield. This discovery provides an exciting route to develop cost-effective hybrid wheat.""

That's important because wheat is one of the world's staple crops, feeding billions of people every day. As global demand for wheat continues to rise, climate change, limited farmland, and population growth make it increasingly difficult to increase production using traditional methods. This discovery could give breeders a powerful new tool to boost yields without needing more land, water, or fertilizer.

The discovery of WUS-D1 could also lead to the development of similar multi-ovary varieties of other grain crops.

In addition to Dr. Tiwari, other authors of this paper from the University of Maryland Department of Plant Sciences include lead author and faculty assistant Adam Schoen, Professor Yiping Qi, Professor Emeritus Angus Murphy, Associate Professor Nidhi Rawat, Assistant Professor Daniel Rodriguez-Leal, Assistant Research Scientist Weifeng Luo, PhD student Anmol Kajla, Post Doctoral Associate Parva Kumar Sharma, and Alex Mahlandt (a former MS student from Tiwari lab).

Researchers at Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah (the U) have discovered that triple-negative breast cancer relies heavily on lipids for growth. These fatty acids, a defining feature of obesity, appear to drive tumor development. The study, funded by the National Cancer Institute and conducted using preclinical mouse models, indicates that breast cancer patients and survivors with obesity might benefit from treatments that reduce lipid levels, and that high-fat diets such as the ketogenic diet could be harmful for them.

""The key here is that people have underestimated the importance of fats and lipids in the all-encompassing term that is obesity,"" says Keren Hilgendorf, PhD, a Huntsman Cancer Institute investigator and assistant professor of biochemistry at the U. ""But our study shows that breast cancer cells are really addicted to lipids, and the abundance of lipids in patients with obesity is one of the reasons that breast cancer is more prevalent and more aggressive in these patients.""

High lipid levels in the blood, a condition known as hyperlipidemia, often accompany obesity. Hilgendorf and her colleagues, Amandine Chaix, PhD, assistant professor of nutrition and integrative physiology, and Greg Ducker, PhD, assistant professor of biochemistry, studied mice fed high-fat diets and others genetically designed to have hyperlipidemia without other hallmarks of obesity, such as elevated glucose and insulin. In both cases, excess lipids alone were enough to speed up tumor growth.

""The idea is that lipids, which form the surface membrane of the cell, are like building blocks,"" says Chaix. ""If a cell receives the signal to proliferate and more building blocks are available, the tumor is going to grow more easily. We see that a high amount of lipids enables this proliferation.""

When researchers reduced lipid levels in the mouse models, tumor growth slowed, even in the presence of high glucose and insulin. While mice and humans have different metabolisms, these findings may point to new therapeutic approaches or diet recommendations to help control cancer growth.

""We think this has therapeutic implications, because if you could just lower the lipids -- which we already know how to do in patients, for example, with lipid-lowering medication -- that could be a way to decelerate breast cancer growth. If we can target these high levels of fat in the blood, the cancer suffers because the lipids are no longer feeding the cancer,"" says Hilgendorf. ""But while our results in mice were striking, there are clear limitations in directly projecting these findings onto human patients. More research using human samples and patients will be necessary to confirm our hypotheses.""

The results may also influence how patients and survivors with obesity manage their weight. Doctors often encourage weight loss to help lower the risk of cancer returning or spreading, but there is limited evidence about which diets are safest or most effective.

Many patients consider the keto diet, which emphasizes high fat and very low carbohydrate intake to trigger a metabolic state called ketosis, where the body burns fat instead of carbs for energy.

The research team cautions that while such diets can promote weight loss, patients should carefully assess their overall metabolic health before adopting them.

""For patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer and have an elevated BMI, we would advise them to consult their physician and develop a weight loss plan as part of their treatment. If you have high cholesterol levels to start with, think about a weight loss plan or potential pharmaceuticals that could lower your lipid levels,"" says Ducker. ""As our study shows, diets like keto that are very high in fat can have serious unintended side effects -- even causing the tumor to grow.""

The study suggests that lipids may also fuel tumor growth in patients with obesity who have other types of breast cancer, or ovarian or colorectal cancers. The research team says the next steps will be to preclinically evaluate how anti-lipid drugs could improve responses to chemotherapy. They also want to better understand how the lipids are feeding cancer cells.

Chaix, Ducker, and Hilgendorf also stress that their study is one specific type of cancer adapting to an obese environment, and that the keto diet may be beneficial for other types of cancer.

The results of the study were published in Cancer & Metabolism. Renan Vieira, doctoral student at the U, is the first author. The critical research happening every day at Huntsman Cancer Institute is supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute, including cancer center support grant P30 CA042014, U01 CA272529-03S1, NCI UH2 CA286584, as well as Huntsman Cancer Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Cancer patients who got a COVID vaccine lived much longer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251019120503.htm","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 16:45:56 GMT","

People with advanced lung or skin cancer who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of beginning immunotherapy lived considerably longer than those who did not, according to new research.

Scientists from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center describe this as a milestone in more than a decade of work developing mRNA-based treatments that activate the body's immune defenses against cancer. Building on an earlier UF study, the results represent an important step toward creating a universal cancer vaccine capable of enhancing the effects of immunotherapy.

The analysis, which examined medical records from over 1,000 MD Anderson patients, is still preliminary. However, if upcoming randomized clinical trials confirm these results, the impact on cancer care could be profound.

""The implications are extraordinary -- this could revolutionize the entire field of oncologic care,"" said senior researcher Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a UF Health pediatric oncologist and the Stop Children's Cancer/Bonnie R. Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research. ""We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilize and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.""

Jeff Coller, Ph.D., a leading mRNA expert at Johns Hopkins University, noted that the findings highlight yet another way Operation Warp Speed (the U.S. government's rapid COVID-19 vaccine initiative) continues to benefit lives in ""unique and unexpected ways.""

""The results from this study demonstrate how powerful mRNA medicines truly are and that they are revolutionizing our treatment of cancer,"" Coller said.

Presented today (October 19) at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin, the study builds on eight years of Sayour's research combining lipid nanoparticles with mRNA. Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is present in every cell and carries the instructions for making proteins.

In July, Sayour's laboratory made an unexpected discovery: to trigger a strong immune attack on cancer, it was not necessary to target a specific tumor protein. Instead, they could simply stimulate the immune system to respond as if it were fighting a viral infection.

By pairing their experimental ""nonspecific"" mRNA vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibitors -- common cancer drugs that help the immune system recognize and destroy tumors -- the researchers observed a powerful antitumor response in mice. This experimental vaccine was not specific to COVID or any other virus or cancer but used similar technology to COVID-19 vaccines.

That breakthrough inspired former UF researcher and current MD Anderson scientist Adam Grippin, M.D., Ph.D., to ask a key question: Could the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine have a similar immune-boosting effect in cancer patients?

To explore that idea, the team analyzed data from patients with Stage 3 and 4 non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma treated at MD Anderson between 2019 and 2023.

Their findings showed that patients who received a COVID mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy survived significantly longer than those who did not.

According to Sayour, the most striking improvements occurred in patients who, based on tumor biology and other factors, were not expected to respond strongly to immunotherapy.

Although these results are from an observational study and require confirmation through a randomized clinical trial, researchers emphasize their potential importance.

Despite the need for further validation, Sayour described the discovery as pivotal for the future of cancer treatment.

""Although not yet proven to be causal, this is the type of treatment benefit that we strive for and hope to see with therapeutic interventions -- but rarely do,"" said Duane Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., Grippin's doctoral mentor and director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute. ""I think the urgency and importance of doing the confirmatory work can't be overstated.""

In lung and skin cancers, doctors commonly engage the immune system with drugs designed to ""release the brakes"" and recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. In advanced disease stages, however, most patients don't respond well and often have exhausted other treatment options like radiation, surgery and chemotherapy.

The new study involved records of 180 advanced lung cancer patients who received a COVID vaccine within a 100-day period before or after starting immunotherapy drugs and 704 treated with the same drugs who did not receive the vaccine. Getting the vaccine was associated with a near doubling of median survival, from 20.6 months to 37.3 months.

Of the metastatic melanoma patients, 43 received a vaccine within 100 days of initiating immunotherapy, while 167 patients did not receive a vaccine. With the vaccine, median survival increased from 26.7 months to a range of 30 to 40 months; at the time the data were collected, some patients were still alive, meaning the vaccine effect could be even stronger.

Receiving non-mRNA pneumonia or flu vaccines resulted in no changes in longevity.

To back their findings, UF researchers then used mouse models to pair immunotherapy drugs with an mRNA vaccine targeted specifically at COVID spike protein. Those experiments showed they could turn unresponsive cancers into responsive ones, thwarting tumor growth.

""One of the mechanisms for how this works is when you give an mRNA vaccine, that acts as a flare that starts moving all of these immune cells from bad areas like the tumor to good areas like the lymph nodes,"" Sayour said.

The next step is to launch a large clinical trial through the UF-led OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network, a consortium of hospitals, health centers and clinics in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, California and Minnesota.

""One of our key motivations at OneFlorida is to move discoveries from academic settings out into the real world and the places where patients get care,"" said Betsy Shenkman, Ph.D., who leads the consortium.

If confirmed, the new findings unlock numerous possibilities, and the researchers said an even better nonspecific universal vaccine could be designed. For patients with advanced cancers, the increased survival from such a universal vaccine could provide a priceless benefit: more time.

""If this can double what we're achieving currently, or even incrementally -- 5%, 10% -- that means a lot to those patients, especially if this can be leveraged across different cancers for different patients,"" said Sayour, an investigator with UF's McKnight Brain Institute.

The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute and multiple foundations.

Sayour, Grippin and Mitchell hold patents related to UF-developed mRNA vaccines that are licensed by iOncologi Inc., a biotech company born as a ""spinout"" from UF in which Mitchell holds interest.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Astronomers discover a gigantic bridge of gas connecting two galaxies","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251018102126.htm","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 16:00:05 GMT","

Scientists at The University of Western Australia's node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) have made a remarkable discovery: a massive structure stretching about 185,000 light-years between two galaxies, NGC 4532 and DDO 137, located some 53 million light-years from Earth.

According to a study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the team also detected a huge tail of gas extending another 1.6 million light-years beyond the bridge, making it the largest feature of its kind ever recorded.

Lead researcher Professor Lister Staveley-Smith from ICRAR UWA explained that the finding provides an important new insight into how galaxies influence each other.

""Our modeling showed that the tidal forces acting between these galaxies, alongside their proximity to the massive Virgo cluster of galaxies, played a crucial role in the gas dynamics we observed,"" Professor Staveley-Smith said.

He added that as the galaxies orbited one another and moved toward the superheated gas cloud surrounding the Virgo cluster, which reaches temperatures about 200 times hotter than the Sun's surface, they experienced ""ram pressure."" This effect stripped gas from the galaxies and heated it as they passed through the dense environment.

""The process is akin to atmospheric burn-up when a satellite re-enters the Earth's upper atmosphere, but has extended over a period of a billion years,"" he said.

""The density of electrons and the speed at which galaxies are falling into the hot gas cloud are enough to explain why so much gas has been pulled away from the galaxies and into the bridge and surrounding areas.""

The discovery was made as part of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Survey (WALLABY), a large-scale project that maps hydrogen gas throughout the Universe using the ASKAP radio telescope, owned and operated by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency.

Co-author Professor Kenji Bekki of ICRAR UWA said the team identified the enormous gas structures through high-resolution observations of neutral hydrogen, a key ingredient in star formation.

""Neutral hydrogen plays a crucial role in the formation of stars, making this finding fundamental to understanding how galaxies interact and evolve, particularly in dense environments,"" Professor Bekki said.

Professor Staveley-Smith said the system had strong similarities with our own Milky Way and Magellanic System, providing a unique opportunity to study such interactions in detail.

""Understanding these gas bridges and their dynamics provides critical insights into how galaxies evolve over time, how galactic gas is redistributed, and the varying conditions under which galaxies may or may not form stars,"" he said.

""This contributes to our broader understanding of the most massive structures in the Universe and their life cycles, which helps us grasp more about their vast complexities and history of star formation.""

A cat jumped up on my couch. Wait a minute. I don't have a cat.

The alert about the leaping feline is something my Google Home app sent me when I was out at a party. Turns out it was my dog. This notification came through a day after I turned on Google's Gemini for Home capability in the Google Home app. It brings the power of large language models to the smart home ecosystem, and one of the most useful features is more descriptive alerts from my Nest security cameras. So, instead of “Person seen,” it can tell me FedEx came by and dropped off two packages.

In the two weeks since I allowed Gemini to power my Google Home, I've enjoyed its ability to detect delivery drivers the most. At the end of the day, I can ask in the Google Home app, “How many packages came today” and get an accurate answer. It's nice to know that it's FedEx at the door, per my Nest Doorbell, and not a salesperson offering to replace my windows. Yet for all its smarts, Gemini refuses to understand that I do not have a cat in my house.

Google isn't the only company souping up its smart-home ecosystem with AI. Amazon recently announced a feature on its Ring cameras called Search Party that will use a neighborhood's worth of outdoor Ring cameras to help someone find their lost dog. (I don't need to stretch to imagine something like this being used for nefarious purposes.)

In early October, Google updated the voice assistant on its smart-home devices—some of which have been around for a decade—by replacing Google Assistant with Gemini. For the most part, the assistant is better. It can understand multiple commands in a spoken sentence or two, and you can very easily ask it to automate something in your home without fussing with the Routines tab in the Google Home app. And when I ask it a simple question, it generally gives me some kind of a reliable answer without punting me to a Google Search page.

Smarter camera alerts are indeed more helpful at a glance. Most of the time, I dismissed Person Seen notifications because they're often just people walking by my house. Now the alerts actually say “Person walks by,” which gives me greater confidence to dismiss those. Some alerts accurately say “Two people opened the gate,” though sometimes it will hallucinate: “Person walks up stairs,” when no one actually did. (They just walked on the sidewalk.) It has fairly accurately noted when UPS, FedEx, or USPS are at the door, which is nice to know when I'm busy or out and about, so I can make sure to check for a package when I get home—no need to hunt through alerts.

But with my indoor security cameras, Gemini routinely says I have a cat wandering the house. It's my dog. Even in my Home Brief—recaps at the end of the day from Gemini about what happened around the home—Gemini says, “In the early morning, a white cat was active, walking into the living room and sitting on the couch.” It's amusing, especially considering my dog hates cats.

You would think then that I would be able to just tell this smarter assistant, “Hey, I don't have a cat. I have a dog,” and it would adjust its models and fix the error. Well, I did exactly that. In the Ask Home feature, you can talk to Gemini and ask it anything about the home. This is where you can ask it to set up automations, for example. I asked it to turn on the living room lights when the cameras detect my wife or I arriving home, and it understood the action. It even guessed that I wanted the lights to come on only when arriving at night, despite me forgetting to mention that.

When I told Gemini that the security camera keeps identifying a cat but it's a dog, and that I don't have a cat, it acknowledged this and accepted that I have a dog. Yet the mistakes continued. A Google spokesperson tells me that Home Brief and Ask Home are in an early-access phase, and Google is encouraging users to submit feedback so it can improve the experience.

My supposed cat.

“We are investing heavily in improving accurate identification, including for pets,” the spokesperson says in an email. “This includes incorporating user-provided corrections (like telling Ask Home that your 'cat' is actually a dog) to generate more accurate AI descriptions. Since all Gemini for Home features (Ask Home, Home Brief, and AI Captions) rely on our underlying Familiar Faces identification, improving this accuracy also means improving the quality of Familiar Faces. This is an active area of investment and we expect these features to keep improving over time.”

Google's Familiar Faces system lets you add names for people the cameras sees often around your home. When it works, it's great. Especially when I had a holiday party and it announced my friends by name when they got to my front door, which caused everyone inside to erupt into raucous applause. But too often my wife and I are sitting at home, only for the Nest Doorbell to ring and announce that I'm standing outside ringing the bell. (Insert surprise Pikachu face.) Familiar Faces doesn't work with pets at the moment, so the eventual addition of that capability will likely help Gemini understand that my dog isn't a cat, even if he acts like one.

It may be early days for these features, but the saga showcases that AI, no matter how intelligent these companies make them out to be, can still fail to distinguish simple details about our lives, even if you tell it the right answer to its face.

We hear a lot about the microbiome, also known as the zoo of different bacteria living in your digestive system. We know some are good and some are bad. Some strains are associated with longevity, while others are associated with scary diseases.

In fact, virtually every aspect of our health has been linked to the microbiome, in one way or another, including cancer, mental health, and diabetes. There are also thousands of companies out there that want you to spend your entire paycheck on supplements, which may or may not be right for your body's specific needs. Meanwhile, thousands of studies on the microbiome are published each month. Even the world's geekiest gastroenterologist can't keep up with all of that.

That's where a new company called Jona Health comes in. It uses AI to analyze the hundreds of bacterial strains in your gut, cross-reference them with all the latest and highest-quality research, then give you a breakdown of your results and an action plan you can follow to theoretically improve your health outcomes. While AI gets shoehorned into virtually every product these days, whether we want it or not, this implementation actually makes sense.

To use Jona, order a kit online. The kit is the same gold-standard kit that your GI doctor would give you, which is known as a shotgun test. It scans for every strain of bacteria, as well as pathogens like parasites and viruses. It's a home stool-sample kit which—while strange—is easy to use. You ship your sample off to a lab using the included self-paid packaging. The lab is also independent of Jona (and again, it's probably the same one your doctor would use); it just sends the results to Jona Health.

Those results are likely to contain hundreds of different bacteria and their relative abundance in your system. It would take you years to research the significance of each one, and by the time you got to the end, enough new research would be out that you'd have to start all over.

The service that Jona provides is that it has an LLM constantly reading new studies as they are published. It ranks the quality and applicability as it goes, too. For example, a study with a large sample size of humans, studied over time, from a reputable institution would likely be rated a 3 (the highest), while a small study that only used mice or petri dishes would likely be rated a 1.

Roughly two to three weeks after you send in your sample, you get a detailed, interactive report that highlights your health associations (i.e. if there's anything to look out for), as well as the things you might do to improve them. If you want to read the study or studies that led the AI to that conclusion, they will be linked there, too.

Critically, Jona does not sell any supplements or probiotics, nor does it recommend brands of supplements or probiotics for an affiliate kickback. I really like that a lot. There are other home gut tests that are cheaper than Jona's, but they rarely use shotgun testing, and most have their own stores and drive their customers toward buying expensive supplements. The only product Jona sells is the test and analysis, which basically eliminates conflict of interest.

When you first purchase your kit, you fill out an intake form. This has basic questions about your diet, lifestyle, and exercise habits, as well as your family medical history. This is where you put in any concerns you or your doctor may have. Have you been super gassy lately? Lots of fatigue? ADHD? Does your doctor say you're prediabetic? Put all that in there. These are the things that Jona will keep an eye out for when it analyzes your test later (though it will show plenty more than that, as I'd soon find out). My home test kit arrived about three days after I purchased it.

Look, there's nothing quite like starting your day by pooping on a little paper hammock affixed to your toilet seat and then poking it a bunch of times with a cotton swab. It was more of a mental hurdle than a practical one, though, as the collection and disposal (you just flush the hammock down when you're done) was easy enough. You then swish the stick around in a solution, cap it, and send it off. Twenty days later, I got an email that my results were in.

On the website, your results are broken down into a few sections: Summary (with tabs for Brain Health, GI Health, Metabolic Health, Skin Health, and Physical Performance), Action Plan (with tabs for Highest Impact, Diet, Lifestyle, and Probiotics), and the Organisms page, which shows you every single organism it found in your sample, and their relative abundance. Mine held some surprises.

On the positive side, my Microbiome Diversity came in at 4.19, which is above average (normal range is 2.80–3.99, as measured by the Shannon Index), which it says is a sign of a healthy microbiome, and it didn't find any pathogens or parasites. It says I digest lactose well (thank goodness). It didn't find any associations for things like depression, celiac disease, IBS, ulcerative colitis, leaky gut, hypertension, eczema, or a bunch of other things that I'm thankful to not have. Some of these were actually a bit puzzling, frankly, as I've struggled with insomnia pretty much my entire life, but it didn't find any associations there, or for fatigue, and I am most assuredly a tired human.

As far as associations that it did find, some were things I suspected, while others were total surprises. Under Brain Health, I had a moderate association for stress and a low association for ADHD, neither of which shocked me. Under Metabolic health was a “very low” association for prediabetes, which I actually thought would be higher, unfortunately. I had a moderate association with osteoarthritis, which made sense, given my family history.

But here's something strange: Under Metabolic Health it showed a moderate association with Hashimoto's disease. That wasn't something that was on my radar at all. I checked my bloodwork from my most recent physical, and my thyroid numbers looked normal, but I had a doctor's appointment the next week anyway, so we ran some additional bloodwork that looked specifically at the thyroid. Sure enough, my thyroglobulin antibodies were almost double what they should be.

I quickly made an appointment with an endocrinologist who said I shouldn't worry about it much for now, but it's something to keep an eye on going forward. I'm so glad that I now know to stay up to date on it, and I wouldn't have known at all if I hadn't taken this test. Hopefully it will end up being nothing, but early detection could go a long way.

On the other side, it also found a moderate association for alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder that causes large distinct patches of hair to fall out. And that's very weird, because I demonstrably do not have that. So, it's important to note that while some of elements of your microbiome might be associated with a condition, it's by no means definitive, nor does it mean there's causation there, necessarily.

It was also interesting to see what it didn't find. For instance, on my intake I put that bloating was something I'd been experiencing, but my test results showed no associations with bloating. When I asked Jona's team about it later, they noted that obviously that doesn't mean that the issue isn't happening, but they don't have evidence for a link to the microbiome specifically. Of all the things that would be directly linked to the microbiome, you'd think bloating would be right up at the top, but evidently not in my case. I was actually a bit disappointed to find that, because I was hoping it would reveal that long elusive fix. Oh well.

For each of the conditions listed, it would give me my top recommendations. For example, my top three for Hashimoto's was to increase omega-3 fatty acids and magnesium (both based on established research) and to up my step count (limited research). You can also see the specific organisms you have that are associated with it and click References to see the associated studies. Even with this distillation, it's still a lot of information to sort through, and it's not always immediately clear how the linked studies pertain to your situation (at least for the layperson).

The next tab is the Action Plan. It features recommendations for Diet, Lifestyle, and Probiotics, but it also has a High Impact list which takes the top suggestions and gives you just a handful to focus on. For me it was increase aerobic exercise, vitamins C, D, and B2, and magnesium. Easy enough! I thought that helped it feel less overwhelming. It even auto-generates a downloadable grocery list, which I found helpful.

While the AI generally puts things together in a way that makes sense, there are definitely some head-scratchers. For instance, for Hashimoto's, it says to avoid “probiotic containing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei strain Shirota.” But for prediabetes recommendations, I'm supposed to increase my consumption of this probiotic.

Elsewhere, polyphenols is one of my recommendations. It highlights foods that are good sources and suggests avoiding dark Chocolate and coffee, because these may conflict with other recommendations or self-reported food sensitivities. If I'm going to give up dark chocolate or coffee, I'd better have a good reason. It also recommended I consume more arabinoxylan, which is a starch found in cereal grains. I should eat more oats, barley, rye bread, and corn but not wheat nor rye. Why would it tell me to eat rye bread, but not rye?

I broke this down with Jona's chief medical officer, Lawrence Kosinski. You may need to break down these results with your own doctor. In fact, Jona's kit is the only one that's available both to doctors and to consumers. Doctors typically won't use anything that doesn't use shotgun sequencing, and the analysis in the Jona report is a lot easier for doctors to understand. Since Jona is already an AI company, though, it would be nice for it to have a public-facing LLM chatbot that allows you to ask questions directly.

My call with Dr. Kosinski was interesting, not just for clarifying my results but for understanding Jona's recommendations. Think of the gut like a petri dish. There are different types of petri dishes containing different substrates (i.e. foods), depending on what they want to grow. “So you need to create the right milieu to create the right microbiome,” Kosinski said. ""The number one thing I want you to get into peoples' heads: Prebiotics are more important than probiotics. What you eat is the most important thing. That's why Jona gives recommendations for what to eat.”

His bottom line was that a diverse diet is really important, which I have, so I should effectively keep eating the way I'm eating but try to integrate more of the foods Jona recommended. So that's what I did. I added supplements for vitamins C, D, and B2 (via a B complex), as well as magnesium, since those were the top recommendations on my Action Items list (though Jona listed the foods containing those, not supplements).

Four months later, I took the test again. I'd been trying to exercise more, de-stress, and eat more of the things. When Dr. Kosinski saw the results, he told me that I'd taken my healthy microbiome and made it even healthier. My diversity had dropped from 4.19 to 4.0, but he wasn't worried about that, because I'd boosted a lot of my good bacteria even higher. There were some good things in my results, too. My stress had gone from moderate to Very Low, and my prediabetes had gone from Very Low association to None.

But then there were some disturbing changes, too. On my first test it showed Very Low for my association with Parkinson's disease, which I'd been nervous enough about. On the second test it had jumped up to Moderate. Obviously, not what I wanted to see. Over at Skin Health, my association for alopecia areata had gone from Moderate all the way to High! Which is especially weird, because again as far as I or anyone else can tell, I don't have that.

So I got Dr. Kosinski back on the phone. We clicked on the Parkinson's results and then the Organisms tab within it. The first thing that stood out was that one bacteria called Akkermansia had taken a massive jump. The normal range is 0.12–1.96 percent, and in my first test I came in at 0.73 percent. In my second test I clocked in at a whopping 5.35 percent. Digging into the references, we found that vitamin D could be associated with an overabundance of Akkermansia, so it was possible that taking the daily vitamin D supplement was way more than I needed. He reminded me that that's why Jona generally recommends foods, not pills. A similar thing had happened with my alopecia areata.

If this sounds frustrating, you would be right. It's like playing whack-a-mole inside my gut, and indeed all of the High Impact items in my Action Plan were now different. But that's just kind of life in the microbiome. It's an ever-changing slurry. Ultimately, while sometimes troubling, I'm glad to have these health concerns on my radar that otherwise wouldn't have been. It's encouraged me to eat healthier, exercise more, and make sure I have my medical team checking certain things regularly. All of that is net positive.

Since I took the test, there are a couple of new features. The first launched in late September and is the Digital Twin. Jona has the data to make a replica of your microbiome, and you can run experiments on it. For example, if I just wanted to zero in on Hashimoto's and Parkinson's, it would zero in on the top eight actions you could take to help those associations, and it shows you how the relevant organisms are likely to go up or town as a result. Of course, your body is an organic system, and there are always a million confounding factors, so I wouldn't expect everything to go exactly to plan.

The other feature, launching by the end of 2025, is one I really wished it had after my second test. It's a track-changes page. Basically, if you have taken multiple tests, it will have a visual overlay, making it easier for you to see what has gone up and what has gone down. This should make it easier for the average consumer to see trends within their microbiome.

Of course, multiple tests means paying multiple times, and Jona's kit isn't cheap, coming in at $485. If you've shopped around for microbiome tests online, that may be shocking to you, as many of them are in the $200 to $300 range. Virtually all of the cheaper ones are using lower-quality tests that might look at 20 or 30 types of bacteria and then recommend supplements that they sell. The shotgun test Jona uses is the medical standard, and it looks at tens of thousands of organisms at a deep, DNA-sequencing level. Jona's AI has also digested (no pun intended) more than 220,000 studies related to the microbiome, and it continues to ingest 2,000 more each month, with your results updating as new, quality research comes to light.

Certainly, this test isn't for everyone, and there are places where it could be improved from a usability standpoint. It would still be best to share you results with your doctor and a gastroenterologist. It gave me a lot of insight into one of the most complex systems in my body, and it provided guidance on how I could make improvements. Too much information can fuel hypochondria, but it's also true that early detection can be crucial when combating certain diseases or conditions. I'm really glad I did it, and I would absolutely do it again.

When I last reviewed a mechanical keyboard from Das Keyboard—the 5QS Mark II—I was not favorable. I felt the storied keyboard company was stuck in the past, focusing on features that didn't create any real improvements in usability and failing to innovate on its core typing experience, which was nearly identical to keyboards from almost two decades ago.

Its latest release, the DeltaForce 65, seems to be a direct response to these kinds of criticisms—Das Keyboard has seemingly abandoned the gimmicks of its past designs, instead focusing on building a modern keyboard from the ground up. While this $200 keyboard stands out from its other offerings, it hardly manages to sit at the same level of its contemporaries. There aren't any cut corners in this keyboard's physical design and assembly, but strange software and layout choices make the entire user experience feel disjointed.

The typing experience with this keyboard is … alright. It's nothing special, not worth writing home about, but it's not bad. The switches are light to type on, being tried-and-true Gateron Red switches with a 45-gram actuation weight. These are a proven design that feels smooth and has been used for years without issue, but they won't blow you away, especially if you're somewhat familiar with modern mechanical switches. They feel a bit wobbly, and when combined with the flex-cut printed circuit board (PCB), they produce a fairly thin and plasticky sound when typing, which is only partially mitigated by the keyboard's sound-dampening foam.

The gasket mount system is simple, and there's nothing wrong with that. There is some flex, and it has a relaxed, comfortable typing feel, but it doesn't compete with the “bouncy” typing of a board like the Mchose GX87. It's fairly muted, without the distinct high-pitched “clacky” sound, or deep “thocky” sound, of a more acoustically-tuned keyboard. The DeltaForce sits in a middle ground that's neutral and tame, without much extraneous noise or depth.

The stabilizers rattle a bit. They've been lubricated from the factory, and for the most part this lubing is well done, but the left side of the space bar still rattles. This is an easy fix to make (you don't even have to open up the keyboard), and the stabilizers themselves—plate-mounted, screw-in stabilizers—are a relatively premium option that should stay rattle-free after being properly lubricated and tuned.

The case is made of a relatively lightweight aluminum. This doesn't have the same heft as some premium metal cases, but still feels more solid than most plastic cases. Inside, there are three PCBs connected together by ribbon cables: The main board with all of the switches, a daughterboard that holds the USB-C port, and an additional board that houses the knob. This means the USB-C port is able to sit closer to the desk, and that neither the port or the knob will be subject to the flexing of the main PCB during typing, a small detail I worry about with nearly every gasket-mount keyboard I test. As far as internal assembly goes, this keyboard gets full marks.

A series of shallow grooves line either side of the case's bottom half. These seem to mimic the side sculpts of some limited-run custom keyboards, and they have a functional purpose, making it easier to lift the keyboard. The design is mirrored in the aluminum knob in the top right corner, which has a similar motif. I really like that these designs are not only ornamental but actually have a functional purpose during regular use.

Going further into the aesthetic choices of this keyboard, it loses me a bit with the keycaps. I'm not a big fan of the camouflage design. The shapes don't always line up across keycaps, and it overall seems tacky. However, the print quality is top-notch, with no fuzziness or discoloration, consistent even along the keycaps' sides. Because the keycaps are white with multicolored printing on top, the RGB lighting is able to bounce between the white plastic plate and the white undersides of the keycaps, appearing brighter and diffusing more evenly across the keyboard.

With a polling rate of 1,000 Hz (meaning the keyboard sends 1,000 messages to the computer every second), the DeltaForce 65 feels snappy and responsive. This combines with the relatively light Gateron Red switches to make a keyboard that's effective for gaming while still being comfortable to type on. It doesn't compare to high-end gaming keyboards with Hall effect switches and 8,000-Hz polling rates, which are going to be faster and more customizable, but for casual gaming, it's more than enough.

The compact size of the keyboard is ideal for gaming, saving a significant amount of space compared to a full-size keyboard. This allows for more mouse space and lets your hands sit closer together for more rapid movement between the mouse and keyboard. To make up for the loss of the function row up top, you can hold the FN key and press the corresponding number key (i.e., FN+1 = F1), and the FN key can be used with some other keys for the Home, Pause, Print Screen, and other removed keys. The knob in the top right is easy to reach and has a satisfying notchiness to it. It's programmed to adjust volume by default, but can be remapped to nearly anything else.

As far as programmability, VIA is the star of the show here. The DeltaForce65 uses an open source system known as QMK for its programmability, and VIA is an in-browser interface based on QMK that allows for seamless, rapid customization of the keyboard's layout. The system is incredibly powerful and intuitive to use, and a common capability of many modern mechanical keyboards.

However, the DeltaForce65 is not officially supported by QMK/VIA, meaning users will have to download the .JSON firmware file from Das Keyboard and manually upload it into VIA to customize the keyboard's layout, as opposed to being completely plug-and-play like many Keychron keyboards. Because of this, if the Das Keyboard website goes down (or the page hosting the user manual is removed), users will be out of luck for customization unless the .JSON file has been archived elsewhere. The lack of official support also means one of the main benefits of VIA—convenient in-browser operation—is less compelling. Instead of simply entering a URL and being able to customize your keyboard, you will also need to download the .JSON file and insert it into the website.

For the most part, the layout can easily be customized using VIA. Any of the keys can be remapped to produce any input, and the RGB lighting can be tweaked with countless presets built into VIA. There's a lot of potential for setting up macros, scripts, and other complex key combinations—when it works.

The main hiccup I ran into was with the shift keys. From what I can tell, it seems the designers of this keyboard's layout wanted to make it so pressing Shift + Esc would type a tilde (~). However, they seemingly did this by conditionally mapping the shift key to both Shift and Function (FN), with the keyboard recognizing the key as Shift when typing a letter or number, and Function when pressing a modifier key. Along with making it easy to type a tilde, it makes the Backspace key mostly useless when holding down either Shift button: When using the keyboard in some browsers, like Firefox, it registers Shift + Backspace as the Delete key. When using Google Chrome, or Google Docs from any browser, Shift + Backspace does absolutely nothing. I can't find a way to fix this issue: Any key mapped as Left or Right Shift in QMK will do this.

Beyond this, some of the other key combinations listed by Das Keyboard don't work either. Win + Esc is supposed to type a backtick, with no success, and Fn + Backspace, which is supposed to register as a Delete key, doesn't work either. After asking Das Keyboard about this issue, I was told these were problems with the unit I received, so the company sent another keyboard. After some testing, these issues were still present in the second unit.

The DeltaForce 65 represents a modernization of Das Keyboard's design philosophy. The gasket-mount system feels bouncy and pliable without seeming flimsy, the flex cuts on the PCB are functional, and both the hot-swap sockets and the exposed screws on the underside show an understanding of consumers and a desire to not only allow but endorse end-user customization.

As much as I like this keyboard's design, the problems with the layout are fairly significant. They prevent the keyboard from being used as intended, and significantly limit its functionality. It's a frustrating issue, and I can't foresee an easy solution when neither reflashing the keyboard's firmware nor editing the layout has any effect. More than anything else, it's disappointing to see a good keyboard ruined by a few decisions that didn't pan out.

If you're sensitive to tech disasters, you might want to look away now: A recent Reddit thread tells the story of an unfortunate user who found 30 years of photos and work locked away and inaccessible in Microsoft OneDrive.

The individual made use of their cloud storage account to consolidate files from various hard drives, which had to be discarded due to a move. The plan was to then move the files back from OneDrive to new hard drives, but before the user was able to do this, their account was locked by Microsoft—without any reason given.

It's still not clear why the account was locked or why Microsoft has so far ignored the user's appeals to restore access, but it's a warning to the rest of us—and a reminder to put a few basic protections and precautions in place.

It used to be a truth universally acknowledged that data wasn't properly backed up until it was backed up twice, in two separate locations. You can copy your important files to an external hard drive, but if it's in the same room as your laptop, then theft, fire, or flood can wipe out both copies at the same time.

Today, having two backups of everything—so three copies in total—might seem excessive, as cloud storage services so rarely go down. We've all become used to the idea that the data we've logged with Microsoft, Google, Apple, or other providers is always going to be available, so we don't need to worry about it.

Apps will often push you to delete local copies of your files.

What's more, apps will often push you to keep all your original files in the cloud, and then be selective about what gets saved locally—you might see Google Photos offer to clear up space on your phone in this way, for example. If everything's safely stored in the cloud, do you really need local copies too?

Well, yes, actually you do. Problems with cloud storage might be rare, but as our example above shows, cloud accounts can be locked, hacked, or hit by bugs, which means you need to store local copies of your files on as many devices as you can. There's always the chance as well that you'll inadvertently delete a swathe of cloud files without realizing it, which will again leave you relying on the files on your devices.

Dropbox can store files exclusively in the cloud, until you need them.

Ideally, you want to have your cloud drives syncing to at least two devices, preferably in separate locations. Even better, set up some kind of local storage backup to a hard drive or network drive in addition to whatever cloud storage protection you've put in place. You might even consider signing up for two cloud storage services, if you have the budget.

Here's one example: In Dropbox, from the Preferences screen you can head to the Sync tab to manage how files are handled. The Online-only option will free up a lot of local hard drive space, but using the Available offline option means you can get at your files if you're locked out of your Dropbox account or you lose your internet connection.

This is less directly related to the opening scenario mentioned above, because Microsoft has apparently locked the cloud account in question without any warning—there's not a whole lot you can do about that in advance, but you can take other steps to minimize the risk of losing access in other ways.

This starts with choosing a strong username and password: The latter should be lengthy and impossible to guess. Ideally, you want to be using a password manager to manage all of your digital accounts, and you should also turn on two-step authentication wherever it's offered (it's available with most apps and services now). Do this and your username and password on their own won't be enough to access your account.

Two of the recovery options for Apple accounts.

It's also important to double-check your backup and recovery options for your cloud accounts. This typically involves making sure details like backup email addresses and cell numbers are always up to date and active. You might need to rely on them if you can't get into your accounts and get at your files in the normal way.

With Apple and iCloud accounts, for example, you can set up both a Recovery Contact (who will help you regain access) and a Recovery Key (a 28-character code you can use instead of your password). To get these options set up, select your account name and then Sign-In & Security in iOS Settings or macOS System Settings.

Google will tell you where your account is logged in.

We've talked about keeping your files available in multiple locations, but you should also make sure your accounts aren't active on any older or unused devices where they don't need to be—it increases the risk of something happening to your data or someone else gaining access to your account.

Most cloud storage services will give you the option of seeing which devices are connected to your account, usually through one of the settings menus. When it comes to Google accounts, you can open up your account details on the web, then click Security and Manage devices to see where you're logged in.

Shopping for someone else's house is intimidating. What housewarming gifts can you give that they won't already have? What's something they'll actually use instead of just adding to their shelf clutter? There are a few easy classics that folks love to gift—who doesn't love a candle or another little houseplant?—but there are also a lot of really useful, beautiful gifts you can give instead. I've lived in eight apartments in the past 10 years and bought my first home last year—here are the housewarming gifts that are getting daily use in my house.

WIRED's Gear team has personally tested and vetted everything that appears in our gift guides. Speaking of, check out the rest of our gift guides, including gifts for outdoorsy people, book lovers, new parents, and STEM-loving kids.

Updated October 2025: We've added new gifts from Flamingo Estate, Great Jones, and Bedsure, and we've updated this guide with the latest pricing for gifts we still love.

Great Jones

Great Jones

I'm a big fan of Great Jones' cookware (and I'm not alone in that sentiment here at WIRED), and what I especially like is how the brand has colorful yet affordable options. The latest that caught my eye is the Spout, a beautiful glass vessel made for pouring your favorite kitchen liquid. It's a fun fit whether you want something pretty for your olive oil pours or have a special oil or dressing you want a dressed-up container for. I'm currently dreaming of restocking the port vinaigrette I bought years ago and filling the Spout with it (and pairing this with a special dressing or oil can be a fun way to round out the gift!).

Ninja

Amazon

Best Buy

Ninja

I was not expecting to love this tiny, cordless blender as much as I do. It takes around an hour to charge via USB-C, and the battery doesn't last very long—about as long as it takes to make two smoothies. But we recently had to do an emergency restock on frozen fruit and protein powder because it's more convenient than dragging out the Vitamix every morning. It has an 18-ounce capacity, which is pretty big, but my 7-year-old can drink from it easily, sadly. The lid and container are dishwasher-safe, and the blending is remarkably thorough and effective—no frozen berries getting stuck, no large chunks left. If you have an early commute, you can even blend and grab on your way to the car. —Adrienne So

East Fork

East Fork

Everyone's home needs a good set of coasters. Not only can they keep your surfaces safe, but a cute set like these Glass Cloud Coasters from East Fork Pottery also make a fun style statement on whatever tabletop they sit on. They come in two gorgeous sets of colors—Day, with a white and blue cloud, and Sunset, with a purple and orange cloud—and are a fun statement for any surface. They're a little slim, but still wide enough for my coffee cups and even my massive Owala. They've held up great after a year of drinks have sat upon them during my working hours, with no scratches or dings to speak of.

SonicPower

Amazon

SonicPower

Moving into a new home always feels like I'm in the cleanest place I've ever lived. Fresh paint! A clean shower! A stove that isn't covered in burned rice remains! But it's work to keep it that way. My new favorite tool to clean with is SonicPower's Electric Spin Scrubber. It's great to grab for shower stains and sticky sink buildup, and it comes with four different brushes so that you can pair the right brush with the right area of your home, like the hard brush for my shower floor and scour brush for the stovetop. It's got simple controls: one button to turn it on and switch between low and high power mode, and a little screen to show how much battery life is left.

Bedsure

Amazon

Bedsure

Nothing says new home like a new set of bedding. One of our favorite affordable, long-lasting sets of bedsheets are Bedsure's GentleSoft Bamboo Cooling Sheet Set ($63). WIRED reviewer Julia Forbes reaches for it more than any other set she has, and says her set has lasted years. These sheets pack all our favorite benefits of bamboo sheets with a silky-cool feel, but are more affordable since they're made with bamboo rayon. It's a great price for a nice gift and something you know they'll need.

The Container Store

Container Store

Nothing says it's a real home like being able to see all the spices. The Container Store's Expanding Three-Tier Organizer has three little shelves and can expand to nearly 2 feet long for plenty of room to arrange spices and jars. I don't know about your spice shelf, but our house has a collection of hot sauces and extra containers of furikake (we can never remember if we're running out yet) that are much easier to navigate with the three-shelf setup. It's not an expensive item, either, but really cleans up a shelf in your pantry in a matter of minutes. It's the only reason my spice section looks even remotely organized.

The Container Store

Container Store (Bins)

Container Store (Drawers)

Moving into a new home sounds like a magical time to get everything organized, right? I thought so, too, and then the chaos of moving in turned every closet I owned into a dumping ground. The top shelves of both my hall closet and my bedroom closet were the worst offenders. So much space, turned into haphazard piles of sweaters and random accessories. Until, that is, I added The Container Store's Like-It modular bins and drawers to the top of my closet. You can stack them if you've got the height space, but I even found just two bins side by side suddenly organized sweaters that usually took up double the space. The drawers are handy too for more miscellaneous items. I'll be adding these to every closet in the house, slowly and surely, and I'm sure any other homeowner you know would love them just as much as I do.

Great Jones

Great Jones (Holy Sheet)

Great Jones (Little Sheet)

Great Jones (Sheet Show Set)

Great Jones (Little Sheet Duo)

If they love to bake, whether it's homemade scones or just premade cookie dough from the grocery store (I've got aspirations of the former but currently have the latter in my fridge), these Great Jones baking sheets are both great for baking and fun to look at. The baking sheets come in five food-themed colors: raspberry pink, mustard yellow, broccoli green, blueberry blue, and pepper black, and can come as a half-sheet or two quarter sheets, or a set of both sizes. The two quarter sheets double nicely as little serving trays for a party.

Flamingo Estate

Flamingo Estate

If you're looking for something on the higher end but don't want to just gift another bottle of wine, try the Chef's Kiss gift set from Flamingo Estate. The maker of our favorite scented candle puts a delicious extra virgin olive oil, spicy chili olive oil, and wildflower honey into a gift-wrapped box for a splurge of essentials your favorite chef will love using. I currently can't stop using the olive oil as a drizzle on my favorite pasta dishes.

Bearaby

Amazon

Bearaby (15 lbs.)

Moving is stressful. You know what can help with that? A weighted blanket. The knitted style you'll find with popular blankets like Bearaby, our top pick in our guide to the best weighted blankets, is both great for staying comfortable and pretty to look at when it's thrown over the couch. Bearaby's Tree Napper is a great option, and it does a nice job of being a little cozy while keeping plenty of airflow. But I also really like Nuzzie's Ice Knit Blanket ($239), which looks similar but has an icy touch to it thanks to the bamboo fabric used. Both have different weights they offer, and you'll want to hit 10 percent of the new homeowner's weight, so I recommend looking at the weight options for each to find the perfect one to buy.

Quiet Town

Quiet Town

I've hated every shower organizer I've ever had. That is, until I saw The Spot from Quiet Town. It comes in three colors and uses a pegboard-like system, coming with three organizers, one hook, and a mirror you can attach to the organizer wherever you see fit. It's a modern style statement in a shower organizer, something I never thought I'd find. The included organizers have enough space for one person's various shower bottles, so if you're gifting this to a couple, you might want to add on an extra bottle basket or two for them to fit everything on there.

But my favorite thing is how insanely long the included strap is. I have a showerhead designed for someone upward of 6 feet tall, and most shower organizers sit weirdly high off my showerhead. The Spot doesn't have this problem thanks to the included long strap. I was able to hang mine about 22 inches below my showerhead with some extra strap to spare. It also comes with accessories to drill it into the wall if you prefer that.

The Trump administration is taking its social media attacks on Democratic opponents to an unlikely platform, with the White House and numerous other government agencies joining Bluesky on Friday.

In its first post, the new White House account uploaded a highlight reel of Trump footage and memes, along with the message, “What's up, Bluesky? We thought you might've missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you.”

Other government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of State, the Department of War, and the Department of Transportation all appeared to follow the White House by creating new Bluesky accounts, and all of them quickly posted messages attacking Democrats over the ongoing government shutdown.

“We heard this is a great place to have an open and honest dialogue, so we're here to talk about how the Democrat shutdown is undermining our country on the world stage,” wrote the Department of State. (Legal experts have suggested that similar statements from government agencies likely violate the Hatch Act.)

The messages were generally written in a cheerful, trolling tone, suggesting that the administration's social media teams were anticipating and even hoping for a negative response on a social network that's widely known as a left-leaning alternative to Elon Musk's X. And Bluesky users delivered, with many responses to the initial White House post bringing up Trump's relationship with infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

“The reason they're coming after this place is because they can't control the people on it and it drives them nuts,” wrote The Onion CEO Ben Collins.

At the same time, many popular Bluesky accounts urged their followers to simply “block and move on,” with comedian Paul F Tomkins declaring that it's “Weirdly fun to block the White House.”

Less than 48 hours after joining, the White House has already become one of the most blocked accounts on Bluesky. According to ClearSky, which tracks Bluesky blocking stats, the White House account is blocked by around 91,000 accounts, while being followed by only 10,000. The only account that's been blocked by more Bluesky users belongs to Vice President JD Vance, who joined back in June. 

While the various new government accounts hadn't quite reached those heights by Sunday morning, they accounted for all of the top 5 most blocked accounts in the last 24 hours.  And other right-wing accounts seemed to be boasting about following the Trump administration to Bluesky and getting widely blocked.

Ironically, it seems that some of the more ""anti-AI"" people I know are more likely to re-share AI-generated content without realising it, because they aren't keeping up with what today's AI output looks like.

In this context, the more fake news/content we see, the better it is, because it will only make the process of getting there fast.

Nah. seems people forget social media has been fake for way longer than AI. sometimes Photoshop, or editing. Sometimes just deliberately miss-attributing a real photo for clicks. heck there's a whole ""fake Asian videos"" subreddit, funny videos that in another light are brilliant sketch comedy but always portray themselves as real. not to mention humans consume boatloads of knowingly-fake things -- movies, tv shows, cartoons, artwork etc.oddly enough the rise of AI may flip one of the most annoying things in social media, all the fake stuff that people think is real. a small subset of people (like myself) are less annoyed by the fake content and more annoyed by the people falling for it. Like those ""Fake Asian Videos"" I've seen a few that were well written, well acted and even well filmed. If it were a comedy show on Netflix it would be hilarious, the distaste I have for them is that they portend to be real and people often believe them to be real.In the short term this is going to be way worse as even discriminating people can't tell if something is fake, but the light at the end of the tunnel is when it hits such saturation that anything real is in the minority and everyone assumes that everything is fake and keeps on consuming.

Calling this a ""slip-up"" is an outrageous downplay. If anything this makes me suspicious of the moderator who posted the comment too. One does not accidentally prepare a zip file with a malicious exe and xubuntu-specific language, upload it to a server, and point a torrent link at it.

reply

You're making an assumption that this moderator is anything more than a Xubuntu enthusiast who wants to downplay outrage on Reddit. Keep in mind Xubuntu is mostly a community effort, not a large corporation with seniors who know how to handle this ""best"".

Indeed that is a suspicious or at least untrustworthy way to deflect the seriousness of a malware infection that potentially affects all users of an OS distribution.

Getting the correct PGP public key appears to be an exercise left to the reader, but if you are already running e.g. Fedora, you can view the packaged QubesOS distro keys distributed by your current OS, cross-reference that with a second source such as a PGP keyserver, and unless you're being Mossaded upon you're probably good if they match.

Modern-day meteorologists rely on a vast network of advanced technologies to predict the weather, but that wasn't always the case. Before satellites, computer modeling, and radar systems, people made forecasts largely by observing their surroundings.

The techniques and tools they used are still effective and accessible today. In fact, they're perfect for anyone interested in becoming a backyard meteorologist. With a few handy instruments and a solid understanding of some basic weather concepts, you'll be making your own forecasts in no time.

Gizmodo turned to two experts in meteorology and amateur forecasting for advice on how to get started. John Huth, a Donner Professor of Science at Harvard University's physics department, teaches a class on backyard meteorology and the science of weather. Steve Seman, an associate teaching professor at Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, also instructs students in meteorology.

They broke down the basics, highlighted helpful tools, and offered words of wisdom for anyone looking to learn more about the weather in their neighborhood.

Weather is driven by six key variables: temperature, atmospheric pressure, cloud formation, wind, humidity, and precipitation. Changes in these variables—and interactions between them—create different scenarios and patterns. Once you understand that, you can begin thinking about how air moves around in the atmosphere.

“We usually start thinking horizontally, at the surface of the Earth, and then go into vertical [movement],” Seman said. Horizontal air movement—or wind—drives vertical air movement through convergence and divergence. Convergence is the inflow of air to a given area, causing it to pile up and rise. Divergence is the outflow of air from a given area, causing it to spread out and sink.

“Those horizontal air movements are also related to vertical air movements,” Seman explained. The first thing to understand is that both atmospheric temperature and pressure decrease with elevation. “These two [gradients] are givens associated with the way the Earth's atmosphere operates,” Huth said.

As warm air rises, it encounters lower pressure and expands, then cools in a process called adiabatic cooling. If it cools past the dew point, moisture condenses around tiny airborne particles, forming clouds and sometimes storms. When air sinks, skies clear.

These are some of the most basic concepts in atmospheric science. While there's much more to learn, mastering the fundamentals provides a solid foundation for understanding Earth's complex weather system.

One of the first things Seman and Huth teach their students is how to observe and measure weather conditions. When starting out, this may be as simple as stepping outside and asking questions: “Does it feel humid out? What kind of clouds do you see in the sky?” Huth suggested.

The senses serve as a backyard meteorologist's first toolkit. At the beginning of Huth's course, he asks students to spend several days observing their physiological responses to different conditions. This establishes an internal baseline that helps guide their forecasting.

Once you've built this foundation, there's no shortage of instruments that can help you measure the weather phenomena you see and feel. But both Huth and Seman stress that you don't need to go out and buy a bunch of fancy equipment. In fact, you can even make some of these tools yourself.

Here is their list of essentials for your backyard meteorology toolkit:

If you're willing to spend more money for a more high-tech setup, you can purchase a home weather station instead. These compact devices gather all the measurements listed above and typically range from $100 to over $1,000. While more expensive models may come with more advanced features and increased accuracy, you by no means have to spend that much.

“For most people, it's not even worth it because the siting of the instrument is so important in terms of the quality of the measurements,” Seman said. Most don't live in places that are ideal for gathering weather data using a home station, he explained.

Full transparency—backyard meteorology isn't the easiest hobby to pick up. Even for those with a science background, learning how to gather and interpret this type of data can be challenging and even frustrating at times.

Huth and Seman can attest to this, having dealt with plenty of discouraged students in their classes. The main piece of advice they offer is to trust the learning process and not give up.

“There is not one meteorologist in the world who knows all the answers every single time,” Seman said. “So have realistic expectations for yourself and just try to build step by step.”

Huth would agree. “Don't be afraid to make mistakes,” he said. “Don't beat yourself up if you aren't precise because the weather is known to be fickle.”

Connecting with other backyard meteorologists or experts in this field can also be very helpful. “I encourage students to ask a lot of questions when [they] encounter things that just aren't making sense,” Seman said. Getting involved in online forums—such as those hosted on the American Weather website—or local clubs are great ways to meet other weather enthusiasts.

Learning to forecast may require a greater investment of time and energy than other hobbies, but it also delivers a higher reward. Being weather savvy—observing the sky, making your own assessments, and having a clearer understanding of official forecasts from agencies like the National Weather Service—can help anyone make more informed decisions.

“The weather is applicable to pretty much everybody's daily life in some way, from what you choose to wear to what your heating bill might be,” Seman said.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

What Happened: The ranking member of a key House subcommittee demanded answers this week from the Environmental Protection Agency about why it has yet to make public a report documenting the health risks posed by a forever chemical found in the water of millions of Americans.

In a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday, Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, cited a ProPublica story from last week that quoted government scientists saying the report had been ready for publishing in April but had yet to be released. Pingree — the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies — asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for “clear answers” about why the report had not been made public, who directed its delay and when Zeldin would commit to releasing it.

What They Said: Pingree referred to the delay in publishing the report as part of “a growing pattern of interference with the Agency's scientific work” and pointed to the Integrated Risk Information System, the EPA program that wrote it. IRIS, which was created during Ronald Reagan's presidency, analyzes the health harm chemicals can cause. “The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program,” she wrote, asking whether scientists had been removed or reassigned from the program and, if so, why.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA's decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.

Pingree noted that the delay appears to contradict Zeldin's repeated public statements about protecting the public from PFAS compounds, which contaminate soil and water in Maine and throughout the country. “Our state is really hoping for help from the federal government. And when you see the federal government turn their back on you and decide to withhold the data … that's really discouraging,” she told ProPublica. “Reading that piece made my blood boil.”

Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people. The report in question found that the chemical interferes with human development by causing lower birth weights and, based on animal evidence, likely causes damage to the liver and to male reproductive systems, including reductions in testosterone levels, sperm production and the size of reproductive organs.

PFNA was a component of firefighting foam and a processing aid to make a kind of plastic used in circuit boards, valves and pipes. Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.

ProPublica's reporting found that IRIS has been drastically reduced under the Trump administration. The program, which calculates values that can be used to set limits for pollutants in drinking water and cleanup levels for toxic sites, has been a frequent target of industry. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has set the direction for President Donald Trump's second administration, called for IRIS to be eliminated. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress introduced legislation called the “No IRIS Act.” Of 55 EPA scientists Publica identified as having worked on recent IRIS assessments, only eight remain in the office, according to a source familiar with the program.

Why It Matters: The report calculated the amount of PFNA that people can be exposed to without being harmed — a critical measurement that can be used to set limits for cleaning up PFNA in contaminated areas called Superfund sites and for removing the chemical from drinking water. This calculation will prove critical to communities around the country as they battle polluters over who will pay to remove PFNA and other forever chemicals from the environment.

Response: Last week, an EPA spokesperson told ProPublica that the report on PFNA would be published when it was finalized but did not answer questions about what still needed to be done or when that would likely happen. The agency's press office did not respond to questions about Pingree's letter.

Do you remember the first time you used a robot vacuum? I remember mine. It was one of iRobot's early Roombas. I was transfixed, watching this chunky black disc whiz noisily around, bashing into walls and furniture before zipping off in seemingly random directions like a hockey puck slapped haphazardly across the ice. It wasn't good at its job, but in a way, its clumsy sort of chaos made it charming.

Nothing is charming about most robot vacuums, now. In fact, most of them are boring as hell. Don't get me wrong, they can be nice to have. But it feels like manufacturers have made a collective decision to ignore the R2-D2 of it all in their quest to turn their products into Very Serious Appliances. Why that might be is anyone's guess, but I suspect either it hasn't occurred to them to make a robot vacuum fun or they want people to see their products as sophisticated, advanced technology. Or maybe it's just very hard to nail fun.

Whatever the reason, it has led us to this place where robot vacuums all look about the same: the friendly, rounded curves of the early models have been replaced with harder edges and sheer, flat design. Many have sensor clusters jutting out of the top so they actually know where they're going, unlike my freewheeling Roomba of old. They're also smarter and less likely to get trapped under your couch, and they've got robotic parts that let them get to more places. (See the independently lifting wheels from the Roborock Saros 10R or the periscope-like sensor cluster of the new Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller.) And in recent years, their docks have become much more than a place to recharge and maybe empty dustbins—now, they can swap out mopping solutions and even cleaning parts of the robots themselves.

The problem is: Too many of them still suck (pun intended) at basic cleaning tasks. Some are better than others, but generally speaking, they're still prone to being disabled by misplaced trinkets, leaving obvious trash behind on carpets, or creating a moat of dirt around the edge of a rug. Their automated docks are impressive, but they're also a constant source of noise. To many of these companies, “better” seems to be synonymous with “busier and more complicated.”

Enter Matic, founded by former Nest engineers who set out to create a robot vacuum, also called the Matic, that can “mimic human perception and self-learning through cameras and Neural Networks” to clean more like a human being—and that does its job locally, no cloud connection needed. The home robotics company has since put out a device that both looks and works better than the vast majority of its competition, albeit for a high price. But it does so with an irresistible charm that I haven't seen in a gadget in years.

Matic Robot Vacuum

It's disarmingly charming robot vacuum with great performance and very few minor quibbles.

Pros

Cons

The Matic is a spectacle right from the get-go. It starts with the shipping box: Instead of slicing through packing tape and lifting out a device hugged by styrofoam and wrapped in plastic, you release four tabs on the bottom of the packaging and lift the top to reveal the Matic sitting on a little cardboard platform with a ramp that flops down. It's not zip-tied or secured in any way, and when you long-press the start button on top, it drives itself off the platform. A display near the button lights up with a message, festooned with digital balloons and ticker tape, that reads (in my case), “Hello, Davis Family.” It feels like a fake robot made for some early-2010s TV show about the near future.

Inside the box's upper portion, you'll find replacement parts, like dust bags and an extra mop roller. But Matic also love-bombs you with a tiny 3D-printed Matic robot vacuum key chain, a sticker sheet full of things like dog ears and a name tag (my child took the liberty of naming it “Martie”), a pair of googly eyes, and a set of friggin' Legos with instructions to build a miniature Matic. The Lego kit doesn't come with every Matic delivered—Matic CEO Mehul Nariyawala told me in an interview that the company had included them with early orders, but that it's hard to get the individual pieces at scale, as it had to special order some. I think the company should try, though, because this was a delightful little build:

The Matic itself beguiles you the moment you look at it. Instead of being a giant, squat hockey puck, the Matic's curvy, blocky cuboid body stands 7.8 inches tall. The easy comparison is Pixar's Wall-E, although I kept thinking it looked more like M-O, a black-and-white floor-cleaning robot that, driven by an obsession with cleaning Wall-E's filth, defies its programming by leaving its predefined course.

To that end, the Matic has a clear cartoonish face, made up of two RGB cameras up top and a broomy mustache-looking cleaning head—the part with the brush and mop rollers—below. When it's in mopping mode, it drives backwards, and there's a face there, too, in the form of two more cameras above an air vent that gives it a Wallace and Gromit-esque smile. The Matic uses those four cameras, along with a fifth mounted on top and several infrared sensors hidden around its body, to navigate and map its world, as well as to identify and avoid obstacles.

The Matic's charming cartoonishness continues when you send it off on an initial mapping run that I can only describe as delightful. It doesn't just creep around your house, slowly taking stock of boundaries and building a virtual layout, as most vacuums would. Instead, it seems to dash excitedly from place to place, pausing here and there for whimsical pirouettes. It's collecting data like any other robot vacuum would, but it feels like a Pixar character awash in wonder at every detail of its new home. It's a marvelous bit of design excess that's it's really hard not to get swept up in.

When the mapping is done, you're treated to what may be the best robot vacuum map in the business. Rather than expressing your home's layout as a cluster of generic rectangles, the Matic app creates a full-color image from stitched-together pictures of your flooring. It's almost what it would look like if a giant lifted my roof and snapped a picture of my house (which, again, just makes me think of cartoons), minus the tops of the furniture the robot is too short to see. You can rotate and tilt the map or drive the robot around with an onscreen joystick as if you're playing a mobile game, and because the details you see in real life are represented so well on the map, it's always easy to tell where the Matic is and direct it precisely where you want it to go.

This is all extremely handy when the Matic gets stuck—which this robot is definitely wont to do, if perhaps less so than other robot vacuums. In cases where it just can't get out of a tight spot, you can go into remote control mode to drive it out of trouble. There's a little latency between your action and the robot's, but I found that I could still drive it around and be reasonably sure I wouldn't run it into walls, even if I couldn't physically see it.

Is this map's detailed rendering of my home a bit of a creepy reminder that I'm letting a little mobile camera drive around your house? Absolutely, yes. But Matic has uniquely positioned itself to get away with that by being almost entirely self-contained, only requiring an internet connection for software updates. Other robot vacuum companies, like iRobot, might ask you to submit pictures from inside your home so they can train the models that drive their object avoidance features. Whereas the Matic is equipped with an Nvidia Orin Jetson Nano, a miniature computer made for AI and robotics, to handle object identification and navigation on-device.

Connecting the Matic to your home Wi-Fi network does make the act of controlling it easier, but the company doesn't punish you for using Bluetooth instead. Apart from not getting software updates, you might never know the difference unless some robot-killing software bug rears its head. The app works exactly the same over Bluetooth; it's just a bit slower, and the connection gets iffy from one room over and nonexistent any farther than that—at least, in my very old house, which has wireless signal-crushing plaster-and-lathe walls. Or, if you like the way the robot works as-is and don't mind never getting software updates, you could easily set the Matic to a schedule, disconnect it from Wi-Fi, and then delete the app forever.

The top-mounted display also gives you enough information that you almost always know what it's up to or why it might be stuck. And, as a bonus, you'll never have to worry about the Matic collecting and phoning home with pictures of you on a toilet that then end up on Facebook. Matic, the company, could go belly up, and this robot could potentially run and be useful for as long as its parts allow—which, to be fair, wouldn't be long if you can't buy the vacuum bags anymore, but we'll get to that soon.

Okay, okay, so it's an adorable little Wall-E with good maps. That doesn't matter, even a little, if the Matic is just as mediocre at cleaning as so many other robot vacuums. Thankfully, it's actually very good; I run my Roomba J7 nightly, and even then, the Matic was able to gather enough dust and hair in one day of testing to fill its dust bag, which Nariyawala told me has a 1-liter capacity. After that first day, I went through roughly a bag a week over two weeks of nightly runs and one or two spot cleans a day. My carpets and hard floors looked cleaner and felt nicer to walk on than they ever do with my Roomba J7 or Eufy L35 Hybrid.

The Matic accomplishes this with little suction—it only pulls air at 3,200 Pa, about a tenth of the 30,000 Pa promised by the Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller or the 19,500Pa of the Ecovacs Deebot X11, some of its most expensive recent competitors. Part of that is thanks to its roller brush, which has chunkier fins that dig deeper into your carpet and are angled in such a way that hair and string are shunted to the side instead of wrapping around the roller. It might also be down to how it cleans; rather than just sort of dumbly driving back and forth across a room in rows, navigating around furniture as needed, like my Roomba J7 or Eufy L35 Hybrid, it seems to detect when it has missed something, and it often goes back to try again from different angles. (Here, I thought again of Wall-E's M-O leaving its prescribed route.)

The Matic even docks well, gliding smoothly over its metal charging contacts, although it can hesitate if there are objects too close to either side. (Matic recommends a foot of clearance beside and above the dock.) Also, it's quiet—Matic puts it at 55 decibels when vacuuming, or around the volume of normal human speech—although it's definitely still noisy if something too big to easily get sucked into the vacuum tube finds its way into the cleaning head and bangs around inside until it's finally sucked up or ejected.

The Matic's vision-based object avoidance is excellent; it never bumps into walls or furniture, sometimes turning with such tight clearance that I often thought, “Ah ha! This time it will smack that wall,” and was proven wrong. It does a good job ignoring things it shouldn't suck up—I never once caught it dragging a dangling USB-C cable or a blanket around. You can still get it to run into you if you jam your foot right in front of it while it's rolling, but otherwise, it's almost gentle when it comes to living things, slowing if it sees a dog or a person in its path and either going around them or just stopping and waiting patiently for the path to clear.

Its object avoidance isn't perfect, though; the Matic will still grab things like hair ties, Lego bricks, and other small objects while going around larger bits of paper. And it got stuck once when the handle of a foldable cloth laundry basket that had been left flat on our living room floor got jammed in the cleaning head. But those sorts of jam were rare, and I wasn't being especially careful to keep them from happening.

When it comes to mopping, the Matic is better than a lot of older mop-bots that just smear plain water across your floor. It actually uses a floor-cleaning solution, though Matic only endorses those made by Aunt Fannie's. My floors feel and look better after a few scheduled cleans. The Matic has a spot-cleaning feature that lets you give special attention to dried stains or fresh spills, driving slower over them and taking multiple passes. It did a fine job cleaning ketchup I squirted all over the ground and took care of a crusty stain I found under my kitchen trash can. But don't expect miracles: it didn't make a dent in a mysterious substance stuck to my dining room floor. In the Matic's defense, I'm pretty sure the substance was gum mixed with a bit of paint—did I mention I have a child?—and I couldn't get it up with my manual mop, either.

Matic says one water tank refill is good for about 1,300 square feet of floor. I don't have nearly that much moppable surface in my home—I've got maybe 100–200 square feet—but I'd say it managed close to that across several scheduled and one-off mopping runs during my testing period. You can configure the Matic to go wait by your kitchen sink (or anywhere, really) when it runs out of water, which I find both adorable and convenient. If it takes longer than 15 minutes for someone to help out, the device docks itself, and the app lets you know the thing's thirsty.

Nariyawala told me the company wanted to design something that, if sent back to the 1960s, would be recognizable as a robot designed to vacuum. It's a nice idea and the right instinct. In particular, its height enables those big ol' wheels that make high rugs or the chunky transition between my dining room and kitchen a nonissue. The taller vantage point of its sensors both keeps them clean longer and gives the robot more information about the stuff it sees on the ground. Those are all intentional parts of its design, Nariyawala said.

But those unorthodox design choices do have their shortcomings. Primarily, the Matic's height means it may not go under furniture that's less than 12 inches off the ground, a big limitation compared to most puck-shaped robots. Mostly, that means it's not cleaning under my couches and chairs as most others can. (Although, it did start going under one of my dining room chairs that's only slightly higher its top following a software update near the end of this review.) I actually think that's a fine trade-off, considering how well it cleans everywhere else. The other thing is that without that tried-and-true circular shape, its boxy body can't spin freely to pick up dirt in very tight spaces. For instance, the Matic won't even attempt to clean a small nook next to my fridge that my circular robot vacuums handle just fine. It fits, but barely—I suspect its reticence to even try is part of its aversion to touching walls and furniture.

As much as I like the Matic app, its cleaning history section could also give a bit more information than it does. The device stopped mid-clean on a couple of occasions, and I didn't see specific reasons why. In one of those cases, my partner found a blob of yarn sitting just in front of the Matic, keeping it from leaving its dock, where it had presumably stopped to recharge mid-clean before continuing. The app's cleaning history said it hadn't cleaned all of the rooms but didn't clarify the reason; my Roomba J7's cleaning history might've informed me that the device had stopped cleaning because it was stuck. Another time, I found the Matic sitting still in the middle of my dining room, its display reading “Paused.” I knew I hadn't paused it, and everyone besides my cat had been asleep when it started cleaning, so a few more details about the proceedings up to that point would've helped me figure out if I needed to report a software bug (or just scold my cat.)

The Matic also lacks any sort of smart home integration. Nariyawala told me that the company is looking into implementing that down the road, but admitted that doing so is “at the bottom of the list.” That mainly means no voice control and no access to automations that could incorporate your other smart home devices like, say, turning the lights off when the Matic finishes its job (although it does a fine job cleaning in the dark). Still, the Matic robot vacuum and its app are so good—and Matter's vacuum support so limited besides—that it doesn't feel like smart home integration would add much anyway.

The biggest caveat, to me, is the Matic's ongoing costs, particularly those of its disposable dust bags. I do like the convenience of its 1-liter onboard one, which holds both wet and dry material and has a built-in HEPA filter. That's more than twice the capacity of my Roomba's plastic dustbin. But a four-pack of these also costs $12 (and a 12-pack is $36). The company says one bag should last about a week, depending on your usage, which was roughly what I got out of it while cleaning around 900 square feet of my main floor every night. Going through a four-pack every month costs basically as much as an ad-supported streaming plan, and comes on top of the less-frequent replacement of other wearable parts, like the mop, dust rollers and side brush. That's to say nothing of how much it costs just to buy the thing.

By comparison, a three-pack of 3-liter dustbags for the Eufy Omni E28 costs just $16.99. That's an expensive robot when bought at its street price of $1,399.99, but as I write this, Eufy is discounting it by $649.99, making it more affordable than the $1,095 Matic.

Whether the Matic is a better buy may come down, at that point, to vibes. The Omni E28 might clean just as well as the Matic; I haven't tested it, so I can't say. But thanks to its heavily automated multipurpose dock, it takes up a lot more space and is likely to be a much noisier presence in your home. The Matic, on the other hand, is easy to place, works very well, and is quiet enough that I'm hardly aware it's even working if we're not in the same room.

The Matic is the best robot vacuum I've ever used. Its friendly-looking chassis and vibe are enough of a hit in my house that my kid now keeps a clean bedroom floor just so the Matic can come in and vacuum it every night before bedtime. To me, that alone is almost worth the $1,095 price tag.

For others who are willing to fork over that amount of money, the Matic offers top-tier carpet cleaning, solid mopping performance, and an uncommonly well-thought-out app. I'm willing to clean up under low furniture myself if I have a robot that does such a great job everywhere else.

There's also the fact that, at least according to Nariyawala, when we spoke, the Matic is engineered for longevity and privacy. Build quality is solid, and the fact that it doesn't need an internet connection to do its job is a huge asset. One of my biggest criticisms of robot vacuums has always been that most of them require the internet to get the full experience, and Matic has shown that's not necessary: your robot can work great without Wi-Fi if you're okay with the range and speed limits of a Bluetooth connection.

But it's the elements of surprise and delight that really push the Matic robot vacuum over the top. I haven't found a gadget this endearing in a long time. Matic approaches home robotics in a way that others have recognized is necessary—see Samsung's Ballie, or that Apple Pixar-style robotic lamp research project—but which I'm not convinced anyone has really nailed. I went into this review curious, above all else, how an all-on-device robot vacuum with a funny design would work, and I was surprised to find something legitimately and unabashedly fun. More of that, please.

T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost.

See iPhone 17 at T-Mobile

Trade in any smartphone in any condition and claim an iPhone 17 Pro without spending a dime. New customers joining the Experience More or Experience Beyond plans don't even need a trade-in to secure a standard iPhone 17. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17.

This isn't a limited-time offer gimmick meant only to pull in a few customers before reverting back to stealth mode: T-Mobile's got the infrastructure and faith backing such aggressive promotions because they run the fastest network in America, according to Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence data. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device.

T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The company has also optimized its integration with iOS, making these iPhone 17 promotions a natural extension of their network strategy rather than a desperate attempt to attract subscribers.

The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.

After surging back to life in 2023 with Evil Dead Rise, the horror franchise is back with Evil Dead Burn.

The 2026-bound film recently wrapped filming, prompting director Sébastien Vaniček to release a short teaser for the film. In it, one of the actors is slamming a bloody metal object down on…something, or someone. Whatever's getting the business end of that attack, it takes a lot of slams before it goes down for good, and the screen cuts to black after a few hits so you're left with the character's screams and the makeshift weapon repeatedly hitting the ground.

Details on the plot of Evil Dead Burn are under wraps, save for it being an unconnected spinoff to Rise. Our new set of unnamed characters are played by Souheila Yacoub (Dune: Part Two), Hunter Doohan (Daredevil: Born Again), Luciane Buchanan (Chief of War), and Tandi Wright (Pearl). In 2024, Vaniček teased to French outlet Konbini he wanted to make a “nasty movie, a film that hurts. […] I'm going to put all the horror I have inside, [and] it'll be cathartic.”

Evil Dead Burn will hit theaters on July 24, 2026. After Burn comes another Evil film, this one written and directed by Francis Galluppi.

If you've been eyeing Govee's popular floor lamps but want something more compact for your desk or nightstand, you're in luck. The brand has become a go-to for smart lighting that actually creates atmosphere without looking tacky or overdone: Their table lamps deliver that same quality vibe in a smaller package, and right now, the Govee RGBIC Smart Table Lamp 2 has dropped to an all-time low of just $63 on Amazon, down from $79.

See at Amazon

One of the biggest improvements here is Matter compatibility which surprisingly makes a big impact if you've had issues with smart home systems in the past. Rather than being tied to one ecosystem, this lamp plays nice with Alexa, Google Home, and even Apple HomeKit via Matter. You can use it with whichever voice assistant you end up liking best, and the installation is actually pretty easy. No more app hopping and trying to find devices that don't wish to communicate with one another. Plug it in and you're set on all your platforms.

The RGBIC technology is where this lamp shines: Unlike lower-end RGB lamps that only display a single color at a time, the RGBIC system displays multiple colors simultaneously in various locations on the lamp. You get 500 lumens of light which is far brighter than previous Govee table lamps and plenty for reading or working. The color temperature is also adjustable between 2700K and 6500K so you can have warm lighting in the evening or cool, bright white light when you are trying to focus during the day.

Govee had 64 preloaded scene modes including holiday settings like Valentine's Day and eight music sync modes that pulse in beat to your rhythm. When you've got guests visiting or you simply want to establish a mood, these scenes work for you. It's with the DIY mode, though, that things get thrilling. You can create your own lighting effects within the app, save them out, and even share them with friends. Children can mess around with colors and designs, and adults can create individual looks for parties or holidays.

The Pat-to-Wake feature is one of those little details that really does make a big difference in the evenings. Rather than feeling around for your phone or switch in the dark, you simply tap the lamp once to be able to see. You do need to set up the Bedtime Switch under the app first, and it only turns on the lamp (and not off), but it's such a convenience when you're waking up at 3 AM and you need some light but don't want to burn yourself.

Timer and scheduling functionality provide functional applications in addition to the flashy light effects: Schedule the lamp to come on gradually in the morning as a wake-up light, or have it turn off automatically once you're asleep. All of these things make the lamp less of an appliance that you need to struggle with and more something that is integrated into your daily life.

For $63, this lamp receives an awful lot of functionality in the deal. The corded model is fantastic because it eliminates the worry about battery life, and the construction seems sturdy enough to survive. If you've ever wondered about smart lights but didn't feel like dropping money on pricey Philips Hue systems, this Govee lamp is the excellent gateway that doesn't sacrifice much in the feature arena.

The camera equipment fared far better.

The final report from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding the implosion of the OceanGate Titan submersible in 2023 has now been published (h/t Scott Manley on YouTube). Earlier this week, we were surprised to see the tragic Titan submersible's $62 SanDisk memory card found undamaged at the wreckage site. However, Docket #60 (PDF) of the final report shows that the computer equipment was far more severely damaged in the implosion. Specifically, the onboard trio of Nuvo-5000LP series fan-less PCs, for example, are almost unrecognizable in a “Large Electronic and Metal Mass.”

 




Above we can just about see some remnants of the red metal plating and cooling fins from the fanless Nuvo PC chassis.

According to the report, the above clump of electronic materials and their supporting structure(s) weighs approximately 100 pounds (~45kg). This used to be three Nuvo-5000LP series fan-less PCs that acted as the submersible's mission computer. The OceanGate Titan computer system was used to log vessel performance as well as acoustic hull monitoring and other diagnostic information.

Page four of report Docket #60 shows a smaller, compressed mass of electronics. While some fabric or carpet seems to be visible in this lump, we are assured that “no human remains were externally visible anywhere on the mass.”

Due to the extremely compressed, tangled nature of these two large remnants, the investigators decided to use computed tomography (CT) scans as a first step. They reasoned that “If the compressed memory components could be imaged in the CT scan, then a pathway could be established that provided a route for using destructive tools that could reach and extract the memory components.”

Of course, the thrust of the investigation was still to find out more about the Titan's succumbing to the immense pressures it was under. So, they looked for ‘survivable space' in the scans, where an SSD PCB could potentially survive intact.

Unfortunately, the third-party lab's 320 kilovolts (kV) CT scanner couldn't penetrate deep enough to find any ‘survivable void' spaces, and no memory devices could be identified. The investigators ruled out using more powerful CT scanners as they thought the extra power could actually “damage data stored on any surviving NVM chips.”

Eventually, the large mass was passed onto the Fire Research Laboratory (FRL) at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), notes the report. Eventually, the ATF extracted the two PCBs pictured below, thought to have come from a pair of 2.5-inch SSDs.

 




By the time of the source report's publication, all data recovery efforts have been unsuccessful. It is explained that both PCBs saw deformations across three axes, and three BGA NVM chips were missing from each of the PCBs. Moreover, the remaining flash memory chips showed signs of cracks and distortion.

Finally, no data was forthcoming from similar investigations into the smaller electronics mass. Looking for storage components among electronics parts collected into Box One and Box 2, was also fruitless.

Safety measures became an insurmountable barrier.

Microsoft introduced BitLocker storage encryption to Windows Vista in 2007. It was initially limited to only the Enterprise and Ultimate editions at the time, but since then, BitLocker has become an integral part of the operating system. Starting with Windows 11, BitLocker is turned on by default when you sign in with a Microsoft account in the OOBE. In theory, this is a novel practice — encrypting your storage without manual interception, but it can easily lead to unwanted problems.

That's what happened to an unfortunate user on Reddit, who was locked out of their data that vanished into the binary mazes of encryption, seemingly forever.

Feeling that their PC was lagging and not working to its fullest potential, u/Toast_Soup (let's call them Soup) decided to reset their PC and install a fresh copy of Windows. It's important to note at this point that Soup had six drives in its system; one of which is the boot drive, of course, and two massive data backups, each worth three terabytes, on the D: and E: disks. After the reinstall, when Soup booted into Windows, the latter two drives were essentially gone, encrypted by BitLocker, despite it never having been turned on in the first place.

See, Soup wasn't aware of the automatic encryption Microsoft enforces these days, so the thought to check first never even crossed their mind. Windows kept asking for a key that Soup never noted down (or even knew existed, for that matter), and without it, the drives are encrypted forever. There's no way to retrieve any data through recovery software — which Soup tried many of — because they can't break the BitLocker encryption. Its entire point is to act as a safeguard against bad actors, so as far as the drives are concerned, you're just trying to steal the data stored inside.

Lost and feeling hopeless, Soup performed another fresh reinstall, but to no avail, as the BitLocker screen appeared again, requesting a new key for the boot drive. Thankfully, Soup was aware of the game by now and knew to jot down that one, so they got inside Windows, but the two earlier drives were still locked. The comments on the post attempted to help our victim, suggesting that they check their Microsoft account settings. However, Soup clarified that only the key for the boot drive (C:) appears there, and nothing else.

 




The best part is that this isn't even the extent of BitLocker's overreach. While nothing quite beats getting permanently (we hope not) locked out of your own data, a couple of years ago, we found out that BitLocker is surprisingly resource-intensive as well. In our testing, it slowed down random read/write speeds of the affected SSDs by up to 45% because it forces your CPU to encrypt and decrypt every single thing. This can genuinely slow down performance and make your PC feel sluggish, which is likely what Soup was experiencing in the first place. The signs were all there.

It's important to note that the software version of BitLocker that runs on your CPU differs from the hardware version (called ""OPAL""). That runs even better than no drive encryption at all, but it's not the one that automatically turns itself on. Some comments from the Reddit thread suggest that even with a local account on Windows 11 Home, changes as small as tweaking the boot order can trigger BitLocker — if it isn't already enabled when you first set up your OS.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

BitLocker doesn't behave like this on Windows 10, or if you upgraded directly from that to 11. But, at this point, for Soup, there's nothing else that can be done beyond wiping those drives and starting over. We suggest staying vigilant in matters like these, where unwieldy corporations take away your autonomy to exercise what they feel is right. Check and turn off BitLocker following our original guide. Make sure to note down any important keys, and always keep backups of sensitive data that you can't afford to lose.

Or enjoy the vinegar odor, because you like marinated pickles, and pitting because you like ant videos.

Some thermal pastes are good for air cooling, others for liquid cooling, some are generally efficient, others are not. But as our colleague Igor Wallosek discovered, there is a thermal paste that stinks and damages coolers. That thermal paste — Amech (Aimac) SGT-4 made in South Korea — appears to be quite popular in online stores around the world because it is cheap and gets favorable user reviews. Yet, SGT-4 appears to be a chemically reactive blend that stinks due to acidic vapors, permanently damages CPUs and coolers with pitting from corrosion, and causes coolers to glue to the chip. The TIM also doesn't meet its thermal ratings due to the pitting.

SGT-4 (not among the best thermal greases that Tom's Hardware has tested) is based on PMDS; however, chemical testing and user evidence indicate that it is not a standard silicone-based thermal paste, as it adds a reactive acetoxy-curing RTV silicone, a substance that seems to release acetic acid when it contacts moisture, based on Igor's findings. This additive — likely methyltriacetoxysilane, according to Igor's Lab — was apparently used to make the grease cohesive and adhesive when applied at thin bond lines, but its reaction produces acidic vapors that cause metal oxidation and the smell of vinegar. 

During operation, the acetic acid gradually corrodes copper surfaces, causes pitting and discoloration, and glues surfaces together, according to both Igor and his readers. Although the substance glues the cooler to the CPU, Igor Lab's measurements found that thermal conductivity was far below the manufacturer's claims, probably due to pitting (called 'ant nest corrosion') caused by the acid. Normally, thermal greases are applied to fill in the imperfections of the surfaces of the cooler and the cooled system, thus enhancing cooling performance. This appears not to be the case with the SGT-4, as instead of filling the voids, it creates new ones.

Community posts on Quasarzone — a South Korean website — confirm a host of problems, such as erased CPU markings, copper discoloration, and pitting on copper. Despite the fact that Amech prefers to be an incognito 'brand' with no website, users from South Korea have found a way to contact it. 

The manufacturer's reaction was not exactly supportive: instead of addressing the evidence, Amech representatives issued personal insults, dismissed the findings as baseless, and insisted the product complied with RoHS and REACH environmental standards that prove that the grease does not contain any hazardous substances. Meanwhile, such certifications are irrelevant to metal reactivity or being precursors of hazardous substances, especially under normal usage conditions.

To make matters even worse, the Amech reps repeatedly referred to Igor's unveilings as 'a person from Germany' to discredit the source while avoiding any technical rebuttal. They have never disclosed the paste's composition either. As a result, by mid-October, trust in the company had collapsed completely among the community.

Can artificial sweeteners actually be harmful to health? And can consuming them on the regular affect our memory and thinking skills? Although a new link found between sugar alternatives and brain aging requires more study, it may warrant some concern. MNT speaks to a physician and researcher to dive deeper into the matter and discuss In Conversation

Artificial sweeteners come in many different names and forms — as liquids or powders, as sucralose, erythritol, aspartame, and more. They are consumed by millions of people around the world, and especially by people with diabetes.

The main reason behind the recommendation for people with diabetes to swap sugar for sugar alternatives is that the latter are believed to cause fewer blood sugar spikes.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved several artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame, as well as sugar alcohols like xylitol and erythritol, and plant-based sugar substitutes like stevia and monk fruit, as safe for consumption.

However, in recent years, more and more research has emerged about the possible long-term health effects of consuming sugar alternatives.

The most recent one was a study published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, which found that the sweeteners — aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame-K, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, and tagatose — were linked to declines in memory and overall thinking skills that were equivalent to about 1.6 years of brain aging.

Such research has stirred controversy and concern among the public, but does this mean people should stop consuming artificial sweeteners altogether? And what other possible effects could they have on health?

To discuss this and more, Claudia Suemoto, MD, PhD, senior author of the Neurology study, joined Medical News Today editors Yasemin Nicola Sakay and Maria Cohut on this episode of In Conversation, looking at artificial sweeteners' effects on health, particularly the brain.

Suemoto is a physician and assistant professor of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School, where she is also an epidemiologist focused on dementia research and brain aging.

She is also currently one of the coordinators of the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group — the largest brain bank in Latin America. In 2016, she was awarded the L'Oreal UNESCO For Women in Science in Brazil.

Results from a trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center showed that a targeted therapy combination improved outcomes for patients with metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) – a type of kidney cancer – whose disease progressed following immunotherapy.

Data from the LenCabo Phase II trial were presented today by Andrew W. Hahn, M.D., assistant professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2025 (Abstract LBA94).

The randomized study found that patients whose disease got worse after immunotherapy and who were treated with the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus lived longer without disease progression compared to those who received cabozantinib.

""This is the first randomized trial to directly compare these two commonly used second-line treatments,"" Hahn said. ""These findings offer insights into treatment sequencing and the importance of generating head-to-head data to guide clinical decisions.""

The trial enrolled 90 patients with metastatic or advanced ccRCC or RCC who had previously received one or two treatments, including at least one immunotherapy targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.

Of those treated with lenvatinib and everolimus, 62.5% saw cancer progression in comparison to 76% of those who received cabozantinib. Those treated with lenvatinib plus everolimus had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 15.7 months compared to 10.2 months for those receiving cabozantinib.

Current first-line treatment for patients with metastatic ccRCC consists of immune checkpoint inhibitors, sometimes combined with targeted therapies. If the cancer stops responding to these treatments, the next treatment options include lenvatinib and everolimus, or cabozantinib.

This trial was designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of second-line therapies to identify the regimen that provides longer PFS and improved patient outcomes.

The findings suggest that lenvatinib plus everolimus may offer a more meaningful benefit as second-line treatment and may guide future treatment selection for patients in need.

A multicenter Phase II clinical trial led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center demonstrated significant tumor shrinkage and disease control in patients with advanced pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), two rare and potentially life-threatening neuroendocrine tumors.

The results of this study, led by Camilo Jimenez, M.D., professor of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented concurrently at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress (Abstract 1705O).

The trial demonstrated that the HIF-2α inhibitor belzutifan showed meaningful antitumor activity with a 26% objective response rate, a significant achievement particularly for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers. These effects lasted an average of more than 20 months, indicating a sustained clinical benefit for those who responded to treatment.

It's notable that nearly one-third of patients (32%) who were taking blood pressure medication were able to reduce their dosage by half for at least six months. This is an important finding, as PPGL tumors often produce excess hormones that raise blood pressure. These results suggest that belzutifan may have also helped manage symptoms related to hormone-secreting tumors.

The primary significance of this study is demonstrating that HIF-2α inhibition with belzutifan can achieve meaningful clinical benefit in patients with advanced, progressive PPGL. In a population with no remaining standard-of-care options, we observed durable disease control and a manageable safety profile, supporting the rationale for HIF-2α as a therapeutic target in this rare tumor type.""

Camilo Jimenez, M.D., Professor of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are difficult-to-treat cancers that affect roughly 2,000 people annually in the U.S. One of the main drivers of tumor growth in PPGL is the HIF-2α protein. In healthy cells this protein adjusts to changes in oxygen levels, but genetic mutations or changes in cell metabolism can cause HIF-2α to become abnormally active, triggering signals that help the tumor grow and spread.

HIF-2α inhibitors, such as belzutifan, have been successful in shrinking tumors and slowing disease progression in other cancers driven by HIF-2α overactivity, such as kidney cancer and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Building on this knowledge, researchers evaluated the effectiveness of these inhibitors in patients with advanced PPGL.

On the LITESPARK-015 Phase II trial, 72 patients with locally advanced, metastatic, unresectable PPGL who had exhausted all other standard-of-care treatment, were treated with belzutifan.

In May 2025, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved belzutifan for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients ages 12 years and older with advanced, unresectable, or metastatic PPGL who do not require immediate surgery. Belzutifan is the first oral and only approved therapy for this disease, making it a new standard of care for this patient population. 

""The approval of belzutifan offers new hope. As an oral treatment, it has been shown to shrink tumors, reduce symptoms, and improve quality of life with low toxicity. It represents a meaningful step forward in care for people living with these rare cancers,"" Jimenez said.

2025 – FDA approves belzutifan for treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with PPGL

2023 – FDA approves belzutifan for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after treatment with a PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitor and a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF‑TKI)

2021 - FDA approves belzutifan for adults with von Hippel‑Lindau (VHL) disease who require treatment for associated tumors (RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors), when surgery is not immediately necessary

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Children with multiple long-term conditions face nearly threefold higher COVID-19 mortality","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251018/Children-with-multiple-long-term-conditions-face-nearly-threefold-higher-COVID-19-mortality.aspx","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 02:08:00 GMT","

Individuals with multiple long-term conditions are two and a half times more likely to die following COVID-19 infection than others. When children were assessed separately the risk for mortality among those with multiple long-term conditions increased to almost three times (2.8) the risk of those without. The mortality rates are 22% and 8% respectively. 

That is according to an authoritative systematic review and meta-analysis of over four million patients with COVID-19 published today (Thursday 17 October) in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. 

The authors are calling for patients with multiple long-term conditions to be prioritised in healthcare policies. 

This systematic review is believed to have considered the largest ever cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a study investigating the impact of multiple long-term conditions. The review synthesised evidence from 111 observational studies of patients with confirmed COVID-19 published between January 2020 and May 2023. These studies were conducted across 51 countries and most involved high risk or hospitalized patient cohorts with COVID-19, which could account for the high rates of mortality found in the study.

This major study thus provides an updated picture of the impact of COVID-19 for people with multiple long-term conditions.

While previous research has identified risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease - such as older age, male sex, socioeconomic deprivation, being from an ethnic minority background and having a pre-existing condition - there has been limited research into, or reporting of, the outcomes for patients with multiple long-term conditions. The authors say this should be a matter of growing concern as a third of adults globally - and more than a quarter in England - have two or more long-term health conditions.

This major review found that following COVID-19 infection, and relative to people with a single or no long-term condition, patients with multiple long-term conditions have:

Dr. Shukrat Salisu-Olatunji, a PhD student at the University of Leicester and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration (ARC) East Midlands, was the lead author of the study. She said:

""Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that there is a significantly higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes for people living with multiple long-term conditions, compared with those without. Furthermore, relative to those without pre-existing long-term conditions, children and young people with multiple long-term conditions experienced more adverse COVID-19 outcomes. This may suggest that increased vulnerabilities could be associated more with the extremes of age rather than simply older age, as has been previously reported.

""We hope that health policies will prioritise people with multiple long-term conditions, especially in times of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.""

This study puts into the spotlight the high risk of poorer outcomes for people with multiple long-term conditions. This systematic review is timely as the publication of the recent NHS Darzi Review highlights the biggest challenge facing the nation as the ageing population, who are living longer often in ill-health with multiple long-term conditions.""

Every day, your brain makes thousands of decisions under uncertainty. Most of the time, you guess right. When you don't, you learn. But when the brain's ability to judge context or assign meaning falters, thoughts and behavior can go astray. In psychiatric disorders ranging from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to schizophrenia, the brain may misjudge how much evidence to gather before acting-or fail to adjust when the rules of the world change based on new information. 

Uncertainty is built into the brain's wiring. Picture groups of neurons casting votes-some optimistic, some pessimistic. Your decisions reflect the average."" When that balance skews, the brain can misread the world: assigning too much meaning to random events, as in schizophrenia, or becoming stuck in rigid patterns, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Understanding those misfires has long challenged scientists. The brain speaks the language of single neurons. But fMRI-the tool we use to study brain activity in people-tracks blood flow, not the electrical chatter of individual brain cells.""

Michael Halassa, professor of neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine

Bridging that gap means combining insights from single-cell studies in animals, human brain imaging, and behavior. Now, a new kind of computer model-grounded in real biology-lets researchers simulate how brain circuits make decisions and adapt when the rules change.

Called CogLinks, the model builds biological realism into its design, mirroring how real brain cells are connected and coding for how they assign value to often ambiguous and incomplete observations about the external environment. Unlike many artificial intelligence systems that act like ""black boxes,"" CogLinks shows researchers exactly how its virtual neurons link structure to function. As a result, scientists can map how this virtual brain learns from experience and pivots based on new information. 

In a study published October 16 in Nature Communications, senior author Halassa and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used CogLinks to explore how brain circuits coordinate flexible thinking. Like a flight simulator for the brain, CogLinks let the researchers test what happens when key decision-making circuits go off course. When they weakened the virtual connection between two simulated brain regions-the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal thalamus-the system defaulted to slower, habit-driven learning. That result suggests this pathway is essential for adaptability. 

To see if those predictions held true in people, the team then conducted a companion fMRI study, which was supervised by both Burkhard Pleger from the Ruhr-University Bochum and Halassa. Volunteers played a game in which the rules unexpectedly changed. As expected, the prefrontal cortex handled planning and the deep, central region of the brain known as the striatum guided habits-but the mediodorsal thalamus lit up when players realized the rules had shifted and adjusted their strategy. 

The imaging confirmed what the model had forecast: the mediodorsal thalamus acts as a switchboard linking the brain's two main learning systems-flexible and habitual-helping the brain infer when context has changed and switch strategies accordingly. 

Halassa hopes the research helps lay the groundwork for a new kind of ""algorithmic psychiatry,"" in which computer models help reveal how mental illness emerges from changes in brain circuits, identifying biological markers to precisely target treatments. 

""One of the big questions in psychiatry is how to connect what we know about genetics to cognitive symptoms,"" says Mien Brabeeba Wang, the lead author of the CogLinks study, a co-author of the fMRI study, and an MIT doctoral student in Halassa's lab. 

""Many schizophrenia-linked mutations affect chemical receptors found throughout the brain,"" says Wang. ""Future uses of CogLinks may help us see how those widespread molecular changes could make it harder for the brain to organize information for flexible thinking."" 

Research reported in the CogLinks study was supported by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Mental Health under grants P50MH132642, R01MH134466, and R01MH120118 and by the National Science Foundation under grants CCR-2139936, CCR-2003830, and CCF-1810758. Bin A. Wang of South China Normal University served as lead author on the fMRI study. The fMRI study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research Center for Brain Cognition and Human Development, Guandong, China; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation); and the FoRUM grant.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New antibody drug conjugates can transform early HER2-positive breast cancer treatment","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251018/New-antibody-drug-conjugates-can-transform-early-HER2-positive-breast-cancer-treatment.aspx","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 01:49:00 GMT","

In a landmark moment at the ESMO Congress 2025, pivotal studies have unveiled compelling evidence that a new class of anti-cancer agents-antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)-can dramatically improve outcomes for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. 

The results from the phase III DESTINY-Breast05 and DESTINY-Breast11 trials, presented in a Presidential Symposium, mark a paradigm shift in breast cancer treatment, positioning ADCs not only as powerful therapeutic agents when the disease has already progressed but also as potential new standards of care in patients with early disease.  

There is a particular need for therapies to ensure patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer achieve pathological complete response following neoadjuvant therapies-i.e., delivered before surgery-, and a high unmet need to treat residual disease in those who do not, to prevent the development of metastasis.""

Dr. Evandro de Azambuja from the Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium

Currently, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is the only ADC approved for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who show residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant therapy and are at a high risk of recurrence. In the DESTINY-Breast05, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a new-generation ADC delivering a topoisomerase I inhibitor, showed to improve invasive disease-free survival and disease-free survival by 53% compared with T-DM1 (for both: hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34–0.66; p<0.0001). Also, T-DXd confirmed its high brain activity, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in brain metastasis-free interval over T-DM1 (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.35–1.17). 

""The generally manageable safety profile and the superior efficacy data suggest that T-DXd should replace T-DM1 as the new standard of care for patients with HER2-positive, residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy,"" notes de Azambuja. 

The use of T-DXd also showed impressive findings earlier in the treatment pathway- before surgery- as reported in the DESTINY-Breast11 trial where 927 untreated patients with high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer received either the ADC followed by standard HER2-targeted therapy (THP) or the conventional anthracycline-based regimen (ddAC-THP). The cycles of T-DXd, sequenced with THP, led to a significant increase in the rate of pathological complete response at surgery (67.3% versus 56.3%; p=0.003). ""The T-DXd regimen has also the added advantage of an improved safety profile compared with the anthracycline-containing regimen,"" comments de Azambuja noting the relevant reduction in cardiac toxicities which was observed with the ADC compared with the conventional treatment. 

""In conjunction, these two studies establish T-DXd as a critical treatment option for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, ultimately providing a new tool for treatment tailoring for what was once considered the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and which today represents the one with the highest chance of cure,"" highlights Dr Paolo Tarantino from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 

After having reshaped the treatment of multiple types of metastatic cancers over the last few years, novel ADCs such as T-DXd are now ""raising the bar"" in the curative setting due to innovations in their design and mechanism of action. However, their use presents new challenges that need to be addressed. ""For instance, 

toxicity profiles must be carefully defined and substantial effort to prevent permanent or fatal toxicities is required. Dosing, duration and sequencing of ADCs must also be optimised to achieve maximal efficacy with the least side-effects, and equally critical is the identification of predictive biomarkers that may allow better tailoring of ADC therapy and minimise overtreatment,"" clarifies Tarantino. 

The presentation of the DESTINY-Breast05 and DESTINY-Breast11 trials results at the ESMO Congress 2025 cements the event's role as a catalyst for global oncology progress. With ADCs now demonstrating superiority in both pre- and post-surgical settings, the oncology community stands at the threshold of a new chapter-one defined by smarter targeting, earlier intervention and deeper biological understanding. 

""Besides the immediate practical impact, in fact, data presented today are expected to have a broader impact on the future of ADC research, marking the formal entrance of the new generation of drugs in the curative arena. This is a therapeutic strategy with tremendous potential, which we are only just starting to unleash, promising to reduce rates of recurrence and improve survival across multiple cancers in the years to come,"" concludes Tarantino.

The Latest | Oct 19, 2025

The United States Women's National Team (USWNT) has called up Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta for the upcoming FIFA international window, U.S. Soccer announced on Sunday. LaBonta will replace Seattle Reign FC midfielder Sam Meza, who was ruled out of the roster due to a minor injury. The USWNT announced its initial 26-player roster on Oct. 15. 

This is the second U.S. National Team call-up in LaBonta's career, the first which came earlier this year.  

LaBonta will join three Kansas City teammates – forward Michelle Cooper,  

midfielder Claire Hutton and forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor – for the October training camp. Now with four, the Current is tied with Gotham FC for the most players on this USWNT roster among all National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) teams. 

The USWNT begins the upcoming FIFA window with two matches against Portugal. The first match, presented by AT&T, will take place on Thursday, Oct. 23, at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa., with kickoff set for 6 p.m. CT. The U.S. and Portugal will meet again in East Hartford, Conn., on Sunday, Oct. 26, at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field. That friendly, presented by Volkswagen, starts at 3 p.m. CT. Both contests will broadcast on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English; on Peacock in Spanish; and on the radio on Westwood One Sports. The first match will also air on Peacock in Spanish and FDP Spanish Radio while the second will be available in Spanish on Universo.  

The Stars and Stripes conclude their three-match set against New Zealand in Kansas City on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 7 p.m. CT. It marks the USWNT's first-ever match at CPKC Stadium, the first stadium purpose-built for a professional women's sports team. The match will broadcast on TNT, TruTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish, and on the radio on Westwood One Sports and FDP Spanish Radio. Limited tickets are available for purchase HERE. 

LaBonta's first appearance for the Stars and Stripes was on May 31 when she came on as a substitute in the 70th minute, helping the team to a 3-0 win against China PR. She became the oldest player to debut for the USWNT in the program's 40-year history at 32 years old. She then subbed in during the 58th minute in a 4-0 shutout over Jamaica on June 3.  

The Kansas City captain has anchored the club during its record-breaking 2025 campaign, helping lead the Current to their first NWSL Shield in franchise history. LaBonta solidified herself as one of the league's all-time greats from the penalty spot on Sept. 26, 2025, when she converted her 14th career regular season PK. That moved her up to be tied with Megan Rapinoe and Marta for first in NWSL history for most regular season PKs. All five of her goals this year have been from the penalty spot, and she has also added one assist. LaBonta has twice been named to the NWSL Best XI this year and her 10 career monthly Best XI honors rank third all-time.

 KC Current

Claire Hutton and Ally Sentnor don't need words to communicate. They just connect.

The 19-year-old defensive midfielder and the 21-year-old forward for the Kansas City Current and the U.S. women's national team have been inseparable ever since they met at a youth soccer camp in 2022 at the University of North Carolina. Hutton was a high-school junior committed to UNC, and Sentnor was a sophomore playing for the 23-time NCAA Champion Tar Heels. But to Hutton, she was already, “OMG, that's Ally Sentnor.”

Advertisement

Now, four years later, they're finally neighbors, living two doors apart in Kansas City. The joy is written all over their faces as they talk to The Athletic over Zoom.

They finish each other's sentences, breaking into laughter, their chemistry radiating through the screen. What began as a shared passion at a college training camp has evolved into a bond strengthened by shared milestones, most recently, Sentnor's blockbuster trade from the Utah Royals to the Current in August, a move that turned their long-distance friendship into an everyday sisterhood.

They say they are kindred spirits.

“We always knew of each other, but it wasn't until we started going to youth camps with each other that we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, we're so similar!'” Sentnor told The Athletic as they recalled their first real in-person meeting at UNC's Chapel Hill campus.

“I just knew I was going to be friends with her. It didn't take long for me to trust her. I knew she was my friend,” Hutton recalled.

Until recently, most of their friendship unfolded miles apart.

Upon graduating early from high school in the summer of 2023, Hutton trained with an array of NWSL teams and eventually chose to forgo her collegiate career at UNC, signing a three-year contract with the Kansas City Current that December.

Sentnor left college early after two consecutive NCAA tournament runs but continued her studies online to complete her degree. She was the top pick in the 2024 NWSL draft and joined the Royals. After a strong rookie season, she was traded to the Current in a record-breaking deal this summer. Hutton was eager for the trade to happen if it meant seeing her friend, and tried very hard not to jinx it.

“At one point, I stopped texting Claire because if I got her hopes up and the trade fell through, I'd be the worst friend,” Sentnor recalled the months leading up to her arrival at the Current. “I told her, ‘I'll let you know when it's done.'”

They kept their weekly calls carefully scripted so that Hutton's first question wasn't “Is it done?” They started with what was for dinner, then maybe circle back. When it landed, the off-field fit was instant.

On the field, their connection leaves no space for words.

“I get the ball and I almost always know she'll be in that pocket,” Hutton explained. It's Hutton's shoulder check, her pivot and the lane that opens because Sentnor has already slid into the seam. No wave, no signals. Just the pass and the give-and-go that makes a complex rotation look like muscle memory.

The unspoken sync has yet to result in a goal for the Current, but now they have a chance to do so with the U.S. in this upcoming international window next week.

It will be their tenth camp together.

Their most memorable one was the time when they roomed together at the 2024 Under-20 World Cup in Colombia.

“It's like past lives,” Hutton said. “You don't know why you love that person so much. You just do.”

The 2024 U20 World Cup was filled with drama. The young U.S. team left many games late, scoring winners well after 90 minutes. They finished the tournament with the program's second bronze medal in 20 years (the last coming in 2004 against Thailand).

During the tournament, Hutton took a ball to the head during practice the day before their quarterfinal match against Germany and had to enter concussion protocol, missing the following two games.

Sentnor, who captained the team in her second U20 World Cup, noticed Hutton struggling. Hutton was squinting, typing the wrong words in the text. Sentnor quietly took the reins and took care of her friend.

“She leaned on me with the concussion, but she was my person that I could come back to the room and talk about everything throughout that tournament,” Sentnor recalls. “The responsibility (of being a captain) comes with drama and other things you have to deal with outside of soccer. Claire was my sounding board, which is so incredible because she was one of the youngest players on the team.”

Sentnor has accumulated 12 senior U.S. appearances and scored four goals and two assists. Hutton scored her first international goal for the USWNT on July 2, 2025, against Canada in a friendly match. The goal was a header from a corner kick in the 36th minute that gave the U.S. a 2-0 lead in a game they ultimately won 3-0. It was a pinch-me moment for her.

Still, neither player is under the guise that they are a guarantee for Emma Hayes' rosters for the next two years. The U.S. coach is giving every player a chance and runs training drills that are stripped-down and specific. In a recent camp, Hayes made center-backs repeat a single inside-foot touch around a cone until it was automatic; forwards rehearsed a micro-touch that sets up the next action, Hutton explained.

“You can't just work hard for the month leading up to (the World Cup), it's the day in and day out right now that hopefully can get us selected for that World Cup team,” Sentnor says. “Every camp is a stepping stone, and the chance to represent our country on the biggest stage would be a dream come true.”

For the next three matches against Portugal and New Zealand, Hayes decided to reintegrate seasoned Europe-based players like captain Lindsey Heaps, midfielder Lily Yohannes, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, and forward Alyssa Thompson. But she also did not disguise her delight at what Sentnor brings to the team.

“She provides another option for us on the left-hand side that can tuck in as an extra 10,” she told reporters on Wednesday. “She may have added a little bit more flexibility than some other players in that situation.”

With the nonstop pressure to perform at the top level, Sentnor and Hutton manage to keep their nerves at bay with cooking.

When they are not training, they cook in shifts and share ingredients.

“If I run out of eggs, I've got Claire's eggs,” Sentnor jokes. They're both planners, both tidy and both food people. Hutton is trying to convert Sentnor to spice.

“We started at mild. We'll work to medium,” she said, revealing their shared love for a particular buffalo chicken recipe at the moment. In their free time, they keep a running list of Kansas City restaurants. Post-dinner sweet treats are non-negotiable. Hutton's old superstition, ice cream the day before a match, died after one good game without it. “I guess the new superstition is no ice cream,” she says, unconvinced. But sweet treats will never not have a place in their kitchens.

When they are not cooking together or training, they are working towards their childhood dreams. “One of the reasons we're so close as friends and are able to be such incredible teammates is because we truly want each other to succeed,” Sentnor said. “We want the people around us to succeed.”

Hutton, a native of New York state, got to see the USWNT squad live, in Hartford, Connecticut, when she was a little girl playing soccer for the local Alleycats Soccer Club.

“It was just a friendly, not even a World Cup match, but it was my first ever live soccer game,” Hutton said. “Seeing what these women represent, with all these fans here screaming and being involved in that, getting the signatures after, I feel like it was just that moment for me,” she said.

On Oct. 26, she will take the field in that very same stadium. This time, as the one being celebrated. It's a full-circle moment, ten years in the making.

“We were not around for the 99ers,” Sentnor said with a laugh. Her first jersey was the red and white striped Alex Morgan jersey. She wore the full kit, of course, with shorts and socks, everywhere she went.

“I looked up to those girls and thought they were just untouchable. Like the coolest people ever existed,” she added. The U.S. will honor Morgan ahead of the match on Thursday in Philadelphia. “Now, meeting them and playing with them, I'm like, ‘Wait a second, this is kind of nuts!' I have a picture with you from when I was, like, 12. So it really is crazy.”

For just 19 and 22, they are proud to wear the crest, and they're equally determined to carry forward the work that Morgan's generation once carried. Morgan helped lead the USWNT's historic fight for equal pay and played a key role in the NWSL's collective bargaining negotiations.

Now that they have equal pay secured with a strong CBA in place, Hutton and Sentnor's focus is on making “great” the baseline across the league. The job is not done until every NWSL team can offer the same opportunities as their owners at Kansas City offer, like their own stadium and state-of-the-art training facilities.

“It isn't OK just for one or maybe six clubs doing it; it needs to be done across the whole league,” Hutton says.

“It can be very easy to get caught up in the individual game and the accolades and everything, but the way that Claire and I think about it is that we want everyone to feel a part of it,” Sentnor added. “We want everyone you know to be able to play at the highest level of their game. And it's important to celebrate each other's successes so that we can continue to drive the sport.”

Christen Press, like many in her generation, inspired change both on and off the field

by



As the soccer world prepares to say its goodbyes to Christen Press, it also prepares to say its goodbyes to the end of an era. 





Press' retirement announcement is the latest in a long string, from Carli Lloyd to Alex Morgan, from Sam Mewis and Megan Rapinoe to Tobin Heath. And that's not even the full list. At this point, it's nearly the entirety of the 2015 and 2019 U.S. women's national team World Cup winning squads. The same teams that went on to fight for equal pay and are known best for leaving the game better than they found it in myriad ways. 





Press is no exception. She was part of the Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) league as a member of magicJack, went on to play in Sweden, before returning to Chicago and the National Women's Soccer League, then played a stint with Manchester United in England's Women's Super League, scoring everywhere she went. She returned home in 2022, becoming the first player to sign with Angel City FC, to the delight of fans.

Raul Asencio was perhaps not the best of performers for Real Madrid during the early summer's FIFA Club World Cup tournament.

The young defender simply couldn't get going and was outshone by new signing Dean Huijsen, who has become the club's standout player this season.

His poor FIFA Club World Cup campaign, coupled with a slow start to the season, led many to believe that his days at Santiago Bernabeu could be numbered.

However, it is the injury of the same Huijsen that may have now opened the door for Asencio to once again make a mark at Real Madrid.

As reported by MARCA, the young centre-back is once again starting to win the trust of new coach Xabi Alonso, who has been ruthless at times with his team selection this season.

Once under intense scrutiny, Asencio now reconnected with the traits that first helped him make a mark at the Bernabeu – his speed, decisiveness, and fearless personality on the pitch.

Inside the dressing room, too, Asencio has earned deep respect for his humility and tireless work ethic, qualities that have made him a valued presence among his teammates.

Even after the World Cup setback and despite Dean Huijsen's rise and Militao's return, Asencio refused to let his confidence dip. 

Instead, he channelled his frustration into relentless daily work, staying prepared for when the opportunity came again. He was always ready to come in handy for his team, as evidenced by the number of times the defender operated at right-back.

However, the job is half done so far. WIth Real Madrid considering significant defensive reinforcements in 2026, Asencio must step up his performances even further if he is to retain a starting role in the team for the foreseeable future.

Injuries have not been kind to Eduardo Camavinga in recent times as he was one of the last players to make his debut under Xabi Alonso this season for Real Madrid.

Having suffered an injury against Getafe in April, the player only made it back to the field for an official game in Real Madrid's clash against Espanyol last month. 

Since then, his minutes have been limited and understandably so as the manager has preferred to exercise caution.

Having started and played 75 minutes for France against Iceland in the recent international break, however, Camavinga has shown that he is ready to take up more responsibility and the manager will look to give him more prominence in the coming weeks.

Speaking to TF1 a recent interview, the Real Madrid midfielder was asked if he thought he had what it takes to leave a mark at the club, especially given the sky-high standards and expectations.

The player, unsurprisingly, was confident in his abilities to do the same. During the interview, he said, “Will I make my mark at Real Madrid? Yes, for sure.”

Camavinga went on to describe his experience as a dream realised, emphasising that he has cherished every moment at the club, regardless of the highs and lows that accompanied it.

“I'm living a dream. Not everyone gets the chance to play for the best club in the world. I have to make the most out of it.”

Finally, the Frenchman reiterated that he was happy at the club and that he did not see any reason to think otherwise about his present or future at the Spanish capital.

“I'm very happy at Real Madrid.”

Lastly, there are reports that in order to get a place in France's 2026 World Cup squad, Camavinga's best bet is to make himself available as a left-back. 

While addressing this matter, he clarified, “Are you going to ask me about the left-back? Left-back, no. Midfielder, yes.

Xabi Alonso has opened up on defender Raul Asencio's reliability ahead of Real Madrid's La Liga clash with Getafe. 

“He has a fantastic ability to read the game, is powerful in his duels, and the more effective he is in how he uses those attributes, the better,"" said Alonso. 

""The mistakes that were made at the Club World Cup can happen to anyone, but whenever he's been called upon this season he's shown high levels of performance and he's very reliable. 

""He's had to play a bit out of position at times but he's got that flexibility. He's a competitive guy, he's got that spirit that all the lads who come through the academy have. 

""You can see that, and there's room for improvement. The unease since the World Cup is well in the past now, he's a reliable player and he's very much available.”

                        Morocco's teenage stars will face six-time champions Argentina on Sunday in the final of the under-20 World Cup – with Morocco's team playing against a backdrop of Generation Z-led protests over issues including government spending on sporting events at the expense of public services.         

Issued on: 19/10/2025 - 07:56

As Mohamed Ouahbi's charges prepare for the showdown in the Chilean capital Santiago, the GenZ 212 youth collective continues to stage protests across Morocco, pushing for reforms on education, healthcare and to tackle corruption and a cost of living crisis.

Demonstrators have hit out at the estimated €2 billion cost of revamping stadiums for December's Cup of Nations and the 2030 World Cup, which Morocco is co-hosting with Spain and Portugal.

Morocco Gen Z protesters call for 'peaceful sit-ins' to demand reforms

Morocco's path to the final at the Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Pradano was paved by a penalty shoot-out victory over France. They are only the sixth African side to reach the final since the inaugural tournament in 1977.

The semi-final at the Estadio Elías Figueroa Brander in Valparaíso had finished 1-1 after extra-time on Wednesday.

""We knew it was going to be a difficult match,"" said Ouahbi. ""There were strong moments and weak moments. We managed it well. In the first-half, I thought we were a little too crazy.

""We pressed well, but we had to calm down. We suffered in the second half because we had given so much in the first.""

Argentina saw off Colombia 1-0 on Wednesday night to send its squad to an under-20 World Cup final for the eighth time.

Matteo Silvetti, 19 – an Inter Miami teammate of Lionel Messi, who won the under-20 title with Argentina in 2005 – scored the only goal of the match in the 72nd minute.

""The team went for it and we deserved the victory,"" said Silvetti, who came on as a substitute for Ian Subiabre in the second half of the game. There are no easy opponents but we knew how to play well.""

How football mega tournaments became a lightning rod for Morocco protesters

On Thursday, Messi, who skippered Argentina to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, took to social media to salute the youth team on their achievement, posting: ""Congratulations to everyone. Grande Matteo Silvetti.""

On Sunday, Diego Placente's men will attempt to stop Morocco from joining Ghana's 2009 vintage as the only African teams to brandish the cup.

“It was a very difficult game against Colombia,"" said Placente, who won four trophies including the 2009 Ligue 1 crown during his two years at French outfit Bordeaux.

""We were uneven in terms of individual performances and the first half was really tough for us,"" added the 48-year-old. ""Now we will try to isolate ourselves from everything that is being said so that the pressure of the game does not increase. We must only think about playing.”

Zidane's son describes pride of playing for Algeria in quest for 2026 World Cup

The brainchild of Fifa vice-president Harry Cavan as a showcase for future stars, the tournament began as the Fifa World Youth Championship, with 16 teams in four groups.

In the inaugural competition in Tunisia, after three round robin games, the pool winners advanced to the semi-finals. The Soviet Union emerged with the first title.

Two years later in Japan, still with 16 teams, the top two from each group advanced to the last eight knockout stages. Argentina came away as champions.

In 1997 in Malaysia, the tournament was expanded to 24 teams. The top two from each of the six groups were joined by the four best third-placed teams in the last-16 knockout stages. Argentina took home a third title.

At the 2005 tournament in the Netherlands, a 17-year-old Messi won the golden boot as the most prolific striker and came in ahead of Nigeria's John Obi Mikel and Taye Taiwo as the player of the competition, after Argentina beat Nigeria 2-1 in the final in Utrecht to claim the crown for the fifth time.

Two years later in Canada, despite a new incarnation as the Fifa under-20 World Cup, it was the same old story as Sergio Aguero's six goals fired Argentina to a sixth success.

Argentina and Morocco battle in the 2025 FIFA Under-20 World Cup final on Sunday at the Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos in Chile. 

Argentina are the record winners of the U-20 World Cup, securing six titles previously, but La Albiceleste's young guns haven't tasted glory since their triumph all the way back in 2007. There have been seven different champions since then, but the South Americans will be desperate to bring the title back to Argentina once again. 

They have blitzed their opposition en route to the showpiece event, winning all six of their matches during the group stage and knockout rounds. They have scored 15 and conceded just two at the tournament to date and Diego Placente's side will enter the final brimming with confidence. 

Morocco certainly have the capacity to cause an upset having won all but one of their matches in the competition, although they have endured a rougher route to the final. They have conceded in each of their last five games and required penalties to beat France in the semifinal. Still, Mohamed Ouahbi's men will fancy their chances of springing a surprise. 

Here's Sports Illustrated's guide to the clash.

A post shared by Selección Argentina in English (@afaseleccionen)

Argentina are guaranteed to be without Álvaro Montoro and Valente Pierani, the former missing with a broken collarbone and the latter sustaining a knee injury against Mexico in the quarterfinal. 

La Albiceleste have a host of players already representing top European sides in their ranks, including Bournemouth's Julio Soler, Porto's Tomás Pérez and Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni. 

However, it's Bayer Leverkusen's Alejo Sarco who's most likely to decide Sunday's final, with four goals under his belt already at the tournament. 

Argentina predicted lineup vs. Morocco (5-4-1): Barbi; Gorosito, Ramírez, Pérez, Villalba, Soler; Subiabre, Acuña, Delgado, Prestianni; Sarco. 

A post shared by Équipe du Maroc (@equipedumaroc)

The majority of Morocco's U-20 squad play in Europe, including their top scorer in the competition Yassir Zabiri. The Famalicão striker has scored three times to date, although only once in the knockout stage. 

Dunkerque's Gessime Yassine could be Morocco's biggest threat in the final, with the winger having managed two goals and three assists across six competition appearances. 

Watford winger Othmane Maamma has also had a great tournament, producing a goal and three assists to date. 

Morocco predicted lineup vs. Argentina (4-2-3-1): Benchaouch; Majni, Baouf, Bakhty, Zahouani; Byar, Khalifi; Maamma, Essadak, Yassine; Zabiri. 

Argentina are clear favorites for the final given their superior squad and prior results in the competition, with the stellar defensive record of Placente's side perhaps their greatest asset heading into the final. These fixtures are usually tight affairs and La Albiceleste will likely be able to edge a cagey clash. 

Morocco's array of attacking outlets could cause Argentina's rearguard issues, but they look unlikely to secure a first U-20 World Cup title—even if they have already managed their best ever finish in the competition. 

Prediction: Argentina 2–1 Morocco

Sunday's reports claim that former Tottenham Hotspur hero Son Heung-min is an option for Milan in the winter transfer window, as he is reportedly seeking a David Beckham-style loan deal to help him prepare ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Son left Tottenham after 10 years at the beginning of the summer, and has since joined LAFC in MLS, where he has scored nine goals from his first 10 league outings. 

The MLS season is scheduled differently to the Serie A season. In 2026, the MLS regular season ran from late-February to mid-October, and features a post-season that culminates with the MLS Cup final on December 6. Then, teams will take an extended break for the off-season. 

With the FIFA World Cup coming up in the summer, there have been reports that Son is interested in a loan move back to Europe to help him prepare, as Beckham did with his loan moves to Milan ahead of the 2010 tournament in South Africa. 

According to reports from transferfeed.com, Milan are among the potential destinations for Son this winter if he is allowed to leave LAFC on a temporary deal. 

His former side Tottenham, and a potential move to his native South Korea have also been mentioned as possible options.

SALÉ, Morocco – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team opened the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup with a resounding 3-0 win over Ecuador. Defender Meila Brewer, midfielder Nyanya Touray and forward Lauren Malsom all scored first-half goals. (HIGHLIGHTS)

In the other Group C match, China PR rolled over Norway, 5-0, meaning the USA sits in second place in the group after the first match day. The United States will face China PR next on Tuesday, Oct. 21 (Noon ET; FS2) and closes the group stage versus World Cup-debutant Norway on Friday, Oct. 24 (9 a.m. ET; FS2).

This is the first FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup featuring 24 nations, up from 16 teams that battled for the title in the eight previous editions of the tournament. This is also the first of five years that the competition will be held in Morocco. The top two finishers in each of the six groups, along with the four best third-place teams, will advance to the Round of 16 knockout stage.

Ecuador made just its second appearance in this tournament and showed some early energy by picking up two first-half yellow cards. Soon enough, the Ecuadorian side proved to be no match for the young Americans, eventually getting doubled up on shots, 22-11.

The USA got off to a quick start as Chicago Stars forward Micayla Johnson sprinted into the penalty area from the right side and forced Ecuador goalkeeper Maria Rodriguez to push her driven shot over the crossbar in the fourth minute.

The Video Support System came into play in just the eighth minute when Johnson was clearly taken down in the box by Ecuador defender Scarlet Garaicoa. The penalty was not given live. The USA asked for a review, but referee Ionela Alina Peşu waved off the claim.

After another penalty shout went unheeded, the play resulted in the USA earning a corner kick from the left side in the 19th minute. Antonucci bent an inswinger into the penalty box and crashing central defender Meila Brewer weaved through goalmouth traffic to smash her header into the net from five yards out. It was the first career goal at this level for the 16-year-old.

The USA kept the pressure on, and in the 22nd minute, forward Maddie DiMaria sent a driven header off the crossbar six yards out after a nice cross from Johnson from the right side. DiMaria, who is one of the four 2009-born players on the roster, earned her first U-17 cap. DiMaria fired a shot into the net in the 37th minute, but her run was correctly deemed offside.

DiMaria was not to be denied, however, and she got behind the defense in the 41st minute on a slipped pass from Malsom. DiMaria's powerful left-footed shot was well-saved by Rodriguez, but she couldn't hold it, and the ball fell to Touray for her to tap home from three yards out to make it 2-0. It was Touray's fifth U-17 international goal in her ninth career cap.

The Americans made it 3-0 just before halftime as Malsom scored her first World Cup goal and second of her U-17 international career. It was Johnson who got her behind the defense with a deft touch with the outside of her right foot into the center of the penalty area. Malsom collected the ball, burst in front of a defender and finished to the left of the goalkeeper from 13 yards out to give the USA a commanding lead a minute into first stoppage time.

The USA ended the half with a flurry of shots and corner kicks, and the South Americans were likely relieved to hear the halftime whistle.

The young squad put the ball in the net less than three minutes into the second half. It was DiMaria again, but once again she was correctly flagged for offside. Johnson seemingly scored in the 89th minute, but she too was whistled for offside.

Forward KK Ream of the Utah Royals, who came on in the 70th minute, had a great chance in the 71st minute on a breakaway, but she was stoned by ‘keeper Rodiguez, and the three first-half scores turned out to be the only ones of the game.

Ecuador had a bit more of the play in the second half but didn't seriously threaten the U.S. goal. USA goalkeeper Evan O'Steen earned the shutout, her fifth in the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, after she picked up four shutouts and Golden Glove honors at the 2024 edition of this tournament.

USA – Meila Brewer (Scottie Antonucci), 19th minute: The U.S. pressure earned several corner kicks early, and the Americans capitalized on the set play. Antonucci served a drive cross from the left side, and it was met by the head of Brewer, who powered her shot into the net from close range to give the USA an early lead. USA 1, ECU 0.

USA – Nyanya Touray, 41st minute: Touray was in the right place at the right time to tap in a rebound from close range after Maddie DiMaria's shot had been pushed up into the air by Ecuador goalkeeper Maria Rodriguez. USA 2, ECU 0.

USA – Lauren Malsom (Micayla Johnson), 45+1st minute: The USA's center forward finished clinically from the center of the penalty area just behind the spot after Johnson had expertly slipped a pass behind the defense. Malsom, a UNC freshman, struck her shot low and past the goalkeeper to give the USA a commanding halftime lead. USA 3, ECU 0 FINAL

U20 World Cup: The Morocco – Argentina final entrusted to a well-known referee!

U20 World Cup / Morocco – Argentina: FIFA reveals referee for the big final!

FIFA has made its decision: a familiar face from major European clashes will be on the whistle for the U20 World Cup final between Morocco and Argentina. Italian referee Maurizio Mariani, an experienced official and a regular on the continental stage, has been appointed to oversee this high-stakes showdown. Renowned for his authority and uncompromising management of big occasions, Mariani will shoulder the huge responsibility of ensuring a smooth final where nerves are set to run high.

He won't be alone in this mission. FIFA has appointed his compatriots Daniele Bindoni and Alberto Tegoni as assistant referees—two top-level officials who regularly work alongside him in major competitions. Rounding out the refereeing team, Americans Joe Dickerson and Logan Brown will serve as fourth and fifth officials, respectively, lending their support at key moments of the match.

The final, set to be played in the early hours of Monday at midnight (French time) at the Julio Martínez Prádanos National Stadium in Santiago, promises to be electric. On one side, Morocco dreams of a historic triumph that would mark a milestone in African football. On the other, Argentina is eager to add another trophy to its illustrious international collection. In this context, Maurizio Mariani's role could prove crucial in maintaining the balance of a match where every detail will matter.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Our expert offers his best Getafe vs Real Madrid predictions for their derby match in La Liga this evening in the Spanish capital (19/10/2025)

Our betting expert expects the visitors to triumph at the Coliseum, with Kylian Mbappe on target, and Getafe failing to score.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change. 



Real Madrid have typically started their games well this season. They lead three of their four away fixtures at the interval.

Across La Liga, they've scored 10 times and only conceded three goals in the first half. That record points to their strategy to play on the front foot and press from the first whistle. It's likely something that Alonso has drilled into his players, who were criticised for often starting slowly last term.

They should have too much quality for a Getafe side that have been unimpressive in their last two home games against Levante and Alaves. Jose Bordalas' team haven't created more than 0.9 xG in a match since the opening weekend of the season.

Real Madrid faced a minor injury concern during the international break, when Mbappe was forced to pull out of the France squad. He had an ankle injury, but it was nothing serious, and the striker should play at the Coliseum.

Mbappe is having a sensational season. He has scored at least once in all of his last 10 games for club and country. That alone makes him an attractive bet to score anytime, with an implied probability of 56.2%.

The 26-year-old averages 4.91 shots and 1.17 goals per 90 minutes in La Liga. His overall record stands at 14 goals in 10 matches in all competitions for his club this term.

Getafe enjoyed some early success in August, with their counter-attacking 5-3-2 approach delivering results on the road. However, they've been far less threatening since Christantus Uche moved to Crystal Palace.

Their top scorer, Adrian Liso, has also missed the last few matches due to his involvement in the U20 World Cup. He's going to be available on Sunday, but may need time to regain full form, having not started any of Spain's five games at that tournament.

With just 5.5 xG, they have the lowest expected goals tally in La Liga. They've also got a miserable recent record in this fixture, having scored only one goal in their last seven outings against Real Madrid. All of those games ended with Los Blancos winning.

Real Madrid have won nine of their 10 matches so far this season. However, their impressive start was dented by a 5-2 loss to Atletico Madrid in the derby.

They bounced back in positive fashion, beating Kairat 5-0 in the Champions League, and Villarreal 3-1 in La Liga. That would have boosted the spirits of Xabi Alonso's side as they prepare for the short trip to face neighbours Getafe.

Los Azulones started the season with back-to-back wins, but they've only taken two points from their last four matches. A 2-1 defeat at Osasuna was their latest setback prior to the international break.

Getafe expected lineup: Soria, Rico, Abqar, Duarte, Djene, Femenia, Arambarri, Martin, Milla, Liso, Mayoral

Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Asencio, Militao, Valverde, Bellingham, Tchouameni, Guler, Vinicius, Mbappe, Mastantuono","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Explore our soccer expert's Liverpool vs Manchester United predictions, prior to Sunday's 11:30 am ET Premier League clash (10/19).

Our expert expects the Reds to start winning again, a result that will increase the pressure on Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.

All odds are courtesy of bet365, correct at the time of publishing and subject to change

It's worth noting that all of Liverpool's recent defeats came on the road. Their home form this season is still perfect, as they've won all five of their games across all competitions at Anfield. They haven't lost a Premier League game at home since September 2024. Nottingham Forest was the last team to defeat them.

United, meanwhile, haven't won an away league game since they beat Leicester City in March. Also, they've conceded three goals in their last two away fixtures and appear very weak defensively. The Reds will see a real chance to get back to winning ways.

Ibrahima Konate and Ryan Gravenberch are expected to overcome minor injuries to play for the hosts, but Alisson is likely to miss out. Amorim doesn't have any new concerns, but his side are clearly the underdogs in this match.

The second half of Liverpool's league matches this season have been thrilling for casual fans. Their games have seen more than double the amount of goals after the break, with the final 15 minutes being especially hectic. They've conceded four and scored six goals between the 75th and 90th minute, with no other team reaching double figures in that period.

Arne Slot will trust his side to break down the Red Devils if required, and back them to score once or twice late in the game. With seven second-half goals conceded, United have one of the worst records after the interval in the division.

The visitors tend to score more goals in the first half, but concede more in the second. That trend could easily continue here.

No team dislikes facing Mo Salah more than Manchester United. He's scored 16 times in the 17 matches he's played against them, in addition to having six assists. With 22 G/A against them, they're the side against whom he's been the most deadly.

Coming off a slight goal drought, this game will be the perfect chance for Salah to start scoring again. So far, he's had four goal contributions in four home games in 2025/26, and could easily extend that to five from five.

Impressively, he hasn't scored in just two out of his last 13 games against United, and he's secured a goal and assist in four of them. Given the visitors' defensive vulnerabilities and away form, he'll be looking forward to this match.

Liverpool are currently in a tough situation after a fantastic start to the season. Defeats to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray, and Chelsea have increased the pressure. They've lost top spot in the Premier League to Arsenal. Their expensively assembled attack has raised concerns as they haven't been scoring as expected.

Manchester United, meanwhile, remain inconsistent. They haven't had the same end result twice in succession all season. Victory in their last match against Sunderland was well received, but it followed a disappointing Brentford defeat.

Liverpool expected lineup: Mamardashvili, Frimpong, Van Dijk, Konate, Robertson, Gravenberch, Szoboszlai, Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo, Isak

Man Utd expected lineup: Lammens, Yoro, de Ligt, Shaw, Diallo, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot, Mbeumo, Mount, Sesko","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Harry Kane has earned “crazy” praise after posting Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo-esque numbers, with the Bayern Munich superstar reaching 400 goals at club level.

Lionel Messi closed the regular season in style, solidifying his grip on the Golden Boot with 29 goals - not that there was ever much doubt. Still, the Inter Miami star wasn't content to coast. In what might have been his best performance of 2025, Messi put Nashville to the sword in a 5-2 win, sending a clear message to the rest of MLS ahead of the playoffs: look out.

Saturday was special, even by Messi's lofty standards. He finished with three goals and an assist at Geodis Park, and this was vintage Messi: dribbling, passing, and ultimately, scoring in ways that other humans simply cannot.

Despite the dominant scoreline, it certainly didn't begin that way. From the opening whistle, it was Nashville, not Miami, that looked destined to put up goals. Under an avalanche of shots, though, Miami somehow never broke. Nashville striker Sam Surridge had six shots before Messi got his first.

But once the Argentine scored his first goal, it became the start of something special. He buried it seemingly out of nowhere, giving Miami the lead in the 35th minute.



After seeing his side concede two just before halftime, with Surridge and Jacob Shaffelburg giving the home side a 2-1 lead, Messi ensured that the second 45 would be his. He netted a penalty in the 63rd minute to equalize. He then set up the sequence that led to Baltasar Rodriguez's go-ahead goal in the 67th minute.

In the 81st minute, he put the game out of reach with his hat-trick goal before then turning provider yet again by unselfishly teeing up Telasco Segovia in stoppage time to put an exclamation point on the night. There was seemingly nothing Nashville could do to prevent Messi from being Messi. He finished the regular season with 29 goals and 19 assists. 

The playoffs begin this week and, after winning other silverware the last few years, Miami have their sights set on MLS Cup. That's a scary thought, then, for the teams in their way - especially if Messi continues to play at this level.

Casper Ruud became the first Norwegian to triumph at the BNP Paribas Nordic Open in Stockholm on Sunday, when he brushed aside Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-3 in the title match.

The second seed was dominant throughout the 68-minute final. He played with great intensity to rush Humbert and was impressive on serve. Ruud dropped just three points on serve in the match and struck 22 winners to 12 unforced errors, improving to 3-3 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

""I would like to congratulate Ugo for his week and sorry about today. I think I played the best match of the year against you, so I am sorry. I am really happy but sorry Ugo,"" Ruud said. ""I know that against you, if I don't play well, you will destroy me. So I knew I had to wake up and play well.

""I am really happy to win here in Stockholm and it is a little bit of a childhood dream as it is close to Norway and all the legends have played here in the past. Federer, Nadal, Borg, McEnroe, you name it. So it is an honour to get a title here.""

Ruud is now a 14-time tour-level champion, with his triumph in Stockholm his second this year. In April, the 26-year-old won his maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown in Madrid.

Leylah Fernandez earned her fifth WTA title on Sunday in Osaka, defeating 18-year-old Tereza Valentova 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. It was Valentova's first-ever WTA final. Meanwhile, Taylor Townsend and Kristina Mladenovic collected the double trophy on Saturday, defeating Stom Hunter and Desirae Krawczyk for their first title together.

Leylah Fernandez won the first eight points and the first seven games of the match en route to capturing her first Kinoshita Group Japan Open title Sunday in Osaka.

The No. 4 seed defeated 18-year-old qualifier Tereza Valentova, who was making her WTA final debut, 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. The victory marked Fernandez's fifth career title and second of 2025.

Her run in Osaka, which included five consecutive wins, was just the second time since her Washington, D.C., triumph in July that she won back-to-back matches.

With the win, Fernandez climbs five spots to No. 22 in the PIF WTA Live Rankings and reclaims the Canadian No. 1 ranking from Victoria Mboko.

“First of all, congratulations Tereza,” Fernandez said during the trophy presentation. “You played amazing, and it's been a wonderful week for you, your coach and your family. I'm sure I'm going to see you in many more finals like this one.”

She then turned her attention to those closest to her.

“Finally, I want to thank my team and my dad, who's also my coach, and my hitting partner,” she said. “Thank you so much for suffering with me this past week, past month and past year. I also want to thank my family and loved ones back home. Without you, I wouldn't be here. Without everyone's sacrifices and support, I wouldn't be on this stage, so thank you so much for all the love and motivation you've given me.”

Fernandez opened the match with confidence befitting the more experienced player, needing less than 30 minutes to race through the first set and bagel the young Czech.

Valentova appeared emotional during the changeover after falling behind 5-0, perhaps feeling the pressure of the biggest moment of her career thus far. To her credit, she regrouped and played more freely in the second set, breaking Fernandez three times and finally consolidating in the final game to force a decider.

In the third set, Fernandez's past experience proved pivotal to the present. Leading 2-1, she pounced on Valentova's second serve on break point, unleashing a crosscourt backhand followed by a down-the-line backhand winner to break for 3-1.

Valentova responded with one more break to close the gap to 4-3 and earned several additional break points across the third set, but Fernandez held firm the rest of the way and ultimately sealed the win.

🏆 Fifth career title🇨🇦 First Canadian to win Osaka@leylahfernandez 👏#JapanOpen pic.twitter.com/QfEyHyeC8x

She celebrated with a bow to the crowd.

“I also want to thank the fans,” Fernandez said. “For coming this week, for supporting us -- not only myself but every player in this tournament. Without you, we wouldn't be here, so thank you so much for supporting us, motivating us and bringing the good energy.”

All five of Fernandez's career titles have come on hard courts.

For Valentova, the loss may be bittersweet. After a rough opening set, she clawed her way back into the match and made a strong impression in her first WTA final.

Coming through qualifying, she earned six wins on the week, including three over top 50 opponents. That included a straight-sets victory over No. 3 seed and world No. 21 Elise Mertens in the second round. She also had a dominant first-round win over Alexandra Eala, dropping just three games. 

She also came from a set down in her second-round qualifying win over Greet Minnen and in her quarterfinal and semifinal victories over Olga Danilovic and Jaqueline Cristian, nearly repeating the feat in the final against Fernandez.

When the newest rankings drop Monday, Valentova will reach a career-best No. 58, up 20 spots from where she began the week.

In Saturday's doubles final, No. 2 seeds Taylor Townsend and Kristina Mladenovic defeated Storm Hunter and Desirae Krawczyk 6-4, 2-6, [10-5] to claim their first title together in Osaka.

For Townsend, a two-time Grand Slam champion and current world No. 2, it marks her 11th career WTA doubles title and fourth of the season. With the win, she has now collected one WTA 250, WTA 500, WTA 1000 and Grand Slam title this season, while snapping a two-match losing streak in finals.

It's the first title of the year for Mladenovic, bringing her career total to 29. The former doubles world No.1 owns nine Grand Slam titles across doubles and mixed doubles.

Leylah Fernandez earned her fifth WTA title on Sunday in Osaka, defeating 18-year-old Tereza Valentova 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. It was Valentova's first-ever WTA final. Meanwhile, Taylor Townsend and Kristina Mladenovic collected the double trophy on Saturday, defeating Stom Hunter and Desirae Krawczyk for their first title together.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

The McLaren championship contenders were both forced to exit the Sprint early after contact at the start.

The Sprint in Austin got off to a dramatic start as the McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri – starting second and third respectively behind the Red Bull of Max Verstappen – crashed out after colliding on the opening corner.

The replays showed that championship leader Piastri went into Turn 1 with caution before being tagged by the Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg behind, the German having claimed an impressive fourth-placed start yesterday. That contact sent Piastri into his team mate and forced both championship contenders out of the Sprint with the Safety Car called into action.

""That was terrible, neither of our drivers to blame,"" said McLaren CEO Zak Brown afterwards. ""Amateur hour. Nico drove into Oscar.""

With Max Verstappen holding the lead, the incident saw George Russell rise into second with Carlos Sainz third.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Sprint and Qualifying ahead of the United States Grand Prix.

Verstappen had a great start and thus managed to avoid the first corner chaos. He had to fend off a late lunge from Russell after the first Safety Car period, but after surviving that challenge the Dutchman was untroubled as he recorded his third straight Sprint win here. Tsunoda made it two Red Bulls in the points after an inspired start. Despite running over the front wing of a Kick Sauber, he managed to avoid all the stopped or spinning cars to climb from P18 on the grid to seventh – which is where he finished.

The Dutchman then went on to complete the perfect day by grabbing pole by nearly three tenths of a second, despite not making it across the line to start his second flying lap in Q3. His first was more than good enough in the end, but Tsunoda was once again frustrated over one lap, this time by traffic in the form of Lawson.

Max Verstappen, Sprint: 1st, Qualifying: 1st, 1:32.510

“I think we had a very strong Saturday and it has been really positive. I was very happy with the Sprint win, it was an eventful race and it was great to get those points. We then made some final changes going into Qualifying to help out the balance a little bit and extract the best performance of the car. I was pleased with how the whole of Qualifying went and with the changes that we made that will hopefully make things easier tomorrow. We worked with the Team to understand what we needed to do with the car and extract performance. We unfortunately missed the final push run by a few seconds which wasn't ideal but luckily the lap we had was enough. I hope that we will also be strong in the race tomorrow and we need to be good on the tyres. It is difficult to tell as a lot of things will change, it will be a lot cooler and the wind direction will change which usually has a lot of effect on the balance of the car and should help us in the right way. Overall it has been a really good day for us; everyone is pushing very hard bringing performance constantly and the last few races have been very strong so we are looking forward to tomorrow.”

Yuki Tsunoda, Sprint: 7th, Qualifying: 13th, 1:33.466

“I have had a mixed day. The Sprint was very good for me, a lot went on in the first lap, I tried to overtake and out brake the cars in front at turn one. Sending it down the inside was worth the risk; I jumped 11 places but also picked up debris and took another front wing almost half a lap. It was a good recovery and result for driving with two front wings! Going into Quali I felt good but my final lap in Q2 was complicated. It was feeling really good until I hit traffic, I was blocked by Liam and the Alpine, it felt like Pierre was in the way, so it could have been miscommunication on their side. Without that I think I would have been in Q3. It feels like I can't have a normal Qualifying at the moment, which is really frustrating, as the car feels like it can perform. I felt something pretty good from the car, so it is a shame that last lap didn't come together. The positive for tomorrow is that I had the race pace this morning in the Sprint and have shown I can jump up the field if I take the right risks.“

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“This has been a very strong day for us and that was down to a great effort from everyone back in Milton Keynes and here at the track. It started off with Max winning the Sprint race. It's true that we got a bit lucky with both McLarens out immediately after the start. But Max drove a very strong race, defending against George to pick up maximum points and more importantly some very useful information on how the car is behaving on long runs. It was also a pretty impressive opening lap from Yuki, making up ten places or so to bring home more valuable points. As for Qualifying, we made use of what we had learnt from the Sprint to change the set-up for the rest of the weekend. Max's qualifying was even stronger than yesterday's Sprint Quali, which means the Team did a great job, going in the right direction. Yuki didn't quite make it to Q3, but as he demonstrated in the Sprint, from where he is starting, he will be able to fight for points tomorrow.”

McLaren had a Sprint to forget when both cars were forced into retirement on the opening lap. Norris had the worse start of the duo but a better racing line into Turn 1, and looked to have made it out of the corner cleanly. Behind Piastri, with better traction but on the outside opted to cut back under his team mate. Unfortunately, a fast-starting Alonso and Hulkenberg were in his blind spot. He found himself tagged by the German, and as a result, hit the back of his team mate who spun. Piastri stopped the car with suspension damaged after getting airborne, while Norris immediately parked up as his tyre rolled down the track. Not the start to the day the papaya team wanted or needed.

Qualifying went better for Norris as he bagged P2 again, just not having the pace to compete with Verstappen who was mighty around the Circuit of The Americas. But Piastri struggled yet again compared to not just his team mate but many of the front runners. He was only sixth, which opens the door for Norris to close the points difference yet again.

Lando Norris, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 2nd, 1:32.801

“A difficult day, having missed running in the Sprint this morning, Quali was definitely slightly harder than yesterday. The conditions changed, which didn't help, but I also didn't put my best lap in on Q3, so to be P2 isn't too bad. The team in the garage did a great job getting the car back together, so thank you to them. We don't have a lot of long-run data to work on, but our race pace has often been better than our Quali pace, so I'm optimistic but realistic about our chances for tomorrow.”

Oscar Piastri, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 6th, 1:33.084

“A tricky day for us today. Obviously not the result we wanted in the Sprint. It's shame to have not been able to finish. Massive thanks to the team for the big effort to get our cars back together.

“Quali was a tougher one compared to Sprint Quali. I just didn't really feel particularly comfortable in the car, so wasn't able to put it all together. But it's a long race tomorrow, and anything can happen, so we'll make up some places and do what we can.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A frustrating day on track with a disappointing Sprint where our two drivers were out on Lap 1 at Turn 1. This took away valuable track time for Lando and Oscar, resulting in them both needing to get straight into the rhythm of Qualifying.

“The team did an incredible job turning both cars around ahead of Qualifying given the large volume of parts that required replacing. My gratitude goes to all the mechanics and operational team members at McLaren who showed their resilience in overcoming this difficult challenge.

“While we aren't on Pole, the entire team will remain focused as we look forward to tomorrow's Grand Prix, in which we aim for a strong finish with both cars. We will try to take advantage and exploit the strengths in our car, especially with the hot conditions alongside the added factor of tyre degradation.”

Russell ran wide on the outside of Turn 1 and managed to avoid the melee that way, which helped his rise to second on the first lap. After the initial Safety Car came in, he managed to stick within DRS range of Verstappen and made one late lunge down the inside of Verstappen for the lead into Turn 12. But he couldn't keep his car on track, and Verstappen held the lead. That was his only chance, as the Mercedes man came home a still decent second. Antonelli was left biding his time in P9, and eventually made a move on Bearman. The Haas man went wide and picked up a penalty, which promoted the rookie to P8 at the flag for the final point on offer.

Russell and Antonelli both looked competitive throughout Qualifying, even if the former needed a late effort in Q2 to make it through after running used tyres for his first flying lap. Russell improved one place from Sprint Qualifying with fourth, while Antonelli was also solidly in the top 10.

George Russell, Sprint: 2nd, Qualifying: 4th, 1:32.826

""It is annoying to end the day just 0.026s away from being on the front-row and two positions higher up the grid. P4 is still a solid result but when it is as close as that, you always feel like you could have done just a little bit more. That said, I was happy with my lap. It wasn't the perfect effort, but I managed to extract a lot of performance from the car and when I crossed the line, I felt that I had done a decent job. Getting P2 would have been a good way to end the day, particularly having finished there in the Sprint this morning, but that's the way it goes sometimes.

""The wind is likely to shift 180 degrees tomorrow which will be interesting. We expect the McLarens and the Red Bull of Verstappen to be particularly quick, but I hope we can be in the mix for the podium. We know we're in a tight fight for second in the Constructors' and every point counts. I'm therefore looking forward to the race and seeing what we can do.""

Kimi Antonelli, Sprint: 8th, Qualifying: 7th, 1:33.114

""I was hoping for slightly better than P7 in qualifying today. We couldn't maximise either lap in Q3 and ended up just the wrong side of a few cars. P5 was definitely possible today if we had managed to put everything together. It was tricky to do that with the change in wind conditions from run to run, particularly at the end of Q2 and into the final segment. It was scrappy and we will work hard to improve on that moving forward.

""With all that said, I am still looking forward to tomorrow. The wind is going to rotate for the race and that will likely affect the balance. Whilst we were trying to optimise the car for qualifying, we made sure that we didn't do that at the cost of our race car. Our pace in the Sprint looked good so we can hopefully use that tomorrow and gain some positions.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""It's frustrating to end qualifying the wrong side of a tight group of cars with both drivers. For George, he was milliseconds away from getting on to the front-row. His lap was good; we haven't consistently had the single lap pace to challenge the top two this weekend, so it was a solid effort to be so close. Hopefully we can deploy the handy race pace we saw in FP1 and the Sprint to get in the fight for the podium with him.

""It was also a question of what may have been on Kimi's side of the garage. His Q2 lap was his best of the session and there was likely more time to be found on his first Q3 lap, which was his fastest of that segment. He may have been able to get ahead of Hamilton and Piastri but he certainly wasn't the only driver not to hook up his best lap as the wind picked up in the closing stages. From P7, he still has a good chance of moving forward and putting together a solid result.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""Qualifying was certainly a case of what could have been today. Both George and Kimi felt there was more time to find in Q3, albeit marginally in George's case. In a best-case scenario, we could have been looking at P2 and P5 but instead it is P4 and P7. That highlights just how close the field has become recently and the importance of delivering the maximum at the crucial moments. It is an exciting challenge and tomorrow we can hopefully enjoy another strong race having come through to the podium and double points in this morning's Sprint.

""From that 19-lap contest, we gathered some useful data on the Medium tyre. There will still be plenty of unknowns though heading into the Grand Prix. The hot weather will make it demanding on the rear tyres and management will be key. We showed solid pace despite pushing hard in the opening laps of the sprint race so we're hoping that through car performance and strategy we will be able to move forward with both drivers tomorrow.""

Leclerc was completely baulked into Turn 1 by a spinning Norris, and yet once he had negotiated that roadblock, he got great traction to climb up to fourth. But a mistake a few laps later opened the door for his team mate, who sailed past. Hamilton had better pace and came close to chasing down Sainz for P3, but ran out of laps to do so.

Qualifying went better for the team than Sprint Qualifying had the day before, with both drivers making Q3 with ease. But once there it looked to be going horribly wrong when Hamilton locked up on his first flying run and Leclerc spun. Luckily both nailed their second laps to bag very decent starting slots.

Charles Leclerc, Sprint: 5th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:32.807

""The feeling in the car was much better in the Sprint compared to yesterday and our pace was pretty good overall, so that's a positive. I made a mistake in turn 5 and Lewis overtook me. After that, it was tricky to get back the pace I had before the mistake. We did gain some insights which should help us to be in a better place for the race tomorrow.

""Qualifying was quite a big surprise considering how difficult this weekend had been for us until now. We put everything together in the end and will start from P3 tomorrow. We've learned quite a bit already and have applied that knowledge this afternoon. Hopefully tomorrow we can have a good start and fight our way forward.""

Lewis Hamilton, Sprint: 4th, Qualifying: 5th, 1:32.912

""It's been a positive Saturday overall. In the Sprint we showed good pace and without the final Safety Car, we could have pushed for a stronger result. Qualifying was also a step forward from yesterday: everything ran more smoothly and that made us more competitive throughout the session.

""Tomorrow will be demanding, but starting from further up the field gives us the chance to fight for important points. Strategy will play a big part, so we'll go through the details tonight to make sure we're ready for the Grand Prix.

""Austin is one of my favourite tracks and the fans have been incredible all weekend. I'd love to repay that support with a strong result.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""Our pace was strong from the beginning of Q1 and we were always in the top four. Then on the first timed lap in Q3, Lewis went straight on at turn 1 and Charles spun, so they were P9 and P10, and we were a bit on the backfoot. But in the end, they were able to put their laps together, even if it was not the best one of the day. Now, as always we will focus on ourselves and see what we can do tomorrow. As for the Sprint Race, we picked up some points and we hope to add to that total tomorrow.""

Somehow, both Williams cars avoided the spinning Norris and stricken Piastri in Turn 1 despite starting in the midst of the top 10. Sainz emerged in third place and had the pace to hold that position, despite pressure from Ferrari behind. Albon was sixth, keeping Tsunoda at bay to make it double points for the Grove-based team.

The Thai driver's Sprint might have been a success, but Qualifying wasn't. He lost his lap time in Q1 to track limits, so exited at the first time of asking. But Sainz at least gave the team something to cheer by making it back to the top 10 yet again.

Alex Albon, Sprint: 6th, Qualifying: 19th, 1:34.690

""It was a decent start to the day with the Sprint; we were able to stay out of trouble and make up some positions to bring home a few points. On Friday, we figured out there was a differential issue with the car, and we couldn't make the changes in time for the Sprint, so going into qualifying the balance and setup was completely new. We need to have a look at the data properly, but by resolving the issue it impacted the balance, and I had more understeer than usual. Generally, the changes made a better and more predictable car, which is positive, but it needed a bit of tuning to accommodate the setup changes, and we didn't have the time as it was straight into Q1. My final push lap time was deleted for track limits which is a shame as we should've been through to Q2 at least. Let's see what tomorrow brings.""

Carlos Sainz, Sprint: 3rd, Qualifying: 9th, 1:33.150

""Today was another good day and I'm happy with my laps. We executed a clean session and pace felt strong. Unfortunately the wind picked up for the last part of qualifying and our car becomes a bit trickier to drive, so overall P9 was more or less our spot today. I have confidence on my race pace for tomorrow so I hope to give these great fans another exciting race to cheer on! We'll aim to move forwards through the pack and hopefully stay close to the cars at the front of the grid. Our ultimate goal is to bring home some more points for the team, so let's race!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""It has been a brilliant day for us. The team walks away with nine more points in this World Championship with both Alex and Carlos contributing to the huge points haul. It's the first Sprint podium we have ever achieved as Williams which is a proud moment for me. We are in a strong position with Carlos tomorrow, starting P9, and I think we have a good opportunity in the race. With Alex, we've been struggling with a differential issue across the weekend, and he did brilliantly in the Sprint to get those points in sixth. The team did a fantastic job rebuilding the back of the car before qualifying and the changes were positive, however they significantly changed the balance of the car which meant he wasn't able to extract everything out of it and it was more unpredictable to him. I am confident that the platform he has for tomorrow will be strong and he'll be back fighting towards points.""

Bearman rose into the points at the end of the first lap, and despite significant pressure from Antonelli, looked set to score. But when the Mercedes man finally managed to make a move, Bearman ran wide defending. He opted not to give the place up, which meant the incident went to the stewards who handed him a 10-second time penalty. That dropped him from P8 to last. He did at least see the flag unlike Ocon, who was punted into retirement by Stroll when the two clashed late on.

Ocon then exited Qualifying in Q1, just unable to extract much pace from the car. Bearman impressed again though, the youngster seemingly gelling with this track. He made it to Q3 and bagged a very decent eighth in his newly upgraded VF-25.

Esteban Ocon, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 17th, 1:34.136

“It was a pretty decent start in the Sprint, and we made up quite a few positions, but not enough to get into point scoring positions. There's a lot of risks to take in Sprints – and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time – but unfortunately that's racing. There's not much to say really about qualifying, we were just too slow. From start to finish, I was struggling with the consistency of the car and how much confidence it gives in the high-speed section. I had to drive with some margin to complete the lap, otherwise the rear is very loose and I'm about to lose it in every corner, that was where the difficulty was. I think it was a little bit better than yesterday, but not enough.”

Oliver Bearman, Sprint: 15th, Qualifying: 8th, 1:33.139

“The Sprint was going really well, but with the penalty I'll have to take a look from the onboard camera as from my point of view, I felt it wasn't a punishable offense as I was being pushed off the track and holding position. I don't think I was in the wrong for staying where I was. I'm still a bit miffed but it's nice to come back with a result like that this afternoon in qualifying. We put the upgrade on the car for Sprint quali yesterday, I didn't have it in on for practice, so I missed a bit of learning of that, plus I'm learning this track. To squeeze into Q3 and then produce a really good lap – I'm really proud of that. The car feels good, it has some different characteristics to the previous car I'd say, which means I was learning on the go. That's part of the fun of Formula 1 of course, and the changes we made between yesterday and today have really made a difference.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“After a difficult Sprint qualifying yesterday, in the Sprint race today, I think we showed good potential. With the new package, we haven't had much time to set up the car, but I think the Sprint showed that the foundations are there. We improved the car for qualifying, but it's still such a fine margin. Esteban was a little bit unhappy with the car on corner entry, he was two tenths off Ollie in Q1, and that was enough to knock him out. On the other side, Ollie managed to scrape through in Q1, and then made amazing steps in Q1, Q2, and also in Q3. To finish P8 and be the top of the midfield pack, that's an amazing result and a testament to the team for continuing to develop the VF-25. It's pleasing for all the team, and I'd like to congratulate them. Now need to convert this qualifying position into points.”

Alonso was on the inside into Turn 1 after a good start, but soon found himself with nowhere to go as the cars concertinaed up. He wound up colliding with Hulkenberg and picked up a puncture. Although he made it back to the pits, he retired the car with too much damage. Stroll then made it a double DNF when he opportunistically sent it up the inside of Ocon late on. Locking up, he hit the Haas and was forced to park up. The stewards then handed him a five-place grid drop for the race for causing the collision.

The Canadian's afternoon did not improve when he had his flying lap in Q1 deleted for track limits, meaning he dropped out at the first time of asking and with that grid penalty, will start from the back. Alonso though turned his day around by making it to the top 10 shootout for the second time this weekend.

Fernando Alonso, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 10th, 1:33.160

""The car has felt quite competitive for me this weekend and I am pleased to have made it into Q3. It was a shame to not make it further than Turn 1 in the Sprint earlier on, as we were looking at being second or third out of the exit until I got hit. In Qualifying this afternoon it was very tight, but we put some strong laps in Q1 and Q2 to progress. We didn't have the best out-lap in our final push in Q3 and thought we didn't have enough time to make it to the flag. This meant I pushed quite hard and the tyres weren't as good as they could have been. The tyre degradation will be a big challenge tomorrow with these high temperatures, so let's see if we can fight for the points.""

Lance Stroll, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 18th, 1:34.540

""Today's not gone my way – there was a misjudgement on my side overtaking Esteban [Ocon] at the end of the Sprint earlier today. I thought I was close enough to dive down the inside but the track was quite dirty there and I locked the front left. It was my mistake and I apologised to Esteban. In Qualifying this afternoon, we managed to get through to Q2 but with track limits had my lap time deleted and qualified in P18. With the penalty from the Sprint, we're starting from the back of the grid tomorrow and see if we can make up any positions. In these weather conditions it's always more challenging managing tyres so we'll see how we do.""

Andy Cowell, CEO & Team Principal

""A disappointing Sprint earlier today with both Fernando and Lance picking up damage on lap one when the two McLarens crashed into each other. Fernando suffered a puncture and Lance had to pit for a new front wing. Lance's Sprint ended after contact with Esteban [Ocon] in the closing stages. The garage crews did an excellent job to get both cars fixed and ready in time for Qualifying.

""The Qualifying session was mixed, with Lance one of several drivers to have a lap time deleted for track limits. Without that, he would have progressed safely to Q2. Fernando's efforts earned him a place in Q3, building on the pace we saw in Sprint Qualifying yesterday. It was not the easiest of Q3 sessions, but starting from P10 gives us a chance to race for points tomorrow.""

Hulkenberg made a good start and went into Turn 1 on the inside of Piastri. But with Alonso on his inside, he had nowhere to go when Piastri started to cut back across. The two collided, and although Hulkenberg was able to continue via a trip to the pits for a new front wing, he finished down the order. Bortoleto did well to make it home in 11th after starting last though, which shows there is still decent pace in the car.

The German could not repeat his Sprint Qualifying heroics, exiting in Q2 but he was P11, so stands a decent chance of fighting for points tomorrow.

Nico Hulkenberg, Sprint: 13th, Qualifying: 11th, 1:33.334

“The sprint was pretty much over after the incident in Turn 1, which was frustrating because it compromised the whole race and ended our chance of a good end result. It was good to get straight back in the car in the afternoon to reset, get it out of the system, and focus on qualifying. This is an amazing track to drive, and overall qualifying was decent.

""Unfortunately, the final lap was not as clean as it needed to be. I struggled a bit in the last sector where I hit some wind gusts, ultimately losing some time there. Starting from P11 tomorrow means we're close to the points on a track where overtaking is possible.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, Sprint: 11th, Qualifying: 16th, 1:34.125

""To be honest, it's been a bit of a tough weekend so far. I've been struggling to find the pace, especially in the last sector —as I did not just have the same confidence in the car that I've had at previous events so far. The first and second sectors felt strong, but I couldn't quite put it all together. Looking back to the Sprint, it's been a bit chaotic with all those yellow flags and crashes, so it was good to bring the car back in one piece – it also gave us an extra chance to gather some more data when it comes to car balance. We've done some changes to the car ahead of Quali, and it felt like things are getting better, but I think I just needed a few more laps to really push to the limit and get a shot at Q2. It's a new track for me, and I feel like I still have something to learn, so I just couldn't extract everything today. We'll learn from it and see how to maximise our chances to improve in tomorrow's race.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“It was one of the most dramatic Sprints we have seen in quite some time. Unfortunately, what looked like a chain reaction in Turn 1 took Nico out early, compromising his race and removing the opportunities of his strong starting position. Gabi managed to avoid all the incidents and brought the car home cleanly.

“In qualifying, Nico showed strong pace and was on course for Q3 before a wind-affected final sector cost him valuable time. Despite that setback, he will still start the race from P11. For Gabi, it is his first time racing here, and this is a track where experience can make a real difference. He has been struggling a bit with the balance of the car this weekend and will start tomorrow's race from P16, aiming to make up positions. Both cars are in a solid position for the race, with everything to play for. Our goal remains the same as always: to fight for points. As we saw in the Sprint today, nothing can be taken for granted.”

Neither Hadjar nor Lawson could take advantage of the first lap incidents to rise up into the points in the Austin Sprint. Hadjar was baulked on the exit of Turn 1 which cost him places and allowed Lawson to sneak ahead. But they did not have the pace to fight with the cars ahead in the dash. Whether they will do so in the race remains to be seen, but neither driver could come close to troubling the top 10. Lawson was 12th in the end, while Hadjar crashed out early in Q1 after he lost the rear of his car and spun into the barriers. That left the Frenchman with an uphill task in the Grand Prix if he wants anything to show for his Austin weekend bar frustration.

Isack Hadjar, Sprint: 12th, Qualifying: 20th, No time set in Q1

“I'm sorry to the team that the car isn't coming back in one piece. I arrived at the corner with too much speed and I was definitely surprised by how suddenly the car snapped, but I knew I couldn't catch it. I know there are things I could have done differently before the corner, it's all about fine margins around here. The car is quick, but obviously starting from the back isn't ideal. We've had good races coming from the back before, but it'll be a challenge. We'll hope for some overtaking opportunities and maybe a bit of magic tomorrow.”

Liam Lawson, Sprint: 9th, Qualifying: 12th, 1:33.360

""We have a very fast car but unfortunately got hit by a big gust of wind at the start of the lap and from that point you're trying to make up lap time. We're all dealing with it at different points throughout Qualifying, but it obviously cost us today. We have a good package, so we'll be working hard to make something work to get into the points tomorrow.""

Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance

""Following an eventful Sprint race, we had some repairs to do on Isack's car, but nothing major. Unfortunately, in Qualifying, Isack lost the car in Turn 6 of his first push lap, putting it to an early end.

""Liam had a strong Q1 and went through comfortably but during his last lap of Q2, he made a mistake in Turn 1 and lost some time. Unfortunately the lap was then deleted for track limits going wide into T19.

""It's disappointing as we were hoping both cars to fight for top 10 with the 6 sets of Soft tyres we had kept for this session but we'll look forward to tomorrow and hopefully turn it around.""

Gasly made up a handful of places at the start, but he did not have the pace to challenge for the points. Still, P10 is his best finish since Spa across either format. As for Colapinto, he was forced into an early pit stop after picking up a puncture battling Stroll and came home 14th. Both drivers managed to make it out of Q1 in Qualifying which was progress, but neither had the pace out there to challenge for the top 10.

Pierre Gasly, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 14th, 1:33.651

“Sprint weekends are always a busy schedule and it has certainly been a busy day at the wheel. I would say we had a decent Sprint Race to finish in P10. Turn 1 was carnage on the opening lap and I just had to try and survive and put the car in the right position to avoid any of the mess. In the end, we gained some places and just had to try our best to defend from there. We lacked pace but certainly learned a few things and tricks, which should benefit us in the race. In Qualifying, again, I felt like we did a pretty good job. I was not too happy with the final push lap where we seemed to struggle in the final corner in particular so we will review that as the first two sectors were good and competitive. I don't think Q3 would have been possible, maybe one or two places higher, but I think, as a team, we can take the positives of being in Q2 for the second time this weekend. Tomorrow, we will see what we can do from P14 and just try to capitalise on any potential chaos in front.”

Franco Colapinto, Sprint: 14th, Qualifying: 15th, 1:34.044

“It has been a tricky day, and weekend overall so far, on my side of the garage. It has been difficult to find the right balance and the car has felt slightly more unpredictable to drive than in recent races, which could also be down to the conditions and high-speed nature of this track. In the Sprint, I managed to get a good getaway but felt some heavy contact from behind on the apex of Turn 1, which ultimately caused a rear left puncture and effectively put us out of contention having to make an extra pit stop. We made some extensive set-up changes between sessions to help me feel more confident with the car. Some things worked and others didn't, but it was a good learning that we can take forward into future races. I was pushing hard in Qualifying and while it was positive getting both cars into Q2, I struggled to put a lap together and had to abort some runs with a few snaps in places. I wasn't really able to race today after the Turn 1 incident, so I'm looking forward to the race tomorrow and seeing what we can do from our starting position.”

Steve Nielsen, Managing Director

“Given our results at recent events, we can certainly take some positivity from the Sprint Day here in Austin. In the race, Pierre did well to survive the chaos at Turn 1 and in the end finished in P10, just outside the points. Franco, unfortunately, suffered a rear left puncture in the various incidents on the opening lap, which very much wrote off any hopes of a good result. The car, in general, has been in a decent place all weekend, which is reflected in both cars reaching Q2 on merit, our first double Q2 appearance since Austria in July, underlining the team's desire to keep striving for the best possible outcome each time we are on track. As we saw in today's Sprint, there could be opportunities in tomorrow's race which will require both drivers to drive smartly, and cleanly, and we will see what we can do to maximise our end result with both cars.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“As expected everyone opted for the mediums to start the sprint race, with the only variable being whether they were new or used. Degradation was high but predictable, especially following the neutralisation, which then allowed the drivers to push hard without worrying about tyre management.

""When it came to qualifying, the times were set using new soft tyres. The high track temperatures made it harder for the tyres to recover their performance after the first flying lap. As a result, the drivers really only had one chance to beat their rivals, with lap times that were a bit slower than expected precisely because of the high track temperatures.
The hard tyre now becomes a valid strategic option for tomorrow's race, given that the performance gap to the medium is less than expected. Looking at all the available compounds, a number of different strategies are possible with no significant disadvantages: all of which are close in terms of overall race time.

""Stretching the first medium stint to a pit stop window between laps 20 and 26 allows a one-stopper, if you then go onto the C1. But a two-stopper is equally effective using soft and medium: starting on the soft and then swapping to the C3 on between laps 12 and 18. The teams can then decide whether or not to run the medium again for the final stint, or stretch the middle stint and use the extra speed of the soft in the final laps.

""A one-stopper using just medium and soft would require extremely accurate tyre management and might risk compromising performance, to the extent that we don't believe it would be a realistic option.

""As we saw clearly today, the drivers will have to pay close attention to two external factors that made driving conditions tricky: gusting winds and irregular asphalt. The first issue adds to the risk of locking up under braking and so can potentially reduce the operating window of the tyres. The uneven asphalt can instead cause micro-slides, which raises tyre temperature and so adds to the challenge of thermal management.”

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

The Sprint at the United States Grand Prix proved hugely eventful, with Max Verstappen taking the win while Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both retired on Lap 1.

Max Verstappen has taken victory in a dramatic Sprint at the United States Grand Prix that saw both McLaren drivers retire on the opening lap after being caught up in a Turn 1 melee.

While Verstappen led cleanly away from pole position, the McLaren of Oscar Piastri was tagged by Nico Hulkenberg's Kick Sauber into the first corner, which then sent the Australian into team mate Lando Norris.

This put both of the papaya squad's cars out of the running, while Hulkenberg dropped down the order after sustaining damage. But there was no such trouble for Verstappen, who handled a challenge from Mercedes' George Russell – and two Safety Car phases – to win the Sprint.

Sprint results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES UNITED STATES GRAND PRIX 2025

In an event that ended under one of those Safety Car appearances – following a late collision between Lance Stroll and Esteban Ocon – Russell had to settle for P2 behind Verstappen, while Williams' Carlos Sainz took P3 ahead of the Ferrari pair of Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc in P4 and P5 respectively.

The other Williams of Alex Albon followed in sixth, with Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda taking seventh. Haas' Ollie Bearman, meanwhile, crossed the line in eighth but was dropped to the back of the field owing to a 10-second time penalty, promoting Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli into the last points-paying place.

After just one hour of practice earlier in the day, Friday's Sprint Qualifying had decided the starting order for the 100 kilometre dash, a format in which the top eight finishers score points from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8.

While Norris had set the pace throughout SQ1 and SQ2, it was the Red Bull of Verstappen that ultimately swept through to take pole position in the final moments of SQ3, marking the Dutchman's 10th Sprint pole.

This put Norris and team mate Piastri in second and third respectively, while Hulkenberg grabbed an eye-catching fourth place for Kick Sauber.

With much still to play for in the Drivers' Championship, the excitement was building as the cars assembled on the grid ahead of Saturday's 19-lap event in increasingly warm conditions – and when the tyre blankets came off prior to the formation lap, it was revealed that all 20 drivers would be starting on the medium compound.

As the lights went out at the Circuit of The Americas, Verstappen made a smooth launch away at the front. But drama rapidly unfolded behind as the pack entered Turn 1, with Piastri getting tagged by Hulkenberg which launched the Australian into a spin – and sent him into Norris, immediately putting the Briton out of the running.

While Piastri initially continued, the championship leader was warned that he may have picked up suspension damage and was ultimately unable to make it back to the pits, meaning that both McLaren cars had retired from the Sprint on only the first lap.

Fernando Alonso also found himself out of the event, the Aston Martin having been caught up in the melee amid contact with Hulkenberg, while the Safety Car was deployed due to the debris scattered across the track.

As for Hulkenberg – who called the incident a “massive sandwich” – the Kick Sauber driver had dropped down to P15 following a visit to the pits, while Stroll and Alpine's Franco Colapinto had also pitted after an eventful opening lap.

On Lap 5 of 19, it was announced that the Safety Car period would soon be ending, with Verstappen still leading from Russell, Sainz, Leclerc, Hamilton, Albon, Tsunoda – the Red Bull driver having withstood running over Hulkenberg's stray front wing on the track – and Bearman.

It was another strong restart from Verstappen, the World Champion holding onto P1 ahead of Singapore race winner Russell. Further back, the other Mercedes car of Antonelli was keen to make moves as the rookie tried to find a way past Pierre Gasly in a fight for ninth.

By Lap 8, Russell had closed in on Verstappen enough to attempt a bold overtake of his own by making a lunge into Turn 12 – but both cars ran wide off the track, with Verstappen rejoining ahead of his rival. “What was that?” the Red Bull man radioed in – and while the stewards noted the incident, they decided that no further investigation was needed.

Elsewhere the Ferrari duo of Leclerc and Hamilton were locked in a fierce scrap for P4, Hamilton ultimately winning the fight to move ahead of his team mate. And back at the front, Russell looked to have lost ground to Verstappen, the Briton dropping back by 1.7s.

As Lap 11 ticked down, Verstappen continued to lead from Russell, Sainz, Hamilton, Leclerc, Albon, Tsunoda and Bearman. The battle for that last points-paying position looked to be heating up, with Bearman closing to within a second of Tsunoda while Antonelli was also hot on the tail of the Haas.

“We have two strikes at Turn 12,” Russell was warned by his race engineer about track limits, while elsewhere Bearman and Antonelli were noted for leaving the track and gaining an advantage following a wide moment for the rookies during their duel.

Further drama hit on Lap 16 when Stroll attempted a lunge on Ocon into Turn 1, the Aston Martin driver locking up and collecting the Haas to put the latter out. While the Canadian appeared to raise his hand in apology, he also became another retirement after pulling his damaged car off the track at Turn 3.

All of this prompted a second Safety Car phase, while it was confirmed that the Stroll and Ocon incident would be investigated after the Sprint. Bearman, meanwhile, was handed a 10-second time penalty for that aforementioned Antonelli fight, a punishment that would drop the Haas man out of the points.

With the recovery operation continuing on track, the Sprint ended under the Safety Car as Verstappen clinched a 13th Sprint victory, the Dutchman crossing the line ahead of Russell, Sainz, Hamilton, Leclerc, Albon and Tsunoda.

With Bearman – who had been running in eighth – dropping to the bottom of the order due to his penalty, Antonelli moved up into P8, while Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and the Alpine of Gasly missed out on points in P9 and P10 respectively.

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto was 11th, ahead of the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar (12th), Hulkenberg (13th), Colapinto (14th) and the aforementioned Bearman (15th).

A quarter of the field retired in a highly eventful Sprint, with Norris, Piastri and Alonso all out on Lap 1 while Ocon and Stroll added to the list of drivers who failed to see the finish.

“I mean, the start was good,"" said Sprint winner Verstappen. ""Then, of course, there was the Safety Car because of the Turn 1 incident, and it took a few laps after the Safety Car to have decent pace, so we need to try to figure out what was going on there.

“Nevertheless, we won the Sprint, which is the most important thing. Looking for tomorrow, I do think we need to be a bit better in race trim to be able to fight the McLarens, because we haven't seen anything from them.”

Following the Sprint, the drivers will next hit the track during Qualifying for the Grand Prix later on Saturday, with the session set to begin at 1600 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams on race day in Texas for the United States Grand Prix.

Saturday was a red-letter day for Red Bull Racing and Max Verstappen with a Sprint victory and a seemingly-comfortable three-tenths advantage in Qualifying.

Looking at the raw numbers, the Dutchman, with his shadow increasingly looming over the Drivers' Championship, looks a good bet to add a fourth US Grand Prix victory on Sunday afternoon… but is everything quite as it seems?

Max has been playing down his chances, pointing to McLaren's strong long-run pace and the high temperatures expected to suit his rivals in Papaya. We've had hot track temperatures before at the Circuit of the Americas, but nothing quite this hot, and that's going to play a part, as is Pirelli's decision to introduce a compound bridge this year between the hard and medium tyres.

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen will start the United States Grand Prix from pole position after dominating the session.

Max Verstappen secured pole position for the United States Grand Prix, backing up his lights-to-flag victory in the Sprint, despite a timing error from Red Bull denying him a second timed effort in Q3.

The four-time World Champion set a 1m 32.510s with his first effort in Q3 to position himself at the front of the field for the second time this weekend, seeing off Lando Norris by 0.291s. Championship leader Oscar Piastri will start from sixth, after struggling throughout the session.

Q1 provided a frantic start to the action, with Isack Hadjar crashing at Turn 6 and causing the red flags to fly. Bookending the drama in the opening phase, both Lance Stroll and Alex Albon saw their times deleted for exceeding track limits, relegating them to the rear of the grid.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen looked in commanding form during Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, the Dutchman clinching pole position despite a potential moment of drama in the final runs.

Max Verstappen has seized pole position for the United States Grand Prix, the Dutchman's initial lap in Q3 proving enough to secure him the top spot after running out of time to put in a second effort.

Having set the pace through Q1 and Q2, Verstappen looked to have continued that theme by going quickest during the opening laps of Q3 on an effort of 1m 32.510s. While he attempted to go again in the final runs, the Red Bull driver did not reach the line before the chequered flag fell, meaning that he would have to rely on his earlier effort.

It turned out to be enough, with his time putting him 0.291s clear of closest challenger Lando Norris in second. The McLaren driver was only six-thousandths ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in third, while Mercedes' George Russell slotted into fourth.

The other Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton claimed P5, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri seemingly experiencing a tricky session in P6. Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli followed in P7, with Haas' Ollie Bearman, the Williams of Carlos Sainz and Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin rounding out the top 10.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES UNITED STATES GRAND PRIX 2025

After his impressive Sprint Qualifying performance on Friday, Nico Hulkenberg was unable to replicate this in Saturday's Qualifying. The Kick Sauber driver exited Q2 in 11th, putting him one position ahead of Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in 12th.

Yuki Tsunoda took P13 for Red Bull, with the Alpine pair of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto just behind in P14 and P15.

There was early drama just a few minutes into Qualifying when a crash for Isack Hadjar brought out the red flags, leaving the Racing Bulls man down in 20th and last place.

Track limits proved to be the undoing of Lance Stroll and Alex Albon in the segment, with the deletion of their respective laps putting the Aston Martin and Williams drivers in 18th and 19th respectively, though a five-place grid penalty for Stroll will drop him to the back. The other names to exit early doors, meanwhile, were Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto (16th) and Haas' Esteban Ocon (17th).

Hours on from an action-packed Sprint at the Circuit of The Americas, the attentions of the paddock shifted to Qualifying, which would decide the starting order for Sunday's United States Grand Prix.

A queue had already formed in the pit lane ahead of the green light signalling the start of Q1, with Ocon leading the pack out for the 18-minute segment. Two drivers to emerge after the initial chain had dispersed were the McLaren pair of Norris and Piastri, both back in action after their earlier Lap 1 exit in the Sprint.

A red flag was thrown just minutes into the session when Hadjar hit the barriers, having lost the rear of the car before spinning off. The Racing Bulls driver was seen hitting the steering wheel in frustration following the incident, while work began to clear his stricken car from the track.

Once the session resumption time had been announced shortly afterwards – with just over 14 minutes left on the clock – another pit lane queue quickly developed. The majority of the field had bolted on soft tyres for their early runs with the exception of Hamilton, who had ran used mediums before also switching to the soft rubber.

There was a dicey moment for Norris as he tried to put a first timed lap on the board, the Briton going wide which forced him to abandon his effort. Leclerc, meanwhile, had gone fastest on a lap of 1m 33.525s, putting him 0.065s clear of Verstappen.

Norris' next attempt was more successful but could still only place him in seventh, one position behind team mate Piastri. At the other end of the timesheets, the drivers at risk as the session entered its final minutes were Stroll, Colapinto, Albon and Bortoleto, along with Hadjar whose crash had brought an early end to his Qualifying.

The Mercedes pair of Russell and Antonelli caught the eye by briefly taking a 1-2, before Sprint winner Verstappen displaced the former at the top by one tenth on a lap of 1m 33.207s. Colapinto, meanwhile, had moved himself just out of danger to P15, pushing the previously improved Bortoleto back down to P16.

All eyes were then on Albon as the Thai driver tried to escape elimination. He promptly seemed to do so by putting his Williams into eighth place – but his lap time was then deleted for exceeding track limits, pushing him back to P19.

Another driver to have their effort erased for the same reason was Stroll, leaving the Canadian in 18th, which will become last place due to a five-place grid penalty. Bortoleto also failed to progress to Q2 in 16th, with Ocon in 17th while Hadjar – having been unable to rejoin the session – brought up the rear in 20th.

Knocked out: Bortoleto, Ocon, Stroll, Albon, Hadjar

Another 15 minutes went on the clock as Q2 got underway, the soft rubber again proving the tyre of choice for the field as they set to putting a time on the board. Verstappen looked to have continued his Q1 form forward, setting an early benchmark of 1m 32.701s.

Leclerc slotted into second, 0.168s away from Verstappen, with Norris third and Hamilton fourth following the initial runs. Piastri, meanwhile, was back in seventh, not a comfortable position for the McLaren driver to be in.

Further back, the names at risk were Lawson, Russell, Tsunoda, Colapinto and Gasly, the latter having yet to set a lap after his time was deleted due to track limits. Russell returned to the track earlier than most for his decisive lap, the Briton moving up to P6.

As the action picked up in the final minutes of Q2 – with just Verstappen opting to stay in the garage, seemingly feeling safe at the top – the other Red Bull of Tsunoda could not better his previous time, leaving him in P13, while Hulkenberg was also unable to progress in P11.

After getting a lap on the board, Gasly moved forward but only to P14 – ahead of team mate Colapinto – while Lawson also exited in P12.

Knocked out: Hulkenberg, Lawson, Tsunoda, Gasly, Colapinto

The remaining 10 drivers readied themselves to battle it out in the decisive Q3, with Verstappen and the McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari duos joined by Sainz, Alonso and Bearman for the final shootout.

Most of the pack had opted for fresh soft tyres, while Piastri, Bearman, Alonso and Sainz had bolted on used sets. And once the first runs had been completed, Verstappen again went fastest to claim provisional pole on a lap of 1m 32.510s, going 0.394s clear of Norris.

Russell and Antonelli had slotted into third and fourth, with Bearman and Sainz beating Piastri while Alonso, Hamilton and Leclerc rounded out the order. The latter's time was some four seconds off that set by Verstappen – and it soon became clear why, with replays showing the Ferrari completing a 360-degree spin into the final corner.

Attentions then turned to the all-important final runs, for which everybody was sporting fresh tyres. There was concern at Red Bull over whether Verstappen would reach the line in time to start his lap – a worry that came to fruition as the Dutchman indeed missed out, meaning that he would need to rely on his earlier effort.

As the others put their own laps in, Verstappen's first time proved unbeatable. Norris slotted into second place – 0.291s back from Verstappen – while Leclerc was not far behind in third. Russell and Hamilton were next in the order, with Piastri back in sixth on a tough day for the Australian. Antonelli, Bearman, Sainz and Alonso, meanwhile, completed the top 10 for the United States Grand Prix.

“It was good,"" said polesitter Verstappen. ""I think in every segment, the car was very strong. Just trying to put the lap together sometimes here can be very tricky. It's very hot with very strong winds as well, and in the first sector, having that tailwind is challenging.

“The first run in Q3 was good, we managed to improve a little bit from Q2. Unfortunately, I couldn't do my final run. It was a bit messy with the out laps, but luckily, we didn't need it. For us, again, a very strong result.”

The 2025 United States Grand Grand Prix is set to begin at 1400 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from the Circuit of The Americas.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

There was a dramatic start to the Sprint at the United States Grand Prix, with McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both suffering a Lap 1 exit.

Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have each given their take on the Lap 1 melee that put them both out of the running in the Sprint at the United States Grand Prix.

While polesitter Max Verstappen held the lead from the McLaren pair off the line, chaos unfolded into the first corner as Piastri was tagged by the Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg.

This sent the Australian into a spin – which launched him into the other papaya car of Norris, immediately taking the Briton out.

Piastri tried to continue on, but the damage proved too significant and the championship leader was forced to pull off the track, bringing the Woking-based team's Sprint to an early end.

When asked for his take on the incident after the event, Norris suggested that the blame was with some drivers behind.

“I mean, what was I meant to do in that – I just got hit,” the 25-year-old said. “I did nothing wrong. Further back things happened, and I just got unlucky and I got hit because of it.

“I don't know, I need to look a bit more carefully. It's more people further back just being a bit careless, and we are the consequence of that.”

There was a similar assessment of what happened from Piastri. Pushed on how much it hurt to suffer a DNF, the nine-time race winner conceded: “It's obviously not ideal, but I actually haven't seen what happened yet.

“I tried to cut back on Lando – I mean, we were both very far from the apex and then got a hit, and he obviously sent me into Lando, so [it's] a shame.”

While Piastri remains at the top of the Drivers' Championship standings on 336 – with Norris 22 points adrift in P2 – Sprint winner Verstappen has now closed the gap down to 55 points in third place.

Isack Hadjar caused the first red flag of Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix with a heavy crash on his first flying lap of the session.

Five minutes into Q1, Hadjar lost the rear of his Racing Bulls machine into Turn 6, before spinning into the wall, causing significant damage.

The crash means that he will start Sunday's Grand Prix from either the back of the grid or the pit lane, depending on the repairs required or whether the team elects to alter the set up choices.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen closed the margin in the Formula 1 Drivers' Championship with victory in the United States Grand Prix Sprint.

Max Verstappen has targeted improvements for Sunday's United States Grand Prix, to ward off the unknown of McLaren's race pace, despite controlling Saturday's Sprint as he claimed another victory.

Verstappen closed to within 55 points of the Formula 1 Drivers' Championship lead after winning the Sprint at the Circuit of The Americas, capitalising on a dramatic Turn 1 collision that saw title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri retire.

As a result, despite his success, the four-time World Champion was cautious on his Grand Prix hopes bearing in mind McLaren did not get a chance to showcase what they could do in Austin.

“The start was good,” said Verstappen reflecting on the Sprint. “Then, of course, there was the Safety Car because of the Turn 1 incident, and it took a few laps after the Safety Car to have decent pace, so we need to try to figure out what was going on there.

“Nevertheless, we won the Sprint, which is the most important thing. Looking for tomorrow, I do think we need to be a bit better in race trim to be able to fight the McLarens, because we haven't seen anything from them.”

He added: “We'll have a look. Of course, we have some ideas of what we can do, and hopefully, we will just stick a bit better tomorrow.”

George Russell took advantage of the Turn 1 chaos to leap from sixth to second with the Mercedes driver also going on to make a bold lunge for the lead into Turn 12 following the Safety Car restart, but he was unable to keep within the confines of the track.

“I knew you don't get many opportunities with Max,” he said. “I saw half a chance and sent it. I was probably a bit too far behind, but I was glad I gave it a go. P2, for sure, was better than we could have expected, and some decent points.”

Asked for his view on the race-opening incident, he said: “I was on the outside and I fully sent it, then I realised that everyone on the inside had fully sent it as well. Carlos [Sainz] and I were like, ‘I don't think that's going to end too nicely'.

“I've not seen it, I've only seen it from my perspective, but it looked like it was three cars into one, which doesn't often go.”

Williams driver Sainz made his first podium appearance of the season last time out in Singapore, and finished third in the Austin Sprint after benefiting significantly thanks to the Lap 1 incident.

“We had a solid race,” said the Spaniard. “We had solid pace from Turn 1 on. The Ferraris were quick behind but we could keep them under control and we brought home the P3, which is really good.

“We're just getting a bit more lucky and things have stopped happening to us. But I've had this pace all year, it's just the first half of the year, I wasn't able to show it and to prove it, but now that things are running a lot smoother, I'm just doing everything I was in the first half. It's just that things are clicking and I'm just happy to show what we can do as a team.

“The car was great yesterday in Quali and today in the race. We lack a bit compared to these guys. Obviously, we cannot fight them, but we are still in the mix, which is good to see.”

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Nico Hulkenberg was unable to convert his season-best qualifying performance into points in the United States Grand Prix Sprint, after a collision with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri put the two McLaren drivers out of the race, and forced the German to pit with damage.

Nico Hulkenberg conceded his good work went ""in the bin"" after a Turn 1 collision with Oscar Piastri negated his season-best qualifying result in the United States Grand Prix Sprint.

Hulkenberg was one of the standout performers in Sprint Qualifying, as he reached the top-10 shootout for the first time this season, and ended the session fourth fastest, behind only the championship-chasing trio of Max Verstappen, Lando Norris, and Piastri.

With multiple lines possible at Turn 1 of the Circuit of The Americas, Hulkenberg found himself with cars on either side as the Sprint began, and made wheel-to-wheel contact with Piastri, which flung the Australian's McLaren onto two wheels and into the sister car of Norris – putting the two championship leaders out of the race.

“Big frustration,” said Hulkenberg reflecting on that moment. “All the good work from yesterday was put in the bin. We lost another front wing, which is also very annoying.”

Although Hulkenberg was able to continue following a pit stop for a new front wing, he finished outside the points, in 13th place.

“It was just messy,” he said of the collision, which the stewards deemed to be a racing incident.

“I saw a replay of it, and Oscar turned in pretty aggressively. He wanted to get the undercut and the run on the exit of Turn 1, but I was kind of there. I can't just disappear, and I had Fernando [Alonso] on the inside.

“I couldn't see him anymore. I saw in my peripheral vision that he had dived in, and then you don't see a car anymore, so I wanted to leave space for him in case he didn't have it under control.

“Then Oscar turned in, and contact was inevitable.”

While Hulkenberg was unable to deliver on his top-four start in the Sprint he will hope to rediscover his turn of pace when Qualifying gets underway later on.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

George Russell will line up in P4 for the United States Grand Prix, with Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli also reaching the top 10 in P7.

George Russell was left feeling that there could have been “more potential” in his performance during Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, with the Mercedes driver admitting that just missing out on the front row in P4 was “frustrating”.

Off the back of his victory last time out in Singapore, Russell enjoyed a positive outing in Saturday's Sprint by taking P2, having avoided the melee that unfolded on Lap 1 at the first corner.

The Briton could not quite repeat that outcome in Qualifying, though, meaning that he will line up behind Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc starts alongside him on the second row.

Asked to sum up his emotions at missing out on a spot at the very front, Russell responded: “Frustrating. The truth is [when] I crossed the line, I was pretty happy with my lap.

“Of course there could have been more potential in it, but that's the case for everybody and especially on a circuit like this. I'll take it, tomorrow's a new day. Need to get around Turn 1 – as we saw today, anything's possible.”

Having started from P5 in the Sprint, Russell was then pushed on whether his climb up to a final result of P2 gave him confidence that he could possibly convert his fourth place on Sunday's grid into a much higher position.

“Well, the Sprint ended up only being about 10 laps long and tomorrow we've got 50-odd laps, and we didn't see McLaren, so I'm not going to say I've got uber amounts of confidence going into tomorrow, but I don't think we're in a bad place,” the 27-year-old explained.

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, Kimi Antonelli progressed through to Q3, having missed out on the final segment during Friday's Sprint Qualifying.

The Italian ultimately claimed seventh place and, when quizzed later on what may have prevented him from going even further, answered: “Lap 1, I had on the main straight… We need to see what happened with the DRS but it didn't open, so I did the whole straight without DRS and lost a couple of tenths.

“The last lap, the front tyre didn't really work and I struggled a lot with the understeer. It's a shame because I was hoping for better, but we look forward to tomorrow.

“We didn't change so much [between the Sprint and Qualifying], to be honest. Just trying to keep a consistent car and looking on to tomorrow as well, because the wind is going to rotate quite a lot so it's going to affect a lot the balance. We tried to make the best car for Quali, but as well looking to tomorrow.”

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen, Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc report back after topping the timing sheets in Qualifying ahead of the United States Grand Prix.

1. Max Verstappen (Red Bull), 2. Lando Norris (McLaren), 3. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by David Coulthard)

Q: Max, you just missed out on starting that final lap. You didn't need it. That was a super impressive qualifying. Put us in the cockpit.

Max VERSTAPPEN: Yeah, it was good. I think every segment the car was very strong. Just trying to put the lap together around here sometimes can be quite tricky. Also, it's very hot, very strong winds as well. And then in that first sector, having a tailwind is challenging, let's say it like that. Yeah, the first run in Q3 was good, just managed to improve a little bit from Q2 unfortunately, and I couldn't do my final run. It was a bit messy with the out laps. But luckily, like you said, we didn't need it. So, yeah, for us, again, a very strong result.

Q: It's been a super Saturday for you. Just explain to me and to our audience the difference in how this track's evolved in qualifying from yesterday to where you are today.

MV: Yeah, again, just tricky with the wind. The wind picked up today compared to yesterday, and it managed to turn as well, a little bit. So, like a full-on tailwind into all the ‘Esses', and with that you just lose downforce. So the car is moving around a lot more even compared to yesterday. That made it a bit harder. Of course, in some corners you gain a bit of lap time back, but you can't commit as much as you normally can in Sector 1.

Q: Well, excellent. You did it very well, nonetheless. Now, Lando, you had to work hard for that. It was looking tight, but right at the very end, you found a lap. So it looked like you were not as comfortable as a team until that final lap.

Lando NORRIS: Well, I improved like, I don't know, half a tenth or a tenth. It was a bit more of a struggle today for whatever reason. Yesterday, I was just quite comfortable. And I don't know if it's just everyone else has improved a bit or the wind today hurt us a bit more. But we were both struggling quite a bit more today just to put the laps in and to be as quick as this guy. So we were pushing, and I'm so happy with P2. It could have been worse, but there was no chance we could have gone pole today.

Q: And that sets you up nicely for the race start tomorrow. You had a bit of experience of that earlier today. So, clean run hopefully at the start?

LN: Yeah. Yeah, just don't get hit — that's my clue for tomorrow. But I look forward to hopefully having a good race with Max. You know, we've had some good ones in the past, so I'm looking forward to it again.

Q: Excellent. We're looking forward to it. Now, Charles, you came very late right to the front. How did you find that pace? And we heard from the two drivers there just how difficult the conditions were.

Charles LECLERC: Yeah, I mean, it was quite a big surprise, especially considering the weekend that has been very difficult for us since the beginning. We tried and put everything together in qualifying. We managed to do so, but I think there are still things we need to understand from this car because there's a bit too much of a swing of performance in the same weekend without fundamentally changing the car. So we'll look into it. But it's been an interesting Sprint race this morning. I think we've learned a lot. We applied that in qualifying and it seems to be working. So I hope that from now on we kind of catch back a little bit.

Q: Yeah, well you never stop learning in this game. But overall, solid day today. Set you up well for the Grand Prix tomorrow?

CL: Yeah. Our car is normally stronger in the race than it is in qualifying. So that's a positive. I don't know if it's strong enough to go and fight with Max and McLaren, but we'll do everything. Hopefully a good start like this morning or last year and then focus to stay in front.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Max, what a lap. You only needed the one to secure the pole this evening. Just talk us through it.

MV: Yeah. It was, I think, a good qualifying. I think the conditions weren't easy, with stronger winds today compared to yesterday. So, Sector 1, yeah, it was a bit harder to be consistent because the car was moving around everywhere. But I guess everyone, of course, is in the same boat with that. And then, yeah, just Q1, Q2, just trying to progress every time with the lap time. I didn't feel like in Q3 the track was actually any better — maybe slightly worse, actually, I think for a lot of people. But, yeah, just trying to find a little bit more pace. And luckily it was there in the car, so just seemed a little step forward compared to yesterday's qualifying.

Q: And how did Isack Hadjar's accident in Q1 affect the track conditions? Did that delay change the track in any way when you next went back out?

MV: I think it just made you aware that it was quite tricky around there, which was the case throughout the whole qualifying. The car was quite loose in that area, so I can understand what happened there. And, yeah, you just had to deal with that for the rest of qualifying.

Q: Let's throw it forward. You weren't overly happy with the car in the Sprint this morning. Have you made any changes between then and now? And just give us your thoughts on the race for tomorrow.

MV: Yeah. I hope it's better for tomorrow. It's difficult to say right now what will happen, of course, also tomorrow. But at least I felt a bit happier with the car compared to yesterday's qualifying, and I hope that's enough then for the race tomorrow.

Q: Very well done. Thank you, Max. Lando, well done to you too. Another front row start for you here. How was quali? How difficult was it to extract that lap time from this car?

LN: Too difficult. I mean, comparing to yesterday… Yesterday, I was pretty happy with everything and things came a bit easier. Today, not so much. And I think that was clear already in Q1, Q2, and Q3. So, yeah, I guess some stuff for us to look into why we probably struggled a bit more compared to yesterday, like Max said. And we know that the wind and temperature and stuff was a little bit different. So, yeah, some things for us to figure out. Not my best lap — I said that on the radio after. So, yeah, just not a great session. So to be P2 I'm still pretty happy with.

Q: And no repercussions from the accident earlier? The car was fine in that respect?

LN: Yeah. The boys and girls did a good job to get everything back and prepared. Obviously, never the best preparation for everyone to be rushing to put the car back together, but that was all fine.

Q: Lando, let's throw it forward. No mileage in the Sprint earlier. How much of an unknown is the race tomorrow as a result? How much of an advantage do these guys here have over you because they completed the Sprint?

LN: I think quite a bit, honestly, because we've not done — I don't think I've done more than three laps in a row and not more than, like, 40 kilos of fuel. So, I have no idea. We don't know if it's going to be amazing or terrible, certainly around here because it's so difficult with the bumps and the bottoming and the winds. It's unpredictable. So, we were hoping to learn a lot this morning in the Sprint, in terms of how the car set-up was going to be from quali to race and how it changes and the things that are good and bad. And then hopefully make tweaks for this quali for the race tomorrow. But obviously that didn't go to plan. So, yeah, we're certainly on the back foot, but I guess we will try not to use that as an excuse tomorrow.

Q: Alright. Good luck with that. Thank you. And Charles, well done to you. A much better quali today than yesterday. What's changed?

CL: Well, we've changed a few things, but it's not like there's been something that we've done a massive change with. It was all about fine tuning. There's something more specific that I've changed on my side, which I think went towards my driving style a little bit and maybe that helped. But a swing of performance like from yesterday to today is still to be understood, to be completely honest. There was more wind. We know that with our car, this is normally a strong point, which probably helped us today. But again, it's a big swing of performance, so we still need to understand.

Q: How different does the car feel here this year compared to last year when you had such a successful time?

CL: Not that different. It's just that the overall performance is very poor. So actually, it's pretty similar to last year in terms of qualifying pace to race pace. We seem to be pretty strong in race pace, but in qualifying pace, we don't quite find the grip that the others have. Especially in the first sector, we tend to struggle a lot with the grip there and that costs a lot of lap time for the rest of the lap. So, yeah, pretty similar, just slower.

Q: Looking to tomorrow then, you say you have good race pace. Can you hang on to these two? Even beat them maybe?

CL: I don't know. A good start like last year probably will help with the free air, but I don't think that we quite have that pace in the car. But never say never. I think last year, we were very surprised once we got into free air to see the amount of pace there was in the car. I hope we can have the same surprise tomorrow, but for now, it seems unlikely.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Andrew Benson – BBC Sport) Lando, for you. I've seen your comments about the incident at the first corner in the Sprint — that you were saying that Oscar got hit. Other people in the paddock think that maybe he was a bit ambitious with his cutback. Has the team reviewed it together yet? And what is your view specifically on that incident and what happened?

LN: I mean, like all things we do as a team, it'll be reviewed. I think it probably takes a bit more time to understand everything, and certainly just before qualifying and probably before the race tomorrow is not the best time. So, yeah, I think things will be reviewed to just understand a few more things. But apart from that, you know, it's nothing I can do. Like, I just have to crack on and do my own thing. I was pretty unlucky to not have a chance to race earlier. And, yeah, that's not just hurt me yesterday or today, but also for the race tomorrow in terms of preparation. So, yeah, it was a difficult time. But I said what I said, and I won't add any more.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Another one for Lando. In terms of the picture of this title race, particularly with Oscar a few places back and the momentum that's swinging back and forth at the moment, how crucial is tomorrow's race? And from P2 on the grid — that lap at the end you said didn't feel the best, but it's put you in a good spot at least.

LN: Yeah. I mean, I think before the weekend, I was asked what's going to help me get further up. At the minute, it's just consistency. I think on a day like today, it's just clear we're not as quick as the Red Bull and therefore we have to be happy with the P2 because that's the best we could have done today, you know. So, yeah, similar to like the questions and stuff, it's just not getting distracted by the mess and the nonsense around that everyone creates and just focus on doing my laps, doing my own job, focusing on trying to get good results and a good performance. But certainly with my position tomorrow and knowing our form in race pace compared to quali, we know Saturdays have just never been as good this year. So I'm hoping we can turn it up a little bit tomorrow and be a bit quicker.

Q: (Sahil Kapur – NBC) Question for Max and for Lando. Max, you said earlier that if the McLarens had gone on in the Sprint race, you weren't sure you'd be able to stay ahead. Based on what you saw in qualifying and maybe some changes in your car, do you still worry that you might not be able to stay ahead? And, Lando, I wonder race pace-wise just how optimistic you feel tomorrow about the win.

MV: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I mean, we changed some things on the car and hopefully that will help tomorrow, and that's the most important. But, yeah, we'll find out. I mean, I don't really think about it too much. I'm confident that I think we improved the car and hopefully we can show that.

LN: I have to be optimistic. Silly not to be. But, you know, I think every single lap that we did today was between, what, five tenths to — three to five tenths off of Max. So to turn that around completely tomorrow, I think it's going to be pretty difficult. I think normally when we have better Sundays, we're quite a bit closer than three to five tenths. And I'm sure if Max did his final lap, he probably would have gone a good step quicker again. So, yeah, not the most hopeful in terms of how our performance was today, but may as well be hopeful anyway.

Q: Lando, did you expect the Red Bull to be as quick here as it is?

LN: They've been quick in many races recently. You know, the last month, two months,  they've been doing a very good job — both Max and Red Bull. They've just been doing a good job and have seemed to catch us up a little bit. And, you know, we're not talking a lot — it's just enough that they're a bit more consistently ahead and on the front row. And when you're on the front row and can have nice races, it can get you a lot of points and give you a lot of opportunities. And then, of course, Max is the one who makes the most of them. So, yeah, I think most places we go now, we think Red Bull will be our biggest competitor, and that's how it's been for the last few months — and I'd say the whole year.

Q: (Nigel Chiu – Sky Sports) Lando, on a track like this — Turn 1 and how tight it is — is it just naturally and instinctively a little bit harder to be racing your team-mate compared to someone else? Obviously, you don't want to clash with anyone, but if it's your team-mate, is there a kind of natural instinct to be a bit more cautious, perhaps? Is it a bit more challenging?

LN: I mean, it's a challenging track. I think Turn 1 is a challenge in itself. You know, it's never easy, but I think there are quite common situations that cause crashes over the last few years, and one of them happened again today. So, yeah, I think you just have to be aware of what happens on different tracks, different Turn 1s. That's part of our job as drivers. But, I mean, as team-mates and as a team, we don't want these things to happen. We've said that every single time, and it's the truth. So, yeah, like I said, we'll review it and keep going racing.

Q: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Max, congratulations on pole. What happened at the end there? Why did you miss doing your final push run?

MV: Yeah. There were just some people in front that were just leaving like ten seconds, easily. So, yeah, then you just run out of time. Then I had two cars in front of me. They were racing as well. I think they set purple sectors on the out lap. Yeah. That's not ideal. So, yeah, we just ran out of time.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Yuki Tsunoda was irked by perceived blocking from Liam Lawson in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, leading him to accuse the Racing Bulls driver of causing such instances ""on purpose"".

Yuki Tsunoda has hit out at Liam Lawson for “always doing something on purpose” after complaining of being blocked by the Racing Bulls driver in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix.

Tsunoda and Lawson have been involved in a number of skirmishes this season, after Red Bull switched the pair after two weekends, promoting the former to partner Max Verstappen ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix weekend while the latter dropped back down to the junior squad alongside Isack Hadjar.

Their previous flashpoints included an earlier incident this weekend in Sprint Qualifying, when the two battled through the first corners in a failed bid to set a last-gasp time.

Added tension exists with speculation that the two are battling for a single seat on the 2026 grid, with rumours that Isack Hadjar will join Red Bull and Formula 2 driver Arvid Lindblad could make the step up to F1 with Racing Bulls.

“With Lawson, it's just the usual story,” said Tsunoda when asked about the potential on-track blocking incident involving the New Zealander.

“He's always doing something on purpose, and it's b*******, so it's him. I don't care about him, to be honest.""

Tsunoda, who will start the United States Grand Prix in 13th – one place behind Lawson – was further irked by blocking from one of the Alpine drivers, although he brushed this off as “maybe just miscommunication from their side”.

He added: “I think, without that, I would have been in Q3. So far, I just can't have normal Qualifying. It's really frustrating but it is what it is.”

On the other side of the fence, Lawson was left bemused by his rival's comments when asked.

“I've absolutely no idea what he's talking about,” he said. “I think traffic is always a little bit tough around here, to be honest. But this weekend it has been something that we've all been dealing with. We got hit real bad yesterday in sector one.

“I can't possibly think where I could have been to be in front of him, but it's just one of those things.”

Racing Bulls have shown strong pace across the weekend so far, but a heavy crash for Hadjar in Q1 and Lawson's Q2 exit leaves plenty of work to be done on Sunday if the team is to add to its points haul.

Of his final effort, Lawson added: “We had a very fast car, we just got hit by a massive gust of wind at the start of the lap and then, from there, you're trying to make up lap time.

“It sucks. The car has been very, very quick. Unfortunately, it's just one of those things. We're all dealing with it, but we get hit at different points and unfortunately, it's cost us quite a lot of lap time.”

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

IndyCar winner and F1 TV analyst James Hinchcliffe finally got to try an F1 car – and says it gave him a whole new appreciation for the mental capacity required to be a top level Grand Prix driver.

For several years now I have been (sort of) jokingly pitching a feature to my bosses at F1 TV. The thought was that although I was an experienced racer in many categories, having never raced in F1, there were some things that were harder for me to analyze.

“As an analyst this presents a problem,” I would say to them. “A quick fix to that would be to find a way for me to get a few laps in a car to understand the systems, procedures and capabilities.”

While my bosses liked the idea from the get go, the harder part was going to be finding a team willing to give me that chance. Laps in F1 cars are a scarce commodity.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton delivered a strong Qualifying performance for Ferrari, with both drivers set to start the United States Grand Prix from the top five positions.

Charles Leclerc was surprised by Ferrari's pace in Qualifying at the United States Grand Prix, as he and team mate Lewis Hamilton secured third and fifth places for Sunday's race.

Ferrari had struggled for pace in Austin prior to Qualifying, with Leclerc and Hamilton enduring disappointing Sprint Qualifying sessions on Friday, finishing P10 and P8 respectively. The pair then went on to gain ground in Saturday's Sprint largely by avoiding the chaos of Turn 1 as the McLaren duo of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri crashed out after being caught up in a multi-car incident.

However, the situation turned around for Grand Prix Qualifying as the Scuderia were a constant threat at the top of the time sheets, leaving Leclerc scratching his head after sealing third on the grid.

“It was quite a big surprise, especially considering the weekend that has been very difficult for us since the beginning,” he said.

“We tried to put everything together in Qualifying, we managed to do so, but I think there are still things that we need to understand from this car, because there is a bit too much of a swing in performance across the same weekend without fundamentally changing the car, so we will look into it.”

Taking confidence from Ferrari often showing stronger pace in Grands Prix compared to Qualifying, Leclerc conceded that he will need to make progress early if he is to maximise the potential of the SF-25.

“I think everything will be down to the start and having free air,” he said. “If we are behind other cars after Turn 1, it is going to be tough. If we are in front of everybody, it is going to be easier, so flat out into Turn 1 tomorrow.”

Leclerc's team mate Hamilton is the most successful driver at the Circuit of The Americas with five wins – the last of which came in 2017.

After battling through a difficult first year with Ferrari, the seven-time World Champion is yet to stand on a Grand Prix podium in his new colours, something which he hopes to change on Sunday.

“It's the closest I've been in God knows how long,” said Hamilton. “It's taken me forever. It's not for the lack of trying, but I'm going to give it absolutely everything to try and get there tomorrow.”

Ferrari is engaged in a finely poised battle with Mercedes and Red Bull for the Teams' Championship. With Max Verstappen on pole and both George Russell and Kimi Antonelli qualifying inside the top seven, Sunday is likely to provide another tense chapter in this fight.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Lance Stroll will serve a grid penalty for Sunday's United States Grand Prix following an incident in Saturday's action-packed Sprint.

Lance Stroll has been hit with a five-place grid penalty for the United States Grand Prix following a collision with the Haas of Esteban Ocon during Saturday's Sprint.

As the action-packed 100 kilometre dash entered into its final stages, Stroll tried to overtake Ocon into Turn 1 – but the Aston Martin driver locked up and hit his rival, putting Ocon out of the running.

While Stroll initially tried to continue on, he subsequently pulled off the track owing to the damage on his AMR25. The incident was then investigated after the Sprint, with the stewards ultimately deciding to hand the Canadian a five-place grid drop for Sunday's race.

Stroll has also received two penalty points on his licence, bringing his total across the last 12 months to seven points.

A document released following the stewards' hearing – in which they heard from Stroll, Ocon and their respective team representatives – reads: “Car 18 attempted an inside overtake on Car 31 into Turn 1 but misjudged the braking point and collided with Car 31.

“The stewards determine that the driver of Car 18 is wholly at fault and apply a penalty accordingly.

“As the driver to be penalized did not finish the race a grid penalty equalling a 10 seconds time penalty is imposed.”

Stroll and Ocon were two of five drivers to record a DNF in the Sprint, with the McLaren pair of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri – along with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso – retiring from the event on Lap 1 following a first corner melee.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen will start on pole for the United States Grand Prix, but his session was not without drama as he missed out on the opportunity to set a second time in Q3.

Max Verstappen has explained how he missed out on a final effort in Qualifying at the United States Grand Prix, after his first effort proved enough to secure pole.

The four-time World Champion will line up at the head of the field for Sunday's Grand Prix at the Circuit of The Americas as he looks to further cut the 55-point margin in the Drivers' Standings to leader Oscar Piastri, with the Red Bull man's victory in the Sprint earlier on Saturday helping to reduce the gap as Piastri and team mate Lando Norris crashed out at the first turn.

However, Qualifying took a late twist for Verstappen as he was unable to start his final flying lap before the chequered flag fell, leaving him vulnerable to the chasing pack.

Despite the best efforts of his rivals, the four-time World Champion's 1m 32.510s effort proved insurmountable, leaving the Red Bull pit wall to breathe a sigh of relief – this after Yuki Tsunoda had lost out in a similar scenario in Sprint Qualifying on Friday.

“I was actually okay,” said Verstappen when asked if he had felt worried in the closing stages.

“I was just a bit disappointed at what was going on ahead. Just a lot of people were leaving 10-12 second gaps, which you can't really anticipate gaps that big. So we missed out by a couple of seconds, which is not ideal, but luckily, it didn't matter.”

Verstappen had complained of a loose rear end in Sprint Qualifying, with the rear seeming similarly skittish at stages in the Sprint on his way to victory. With a change in the wind for Qualifying, this was again something he was forced to manage.

“The wind picked up today compared to yesterday, and it managed to turn a little bit, so a full-on tailwind into all of the esses, so you just lose downforce,” Verstappen explained.

“The car is moving around a lot more, even compared to yesterday, so that made it a bit harder.

“Of course, in some corners, you gain a bit of lap time back, but you can't commit as much as you normally can into sector one.”

Verstappen will look to take Grand Prix victory in Austin on Sunday as he continues to mount a fightback for the Drivers' title, with rivals Norris and Piastri starting second and sixth respectively on the grid.

Experts will look for commentary on how a strong content slate will affect the current fourth quarter and how gaming and podcasting may impact 2026, as AI and other worries have put pressure on the stock.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Sure, there was some recent chatter about whether Netflix would consider a competing for Warner Bros. Discovery, which is being pursued by David Ellison's Paramount. But during its October 21 earnings results, the streamer is likely to keep the spotlight on Kpop Demon Hunters, the Sony animated film that has become the service's most successful movie ever and which Wall Street is touting as boosting engagement and likely subscribers in the recently closed third quarter.


	With Netflix stepping up to the third-quarter earnings plate after the market close on Tuesday, Kpop characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey are expected to be MVPs. But investors will also already focus on how a strong content slate will play out in the current final quarter of 2025. That may explain why the stock has trended lower over the past week.

	But the stocks have been underperforming for a while amid questions about how AI could impact the streamer. “Shares have lagged the Nasdaq … since end of June, with concerns over engagement growth and the competitive threat from AI-generated content weighing on sentiment,” Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote on Friday. “We remain bullish, expecting strong second-half 2025 financial results, including potential advertising upside and engagement growth.” He reiterated his “overweight” rating with a $1,500 stock price target.

Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino similarly said: “Amid concerns of AI's possible impact on streaming economics and after very sharp third-quarter [stock] underperformance, we are buyers of Netflix.” He stuck to his “outperform” rating and $1,390 stock price target on the company.


	“Since May, the story has encountered Google's Veo 3, Meta's Vibes, Midjourney's AI video generator, and OpenAI's Sora 2,” the analyst wrote in his report entitled “Hey ChatGPT, Should I Buy NFLX?,” which is Netflix's stock ticker symbol. “While limited to short-form video now, AI's dramatic strides in video fuel concerns that AI video creation will degrade the value of streaming leadership.”


	His conclusion: “Netflix's widening growth strategies, superior scale, and rich cash flow position it to extend its lead in long-form video streaming, which continues to take wallet share from pay-TV.”


	Investors and experts will also listen out for management commentary on the progress of its advertising tier business and newer initiatives, such as this week's news that Spotify video podcasts will come to Netflix in the U.S. in early 2026, followed by other markets. Initial Spotify Studios and The Ringer titles set to hit Netflix include The Bill Simmons Podcast, The Zach Lowe Show, The McShay Show, The Rewatchables, and Conspiracy Theories.


Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon, who has an “outperform” rating and $1,390 stock price target on the streamer, is bullish heading into the latest results. “Netflix engagement rebounded in the third quarter, driven almost entirely by KPop Demon Hunters,” he wrote in his earnings preview. “Netflix's global engagement rose modestly quarter-over-quarter, reversing the second-quarter dip that came with a weaker content slate last quarter.”

	











	The expert highlighted that KPop Demon Hunters added “roughly 500 million viewing hours, with another about 400 million expected in the fourth quarter.” His conclusion: “There are always big hits that meaningfully move the engagement needle, though one of this magnitude is atypical for Netflix, or any player.”


	Yoon expects all that to add up to around 7 million Netflix subscribers net adds for the third quarter. “Growth was strong in international regions, primarily in Latin America,” he wrote. “Non-English content continues to be the driving force behind growth, and younger audience segments lead the growth this quarter.”


Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich seemed to reference the KPop Demon Hunters success in her Netflix earnings preview, entitled “Hunting down hits.” She has a “buy” rating and $1,490 price objective on the stock.


	“We anticipate that Netflix's third-quarter results will be at least in line with guidance on key metrics including revenue, operating income and earnings per share,” she noted. “Netflix continued to execute on its high-profile live event's strategy, with Canelo-Crawford bringing in an estimated total of 41.4 million viewers, making it the most-viewed men's championship boxing match of the century. In August, KPopDemon Hunters became the most watched Netflix film of all time (325 million views), indicating the company's continued ability to scale massive hits out of relatively unknown IP.”

	











	Remember the recent engagement gains? Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris used those for a pun in a recent report, entitling it “Congratulations on Your Engagement.” “Investor conversations remain focused on Netflix viewership engagement trends and implications for longer-term revenue growth and margin expansion,” he wrote. “We expect member engagement to accelerate into year-end, benefiting from a fourth-quarter slate highlighted by the final season of Stranger Things, Jake Paul vs. Tank Davis, and the NFL on Christmas Day.”


	His bullish stance meant he stuck to his “buy” rating and $1,450 stock price target.


UBS analyst John Hodulik also maintained his “buy” rating on Netflix shares with a $1,495 price target, highlighting a strong content slate.


	“We expect member growth (management cited strong end to the second quarter), higher pricing and increased ad revenues to support 17 percent revenue and 25 percent operating income growth in the third quarter, in-line with guidance, versus 16 percent/45 percent last quarter,” he wrote. “We believe the return of marquee shows (Squid Game June 27th; Wednesday Aug. 6th) and new hits (KPop Demon Hunters, Untamed) provided a tailwind to engagement/monetization.”


	And he expects this trend to continue in the current fourth quarter, “with Monster, The Witcher, Stranger Things and NFL content all on the slate.”


BMO Equity Research analyst Brian Pitz is also bullish. In a report entitled “Keeping Eyeballs Locked on Screen With Content Slate, Podcasting, and Gaming,” he maintained his “outperform” rating with a $1,425 stock price target.

	











	“We continue to be bullish on the name given record-breaking KPop Demon Hunters viewership data, an attractive content slate in the second half of 2025, and a strong slate lineup in 2026,” he wrote. “We expect incremental growth in 2026, driven by a strong content lineup, the Spotify podcasting deal, push further into gaming, and AVOD ramp-up.”


Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos, who has a “hold” rating without a price target, argued in his preview report that, for most on Wall Street and beyond, “the real question and focus will be on fourth-quarter guidance” on Tuesday. He forecasts a gain of 5.8 million subscribers, “which would put Netflix comfortably in the north of 320 million global paying subs.”


	As is quite often the case with the streamer, things could turn out better than projected. “If, as we suspect, there was in the second quarter, there was upside to that number, that would be the likeliest driver of revenue outperformance,” Kurnos highlighted.


	If his forecasts prove accurate, “AVOD would become an estimated one-third of all global paid users in the third quarter – an intriguing milestone,” Kurnos concluded.


	Now, how about that chatter about a possible WBD bid? Kurnos remains cautious on Netflix's stock because of its high price and bid uncertainty. “We are going to opt to maintain the hold rating for now, with shares trading at almost 33 times 2026 estimated adjusted operating income, and, although a seemingly low probability, the lurking specter of Netflix taking a swing on the M&A front, creating some longer-tailed doubt in investor minds,” he wrote.

	











	Of course, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters recently responded to a question about a possible WBD play that media deals “don't have an amazing track record.”


	And Yoon wrote: “We have considered the scenario, but not as a likely outcome, largely because it is unclear what strategic value Netflix would realize.”

The ""Manchild"" singer doubled up as the host and musical guest for the third episode of season 51. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Sabrina Carpenter‘s Saturday Night Live hosting debut kicked off with a fun callback to none other than the viral Domingo skit — with a modern pop twist.


	The “Manchild” singer returned to the late night show on Saturday, where she doubled up as the night's host and musical guest. The cold open kicked off with another homecoming of Chloe Fineman‘s Kelsey character and her group of best friends, including Carpenter.




	True to the original skit, Kelsey's girl squad recounted their Nashville night out in front of her husband Matt (Andrew Dismukes) in full song form, set to the tune of some of the most popular modern tracks. They recalled their festivities by singing along to the backtrack of Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” and Lady Gaga's “Abracadabra,” before Marcello Hernández‘s beloved Domingo character made his grand entrance (and return) to profess his love to Fineman's Kelsey, set to Alex Warren's track “Ordinary.”

	The original Domingo skit instantly went viral, originally featuring Carpenter's “Espresso” as Kelsey's bridesmaids confessed that she had cheated on her husband-to-be with Domingo. The Grammy winner wasn't actually featured in the original bit, though fellow pop star Ariana Grande was. (Carpenter did star in the SNL 50 Domingo sequel, though.)

	Later in Carpenter's opening monologue, she lightly addressed the controversy surrounding the cover art for her latest album, Man's Best Friend. Pointing back to her last appearance on the show during SNL 50, she noted that “since then, my new album Man's Best Friend came out, which I'm so excited about. But some people got a little freaked out by the cover.”

	











	“I'm not sure why. It was just this: me on all fours with an unseen figure pulling my hair. But what people don't realize is, that's just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it's clearly a picture from the 50th anniversary special of Bowen helping me up by the hair,” she said, as the shot of the album cover zoomed out, continuing, “After Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line.”


	The “Bed Chem” singer used the rest of her monologue to “clear up some misconceptions people have about me,” joking that “everyone thinks of me as this horndog pop star, but there's really so much more to me.”


	“I'm not just horny, I'm also turned on, and I'm sexually charged. And I love to read. My favorite book is the encyclopedia. It's so big and it's hard…” she said, before continuing, “There is a real person underneath all the sparkles and the wigs and the corsets, and another thing you might not know about me is that I love to interact with the audience during my show, so I'd like to do that right now.”


	She went on to touch base with a few audience members before returning to the stage, where she continued another one of her concert traditions: “The last fun thing I like to do at my concerts is arrest someone for being hot. So, who here can I arrest tonight?”


	Kenan Thompson then hit the stage, where he joked that he was arresting the singer “for falsely impersonating an officer 200 times at your concerts. And you're arresting innocent hot people.”

	Saturday night marked Carpenter's first SNL hosting gig, while it was the second time she served as the night's musical guest. She, too, notably performed a rendition of Simon & Garfunkel's “Homeward Bound” alongside Paul Simon at the 50th anniversary special. 


	Ahead of the show, Bowen Yang took to his Instagram Stories to note that he was missing the taping. The Wicked star skipped episode three to attend the 2025 Academy Museum Gala, where he was honored with the Vantage Award.


	The “Espresso” singer served as the third overall host of season 51, following in the footsteps of Bad Bunny and Amy Poehler. Earlier this week, the next wave of SNL guests were announced. Miles Teller will host on Nov. 1, while Nikki Glaser and Glen Powell are set to make their hosting debuts on the Nov. 8 and Nov. 15 shows, respectively. 


	Last Saturday's show was full of star-studded cameos, as former cast member Poehler brought back fellow SNL alumni Tina Fey and Seth Meyers throughout the episode. Fey also made a cameo to impersonate Kristi Noem in the cold open, while Poehler portrayed Pam Bondi.

Rivers is remembered as ""a once-in-a-lifetime kind of human"" in an emotional tribute from the band.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



	Sam Rivers, longtime bass player and a founding member of Limp Bizkit, has died. He was 48.


	The band (Fred Durst, Wes Borland, John Otto and DJ Lethal) revealed the news of Rivers' death Saturday night (Oct. 18) in a tribute to the musician titled “In Loving Memory of Our Brother, Sam Rivers,” in a post on Instagram.


	“Today we lost our brother. Our bandmate. Our heartbeat,” Limp Bizkit wrote on Saturday of Rivers, who was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1977 and was one third of the original formation of Limp Bizkit in 1994, alongside vocalist Durst and drummer Otto. (Borland and DJ Lethal joined in 1996.)

	“Sam Rivers wasn't just our bass player — he was pure magic,” his band members said. “The pulse beneath every song, the calm in the chaos, the soul in the sound. From the first note we ever played together, Sam brought a light and a rhythm that could never be replaced. His talent was effortless, his presence unforgettable, his heart enormous.”

	











	Their statement continued: “We shared so many moments — wild ones, quiet ones, beautiful ones — and every one of them meant more because Sam was there. He was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of human. A true legend of legends. And his spirit will live forever in every groove, every stage, every memory. We love you, Sam. We'll carry you with us, always. Rest easy, brother. Your music never ends.”




	DJ Lethal left an additional comment on Instagram, writing, “We love you Sam Rivers. Please respect the family's privacy at this moment. Give Sam his flowers and play Sam Rivers basslines all day! We are in shock. Rest in power my brother! You will live on through your music and the lives you helped save with your music, charity work and friendships. We are heartbroken. Enjoy every millisecond of life. It's not guaranteed.”


	Rivers' cause of death has not been revealed.


	He was diagnosed with liver disease in 2011 and received a liver transplant in 2017. Within this time period, he took a short hiatus from his work with Limp Bizkit — but was back with the band by 2018. 


	Limp Bizkit's breakthrough came with the nu-metal band's 1997 debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all — featuring their cover version of George Michael's “Faith,” which picked up radio airplay and had a music video in rotation on MTV and the network's then-popular TRL (Total Request Live). But it was their 1999 sophomore album Significant Other that reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for the first time, and the set received three Grammy nominations — in the categories of best rock album and best hard rock performance (for their hit “Nookie,” as well as album track “Take a Look Around”). They'd have another Billboard 200 No. 1 with the 2000 album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.


	To date Limp Bizkit has released a total of six full-length studio albums, with the most recent being 2021's Still Sucks.

	











	Limp Bizkit recently returned to No. 1 on a Billboard chart for the first time since 2011. The single “Making Love to Morgan Wallen” debuted atop Hot Hard Rock Songs, Alternative Digital Song Sales and Hard Rock Digital Song Sales the week of Sept. 27, 2025.

	In her second time as a Saturday Night Live musical guest and as a first-time host, Grammy winner Sabrina Carpenter wasted no time in delving into controversy in her signature cheeky style.


	The late-night sketch show — which began late tonight due to college football — eschewed its typical political satire for a Domingo reunion during its Cold Open, featuring a reprisal by Marcello Hernandez and Carpenter. Taking to the stage fresh off of the intro, Carpenter addressed the internet furor over the cover art for her most recently released album, Man's Best Friend.

	“Some people got a little freaked out by the cover,” she said, alluding to fan concerns it was unfeminist. “I'm not sure why? It was just this: me on all fours, with an unseen figure pulling my hair. But what people don't realize is that's just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it's clearly a picture from the 50th anniversary special of Bowen [Yang] helping me up by the hair — after Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line, saying something like, ‘Daddy need his mini quiche.'” (As reported earlier, Bowen Yang is absent this episode.) 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The “Espresso” singer continued, wanting to “clear up some misconceptions” about her public persona. “Everyone thinks of me as this horned-up pop star, but there's really so much more to me,” she quipped. “I'm not just horny. I'm also turned-on, and I'm sexually charged, and I love to read. My favorite book is the encyclopedia. It's so big, and it's hard.”


	Carpenter, who is the first person to be pulling double-duty this season, also pulled from her concert repertoire to interact with the audience. As she moved to “arrest” someone for being hot — a mainstay bit from her tour — veteran Kenan Thompson popped up to jail her in turn for impersonating a cop hundreds of times.


	Watch the full monologue above.

	As Sabrina Carpenter pulled double duty on this weekend's Saturday Night Live, the show's censor couldn't quite keep up.


	While performing her track ‘Nobody's Son' from her seventh album Man's Best Friend, the 2x Grammy winner dropped two F-bombs that made it onto NBC‘s East Coast broadcast, as well as Peacock‘s simulcast.


	“He sure f*cked me up,” sang Carpenter twice in her karate-themed performance at Studio 8H. It's unclear if NBC will face a fine or other consequences from the FCC. Deadline has reached out to both for comment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	According to a source close to the show, the episode was fixed for the West Coast and future airings. The word has since been scrubbed from the performance on Peacock and YouTube.

	











	But for many watching live, the moment did not go unnoticed. “Sabrina saying f*ck TWICE on live national television is the most Sabrina Carpenter thing ever she dgaf im crying,” wrote one fan on X.


	“Never leave Sabrina Carpenter unsupervised she's gonna drop the f bomb on national television,” another posted.


	“Sabrina Carpenter said f*ck on SNL justice for Jenny Slate,” someone else wrote.


SNL previously faced similar controversy last season when Ego Nwodim‘s ‘Weekend Update' call-and-response bit elicited some expletives form the live studio audience. But the show avoided an FCC probe as the West Coast delay was censored, and the East Coast broadcast aired after the 6am-10pm window during which obscene content is prohibited on broadcast TV and radio.


	Marking her third appearance on the NBC sketch comedy show, Carpenter served as celebrity guest host and musical guest on this weekend's Saturday Night Live, also performing her song ‘Manchild'.

The president of the United States of America threatens, attacks and literally writes that he hates American citizens (“I hate Taylor Swift”) on a daily basis, and half this country idiotically cheers him on…I think this country can handle a pop star saying the word f*ck.

Saturday Night Live repertory player Bowen Yang is set to miss tonight's taping of the late-night sketch show, the comedian and actor confirmed on his Instagram Story.


	He wrote, “missing the show tonight but it will be sooooo fun sab is amazing,” referencing Grammy-winning pop star Sabrina Carpenter‘s double-duty showing for the Lorne Michaels-created series.


	As indicated on the Wicked star's social media, the absence is pre-planned, as the podcast host is set to receive the Vantage Award as an Academy Museum Gala honoree in Los Angeles. “A trailblazer bringing laughter, heart, and representation to the screen. Congratulations to Bowen Yang, recipient of the Vantage Award, which he'll receive at the fifth annual Academy Museum Gala on October 18,” the Academy Museum wrote on Instagram yesterday. (Other honorees include Penélope Cruz, Walter Salles and Bruce Springsteen.)

	











	Yang joked at the image used for his tribute, writing online, “academy museum announcing my death,” alongside a heart emoji.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deadline has confirmed that fans hoping to see the MVP can rejoice, as Yang was in Studio 8H earlier this week prepping for a pre-taped sketch in which he will appear. It's unknown what that skit will entail.


	Yang, a mainstay for Weekend Update, has previously portrayed disgraced Congress member George Santos a number of times on SNL, and the ex-GOP representative was just released from prison after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence yesterday. Santos was sentenced to and serving seven years in prison after pleading guilty to committing wire fraud and identity theft.

	











	Season 51 of SNL kicked off with host Bad Bunny and musical guest Doja Cat. Last week, Amy Poehler took command of the show, featuring artist Role Model. Carpenter will be featured as a second-time musical guest tonight, marking her first time hosting and making her the first figure to pull double-duty this season.

Recently elected Writers Guild of America West President Michele Mulroney delivered a rousing speech at the No Kings protest in Los Angeles, decrying President Donald Trump and his administration's recent actions curtailing Hollywood writers' freedom of expression, specifically via the targeting of late-night shows.


	“I'm here today representing our union, the Writers Guild of America West, and its 11,000 film, television, and news writers,” Mulroney began. “As writers, our currency is words and stories. The freedom to express ourselves is a fundamental American right and the very core of our democracy. And it's under attack by this administration. They are using every tool in their arsenal to silence voices of dissent.”

	She continued, “These past few months we have seen direct attacks on Writers Guild members who use their platforms to criticize or question this administration. In July, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was abruptly canceled after Colbert made comments about Paramount's settlement with Trump. Then, Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended in September over a monologue that was lightly critical of Trump's followers. Shortly after Kimmel's suspension, the President of the United States openly called for the cancellation of two more Writers Guild members: Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon.”

	“These late-night shows not only provide hundreds of good union jobs, and much-needed laughs in these troubled times; they entertain and inform audiences all over the country,” Mulroney added. “They do far more than just tell jokes, they tell truth. And it's clear that some people can't handle the truth.”


	In continuing, Mulroney singled out how the issue doesn't just pertain to Tinseltown: “This isn't just about Hollywood. This is about our fundamental right as human beings to disagree with those in power. To debate, to reason, to interrogate ideas. This is one of the foundations of a civil society.”


	Mulroney also highlighted “the existence of a free, independent media where facts can be reported without repercussions” as one of the key tenets of a democratic populace. “But we currently find ourselves in an era of consolidated media where an increasingly small number of gatekeepers control what we get to watch on television. We've all heard the FCC claim that ‘the public interest is best served by permitting free expression of views,' yet FCC Chairman Brendan Carr does not hesitate to support attacks on those who challenge the Administration's narrative.”

	











	She continued, “Make no mistake: Mega corporations pushed for a pro-business administration that would allow them to consolidate their control over media at the cost of free speech. Instead of diversity of expression, we have the administration using media behemoths to impose a single, uncontested narrative and perpetrate acts of blatant political censorship.”


	In concluding her speech, Mulroney stated that the WGA will “not stand by and let these attacks go unaddressed.”


	“The Writers Guild stands here today, with all of you, to say loudly and proudly that we will speak our minds, write our truths, tell our stories, and fight like hell for free speech and an independent media. When our voices are strong and clear, when our words are powerful, we cannot be silenced. We've learned time and again that when we fight? We win!” she said, leading a chant of “When we fight! We win!”


	In preparation for No Kings today, the WGA West Instagram account posted photos of members coming together to make signs.


	Millions have taken to the streets across the nation in support of the second round of No Kings protests. Prominent Hollywood celebrities, like Glenn Close, Spike Lee and Jean Smart, have voiced their resounding support for the countrywide day of dissent.


	In addition to Mulroney, well-known figures across politics and media took to stages in various cities to address constituents who had turned up to demonstrate. In Washington, D.C., Bernie Sanders, Bill Nye and journalist Mehdi Hasan issued warnings against the country's creep into fascism.

That the issue. The messaging is not effective. The organizers need creative writers to draft the message. No Kings falls flat and I'm with them. Nothing will change because Dems lost power.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kylie Jenner Debuts Stunning Pink Hair & Matching Latex Dress: PHOTOS","https://entertainmentnow.com/kardashians/kylie-jenner-pink-hair-latex-dress/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 06:59:17 GMT","

Kylie Jenner not only made a decade-long music rumor a reality recently, but she also popped up at an event deemed “Kylie Jenner's 10 Years of Kylie Cosmetics Celebration with Friends & Family” on October 17 in West Hollywood. Reminding fans of her beloved King Kylie era of ever-changing hair colors, Kylie debuted pink hair that matched the latex dress that she wore for the night.

Kylie opted for long locks that had just enough of a wave to turn the style into an old Hollywood-esque ‘do. Of course, the light bubblegum pink shade completely hailed back to the reality TV star's days of teal, dark blue and even green hair.

As for her dress, the form-fitting gown followed her curves while the full-length piece reached down to her feet. It was partially held up with thin straps and had extra folds of latex on either side of her bossom.

She also opted for large (like, massive) rings on her fingers but went without a necklace. Her high-heeled shoes were also a suitable shade of pink that went perfectly with her ensemble.

For her makeup, Kylie slayed pink lips that were slightly darker than her hair and eyeshadow that matched. She also had a slight blush on her cheeks and kept her dark brows.

A post shared by @fileskyliejenner

When Kylie stepped out with pink hair and wearing a latex dress in the same color, fans were floored by the look. That's why they flooded social media to show their appreciation and admiration.

One person took to the comments of an Instagram post featuring Kylie, saying, “Da most beautiful pink lady in the world 🌎 🫠🍒”

“Stunning. All I can think of is the song Barbie Girl,” another person wrote.

A third fan said, “Kylie has got to be most beautiful woman there is.”

“WOOOOW SHE LOOKS SO GOOD,” came from another social media user.

Someone else wrote, “Omg she is back in her wigs era”

When it comes to Kylie's style — including her hair color — she's certainly willing to change things up on a whim. That's something that she proudly embraces.

“I think that I'm kind of a chameleon with my style; I love to play,” she told Harper's Bazaar in May. “I've been like that since I was 16. I changed my hair color like once a week and cut my hair off and then put a wig on or put extensions in; and I've always switched up my style. It's just a part of who I am…”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Denise Richards & Aaron Phypers Divorce Update","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/denise-richards-aaron-phypers-updates/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 00:43:31 GMT","

As Denise Richards‘ divorce proceedings with her ex-husband Aaron Phypers continue, the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star is staying above it all by zeroing in on work while staying glowing and glamorous. Most recently, she took to her Instagram on October 17 to post a brand deal while showing off her fresh-faced complexion.

In the video, the “Love Actually” actress sits bare-faced in a sauna wrapped in a plush pink robe as she tells fans she achieves a “dewy, hydrating, and youthful glow” with the skincare line she's promoting. She also revealed she recently had a facelift, contributing to her wrinkle-free appearance.

A post shared by Denise Richards (@deniserichards)

On October 17, 2025, Page Six reported Phypers, who married Richards in September 2018, is seeking to be awarded half of his ex's OnlyFans earnings in a new divorce demand. Users of the platform make money when subscribers pay to view their photos, and popular stars on the app can earn sizeable incomes. 

The app initially popularity for the prevalence of X-rated content, but many users are now using it to share tamer content.

The report says the documents assert that Phypers was instrumental in establishing Richards' success on the platform, and holds “the intellectual property rights to most, if not all, of the pictures that are in use on her page.”

In the documents, which he filed Friday, he asked the judge to grant him “half of the OnlyFans income that is our joint income that we built and earned together, since I took the photographs and own the intellectual property rights.”

He also insisted Richards has “cut me off from accessing that joint income that we earned together.”

People says Richards followed in the footsteps of her 21-year-old daughter, Sami Sheen, by opening an OnlyFans account in 2022. Both content creators and patrons of the photo site must be 18 or older. 

The report says Richards spoke out in support of her daughter's decision to join the site, writing on Instagram at the time, “I wish I had the confidence my 18-year-old daughter has. And I also can't be judgmental of her choices. I did Wild Things and Playboy.”

Richards also praised her daughter for being able to “ignore the negativity,” before adding, “It took me many years and I still sometimes struggle.”

So just how much money is at stake? The Page Six report says the documents filed by Phypers indicate he believes Richards brings in anywhere from $200,000 to $300,000 per month on the platform.

Although she's getting extra help from her Korean skincare regime, Richards is keep it all the way real with her adoring fans, acknowledging in her latest Instagram video, “I recently just had a facelift, so I'm being extra cautious with what I'm putting on my skin.”

Fans admired the honest move, with one writing, “I love that she just admitted she had a facelift. I wish all movie stars would admit it. This is why she looks absolutely amazing.”

Another fan chimed in, “She used one of the best surgeons out there! I happened to see it yesterday video popped up not knowing she would be on it. And Wow!! She looks just beautiful.”

Richards another skincare secret she keeps in her bag of tricks is a salmon facial, which she also recently had done, saying it made her feel “dewy” and gave her a “glow.”

Where can I buy the Korean skin care products she was talking about?

Kim Kardashian turned heads by covering her face at the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles on October 18, 2025. The event was held to honor several celebrities, including Penélope Cruz with the Icon Award, Bruce Springsteen with the Legacy Award, and Bowen Yang with the Vantage Award, per Vogue. 

Wearing Maison Margiela couture, Kardashian's jaw-dropping look was a “last-minute” decision, she told Variety, admitting her makeup artist probably wouldn't be happy with her for covering her face. 

Because it was difficult to see through her face cover, Kardashian required help getting to the spot where she and other celebrities posed for photographers. Her head was fully enveloped in nude fabric, which was tucked inside a stunning, three-tier diamond necklace.

Telling Variety her look was by designer Glenn Martens for Maison Margiela, she said, “You know, I love Margiela. I flew in my favorite makeup artist Mario from New York, and this is kind of a last-minute thing, so I'm sure he's not so happy with it.”

That's right — Kardashian had her makeup and hair fully done before covering it all with the fabric mask. But the billionaire entrepreneur thought the nude look gave a subtle nod to her own shapewear line, SKIMS.  

“It does look very SKIMS-y,” Kardashian told Variety. “That's why I was drawn to it when the Margiela couture show came out. I saw this look and I was like, ‘That is so SKIMS to me.'”

Kardashian did tell Variety she planned to remove her face cover once inside for the gala, so she could hobnob with fellow stars, including her own sisters, Kendall Jenner, who showed up for the gala in a black sleeveless gown. 

Among the other celebrities who rocked the blue carpet at the Academy Museum Gala were actresses Eva Longoria, dressed in a shimmering Elie Saab gown, and Lupita Nyong'o, who wore Chanel, according to Vogue. 

Viola Davis, stunning in royal blue Gucci, told Variety she's feeling good at 60, declaring, “There's freedom in turning 60. I'm like, ‘Wow! I made it this point! I've earned it, I've earned my opinions, I've earned my peace, I've earned my soul. So I'm gonna take up space.”

Charlie XCX stepped out in all-black Saint Laurent, per Just Jared, and Kaia Gerber wore a custom white lace gown and cape by Givenchy, the outlet reported. 

The star-studded affair also included guests such as Jon Hamm, Jennifer Hudson, Selena Gomez with her new husband Benny Blanco, Ed Sheeran, and Olivia Rodriuo. No word yet if any of them saw Kim Kardashian's face make an appearance at the bash.

October 19, 2025

At a 1976 concert featuring American saxophone superstar Stan Getz and Brazilian singer and guitarist João Gilberto, Getz welcomed his partner to the stage in a tone of voice that reveals just how gobsmacked he remained by his genius. “The most individual singer of our time, a true originator,” he enthused. “His curious ability to sing warmly without a vibrato, his impeccable and inimitable rhythmic sense, his intimacy, all coupled to his wonderful guitar work, make him unique.” If that sounds dry, Miles Davis put it so: “Gilberto could sound seductive reading aloud from the Wall Street Journal.”

Despite being in close proximity to João Gilberto for over a decade by that point—onstage and in the studio—Getz is forever mystified by Gilberto: his voice, his attenuated pitch, his rhythmic sense, the space within the music that he birthed, bossa nova. And in a decade of increasingly louder and louder musical revolutions, Gilberto sat at the center of the most hushed one of all, now mistakenly perceived as quaint elevator music instead of the sophisticated and subtle paradigm shift that bossa nova actually was, a marriage between Afro-Brazilian rhythm and intricate Eurocentric harmonic concepts.

In 1964, Getz and Gilberto brought bossa nova to the American masses with their collaborative album Getz/Gilberto, and then the rest of the world, though everyone was well behind what had already transpired in Brazil—the modern equivalent of finding out the hottest sound in China is “Old Town Road”. When Gilberto cut his first solo record, Chega De Saudade, in Brazil in 1959, it ignited a flame in that country, a revolution in samba that completely transformed Brazilian music. “The kids could see themselves in that music,” Ruy Castro noted in his history of the music, Bossa Nova. Gilberto was an enigmatic singer, a subtle rhythmic player, and a lowkey guitar god, inspiring a new generation to sing and pick up a guitar, while gratefully also ending Brazil's national obsession with the accordion. At home, Gilberto was an icon. “I owe João Gilberto everything I am today,” Caetano Veloso said. “Even if I were something else and not a musician, I would say that I owe him everything.”

But that wasn't always the case. When he found himself dismissed from vocal group Os Garotos in the mid-'50s, Gilberto was broke and despondent. By the start of 1955, he found himself cut off by his parents and alienated from Rio's music scene. People who saw him on the street saw a disheveled man with dirty shoulder-length hair, an unkempt beard, and a ruffled suit he had slept in, oft-seen talking to himself on the benches in front of the National Library. What followed is what Castro deemed a “solitary descent into his own personal hell,” as Gilberto left Rio a pauper, spent a few months in Porto Alegre, before arriving unannounced at his sister's front door in Diamantina. Gilberto's uncanny sense of timing was already evident: his sister had just given birth to a daughter and was convalescing at home. But she could see the fraught, fragmented state of her brother's mental health and took him in anyway.

Over the next eight months, the music inside Gilberto's head incubated in Diamantina, not that anyone else could hear it. He locked himself in his bathroom for hours at a time to practice. The hard tiles of the small room provided acoustics that allowed him to hear his guitar like never before. His guitar notes hovered in the air thanks to the natural reverb of the loo. There were no strummed chords, no fingerpicking or single note runs, but instead a swaying movement between the even bass notes thrummed with his thumb and a counter-rhythm in chords he plucked with his next three fingers. He would later say that this subtle rhythmic idea came from watching the Afro-Brazilian women of Juazeiro walking with laundry baskets on their heads, hips swaying. (But he would also be inspired by the waddling of ducks on another early number, “O Pato.”)

Amid the natural reverb of his acoustic guitar in the washroom, he also realized that by singing softly without any vibrato in his delivery, he could change his tempo at will, pushing and pulling against his guitar accompaniment in a curious new way. The sound moved to his nasal cavity as a hum rather than through his mouth, whispered more than projected outward. And at last Gilberto had him a captive audience, sneaking out in the early morning hours to serenade his newborn niece in her crib with this new sound that barely rose above a purred lullaby. But João's mood swings wore on his sister after a few months, and he soon found himself back home, where his father was unimpressed by this so-called breakthrough: “That's not music. It's nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah.” Gilberto was next checked into a sanitarium, but they found nothing wrong with him, and after a week, he was discharged.

When he returned to Rio, he sought out pianist/composer Antônio Carlos Jobim, who had gained international renown for his samba soundtrack to Marcel Camus's Orfeu Negro, with songs written by Jobim with Vinicius De Moraes and performed with guitarist Luiz Bonfá. Jobim knew Gilberto as a singer, but was knocked out by his guitar playing, which “simplified the samba rhythm and left a lot of room for the ultramodern harmonies” he had been dabbling with in some new songs. Their first collaboration, “Chega de Saudade,” lit the fuse for the new beat of bossa nova, and a vital connection was made.

Translated as “No more blues,” the subtle fluctuations in Gilberto's guitar and vocal timing suggested new patterns when laid atop Jobim's complex sense of harmony, like an overlay of two sets of parallel lines that make a vast new array of complex patterns. Gilberto didn't sing so much as sigh with malaise. It was a melancholia suited for the times, a Brazilian iteration of existentialism. Just as unrequited love might never be quenched, so it was with some of the songs, melodically and lyrically. There was always a dark shadow amid its elegant curves, harmonies that didn't quite resolve as was expected. Gilberto's sound shrugged; such was life.

Jobim penned three of the numbers on João's debut album. He also served as the music arranger tasked with meeting Gilberto's increasingly maddening demands, from needing a separate mic for his guitar and his vocals to needing 28 takes to get the pronunciation of the o in “Rosa Morena” just so. The recording studio was no bathroom.

Thanks to U.S. musicians like Quincy Jones and Charlie Byrd doing State Department tours of Brazil, Chega de Saudade trickled up to the States, with one Jobim tune on the album becoming a beguiling standout. Translated as “(Slightly Out Of Tune),” “Desafinado” resonated with jazz musicians of all stripes. In 1962 alone, Jones and Byrd both covered it, as well as Herbie Mann, Herb Alpert, and Chubby Checker. It was through Byrd that Stan Getz first heard this new Brazilian sound and was smitten.

Getz dominated jazz in the 1950s. The New York Times had deemed him “the poll winners' poll winner,” topping every reader and critics' poll imaginable that decade, never mind that the likes of Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and Ben Webster were still in their prime while Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, and Dexter Gordon were all on the rise. Such is the peril of a white man in the jazz world, and Getz was famously an unrepentant asshole. Upon hearing Getz had heart surgery, a longtime bandmate quipped: “Did they put one in?” By 1960, Coltrane finally topped Getz in the Downbeat poll, and Getz's heroin and barbiturate addiction caught up to him, collapsing his marriage. A few years on, he needed a hit, and bossa nova gave it to him.

“The songs of Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim…arrived here when anemia and confusion were becoming noticeable in our music,” Getz said of his pivot to incorporate a Latin American musical form into a Black American one. No doubt he heard the sound of Ornette Coleman and Coltrane circa late 1961 and, like the rest of White America, feared where jazz was heading. With Byrd and a band of Americans, he cut Jazz Samba in 1962, and their version of “Desafinado” garnered a Grammy for “best jazz solo” and sold over a million copies. Getz and producer Creed Taylor strip-mined that sound: Big Band Bossa Nova followed six months later, which was then followed six months after that by Jazz Samba Encore!

In November of 1962, Getz finally got to meet Gilberto in person at a Carnegie Hall concert sponsored by Brazilian airline Varig and the cultural wing of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While that concert was a bit of a mess, it planted the seeds for a studio date in New York City four months later. This time, Gilberto brought up a Brazilian rhythm section that could actually play to his exacting demands. With Milton Banana on drums, Sebastião Neto on bass (though the album credits Getz bassist Tommy Williams erroneously), and Jobim on piano, Gilberto arrived with his wife of three years, Astrud, at A&R Studios on March 18th and 19th, 1963.

“Tom, tell that gringo he's a moron,” an exasperated Gilberto said at one point in Portuguese to Jobim, who then translated for Getz: “Stan, Joao said to tell you that he's always dreamed of making a record with you.” Getz may have already recorded multiple American iterations of samba and bossa nova, but his tone and rhythm were found wanting by Gilberto. Getz's rhythm was stiff and unpliant, his tone much harder than the delicate, near ineffable filigree that João strove towards. The two men couldn't even agree on which take of each tune was the best.

Despite the growing acrimony in the studio, the results were impeccable. While Gilberto eschewed vibrato, Getz's horn emanated it on his solos, unfussy and cutting to the heart of each of the eight songs captured across two days. The group updates a few vintage sambas like “Doralice” and “Pra Machucar Meu Coração,” which had been huge hits in the 1940s, now cast in sophisticated, serious settings by Gilberto and Jobim. “O Grande Amor” is Getz at his smoldering best—it would remain in his repertoire long after he had worn out the album's biggest hits.

While it had instantly entered the jazz canon and had been recorded by Gilberto, “Desafinado” gets a definitive reading here, with the attuned ears of producer Creed Taylor and engineer Phil Ramone capturing its indelible essence. Jobim penned the song with Newton Mendonça as a cheeky homage to all the tin-eared samba singers they had heard over the years: “If you tell me l'm out of tune, my love/You must know that causes me immense pain,” states its purpose clearly in the opening couplet.

Getz's Grammy-winning version of it was not quite right, so the Getz/Gilberto version detunes it properly. The melody and harmony are in E-flat major, but the end of verse lines lie outside of that scale, the harmony sliding down in half steps that create a subtle dissonance and ending in a F7 b5. Gilberto's delivery is smooth enough that only upon close listening do his vowels clang and feel off. (You can hear a clearer example of this approach in English, as on this version of Gershwin's “'S Wonderful,” the held vowels sour and then subtly sweeten as the harmony finally aligns, like a foul ball just curling fair.) Easy as it sounds, in practice “Desafinado” is one of the trickiest songs of the 20th century, with no verse-chorus structure, running 74 measures long, featuring over 20 chords in the harmony, and full of subtle shifts that slide underfoot like the white sands of Ipanema Beach, leaving even the most sure-footed singer and player wobbling and off-balance.

And then there's that girl in the distance who seems to just glide across the sands untroubled. Jobim and De Moraes used to sit at the Veloso café at Ipanema, smitten by a then 17-year-old Heloísa Pinheiro, who would walk by to wolf whistles on her daily stroll along the beach. They penned a song for a musical comedy in homage to her, but for just about every person who has ever heard “The Girl From Ipanema,” the female that forever springs to mind is Astrud Gilberto, João's wife.

Of that Brazilian entourage in the studio those days, Astrud was the only one who spoke English fluently, and someone decided that “Ipanema” was a surefire hit, if only someone could render the lyrics into English. Astrud had sung in public only a handful of times and never recorded before. Despite being from Bahia, she would become the voice of said “Girl,” her voice forever associated with the song, its two male artists forever shoved to the periphery as her fresh, naif voice took center stage.

Much like Pinheiro, Astrud is both muse and a blank canvas for the projection of these men around her. Her slightly awkward delivery, her lack of polish professionalism, her flat vowel sounds, her curious messing up of the pronoun “he” instead of “me,” all add to its English as a second language charm. Despite the actual song opening with João's purr of a voice—his onomatopoeic “jeem doon doon bleem gung gong” a delight of pure sound gibberish so percussive and wet it's as if his mouth was brimming with water—it's nearly impossible to remember his voice being there at all. In hi-fi dens, radio broadcasts, jukeboxes, and jazz lounges throughout the U.S., listeners could tune into the song and imagine a beautiful young girl beckoning to them from a warm, white sand beach south of the border, or else a lush tropical forest. When does pop not entince with such a sumptuous fantasy?

Verve then promptly sat on the recordings for a full year, thinking that the bossa nova market was oversaturated. In the interim, João and Astrud's marriage fell apart while in Europe in the summer of 1963. By the time João returned to New York in early 1964, he was already with his future wife, Miúcha Buarque de Holanda. What made the record label finally change its mind is unknown, but when “The Girl From Ipanema” finally went walking on the airwaves, it became an unprecedented smash hit. It hit No. 5 on the singles chart, a remarkable feat for a jazz tune, and Getz/Gilberto climbed all the way to No. 2 on the albums chart, kept from the top of the charts by the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night.

Nevertheless, Getz/Gilberto stayed on the charts for 96 weeks. Bossa nova mania had arrived. The only concert that the principal players did for the album was at Carnegie Hall. Americans, two-left-footed though they may be, even tried to come up with a bossa nova dance, gratefully to no lasting effect. In Brazil, though, it all seemed old hat. It also didn't help that the country was in the midst of a military coup when the album dropped with chaos in the streets of Rio. But “The Girl From Ipanema” immediately seeped into pop culture, the sophisticated samba ironically becoming known as a type of Muzak, the banal sort of sound heard in elevators.

To say Astrud is an afterthought on the record is glaringly obvious; her name isn't anywhere on the cover or sleeve, not even on the center label (and João's name is missing its tilde). When the record sold into the stratosphere, Getz cleared a cool million and bought himself a country manor upstate to match. Gilberto received $23,000 in royalties, while Getz, ever the heartless bastard, made sure that Astrud herself was paid the flat fee of a session musician: $120.

Yet in a decade filled with iconic entrances, no one was as seismic in such a brief a blip of time. The Beatles played three songs on Ed Sullivan, Jimi Hendrix spent only a few minutes smashing and burning his guitar at Monterey Pop, Dylan's electric set at Newport was about 15 minutes. On an album that just clears 33 minutes, Astrud can only be heard on, “Ipanema” and “Corcovado,” less than three minutes of it. It cemented her legacy in that time, and Astrud arguably enjoyed greater longevity and more stability in her career than her male counterparts. Getz would go through divorce proceedings so acrimonious and cruel that it changed divorce court law. Gilberto remained an icon at home but became increasingly hermetic and erratic. The girl from Ipanema just doesn't see? Or she just has her eyes on a horizon they can't envision?

	Two-time Saturday Night Live musical guest Sabrina Carpenter — also the host of Saturday's show  performed two tracks from her seventh and latest album, Man's Best Friend.


	Carpenter opened with the lead single “Manchild,” which she co-wrote with Bleachers' Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen. The pop star, who graced Rolling Stone‘s July-August cover, quipped to us when asked if it's about anyone in particular: “It's about your dad.”


	Carpenter's second song was “Nobody's Son.” The reggae-pop tune — sixth on the track list — was co-written by Carpenter, Allen, and John Ryan.


	About Man's Best Friend, which hit the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart shortly after its late August release, Rolling Stone‘s Brittany Spanos wrote in a positive review: “Her new songs are united in their grooviness as Carpenter's heartbreak and disappointment in her male options takes her on a thoroughly modern tour of what dating, embracing, and then flipping the script on the humiliation ritual that is being a woman who dates men.”

	Carpenter debuted on SNL in May 2024. During the season 49 finale, she performed her hit single “Espresso,” which she would later include on her album Short n' Sweet, as well as a medley of two songs from 2022's Emails I Can't Send. The singer-actress was last in Studio 8H in February during the 50th anniversary special, joining Paul Simon for a rendition of Simon and Garfunkel's “Homeward Bound.”

	











	Carpenter will be back in New York next week as she hits the home stretch of her Short n' Sweet tour. After that, she'll be in Nashville, Toronto, and then Los Angeles.

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump joined a Gen Z boys' podcast about snacks in which he simultaneously dissected both Airheads and his chances of getting into heaven.


	On “Snack Homiez,” Trump (James Austin Johnson) told the podcast hosts—one of whom was played by Sabrina Carpenter—that “it's been a long time coming with regard to snacks and friendship and from the standpoint of podcasts.”


	When asked by Braylor (Chloe Fineman) what he thinks about vegetables, Trump admitted he has “never been one for the veggies.” 


	“Ding-dongs, I like a ding-dong,” he explained. “We love Little Debbie. She does tremendous work. It's awful what happened to her. I like the Christmas tree cake. You know, it used to be seasonal. But I very smartly made a call, now we get it year 'round.”


	“Dang! That's so fire, sir!” Braylor replied.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“It is,” Trump agreed. “It's very fire.”


	When Tayson (Carpenter) brought up Airheads, Trump naturally rambled about world affairs and kept exaggerating his questionable list of wars “solved.”

	











	“Airheads—very interesting taste. Look at China, look at Korea. You know, I've solved like seven wars at this point, right? And no one gives me credit. It's like 100 wars I've solved, right?” he said.


	“Something like 200 wars, right?” he went on. “You know Zelensky, he asked for Tomahawks that could reach Moscow, and I used to not like the guy, but he's tough, he loves his country. He loves his country.” 

	











	Trump then offered a non-sensible explanation for commuting fraudster George Santos' prison sentence.


	“You know who I like is George Santos. He's weird, he's a liar. I think he's great. We don't know anything about him. He's one of our favorite people. I don't know him at all but one of our favorite people,” Trump said, before referencing Saturday's No Kings protests nationwide against him. “People are marching because they're happy he's free. It's a ‘Yes, king' March. They say ‘Yes, king.' Maybe if I think about it, blue Airhead.”


	Trump then asked the podcast hosts about whether they though he would be getting into heaven—apparently a frequent concern of his of late.


	“Am I going to heaven, Chet? Do I fit the criteria in terms of Christian and with regard to St. Peter and pearly gates?” the 79-year-old asked.


	The kids weren't sure.


	“Um, I don't know, sir,” Braylor replied.

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators turned out in Washington, D.C. and cities across the nation on Saturday, to protest what they characterize as the increasingly authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.


	“We're here representing normal people — regular, peaceful Americans — who are against what this administration is doing, who are against the occupation of our cities and the disappearing of our neighbors off the streets,” says Jermaine Collins, a 34-year-old veteran of the war in Afghanistan, speaking to Rolling Stone beside a city dump truck, set up to block road access beside the National Gallery of Art.


	A rally more than a march, the “No Kings” protest centered on a stage set up on Pennsylvania Avenue with the U.S. Capitol in the background. The event comes as the Trump administration becomes increasingly eager to directly confront its political opponents using the varied levers of state power — including by using anti-terror tools originally designed to fight foreign extremists against domestic targets, and by deploying the National Guard to major cities under federal authority.

	











	In Washington, squads of roving guardsmen in MultiCam uniforms and body armor carrying M17 pistols and M4 rifles have become a commonplace sight, but on Saturday the law enforcement presence was relatively light and relaxed. A contingent of Metropolitan Police Department bicycle cops — in reserve as a rapid reaction force, their typical role should a protest turn violent — lounged in the shade of the art gallery's East Wing, mostly napping as protesters gathered nearby beneath a hot autumn sun. There was no sign of the National Guard near the protest site — indeed, there seems to have been a decision to minimize their presence in the areas surrounding Capitol Hill over the weekend.

	











	Nevertheless, the deployment of soldiers to American cities was toward the top of the list of concerns for many who attended the protest.


	“It's horrifying,” says one 68-year-old resident of D.C. holding a “Freedom of the Press” sign. He had gathered with a handful of friends in the shade of a tree in Union Square to listen to the speeches being broadcast from the nearby stage. “We have friends who are in it [the D.C. National Guard]. It's a waste of time and resources.”

	The retiree and his three friends, all of whom asked not to be identified for fear of potential retribution by the American government, spoke to this reporter at length about what they see as a breakdown of politics-as-usual in the U.S. Describing themselves as political moderates, they say they are not optimistic that the Trump administration's “vindictive lawlessness” — as one described it — could be easily defeated, especially in the current emotionally charged and divisive partisan political environment.


	And yet, they are holding out hope that resistance to the administration will manifest in votes against Republicans at the ballot box during next year's midterm elections, despite what one called a “pathetic” performance by the Democratic Party.


	The reason Trump was reelected is that “underlying the flamboyant rhetoric, there are real issues that need to be addressed,” the 68-year-old says. Democrats need to face that reality, he adds, but it's also vital to convince voters to reject the MAGA movement and its excesses. “I have to hope that events like today will help make inroads with the independents who were voting ‘Trump' in the last election.”


	Others see protests like “No Kings” as the beginning of a broader movement of national resistance.


“I'll keep it real simple. This administration is taking the U.S. down a road to authoritarianism,” says Ethan Wilson, a 42-year-old veteran of the war in Iraq, who — along with Collins — was representing a progressive veterans non-profit called “Common Defense.”

	“The courts are important. Elections are important. But that's not probably going to be sufficient to save us,” Wilson believes. “What we need is a major non-violent civil resistance movement in the U.S. that's capable of building levers of power that can be used against the administration and its supporters — especially the top tier of elites in American society that either actively support the administration or that are going along with it.”

	











	The goal of this, Wilson says, is to pressure elites and institutions to remove their support from what he calls “the emerging regime.”


	“Again: Non-violently,” he adds.


	Indeed, there were no signs of violence witnessed by Rolling Stone at Washington's “No Kings” protest. This reporter watched a lone man in a “Make America Great Again” hat and Donald Trump shirt walk through the crowds of protesters unmolested, staring defiantly as the people around him largely ignored his passing.


	That wasn't surprising to Collins, the Afghan vet. “There's a bunch of regular folks who are out here who're protesting. It's not what you've been seeing on Fox News and all that. Like, look around. There's not a bunch of — they framed us as ‘terrorists,'” he says. “So that's kind of crazy. Naturally, that's crazy.”


	The event in D.C. was one of more than 2,700 similar protests across the country, organizers say. The administration and its allies have flip-flopped between downplaying and ignoring the protests, to describing them as major threats to national security.


	On Wednesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he wanted to introduce legislation allowing the Department of Justice to pursue prosecutions of the funders and organizers of “No Kings” under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act.


	“Follow the money. Cut off the money,” Cruz told Fox News. “You look at this ‘No Kings' rally — there's considerable evidence that George Soros and his network is behind funding these rallies, which may well turn into riots.”


	“This is the authoritarian playbook,” says Brandon Wolf, the national press secretary for the LGBTQ rights non-profit Human Rights Campaign, one of the organizers of the “No Kings” rally. “They rely not just on division and chaos, but intimidation – because they're the minority in this country. Not only is Donald Trump wildly unpopular, but the vast majority of people in this country don't support dictatorships. They don't support tyranny.”


	“We don't have a country if we don't have the First Amendment, and people absolutely should exercise their freedom to peaceably assemble and petition their government,” Wolf says. “No matter what bluster comes out of the White House or their enablers, that is a fundamentally American freedom.”


	Nevertheless, Cruz's threats are part of a larger pattern in which the Trump administration has shown a willingness to go after protesters. In September, the president signed an executive order that labeled the leaderless anti-fascist collective movement known as Antifa a “Domestic Terrorist Organization.”

	











	On Thursday, federal prosecutors secured a grand jury indictment against members of a supposed “Antifa Cell” on charges of providing “material support to terrorism,” related to an incident at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Alvarado, Texas on July 4. In that incident, a group of individuals dressed in black raided the ICE facility, shooting fireworks and vandalizing property, according to the U.S. government, in an attack that amounted to an “ambush” and “attempted murder of federal officers.”


	It is believed to be the first time that terrorism charges have been applied to alleged followers of the anti-fascist movement. Protests against ICE officers and facilities and supposed rampant crime have formed the basis for a number of unprecedented enforcement actions taken by the Trump administration — including the deployment of the military to Los Angeles, the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and a planned deployment of federalized National Guard members to Chicago.


	A temporary restraining order blocking that deployment was upheld by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, which in its ruling specifically noted that “Political opposition is not rebellion,” arguing that the evidence did not support the president federalizing troops over the objections of local authorities.


	“A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protesters advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows,” the court wrote, adding, “Nor does a protest become a rebellion merely because of sporadic and isolated incidents of unlawful activity or even violence committed by rogue participants in the protest.”


	Back at the protest in D.C. on Saturday, certainly there was little indication of open rebellion afoot. But there was plenty of carefully considered outrage.


	“I am an immigrant. I wasn't born in this country. So that means I have the love for this country that immigrants have. It's a different type of love, in a way, because you realize what your life could have been like, had you not had this opportunity,” says Nancy, a 57-year-old attorney from Maryland who — like many of the people with whom Rolling Stone spoke — asked not to be identified using her full name. “I've been here all my life. My dad was American, my mom was from South America. I think this country's really important, and I think it's worth fighting for.”

	











	“I'm an attorney and I believe in the rule of law,” she adds. “The rule of law is what differentiates a free people. And so I'm really, really concerned about the abrogation of the rule of law — and how easily it's happening. How almost without thought, we're getting numb to whatever breaches are occurring.”


	For the most part, the large-scale protest had the atmosphere of a block party, filled with lively supporters of myriad causes in evidence. Regardless of someone's motivations or politics, organizers say, the most important thing anyone can do to defend the rights that they believe to be under threat is simply show up.

	“Regardless of the lengths to which this administration is willing to go to quell dissent in this country, it is still our obligation to show up and defend our most fundamental freedoms,” says Wolf. “You can't tell what this administration is going to do from one day to the next. They've shown a willingness to back down when they face immense public pressure before. Oftentimes, it's bluster and there's not a whole lot of bite behind the bark. And sometimes there is.”


	“But I will just say that, throughout American history and across the world, courageous people have stood up in the face of harrowing circumstances and defended freedom,” Wolf adds, “and they've been on the right side of history when it was written.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on Donald Trump‘s commutation of Republican former congressman and fraudster George Santos‘ seven-plus year prison sentence, his decision to give Argentina a $20 billion financial aid package, and the president's recent Time magazine cover.


	“Yesterday, President Trump finally released what everyone has been asking him to release: George Santos,” co-anchor Colin Jost joked, alluding to files related to Trump's former pal and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 


	Santos had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft—”which I think is when you push someone in a closet and change clothes with them,” Jost went on. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Jost circled back to Santos, who repeatedly lied about his background and work history, later in the segment. 


	“In the clinching game of the NLCS, Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani pitched six scoreless innings, struck out ten batters and hit three home runs,” Jost said, “a feat previously only accomplished by George Santos.”

	











	Jost also addressed the Argentine bailout, which the Trump administration is reportedly working to double to $40 billion.


	“Argentine president Javier Milei…met with President Trump at the White House this week, where Trump announced that he's sending $40 billion to Argentina, because if history is any guide, a lot of Trump officials will end up fleeing to Argentina,” Jost joked, alluding to the post-World War II Nazi exodus to the country.

	











	Co-anchor Michael Che weighed in on Trump's appearance on the cover of Time magazine, which he wasn't pleased with and which was mocked by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among others.


	“President Trump criticized Time magazine for using a bad picture of him on the cover, saying ‘They disappeared my hair.' And I've got to agree: that thing do look waxed,” Che joked, zooming in on the 79-year-old's neck.


	Che also made a jab at his colleague while referencing the racist and antisemitic group chat between Young Republicans leaders that was exposed this week.

Sabrina Carpenter mocked the controversy over her Man's Best Friend album cover and fired back at her “horndog pop star” reputation during her Saturday Night Live monologue.


	“Last time I was here, for the 50th anniversary, I got to sing with Paul Simon, and since then my new album Man's Best Friend came out,” Carpenter said. “Some people got a little freaked out by the cover. I'm not sure why. It's just this.”


	Carpenter then showed the controversial cover, “Me on all fours with an unseen person pulling my hair. But what people don't realize it's just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it's clearly a picture of me at the 50th anniversary special of Bowen [Yang] helping me up by the hair.” Carpenter continued to zoom out on the unaltered photo: “After Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line, saying something like ‘Daddy needs his mini-quiche.”

	“Since I'm here, I want to clear up some misconceptions people have about me,” Carpenter added. “Everyone thinks of me as this horndog pop star, but there's really so much more to me. I'm not just horny… I'm also turned on. And I'm sexually charged. And I love to read. My favorite book is the encyclopedia, it's so big, and it's hard, and okay seriously, sorry.”

A private company at a high-powered Army conference demonstrated a unique aircraft at the event — and allegedly took responsibility for setting off last year's drone and “UFO” pandemonium in New Jersey, a source told The Post.

At the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August, a private contractor conducted a live demonstration of a manned aerial craft that wowed the crowd with its unconventional appearance and unorthodox flight-movements, an attendee told The Post.

“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” an employee of the unnamed contractor claimed to a small group after the demonstration, according to the source who was invited to the summit.

The company was in the air over the Garden State in November 2024 to “test out their capabilities,” the contractor's employee claimed to the source — adding they were not required to disclose their activity to the public because of a private government contract.

In video provided to The Post, the roughly 20-foot across four-winged flier zooms through the skies just above the tree-line, drawing the attention of dozens of soldiers on the ground.

“I thought it was the military testing something out on the other side of the base,” the source, a military veteran and drone expert, said of their first impression of the flying object on Aug. 12 at Fort Rucker.

“It feels like it's a UFO because it defies what you're expecting to see,” they said, adding there was an “uncanny valley feeling” when watching it quietly motor through the sky.

“When it turned you almost completely lose sight of it,” the source said, of the roughly 30-minute demonstration in the controlled airspace of Fort Rucker.

“Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.”

All conference attendees were approved by brass at Fort Rucker, which enacted strict rules for participation, including the exclusion of any drone or craft containing any Chinese-made parts, the source revealed.

“It would definitely have to be cleared,” they said, adding, “Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that.”

Fort Rucker, which is the headquarters for the Army's Aviation Branch, could not be reached for comment.

The rash of supposed drone sightings in New Jersey began on Nov. 13, 2024 over Army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued across the state through early December.

President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration announced in January that many of the reports of mystery drones were hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private individuals.

The Army declined comment, citing the shutdown of the federal government.

A private contractor has allegedly taken responsibility for last year's drone and ""UFO"" sightings that caused a stir across New Jersey, according to an insider.

During a top-tier army conference, an individual reportedly unveiled a piloted aerial vehicle that left attendees in awe due to its unique design and unconventional flight patterns over NJ.

""You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,"" a worker from the undisclosed contractor is said to have told a small group after the presentation, as per a source speaking to the New York Post.

The company was purportedly airborne over the Garden State in November 2024 to ""test out their capabilities,"" the contractor's representative informed the source - asserting they weren't required to disclose their operations to the public due to a confidential government agreement.

Last year saw hundreds of enigmatic ""orbs"" appearing in the skies over several weeks, predominantly over New Jersey but also in numerous other states.

Despite authorities' attempts to reassure the public that these objects pose no national security threat, the inability to identify them has fuelled wild conspiracy theories. Some speculate they're searching for ""nuclear warheads"", while others suggest they might be the property of hostile foreign nations, reports the Express US.

The sightings of drones have ignited online conspiracy theories linking them to 'Project Blue Beam. ' This wild theory suggests that NASA intends to establish a new world order via a fabricated religion led by the Anti-Christ.

To make this plausible, proponents argue that a technological simulation of the 'Second Coming' would be staged.

Republican politicians have also speculated that the drones could have been launched ""by violent dictatorships, perhaps maybe Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea.""

However, the FBI, White House and Pentagon have all stressed that none of the activity poses a credible threat.

Yet, the Post now reports that at least part of the mystery has been unravelled. All conference attendees received approval from Fort Rucker leadership, which set strict participation guidelines, including prohibiting any drone or aircraft containing Chinese-manufactured components, the source revealed.

""It would definitely have to be cleared,"" they clarified, adding, ""Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that.""

The wave of alleged drone sightings in New Jersey began on November 13, 2024, above the army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued state wide into early December.

President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration disclosed in January that many reports of mysterious drones were actually hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private citizens.

It's official—TRAPPIST-1e, 40 light-years from Earth, could have conditions for liquid water and extraterrestrial life

Information continues to emerge about new discoveries from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. In two separate articles published Monday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, astronomers focused on the TRAPPIST-1 system, composed of seven rocky planets orbiting a single star. The object being studied is an Earth-sized planet 40 light-years away that could harbor oceans or icy surfaces.

According to a study that analyzed observations from the James Webb Space Telescope for more than a year, a rocky, Earth-sized planet in our Milky Way galaxy could have an atmosphere around it. This means the possibility that liquid water could also exist is high. And as we know, if there's water, there's life, which would be great news for the scientific community. Recent studies presenting initial results from observations by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope suggest that the planet, known as TRAPPIST-1e, could have a nitrogen-rich atmosphere similar to Earth's.

The note we make about the atmosphere is very important. Keeping water in a liquid state, which is the minimum way to create life, requires the atmosphere, that layer that protects it from evaporation. This makes the search for exoplanet atmospheres one of the most fascinating and important activities in the field of astronomy. “TRAPPIST-1e has long been considered one of the best habitable-zone planets to search for an atmosphere,” said Dr. Ryan MacDonald, Professor of Extrasolar Planets in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews.

Therefore, to continue their studies, astronomers used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to observe four “transits” of TRAPPIST-1e, or moments when the planet passed in front of its star. The telescope, powerful as it is, doesn't directly detect the atmosphere (if there is one) around TRAPPIST-1e, but instead measured how the exoplanet absorbed light to determine its surroundings.

The goal now for researchers is to obtain more JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1e to enable a deeper search of the atmosphere. With each additional transit, the atmospheric content becomes clearer. “In the next few years, we'll go from four JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1e to nearly 20. We finally have the telescope and tools to search for habitable conditions in other star systems, making today one of the most exciting times in astronomy,” MacDonald said.

Finding an atmosphere isn't so simple for astronomers. Researchers must carefully account for starspots, as they are created by local magnetic fields on the surfaces of stars. The team spent more than a year carefully correcting the data to remove star contamination—the visual noise around TRAPPIST-1e.

How can they do this? Scientists use colors. Like a prism, light can be separated into different color bands in a rainbow-like spectrum. In this way, the way colors are blocked, or how they filter out certain colors, can be signals of specific atoms or gas molecules. “If we see no variation in color, then the planet is probably just a bare rock,” MacDonald said.

As for current discoveries and data, NASA has stated that Titan (one of the moons orbiting Saturn) likely harbors a vast subsurface ocean, which could make it habitable, but the moon's methane-rich environment would mean that any life existing there would be very different from that on Earth. This is an example of how far-reaching research can go. In other words, what we know about TRAPPIST-1e is still very limited; we'll have to wait to learn more about the details of this discovery.

A woman said a psychic accurately predicted her future husband's shoe size, height and ""kindness"" - before she married him five years later.

After a series of unsuccessful relationships, Anya Clements, 24, consulted a psychic in July 2019 to discuss her romantic prospects.

Coming from a family of tarot and tea leaf readers, she often sought guidance from psychics when she needed reassurance about her future. During one session, a psychic foretold details about Anya's Birmingham University, course, career and even her future husband, including his physical appearance and personality traits.

Astonishingly, every prediction came true, and a month later, Anya reconnected with an old friend who fitted the description ""perfectly"". The man who was destined to be Anya's husband was said to have large feet, be tall and older than her - and her actual husband has size 10 feet, stands at 5ft 11in and is five years her senior.

The couple were married on 21 September 2024, exactly five years after they officially became a couple. Anya, an aesthetics nurse from Cardiff, said: ""The psychic said I was going to be really happy - it's scary how much she predicted and it's all come true.

""My husband doesn't really believe in it - but I've been to around ten psychics in my lifetime. After the psychic, in the same session, predicted my uni - I thought I'd meet my husband there.

""I didn't expect him to be a family friend living in my small town - but that's what they say about soulmates.""

Anya sought guidance from a psychic in July 2019 after having ""been with some blokes in the past who weren't very nice"". She was careful not to disclose any personal details to the tarot and tea leaf reader - not even her name.

Throughout the session, the psychic began predicting aspects of Anya's future - telling her she would enrol at the University of Birmingham, on a nursing course, and that she would start a job in the NHS but leave to pursue other things.

Anya then enquired about her future husband - and the psychic provided a detailed physical description, including his shoe size and height, as well as his occupation and personality traits.

The future husband's characteristics would include: A tall stature, large feet and muscles. He would also be incredibly kind - and older than her.

""This psychic had no clue how old I was, and she accurately predicted I'd be going to Birmingham to study nursing - before I even got accepted,"" Anya said.

""I was told, as soon as I met my husband, I'd know I wanted to marry him. He's seven inches taller than me, has size 10 feet and he worships the ground I walk on.

""Linking the two together, I started to think I'd meet my husband at uni."" Anya was raised in a community where ""everyone knows everyone"" - and she already knew her now-husband platonically.

Although the pair ""liked"" each other, Anya deliberately chose not to pursue a relationship - believing she would encounter her future husband in Birmingham.

She did not recognise he fitted the psychic's physical description as she was preoccupied with university life.

But, two months later, just as she was departing for Birmingham, Anya said something ""clicked into place"" in her mind - prompting her to ask him on a date.

""September 21, 2019 - we decided there was something there to fulfil,"" she said. In February 2024, the couple became engaged - though Anya's now-husband had been keeping the ring for two years.

Another psychic had correctly forecast the pair's engagement date eight months beforehand, in June 2023.

The couple married on September 21, 2024 - with a video Anya recorded immediately after her reading, describing her future husband's characteristics and appearance, shown to guests during the reception.

She said: ""I'm really grateful for how it's all turned out. Everyone was really, really shocked at the wedding - because it's just all come true.

""It just gives me a little hope - it's all really exciting.""

List of true psychic predictions so far: - Anya's husband, from his height and shoe size to his kind nature.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","This Forgotten ‘Prison Break' Twist Secretly Solved One of America's Greatest Unsolved Mysteries","https://collider.com/prison-break-d-b-cooper-mystery-explained/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 16:30:00 GMT","

Prison Break may not have been the most realistic prison drama around, but it was always the most entertaining. The Fox series debuted in 2005 and followed Michael Scofield's (Wentworth Miller) attempts to break his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) out of prison, where he was slated to be executed for the wrongful conviction of killing the Vice President's brother. The series screamed government conspiracy and delivered on that front, but it also solved a decades-old mystery.

Part of Michael's master plan was to get himself thrown in prison so he could find a way out with Lincoln in tow. He was able to do this because he was part of the architectural firm that designed the prison — not to mention a genius — but there were many other components to his plan. One of the biggest was his plan once they escaped, and how they would survive outside those walls. In addition to seducing the prison doctor, Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), Michael cultivates a theory that one of his fellow convicts was behind one of the most mysterious hijackings of all time.

This, of course, was the mythic figure, D.B. Cooper. In 1971, an anonymous hijacker took over a plane flying from Portland to Seattle. He demanded $200,000 in cash with the intent of making it to Mexico. On the way, Cooper parachuted out of the plane and was never heard of again. In later years, portions of the ransom money were found, but the mystery still remained unsolved. At Fox River Prison, Michael not only tries to free his brother but also solves a case that had stumped the FBI for decades. Michael forms a theory that the kindly lifer, Charles Westmoreland (Muse Watson), was the true identity of D.B. Cooper. For most of the season, Westmoreland denies the charge but comes in clutch in the final act.

Based on its concept alone, Prison Break asked fans to suspend their disbelief. The main characters frequently encountered government assassins and mafia leaders. Amid all that, finding D.B. Cooper wasn't too much of a stretch and eventually became a big emotional crux at the end of Season 1. Michael could make all the plans he wanted, but his escape was contingent on Westmoreland's involvement. He was counting on the D.B. Cooper money still being buried out there somewhere, and he and his brother could use it to start over. The only issue was Westmoreland reluctance to join the escape.

Westmoreland had been convicted of an unrelated crime and was serving a life sentence. His only wish was that he could make peace with his estranged daughter, Anna, before he died. But circumstances being what they were in prison, the tides eventually turned. After learning that his daughter was dying of cancer, he agreed to escape with the rest of the convicts. In a tragic turn of events, Westmoreland finally confessed to his identity on the night of the escape when he was fatally stabbed. The real D.B. Cooper would never see his daughter again, no matter how much he tried to make amends. Michael also had to say goodbye to another father figure, but in his last moments, Westmoreland confessed to where he had left the stolen money. This was Michael and Lincoln's ticket to freedom, but it came at a great cost.

The passing of Westmoreland was one of the more emotional losses of the first season, as he was one of the few of the escapees who hadn't forced his way in. He had been a mentor of sorts to Michael and ultimately deemed him worthy of the money and the answer to one of the greatest American mysteries. When Prison Break was good, it was legendary, and fans can watch these classic moments by streaming the 20th anniversary collection on Hulu.

US President Donald Trump is placing more pressure on Ukraine than on Russia as he prepares for a new summit with President Vladimir Putin, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing sources. 

Several American officials told the outlet that they have observed Trump's “hesitation to push Putin, who has shown little interest in concessions needed for a deal.” One WSJ source noted that “the White House has put more pressure on Kiev than on Moscow.”

The WSJ said Washington has weighed additional measures to increase pressure on Moscow, but so far has stopped short of applying them. This comes as Putin and Trump held a phone call on Thursday, during which the two agreed to hold a summit in Budapest, Hungary, in the coming weeks.

Hoping to build diplomatic momentum, US officials are reportedly planning a series of lower-level meetings with their Russian counterparts, to be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio – rather than special envoy Steve Witkoff — a change viewed positively by Ukrainian and EU diplomats, according to the paper. Western media tend to view Rubio as more hawkish on Russia than Witkoff, who has held several face-to-face rounds of talks with Putin this year.

Following the call with Putin, Trump received Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky at the White House on Friday, with talks revolving around potential deliveries of long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kiev. According to Axios, however, the meeting was “bad,” and Zelensky left without any promises of deliveries.

Moscow has warned against supplying Tomahawks to Ukraine, arguing they would “not change the situation on the battlefield” but would “severely undermine the prospects of a peaceful settlement” and harm Russia-US relations.

Following the Trump-Zelensky meeting, the US president said that he had told both the Ukrainian leader and Putin that “it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL.” “They should stop where they are… Let both claim Victory, let History decide!” he said.

Russia has consistently praised the Trump administration over what it described as a genuine desire to find a peaceful settlement to the conflict and as attempts to understand its root causes.

Trump made the comments ahead of a planned visit by US Secretary Treasury Scott Bessent to China. Beijing and Washington are aiming to avoid another tit-for-tat tariff tussle.

China and the United States will conduct a new round of trade talks next week to avoid another denting tit-for-tat tariff tussle between the world's two biggest economies, as President Donald Trump called US tariffs on Chinese goods unsustainable.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday that he was expecting to meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia in the coming week.

On Friday, the US broadcaster Fox Business showed excerpts of an interview with Trump in which the American leader said he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit slated to be held in South Korea in November. 

Asked whether a 157% cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods was sustainable, Trump defended his decision while seemingly acknowledging its likely effect on the US economy.

""It's not sustainable, but that's what the number is... They forced me to do that,"" he said.

Last week, China expanded its export controls on the critical rare earths industry.

Beijing's move prompted Trump to threaten 100 percent tariffs on imports from the Asian economic giant in retaliation.

Earlier in the week, Bessent and Greer criticized China's restrictions, calling the decision a threat to global supply chains.

China enjoys dominance over rare-earth elements which are crucial for tech manufacturing. 

Trump has also threatened to levy new US export controls that would halt supplies of ""any and all critical software.""

Chinese state media Xinhua reported that Bessent and He had ""candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges"" in a video call on Saturday morning. The report added that both sides agreed to hold a new round of trade negotiation ""as soon as possible.""

The call was also attended by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Xinhua said.

Bessent wrote on social media platform X that the call was ""frank and detailed"", adding that the two senior officials would meet ""in-person next week"" to ""continue"" their discussions.

Over the last six months, the two have met in four European cities to chalk out a tariff truce that scaled down duties from a damaging triple-digit mark for each country.

The agreement is set to end on November 10.

The drone attack sparked a fire at the Orenburg gas processing plant in Russia, the world's largest facility of its kind. Follow DW for more.

Kyiv has struck a refinery some 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) east of Kyiv in Russia's Orenburg region, the regional governor said.

Although there has been no official confirmation that it carried out the strike, Ukraine has increased its attacks on Russian refineries and other energy facilities since August in an effort to disrupt petrol supplies and deprive Moscow of funding.

The strike comes days after a massive Russian drone and missile attack hit gas facilities in eastern Ukraine.

Below is a roundup of developments in Russia's war in Ukraine on the weekend of October 18 and 19:  

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged his US counterpart Donald Trump to exert more pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said Putin was stronger than Hamas, in a reference to the peace plan for Gaza brokered by the Trump administration.

Zelenskyy made the remarks during an interview with US channel NBC broadcast on Sunday.

Responding in English to a question on ""Meet the Press"" about whether the US leader should take a tougher stance with Putin, Zelenskyy replied, ""Yes, and even more because Putin is something similar, but more strong than Hamas."" 

""It's [a] bigger war, and he is the second army in the world,"" Zelenskyy added.

Zelenskyy visited Washington D.C. last week in a failed bid to secure US-made Tomahawk missiles, which the Ukrainian leader has been calling for for weeks.

Trump, who is set to meet with Putin in Budapest in the coming weeks, did not commit to providing Kyiv with the weapons, highlighting that doing so would be an ""escalation.""

The US leader also said that his country needed the weapons and did not want stockpiles to dwindle, something he highlighted again on Sunday during an appearance on US broadcaster Fox.

The Orenburg gas processing plant, the largest facility of its type in the world, has been compelled to halt its intake of gas from Kazakhstan following a Ukrainian drone attack, according to Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry.

The ministry ministry said Gazprom had notified it of the emergency but had yet to provide details on the extent of the damage or a timeline for resuming full operations.

Earlier, Orenburg regional governor Yevgeny Solntsev had said the plant had been partially damaged in the strike.

Ukraine confirmed it targeted the Gazprom operated processing plant.

Ukrainian drones struck a gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region, regional governor Yevgeny Solntsev said Sunday on Telegram.

The attack sparked a fire and left the plant partially damaged, Solntsev said.

This is the first time the plant, which is part of the Orenburg gas chemical complex, including Gazprom's production and processing facilities in the region, has been reported to have been hit.

The complex has an annual capacity of 45 billion cubic meters of gas, the world's largest facility of its kind.

Ukraine has not made an immediate comment, but it has increased its attacks on Russian refineries and energy facilities since August.

These attacks aim to disrupt petrol supplies and limit Moscow's funding.

Ukrainian forces say they shot down 40 of 62 drones launched by Russia overnight into Sunday.

Nineteen drones struck seven locations, damaging apartment blocks in the eastern town of Shakhtarske, which lies east of Dnipro in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ten people were injured.

Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry has said it intercepted 45 Ukrainian drones, mostly over the Samara and Saratov regions in southern Russia.

In the Urals, a drone hit a gas plant in Orenburg, sparking a fire, Orenburg Governor Yevgeny Solntsev said. 

No injuries were reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded full control of Ukraine's Donetsk region in a call with President Donald Trump, two senior officials familiar with the conversation, told The Washington Post. 

Russia or Russian-backed separatists have claimed parts of the region since 2014, but have never been able to take full control of it. 

The newspaper reported that Putin offered to surrender parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in exchange. 

That's a more restrained territorial claim than Putin made in August, during the Trump–Putin summit in Anchorage.

Trump did not mention the demands in public remarks during a meeting with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. 

Trump plans to meet with Putin in Hungary to continue discussions.

Russia claimed to have annexed the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in their entirety in September 2022, but only controls them in part, and Kyiv retains control of the eponymous regional capitals.

DW resumes its reporting on the war in Ukraine as the two sides exchange overnight drone attacks.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post, quoting two anonymous sources, has reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a call with President Donald Trump, demanded that Kyiv surrender complete control of the eastern Donetsk region as a condition for ending the war.

Despite concentrating its military efforts on the region in Ukraine, Russia has failed to conquer it.

You'll find these and other stories as we continue our coverage this Sunday. 

Repair work has begun on the power lines to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant after a four-week outage, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said.

""Restoration of off-site power is crucial for nuclear safety and security,"" he said in a post by the UN nuclear watchdog.

The plant was occupied by Russian forces shortly after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Although its reactors have been shut down, they still require cooling, which depends primarily on external power. Diesel generators were used as a backup.

The last high-voltage power line supplying Europe's largest nuclear power plant failed on September 23. Fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces had prevented repairs.

Both the IAEA and Russia have confirmed that conditions now allow the work to proceed.

Russian forces continued their attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight to Saturday.

More than 10 strikes hit Chuhuiv in the eastern Kharkiv region, causing power outages in almost all districts, Mayor Halyna Minayeva posted on Facebook.

The regional energy supplier in the northern city of Chernihiv said around 17,000 customers were without power after attacks on an energy infrastructure facility in the Koriukivka district. 

Ukraine's air force said Russia launched a total of 164 explosive-laden drones at Ukraine in overnight attacks. Some 136 were repelled, while 27 hit targets in 12 locations.  

Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces have taken the village of Pleshchiivka in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.

The claim has not been independently verified.

A large explosion in an explosives factory in the Russian city of Sterlitamak in the Urals has killed three women, a senior local offical has said, while refuting speculation that the blast was caused by a drone attack.

Five other people were being treated in hospital after the incident on Friday evening at the Avangard factory, according to Radi Khabirov, head of the Russian autonomous republic of Bashkortostan.

One building was destroyed but the plant continued to manufacture ""extremely necessary and sought-after products for our country,"" Khabirov said in a post on Telegram.

Russian media outlets reported that the factory produced weapons and ammunition for Russia's war in Ukraine.

In September, Ukrainian drones hit the Bashkortostan oil refinery run by state-controlled company Gazprom, as Kyiv tries to reduce Russian energy revenues used to fund the military.

A Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian-occupied part of Kherson region in southern Ukraine, has klled two people, the Russian-installed governor of the area, Vladimir Saldo, said on his Telegram channel on Saturday.

Both victims lived in a temporary accommodation centre for evacuees, Saldo said.

Russia claimed to have annexed the Kherson region in its entirety in September 2022 but only controls parts of it.

Ukrainian forces retook the regional capital, also called Kherson, in November 2022.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there had been a ""productive"" call with Kyiv's European allies following Zelenskyy's meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Starmer called for a ""just and lasting peace"" in Ukraine.

""Productive call this evening with @ZelenskyyUa, other European leaders and @SecGenNATO,"" he said.

""I reiterated our unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support,"" he added.

The call included leaders from Germany, Finland, Italy, Norway and Poland, along with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and European Council President Antonio Costa.

Zelenkyy wrote on X that he had shared details of his talks with Trump during the call.

""The main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe,"" he wrote.

""I am grateful for the conversation, for all the support, and for the readiness to stand with Ukraine,"" he added.

 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Kyiv has still not abandoned the hope that the US will approve the delivery of long-range Tomahawk missiles, despite a meeting with US President Donald Trump where the issue was apparently sidelined.

""Our teams work on it"" Zelensky told US broadcaster NBC in an interview.

""It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,'"" he said, while acknowledging Trump also didn't say ""yes.""

Zelenskyy told reporters after the meeting that although he and Trump discussed long-range weapons they ""decided that we don't speak about it because ... the United States doesn't want escalation.""

Kyiv has long requested the missiles from the US, as they would allow Ukraine to strike targets well within Russia.

In the interview, Zelenskyy noted that the weapons are therefore a sensitive issue for Moscow and that Russian President Vladimir Putin fears their delivery to Kyiv.

Trump's reticence on delivering Kyiv Tomahawks, which follows a period when he seemed more open to the idea, comes after his call with Putin on Thursday.

According to Putin's foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, Putin told Trump during the call that if Kyiv received the Tomahawks, it wouldn't ""change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between"" the US and Russia.

Thank you for joining DW's reporting on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now far into its third year.

News on the war is currently dominated by the question of whether US President Donald Trump will accede to Kyiv's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, with the chances of their being delivered to Ukraine seeming to dwindle after Friday's meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president.

Meanwhile, both sides continue to target each other's energy infrastructure: Kyiv in a bid to stop energy revenue from going to finance Russia's war, Moscow to disrupt supplies ahead of the winter and the heating season.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.—The U.S. State Department said Saturday that it has “credible reports” that the Hamas terrorist group could violate the cease-fire with an attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

If the attack takes place, it “would constitute a direct and grave violation” of the agreement forged by President Donald Trump to end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, the statement said.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US conducted a strike Friday on a boat that American intelligence officials believed was involved in illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean.
    


            Hegseth wrote in a post on X that the vessel was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and had “substantial amounts of narcotics” on board. He said the three men on the boat were all killed and no US forces were harmed.
    


            This is the seventh known strike in a series of recent attacks by the US military on vessels that the Trump administration says are involved in drug trafficking. It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board. President Donald Trump said Saturday the survivors of that strike were released to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia.
    


            “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote Sunday. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”
    


            The strikes are a part of the Trump administration's hardening stance against South American countries allegedly involved in smuggling illicit drugs into the US. The president recently authorized the CIA to operate in Venezuela and has been weighing military action inside the country as part of a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            Trump has also clashed publicly with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US last week of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of its Caribbean strikes. Trump announced Sunday he would cancel all US payments and subsidies to the country.
    


            Petro responded on X, calling Trump “ignorant” and denying his involvement in illegal drug trade.
    


            The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it appears to give grounds for the president designating drug traffickers as enemy combatants and having them summarily killed without legal review.
    


            Historically, people involved in drug trafficking have been considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.
    


            The Senate blocked a push earlier this month to limit Trump's ability to command the military to strike alleged drug boats without congressional authorization.
    


            Sens. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski were the only Republican lawmakers to cross party lines and support the resolution.
    


            “We basically are summarily executing people who are accused of something. It's a terrible idea,” Paul, who joined with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine to force a vote on reining in Trump's war powers, told CNN on Thursday.

            Disgraced former Rep. George Santos, fresh off his release from prison after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence on Friday night, dismissed his critics, telling CNN he's focused on the future after eating a “very large slice of humble pie” during his time behind bars.
    


            Santos, who had been serving a seven-year term for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress, said he had just been released from solitary confinement when his fellow inmates saw news of the commutation on television and told him.
    


            “I had no expectations,” the New York Republican told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.
    


            Some Republicans from New York weren't happy with the president's decision. Rep. Nick LaLota posted on social media that Santos “didn't merely lie — he stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”
    


            LaLota added that Santos should “devote the rest of his life to demonstrating remorse and making restitution to those he wronged.”
    


            Rep. Andrew Garbarino, in a statement to the Washington Times, said Santos “has shown no remorse. The less than three months that he spent in prison is not justice.”
    


            Santos said on Sunday his former colleagues are “entitled to their opinion.”
    


            “People are going to hate me. It doesn't matter whoever gets clemency in the future, whoever that person might be. I'm pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that's just the reality of our country.”
    


            He claimed he had received a “a seven-year disproportionate sentence that is anything but political if you talk to anybody who really looks at these kinds of cases.”
    


            Santos is no longer required to pay any further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions, according to a copy of his clemency grant which was posted on social media by US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin.
    


            Asked whether he will pay his donors back, Santos said Sunday he will “do my best to do whatever the law requires of me.”
    


            “The investment was made to win a race. I won that race,” Santos said. “There was no fraud there.”
    


            He said he is now “going to look to the future,” apologizing to the American people and people in his former district, saying he was in a “chaotic ball of flames” at the time he committed his crimes.
    


            Santos said his experience in prison, especially in solitary confinement, has inspired him to focus on helping with prison reform efforts, something he had spoken with the president about.
    


            “It's actually creating recidivism because it's not doing what it's supposed to do,” Santos said of the prison system. “I told this to the president, that I'd love to be involved with prison reform, and not in a partisan way.”
    


            Santos said he did not see himself returning to politics in the next 10 years.
    


            “I'm 37 years old. I can tell you this, not that I can see if in the next decade. … I'm all politicked out,” he said.

            The San Jose Sharks have apologized after an apparent offensive message seeming to praise Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was displayed on the arena's scoreboard during the team's Hispanic heritage celebration on Saturday night against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
    


            Video shared with CNN showed the scoreboard displaying: “SJ SHARKS FANS LOVE ICE !! GET ‘EM BOYZ !” Some fans at SAP Center in San Jose, California,﻿ can be heard booing in response.
    


            Sharks fan Jessica Clark told CNN she and her group were “appalled” by the message. “They're my favorite team — I even have tattoos — but this was something that should've been caught,” she said.
    


            In a statement posted on X later, the NHL team said: “During the first intermission of tonight's game, an offensively worded message which had been externally submitted was inadvertently displayed on the in-arena scoreboard.”
    


            Sharks Sports & Entertainment said the message did not reflect the organization's values and had not been detected during its standard review process. The team expressed deep regret and said it is investigating the origin of the message.
    


            The incident occurred during “Los Tiburones Night,” the Sharks' ninth annual celebration of “the team's commitment to the Bay Area's vibrant Hispanic community,” according to the club's website.
    


            The Sharks would go on to lose to the Penguins 3-0.

Maye Musk, mother of Elon Musk, details why she left the Democratic Party and responds to criticism against her son, on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

FIRST ON FOX: A Trump-aligned political consulting firm set out to investigate the ideological swing of affluent, college-educated white women who were once considered moderate, but have since moved farther to the left, uncovering what researchers describe as a new voting bloc of left-wing women: ""Resistance Grandmas.""

""We are so knowledgeable about everything,"" one woman said in a Northern Virginia focus group video reviewed by Fox News Digital, referring to herself and the other women who joined the session while slamming President Donald Trump's ""One Big, Beautiful Bill."" ""When [Trump voters] start being personally impacted, that's when I'm hopeful that a little bit of something is gonna change.""

""It's gonna be a catastrophe,"" another woman chimed in, as another middle-aged woman added, ""However, they will find a way to blame Democrats.""

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a report conducted by the National Public Affairs (NPA), the polling arm of Trump campaign-aligned American Made Media Company, in September, as well as the full two-hour focus group session in northern Virginia that showcased the beliefs of 10 white, liberal, middle-aged, college-educated, upper–middle-class suburban women.

The women who participated in the focus group were not informed it was conducted by a Trump-aligned polling firm, they were only told that they were brought in to discuss political topics for a focus group commissioned by another research firm. The researcher leading the focus group told the women at the start of the meeting that she had ""no stake"" in their comments ""one way or the other,"" and that the women ""could say whatever comes to mind.""

""Pretty much anything is fair game,"" the focus group leader told the women. 

Fox News Digital is not publishing footage of the video or names of the women but reviewed extensive footage of the session for the purposes of this article. 

The focus group was conducted to study how affluent middle-aged and older white women have increasingly shifted to the political left in recent years, and was sparked by a racist sign displayed outside a Northern Virginia school board meeting in August targeting Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears. 

""In the year since President Trump's historic victory, commentators have obsessed over what they call the radicalization of young white men. But a quieter, just as revealing transformation has swept another group once known for moderation and civility: older, affluent white women. This change came into sharp focus last August in Arlington, Virginia,"" NPA's report outlines. 

The Virginia gubernatorial cycle is at a fever pitch, with the election just over two weeks away pitting ex-CIA agent and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger against Republican Earle-Sears. In August, a white woman was spotted holding a Jim Crow-era-reminiscent sign targeting Earle-Sears, who is Black, when the candidate attended a school board meeting. 

""Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then blacks can't share my water fountain,"" the sign read, igniting outrage from conservatives and others who called it racist.

The women in the focus group overwhelmingly characterized the sign as written in poor taste, describing its words as ""ugly,"" but also justified it by arguing Republicans have ""already taken it too far with their trans bans."" Another woman used the N-word while comparing the sign to those of the segregated Jim Crow era of the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries in the American South. 

""What's the best analogy for a trans person not being able to use a particular bathroom in our recent modern history?"" one participant asked the group. 

Another woman chimed in: ""You used to have hotels that said 'No n----rs, no Jews, no dogs at these hotels. Is that… I don't know if that's the same thing.""

""Like, I don't think I would feel uncomfortable, and I definitely wouldn't hold up that sign,"" the first woman said in response. ""But this person, I think, was just trying to find an appropriate analogy.""

The NPA report explained that polling data since the 2012 election, which pitted former Democrat President Barack Obama against Republican Mitt Romney, showed that ""voting patterns among white voters and women haven't moved much in a decade.""

The shift to the left, the report argued, is not due to gender or race, but rather income and education. 

""In 2012, college graduates leaned Republican, 51-47, while postgraduates favored Democrats 55-42. By 2024, that pattern had flipped and widened: Harris won college grads 53-45 and postgrads 59-38. Non-college voters went the other way. High-school grads and those with some college, once evenly split, gave Trump a 56-43 lead,"" the report found. 

""Income followed suit. Voters earning under $50,000, once a 60-38 Obama bloc, shifted to a 50-48 Trump edge. Those earning over $100,000 flipped from a 54-44 Romney majority to a 51-47 Harris win,"" it continued. 

The report took issue with the media asking and diving into explanations on ""what ‘broke' young white men"" to move farther to the right and help re-elect Trump in 2024, but argued the question should instead be: ""What radicalized rich white women, and whether they even realize it.""

The women in the focus group overwhelmingly presented themselves as arbiters of knowledge, reporting that they have the ""luxury"" of reading news articles from different outlets, while other voters are more concerned about costs of living and putting food on the table. 

DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING A CRITICAL MISTAKE — AND VOTERS ARE LETTING THEM KNOW

One woman in the group recounted that her cousin living in a Heartland state was a lifelong Democrat who announced ahead of the 2024 election that he was leaning towards voting for Trump, which the woman said made her nearly fall ""off my chair."" 

The cousin, a male farmer, reported to her that the Biden administration had not helped U.S. farmers. 

""He doesn't know. He's not paying attention to China's not buying wheat or soybeans,"" the female voter said. ""He's just concerned about his daily life and making enough money to support his family. And so I don't think they're paying attention.""

""I think a lot of times people are just very focused on … how it impacts them on that day and not reading The Washington Post or The New York Times or other things that we all have access to and, you know, have the luxury of doing,"" she added.

Another woman reported to the group that she had turned in her longtime friend after she found out she had breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The FBI launched a tip line shortly after Jan. 6, 2021, where people could report those who were ""instigating violence in Washington, D.C."" 

""She said, ‘We were just walking around,'"" the woman in the focus group recounted of the conversation with her friend about Jan. 6. ""And I know she slipped. I know she didn't mean to tell me she was in the Capitol.""

""And I said, 'It wasn't a f---ing open house. You weren't, you weren't buying the Capitol,'"" she continued, as other women in the group remarked, ""Wow"" and ""Good for you.""

NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED DETAILS HOW DEMOCRATS LOST THE NON-WHITE VOTERS OBAMA GAINED

The woman said she has not spoken to her former friend since, and submitted a tip to authorities that she was in the Capitol the day of the protests. 

""And then I had that whole inner turmoil of, ‘Do I go on that website and say I think that she would' …. I went back and forth on that for probably two weeks and asked some people. And finally, I just went on and said 'she was there, and I don't know what role she had, what it was,'"" she said. ""She was in that building by her own admission.""

""As the session ended, they voiced a small hope that the country might still find a way back to calm and common purpose. Whether that hope can survive a culture built on outrage is uncertain. But their conversation left one clear lesson Beneath polls and party lines, the real contest for the nation's future is over how Americans think, speak, and live with one another,"" the report concluded. 

The women in the group called on the Democrat Party to find cohesion and to disseminate their message to party leaders across the country in order to win upcoming elections. 

""Democrats need to stop primarying for the lesser Republican. So what's happening is … Democrats are voting between two Republican primary candidates, and they're voting for the idiot, crazy, right-wing guy so that they don't have to compete against this actual intelligent person. And that's where we're getting these nutcases,"" one woman said. 

Another woman said the DNC should combat everything Trump says, including when the president pinned blame on radical liberal violence for the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September.

""I think it comes from the DNC. I think they need to organize. I think they need a cohesive message. I think they need to be vocal every time Trump says something, even about Charlie Kirk. Yes. No one should be killed for what they believe in. A hundred percent. But they are turning him into a martyr,"" one woman said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The party that cried fascism","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3855322/democratic-party-cried-fascism/","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

CNN's chief data analyst, Harry Enten, delivered a dose of cold reality to Democrats who had assumed the party was on track to reclaim control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections. According to Kalshi, a closely watched prediction market, Democrats' chances of retaking the majority have plummeted over the past six months — from 83% in April to 63% in October.

What had appeared as a “likely Democratic win in the House come next year has become much closer to a toss-up at this point, although still slightly leaning Democratic.”

Enten noted that this sentiment is most apparent in generic congressional ballot polls. On the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, the RealClearPolitics average showed Democrats with a 7.3-point lead, and they ultimately won by 8.4 points. Today, Democrats still hold a 1.9-point edge — a margin analysts consider favorable to Republicans due to the Democrats' structural disadvantage. Because Democrats tend to pile up huge margins in urban districts, many of their votes don't translate into additional seats, effectively becoming “wasted.” As a result, Republicans can win more House races even with a smaller share of the national popular vote.

WHAT IS ANTIFA AND HOW DOES TERRORIST DESIGNATION AFFECT LEFT-WING NETWORK?

But, if President Donald Trump truly represents the second coming of Hitler, as many Democrats claim, why are Republican candidates polling stronger today than they did during his first administration?

Well, it might be because Democrats more closely resemble Nazi Party propaganda master Joseph Goebbels than Trump does “der Führer” and that voters are finally catching on.

After Trump's once-ridiculed negotiations to free the Gaza hostages unexpectedly bore fruit on Monday, the smarter Democrats summoned enough grace to acknowledge the achievement. The rest, those for whom hatred of Trump has hardened into a kind of moral religion, may have preferred that the hostages remain in Hamas captivity rather than credit Trump for their freedom.

The Democrats' rhetoric about all things Trump has become wildly dishonest. What began as partisan exaggeration has turned into a reflexive contempt that now borders on slander. Every gesture, utterance, or policy is cast as apocalyptic, every success dismissed as sinister. The habit of moral hyperbole has become so ingrained that many on the left no longer argue against Trump — they simply denounce him as though invoking a curse.

The following reader response to a recent article I wrote on blue-state officials' efforts to impede Trump's enforcement of U.S. immigration law illustrates the point perfectly. It reads:

“Why is it so difficult for people to see that the Trump regime is trying to destroy democracy? They are acting so similar to what happened in Germany nearly one hundred years ago it is frightening. How much more clearly can you say ‘I am a fascist' than by declaring anti-fascists the enemy?”

The reader claims, without evidence, that Trump is attempting to “destroy democracy,” drawing a sweeping parallel to Germany in the 1930s but offering no specifics. His administration hasn't shuttered any newspapers, confiscated private property, or dispatched its political opponents to concentration camps. Nothing even remotely resembling Kristallnacht has occurred.

What Trump has done is try to enforce existing immigration laws and address the surge in crime that has accompanied lenient prosecution policies and the spread of no-cash-bail initiatives championed by liberal officials.

This comment is absurd on its face. But because it's been repeated so often and for so long, it's now accepted as the truth by the majority of Democrats.

However, as the accomplishments of this president continue to pile up, the contrast between rhetoric and reality has become impossible to ignore. The Democrats' narrative, built on hysteria, moral theater, and a decade of self-righteous outrage, has begun to collapse under its own weight. What was once sold as a defense of democracy now looks suspiciously like its parody.

The irony is rich: criminals and illegal immigrants are endlessly defended in the name of “due process,” yet the same courtesy is denied to the president of the United States. Trump's every utterance is treated as evidence of guilt, his every success as proof of conspiracy. The presumption of innocence, that most basic tenet of liberal democracy, is now reserved only for those who despise him.

JOHN REID PRESSES DEMOCRATIC RIVAL FOR ‘DUCKING' DEBATES IN VIRGINIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR RACE

For years, the Left has insisted that Trump represents the death of democracy and the rise of fascism. But this myth is crumbling. Voters who were once swayed by that feverish story are waking up to the gap between what they were told and what they can see with their own eyes. The Republic still stands, elections still happen, and the press still shouts its opposition from every front page. The apocalypse, it seems, has been postponed.

All the while, the same chorus that cries “fascism” at every policy disagreement continues to insist that two plus two equals five — and demands that the rest of us applaud its arithmetic.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Israel strikes Gaza in first major ceasefire test, saying Hamas attacked troops","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/19/israel-strikes-gaza-in-first-major-test-of-ceasefire.html","Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:42:40 GMT","



Israel on Sunday struck targets in southern Gaza after saying its troops came under fire from Hamas militants, in the first major test of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire meant to halt more than two years of war.

Militants used a rocket-propelled grenade, and Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery, the military said.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consulted with Israel's security heads and directed the military to take ""strong action"" against any ceasefire violations, but didn't threaten to return to war.

Israel's military said that militants shot at troops in areas of the southern Gaza city of Rafah that are Israeli-controlled according to agreed-upon ceasefire lines. No injuries were reported. A separate military statement said that Israel would respond to ceasefire violations with ""great force"" against Hamas.

Hamas, which continued to accuse Israel of multiple ceasefire violations, said that it wasn't connected to any clashes in Rafah.

The Palestinian group also said that talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.

An Israeli airstrike killed at least six Palestinians in central Gaza, health officials said. The strike hit a makeshift coffeehouse on the coastal side of the town of Zawaida, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government.

Another Israeli strike killed at least two people close to the Al-Ahly soccer club in the Nuseirat refugee camp, the ministry said. The strike hit a tent and wounded eight others, said Awda hospital, which received the casualties.

A third strike hit a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis in the south, killing at least one person, according to Nasser hospital.

An Israeli military official told journalists there had been three incidents Sunday, two in southern Gaza and one in the north, and noted that the update was partial for now.

Israel identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight.

Netanyahu's office said the bodies belonged to Ronen Engel, a father of three from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai agricultural worker from Kibbutz Be'eri.

Both were believed to have been killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war. Engel's wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a ceasefire in November 2023.

Hamas, in the past week, has handed over the remains of 12 hostages.

Hamas' armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said that it had found the body of a hostage and would return it on Sunday ""if circumstances in the field"" allowed. It warned that any escalation by Israel would hamper search efforts.

Israel on Saturday said the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would stay closed ""until further notice"" and its reopening would depend on how Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning the remains of all 28 deceased hostages.

Hamas group says the devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas of Gaza have slowed the handover. Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned.

Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died. The ministry has posted photos of bodies on its website to help families attempting to locate loved ones. The bodies were decomposed and blackened. and some were missing limbs and teeth.

Only 25 bodies have been identified, the Health Ministry said.

After Israel and Hamas exchanged 20 living hostages for more than 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, the handover of remains is a major issue in the first stage of the ceasefire. A major scale-up of humanitarian aid, including the opening of the Rafah crossing, for people entering or leaving Gaza, is the other central issue.

Hamas said talks with mediators to start the ceasefire's second phase have begun.

The next stages of the ceasefire are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory.

Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesman, said late Saturday that the second phase of negotiations ""requires national consensus."" He said Hamas has begun discussions to ""solidify its positions,"" without giving details.

According to the U.S. plan, the negotiations will include disarming Hamas and the establishment of an internationally backed authority to run Gaza.

Kassem reiterated that the group won't be part of the ruling authority in a postwar Gaza. He called for the prompt establishment of a body of Palestinian technocrats to run day-to-day affairs.

For now, ""government agencies in Gaza continue to perform their duties, as the vacuum is very dangerous, and this will continue until an administrative committee is formed and agreed upon by all Palestinian factions,"" he said.

The Rafah crossing was the only one not controlled by Israel before the war. It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Palestinians to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.

On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority's Interior Ministry in Ramallah announced procedures for Palestinians wishing to leave or enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. For those who want to leave Gaza, Palestinian Embassy staff from Cairo will be at the crossing to issue temporary travel documents that allow entry into Egypt. Palestinians who wish to enter Gaza will need to apply at the embassy.

The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.

Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross.

Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack that sparked the war.

Oops, something went wrong

Professor Andrew Urquhart is Professor of Finance and Financial Technology and Head of the Department of Finance at Birmingham Business School (BBS).

This is the ninth installment of the Professor Coin column, in which I bring important insights from published academic literature on cryptocurrencies to the Decrypt readership. In this article, I discuss Bitcoin energy usage, and the future for sustainable cryptos.

When you hear the words “Bitcoin mining,” you might picture giant warehouses packed with whirring computers, gobbling up electricity like there's no tomorrow. That image isn't far from reality.

Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, its proof-of-work (PoW) system has been both its greatest strength and its biggest controversy. It keeps the network secure and decentralized, but it also ties digital finance to very real energy and environmental costs.

Professor Coin: What Gives Bitcoin Its Value?

The go-to benchmark is the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), which estimates that Bitcoin mining consumes electricity on the scale of mid-sized countries. But here's the catch: Bitcoin's energy use doesn't rise smoothly. Instead, it follows market cycles. When Bitcoin's price surges, miners switch on more rigs, pushing up hashrate, difficulty, and electricity demand. When prices dip, older or less efficient machines go dark.

Stoll, Klaaßen and Gallersdörfer (2019) pegged annual consumption around 46 TWh back then, with ~22 megatons of CO₂ emissions More recently, new data suggests that consumption has grown substantially.

According to the 2025 Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report, Bitcoin's annual electricity usage is now estimated at 138 TWh, with network-wide emissions of approximately 39.8 Mt CO₂e. The same report also notes that 52.4 % of the energy used by miners comes from sustainable sources (renewables + nuclear) as of 2025.

These updated figures help us see that while Bitcoin's environmental footprint remains significant, the composition of its energy mix is also shifting—offering a more nuanced narrative for 2025.

How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Really Use? Less Than You Might Think

New research asks a broader question: what's the total environmental cost? A 2023 paper by Chamanara et al. (2023) estimates Bitcoin mining at ~173 TWh, adding in CO₂, water, and land impacts.

Meanwhile, the UN University warned that mining draws heavily on freshwater in regions with scarce supply. And it's not just the running of machines: de Vries (2021) estimated tens of kilotons of e-waste annually from discarded ASIC rigs, since miners churn through hardware every couple of years. This holistic picture means Bitcoin's footprint is now seen as multi-dimensional: electricity, emissions, water, land, and waste.

Here's where the story gets interesting. Not every blockchain guzzles energy like Bitcoin. In September 2022, Ethereum's Merge replaced PoW with proof-of-stake (PoS). Overnight, its energy use dropped by ~99.9%. Same user experience, radically different environmental profile. This one move showed the world that crypto doesn't have to be a climate villain.

What is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work

Ethereum's success has raised uncomfortable questions for Bitcoin. If another major chain can deliver security and functionality without the same energy burn, should Bitcoin follow?

Purists say no: PoW is what gives Bitcoin its incorruptible, apolitical security. Critics counter that clinging to PoW risks political backlash, carbon taxes, or even outright bans in certain jurisdictions.

Not all miners are environmental bad actors. Some argue they are part of the solution, not the problem. In Texas, mining farms strike deals with grid operators, curtailing power when demand spikes. In Iceland and Canada, miners plug into cheap hydropower. Recent engineering research even explores using mining to monetize excess methane from landfills or stranded renewables that would otherwise be wasted.

Elon Musk Gushes About Bitcoin 'Energy' Demands—Years After Environmental Gripes

The optimistic narrative goes like this: Bitcoin mining could act as a “buyer of last resort” for surplus green energy, smoothing out variability in solar and wind production. Studies like Hossain & Steigner (2024) and others suggest that, under the right conditions, mining could become an economic driver for renewable projects.

But the jury is still out—whether miners truly accelerate the green transition or just opportunistically chase cheap power depends on location, incentives, and regulation.

So where does that leave us in 2025? Here are the big takeaways:

Bitcoin's footprint is real and significant. We're not just talking electricity, but also carbon, water, land, and e-waste.

Design matters. Ethereum's Merge proved that PoS can slash energy costs without breaking a network. Bitcoin, by contrast, has doubled down on PoW.

Nuance is needed. Not all mining is equal—coal-based rigs in Kazakhstan are very different from hydro-powered farms in Quebec.

Policy pressure is rising. Expect governments to ask not just “how much power?” but “what kind of power, where, and with what externalities?”

Bitcoin will always carry the energy question with it. Whether it becomes a climate villain or an unlikely green ally depends on choices made by miners, policymakers, and communities in the next few years.

For now, one truth is clear: in crypto, the invisible isn't weightless. The future of digital money is tied, quite literally, to the power grid.

In the midst of today's AI hysteria, have we forgotten about blockchain technology and the seductive Web3 promise of decentralization? Robbie Bach, longtime Xbox chief and lieutenant of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, certainly hasn't. In his new novel, The Blockchain Syndicate, the prescient Bach imagines not only a giant political crypto grift, but also warns about the siren song of Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). No, blockchain might not be as sexy or lucrative as LLMs these days - but Web3 still matters even if, as Bach suggests, its promise of a decentralized network remains more seductive than substantive.









1. Crypto as “Giant Grift” Bach views cryptocurrency as a highly risky, speculative investment vehicle comparable to commodities like gold or silver, but warns there's “definitely a giant grift” happening, with vulnerable people—particularly older investors putting their savings at risk—being exploited by those taking advantage of the crypto craze.

2. AI Bubble Will Burst (But Not Catastrophically) Bach believes we're in an AI investment bubble where valuations are unsustainable. He predicts a “sorting” of winners and losers over the next 12-18 months, with many AI investments failing to pay out, though he avoids the term “explosive pop” in favor of a more gradual reckoning.

3. Blockchain: Powerful Tool, Double-Edged Sword Despite AI hype, Bach argues blockchain remains highly relevant and current. He sees it as neither inherently good nor bad—just a tool that can be used for legitimate purposes or criminal ones. He's particularly intrigued by its dual nature: ultimate transparency yet also ultimate obfuscation through anonymity.

4. Microsoft's Secret Weapon: Adaptability Bach credits Microsoft's longevity to its ability to make “tectonic shifts” across generations—from DOS to Windows, to cloud computing, to AI. He argues this skill at navigating massive transitions under Gates, Ballmer, and Nadella is more impressive than any single product innovation.

5. FBI and CIA Are Irreplaceable Bach emphasizes that regardless of political views about current leadership, institutions like the FBI and CIA are essential for national security with no viable replacement. If they're not working well, the solution is to fix them, not abandon them—a theme central to his thriller's premise.

CBDCs and their impact on banks, citizens and customers

Share

In a digital age where technology influences every aspect of our lives, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a significant focus for governments, financial institutions, and businesses. These digital versions of national currencies promise enhanced security, efficiency, and increased financial inclusion. However, they also raise questions regarding architecture, technology, and governance. Download the factsheet for an in-depth exploration of the various CBDC models and their implications for central and commercial banks, as well as citizens and customers.




Central banks globally are at various evolutionary stages with CBDCs, so there are currently many models and approaches. Governments and financial institutions are conducting real-world tests to explore the desirability, feasibility and viability of each type.

These digital currencies promise to reshape domestic and international financial systems, but their success hinges not just on individual attributes. They must also be able to interact seamlessly with other CBDC systems. Main CBDC models follow the four following archetypes:

Focusing first on Wholesale CBDCs aimed at domestic financial institutions, these have significant potential to revolutionise domestic payment systems and interbank settlements. While they are feasible and advantageous for these specific sectors, it's worth noting that their scope and impact are confined to a specialised market within the financial industry. 

Turning to Retail CBDCs, which are intended for the general public, these offer notable benefits from a consumer standpoint. However, their introduction poses considerable challenges in terms of feasibility. Specifically, there are concerns about how these might disrupt existing commercial banking systems and potentially destabilise financial markets. 

 

Using Retail CBDCs for cross-border transactions offers advantages, but these are largely theoretical at this stage. While they could offer benefits to individual consumers engaging in international trade, several obstacles stand in the way, such as foreign exchange management, consumer protection and regulatory compliance.

Finally, of the various options, Wholesale Cross-Border CBDCs are emerging as the most balanced in terms of desirability, viability and feasibility. These digital currencies hold promise for significantly streamlining international trade by eliminating inefficiencies in traditional banking systems, allowing multiple currencies and assets to be settled and various access policies to coexist.

As central banks worldwide explore various CBDC models, Wholesale Cross-Border CBDCs have emerged as a top priority for many, due to their desirability, viability and feasibility. This shift marks a transition from years of theoretical study to the actual process of productisation.

 

CBDCs offer efficient payments, cost savings for central banks, and financial inclusion. However, they require acceptance, address regulatory challenges, and demand robust security measures. 

The current momentum is leaning towards Wholesale Cross-Border CBDCs, but there are key questions that central and commercial banks must address. These range from legal and regulatory considerations to implications for monetary policy and financial stability.

CBDCs are rapidly gaining momentum, so there's a need for meticulous planning, in-depth analysis, impact assessement and a keen eye on balancing risks and ambitions. And as the concept of CBDCs becomes more widely accepted globally, specialised expertise will become paramount.

Read a JSON file, scale an image, stitch it together.

An executive is retiring. He's been very fond of horse races, but has been very responsible throughout the years. Now with some free time on his hands, he spends more time than ever at the tracks and collects large amounts of data. He takes his data, along with his conviction that he's certainly onto something, to a friend in research at a nearby university. He convinces his friend to take a look at his data and find a model they can use to win at betting. After many delays, and the researcher becoming more disheveled over months of work, he returns to the retired executive to explain his model. He begins ""if we assume all the horses are identical and spherical...""

Well, for sure, a core tenet of computer science is that all models of computing are equally powerful in what inputs they can map to what outputs, if you set aside any other details

Spherical cows are about simplifying assumptions that lead to absurd conclusions, not simplified models or simplified notation in general.Calling functional programming a spherical cow when you mean that automatic memory management is a simplifying assumption, is such a gross sign of incompetence that nobody should keep reading the rest of the blog.

There aren't any commonly-accepted conclusions from spherical cows because the bit is the punch line. It's a joke a physics 101 student makes when toughing through problems that assume away any real-world complexity and thus applicability.Spherical cows, in the real world, are pedagogical tools first, approximations second, and mis-applied models by inexperienced practitioners third.“Hello World” is a spherical cow. Simplifying assumptions about data are spherical cows.

But I think the way the US is set up (districting, gerrymandering, redlined, electoral college, etc) makes it far too easy for fringe beliefs to take over and dictate policy. So having states simply being more independent puts up far more barriers to all of us just losing our freedom.I live in IL. (Not near Chicago). My kids public school only gets about 15% of its funding from the federal govt. We could just finally stop having our stupid flat income tax and make up the shortfall. It might set back the universal preschool system, perhaps (which would be a tragedy but better than complete destruction).Meanwhile, schools might not even exist in many other states if federal funding disappeared.

That said, as a fly on the wall, my obvious observation from people at large is a direct correlation between how much power they believe  states should have and whether or not they belong to the party in power.  So it's definitely worth the exercise of seeing if you'd feel the same way still if your exact clone ran the federal government.

Let's say we get rid of Medicare, Medicaid, social security, and research funding at the federal level. What happens next?The West Coast and North East form compacts, companies, or nonprofits that provide healthcare, retirement and funding for their schools. The south, parts of the Midwest, and the plains fail to do so (at least to the same level) and within a generation we have two separate countries and war.

Fight back against _what_? Look: our universities really do need reform, and the perceptive observer should be able to see that independent of political opinions. The current administration may be an imperfect vehicle for reform, but I don't see anyone else trying.In particular, universities need to return to pursuing truth. Not every department at every school has abandoned the goal of seeking pure knowledge, granted, but the reality is that many have oriented themselves towards building a ""better world"" by preaching (there is no other word) the ""right"" ideas well past the point where they intersect with the real world.It is damn hard for me to muster sympathy for the universities. I recall that they spent a decade demanding statements of ideological affiliation as a precondition of hiring, that they pollute the epistemic commons by suppressing inconvenient facts, and that they rationale injustice against individuals by gesturing at universal, cosmic justice that they claim they alone have the power to discern.I see no reason to send public money to seminaries that have murdered universities, donned their skins, and demand respect as institutes of knowledge.

It sadly does not mean that universities are laser-focused on seeking truth, and are free from ideological biases, often very obvious. Regarding truth, one of the leading theories in humanities is that of Michel Foucault, which states that there cannot be any objective truth, and what is considered true is determined by power structures.I'm glad to see though that the four universities are making a stand, and value independence above whatever ""federal benefits"" the administration may offer. It's sad that these are only 4 out of 9.

But surely it also can't be the case that colleges demand what are basically declarations of political allegiance in the form of DEI statements, institutional trust is nosediving and ideological capture is to blame in large part. I hope this push from the administration fails, but I also hope something changes because otherwise the result is going to be worse than if universities actually submitted to these demands.

Consider crime. Restorative justice has failed everywhere it's been tried . Utterly. Comprehensively. Totally. Everywhere it's tried, restorative justice increases crime and degrades the public spirit.Yet universities continue to push it, despite all evidence, because it flatters a certain worldview. That this viewpoint is universal in academia isn't the organic victory of a good idea, but ideological groupthink that becomes a menace to society when it escapes the quad.And it's not only that equitable justice is the dominant viewpoint: it's that no competing viewpoint are allowed. To disagree is to be a bad person, and universities today wield every institutional weapon they have against ""bad"" people who hold ""bad"" ideas. This is not an environment conducive to knowledge formation.No university department that pushes ""equitable justice"" as summa bonum should receive public money. It's just nonsense.So it is for many university programs these days. As J.S. Mill wrote: ""He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion.""

Universities? Can you point to a university whose explicit policy is restorative justice? That's not how universities generally work. You're probably taking issue with an individual department which naturally has a certain research and academic history.Are you prepared to cite the works prepared and researched by individuals at a university or lab which counter the research on restorative justice?If not then either it doesn't exist and we're operating on anecdata or it does exist and the research system is proceeding exactly as intended. You are also comparing the outcomes of policy to the work of scientists and philosophers without analyzing the specifics of imperfect policy meeting an imperfect world.Research and knowledge work in general is often wrong. That's not the point. For decades large parts of the genome were believed to be garbage. That wasn't amended by the government it was amended by researchers following the scientific process. The politicization of the process doesn't speed it up, it simply introduces an outside malignant influence to an otherwise slow but steady process of inquiry.

A wicked man to be sure but very helpful in breaking Progressive's control of institutions. Also, showing their hypocrisy as they complain about people doing to them what they've been doing for decades now. If it's so bad, they should likewise cease all ideological activities in all institutions. (They won't.)

This is the original compact https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/1...1 The Compact explicitly makes federal funding conditional on compliance, meaning that universities must either align with federal definitions of “excellence” and “neutrality” or lose access to research grants, contracts, student loans, and tax exemptions. In practice, this could establish a centralized federal control mechanism over university policies effectively nationalizing large portions of higher education decision-making without direct legislation.Sections 2 and 4 (“Marketplace of Ideas” and “Institutional Neutrality”) appear to promote pluralism, but they impose mandatory structural changes to ensure “no single ideology dominant”. This could require ideological balancing in faculty hiring, curricula, and departmental governance. The threat of Department of Justice enforcement transforms “neutrality” into a federally monitored ideological litmus test, likely constraining academic freedom more than protecting it.Section 6 defines “male,” “female,” “woman,” and “man” strictly by biological function and requires single-sex spaces to be maintained on that basis. This departs from current federal civil rights interpretations under Title IX and would effectively prohibit recognition of gender identity in campus policy rolling back existing protections for transgender and nonbinary students.By forbidding universities from commenting institutionally on “societal and political events” unless directly related to operations, the Compact silences institutional voices on issues like racial justice, climate change, or foreign policy—even if faculty consensus supports public engagement. The “marketplace of ideas” clause simultaneously allows punishment of university employees or centers deemed “dominant” in ideology, directly threatening critical studies programs (e.g., gender studies, ethnic studies).Section 8 introduces anti-money-laundering and KYC requirements typically reserved for banks, applied here to universities. It also mandates information sharing with DHS and the State Department and caps foreign student enrollment at 15%, with a 5% per-country limit.

This mechanism represents an extraordinary form of financial coercion that could bankrupt noncompliant universities, effectively forcing universal submission or privatization.

1 The Compact explicitly makes federal funding conditional on compliance, meaning that universities must either align with federal definitions of “excellence” and “neutrality” or lose access to research grants, contracts, student loans, and tax exemptions. In practice, this could establish a centralized federal control mechanism over university policies effectively nationalizing large portions of higher education decision-making without direct legislation.Sections 2 and 4 (“Marketplace of Ideas” and “Institutional Neutrality”) appear to promote pluralism, but they impose mandatory structural changes to ensure “no single ideology dominant”. This could require ideological balancing in faculty hiring, curricula, and departmental governance. The threat of Department of Justice enforcement transforms “neutrality” into a federally monitored ideological litmus test, likely constraining academic freedom more than protecting it.Section 6 defines “male,” “female,” “woman,” and “man” strictly by biological function and requires single-sex spaces to be maintained on that basis. This departs from current federal civil rights interpretations under Title IX and would effectively prohibit recognition of gender identity in campus policy rolling back existing protections for transgender and nonbinary students.By forbidding universities from commenting institutionally on “societal and political events” unless directly related to operations, the Compact silences institutional voices on issues like racial justice, climate change, or foreign policy—even if faculty consensus supports public engagement. The “marketplace of ideas” clause simultaneously allows punishment of university employees or centers deemed “dominant” in ideology, directly threatening critical studies programs (e.g., gender studies, ethnic studies).Section 8 introduces anti-money-laundering and KYC requirements typically reserved for banks, applied here to universities.

The only unnecessary part is explicitly calling out conservative opinions, some of which will have no place in some university subjects, e.g. a geology student insisting the Earth is 6000 years old.

We certainly don't issue degrees based only on what expertise they identify as. We don't allow them in office based on whether they identify as President or Principal. We should likewise not use their feelings or unsubstantiated beliefs to determine if they're a man or a woman when biology has the answer almost every time. Intersex, the exceptions, we'll handle on a case by case basis.

When executive demands something of private citizens and private entities, it means they are bossing over said people/entities. Nobody elected the executive to boss over people. When Congress attempts to set these same regulations, these entities get a chance to reach out to their reps and ask for changes. When Congress sets regulations, power is dispersed among 400+ reps.You are thinking about the outcome of the regulations feeling the same. ""No kings"" are demanding that the means to setting rules be distributed among reps - when the rulemaking is distributed, you'll find that the rules demanded will change - because most people don't want these exact rules as they stand. And they don't want to submit to a fickle corrupt executive who will change these rules selectively on a dime on a random Friday.

Bluesky is a social media platform loved by liberals, leftists, progressives, woke people, or whatever you want to call dislikers of Donald Trump. When a bunch of Donald Trump-associated accounts started using Bluesky ahead of this weekend in order to provoke a food fight, some were outraged or trolled back, but Bluesky's robust blocking feature and cultural norms around ignoring right-wing trolls and harassers made their presence mostly a non-issue.

On Friday afternoon, the Trump 2.0 White House account, @whitehouse-47.bsky.social, announced its momentous arrival by posting a vaguely triumphalist montage of clips that referenced a lot of inside jokes for Republicans that probably don't even register for outsiders, like one about Joe Biden's autopen.

To clarify that this was not meant to earnestly signal the opening of a channel for information exchange between citizens and the head of the U.S. federal government, the text of the post was a sarcastically cheerful provocation: “What's up, Bluesky? We thought you might've missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you. Can't wait to spend more quality time together! ❤️🇺🇸”

What's up, Bluesky? We thought you might've missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you.

Can't wait to spend more quality time together! ❤️🇺🇸

— The White House (@whitehouse-47.bsky.social) October 17, 2025 at 2:21 PM



The replies from the Bluesky faithful included a whole lot of invocations of Trump's alleged connections to Jeffrey Epstein, and references to the #NoKings movement.

Mostly, however, the account got blocked. According to the Bluesky block tracking site Clearsky, @whitehouse-47.bsky.social is already the second most blocked account on Bluesky, just below Vice President J.D. Vance, who joined the site over the summer and has since secured a durable position atop the ranking.

The White House's bid for attention was accompanied by similar introductory posts from the departments of State, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Commerce, the so-called “Department of War,” and many other cabinet departments and executive branch offices. Their posts and videos mostly just greet the users of Bluesky and hint at future dialogue in the same sarcastic tone at the initial White House post.

These accounts all show tens of thousands of blocks in the past 24 hours as of this writing—more blockers than followers in most cases. Some, like the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, earned themselves follower counts under 1,000. Most have spent the weekend posting platitudes, and receiving double-digit repost counts as users avoid taking the bait.

If the White House communications people who likely orchestrated all this were hoping to be able to generate epic lib meltdown content, it's doubtful the mostly muted reaction was worth their effort. That's because blocking on Bluesky is public, conspicuous, and designed to be total. Embeds will break. Reply chains will crumble. Further clashes, friction, and cognitive dissonance will drop off abruptly. The blocker and blockee will basically vanish from one another's universes.

Bluesky blocking culture also includes the use of block lists, one-stop-shopping for blocking all accounts in some category or group with a single tap. There is even, somewhat more controversially, at least one block list of all users who interacted with the White House account rather then simply blocking it. The many, many blocked nodes in the network weaken the network effect of posting on a platform, which in turn appears to have resulted in low engagement for a bunch of accounts associated with the most powerful person in the world.

Bluesky critics like Mark Cuban call Bluesky an echo chamber, and it's hard to argue that they're entirely wrong. But all the Trump White House set out to do this weekend in that echo chamber was make a screeching noise, and since users are equipped with very effective earplugs, it wasn't even all that annoying.

Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar says people need to wake up.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar said that the U.S. should end its dependence on China, and that the first thing it should do is to recognize its dependence is a problem. According to his opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. and China are already engaged in an economic war with each other, and other people should wake up to this reality. However, Sankar says that many business leaders still refuse to see this, and still wholeheartedly believe in the Chinese message of its ""peaceful rise.""

The opinion piece points out that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently expressed his opinion that the label 'China hawk' is not a badge of honor Americans should wear, it is really 'a badge of shame.' Huang also said it ""doesn't have to be all us or them. It could be us and them.""

Mulling over the Nvidia CEO's philosophy, the Palantir CTO wrote, ""The first step to ending our dependence on China is admitting we have a problem."" Sankar continued, ""We can continue as useful idiots, decrying ‘China hawks' who point out that we're funding our own demise. Or we can wake up to the reality that we're already in an economic war in which every purchase and investment will help determine which system survives.""

While Sankar does not directly call out Huang as a “useful idiot,” the implication is certainly there, given his reference to the Nvidia CEO's comments. The Nvidia CEO has always been against export controls on the most powerful chips, saying that such a move could backfire against the U.S., as it would allow Chinese companies like Huawei to define global standards.

Instead, Huang wants his chips to be readily available in China, so that American technology can become the backbone of global AI technology. We should note, though, that China used to be Nvidia's biggest export market, where it once had 95% market share — it has since dropped to zero because of export controls and the ongoing trade war between the two global rivals.

Sankar's take on this is that China is just using foreign companies to support its goals until it can develop a credible home-grown challenger. These companies would then flood the global market with cheaper goods, while, at the same time, Beijing is taking steps to limit the access of the original foreign business to the Chinese market. He does not lay the blame on China alone, though.

American companies have been an undeniable part of China's growth, with juggernauts like Apple, Tesla, Intel, General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Coca-Cola, among others, investing heavily in the country. This massive inflow of cash, technology, and know-how has allowed it to rise and become the leading global manufacturer. In fact, some experts say that companies stay in China not because of cheap labor, but because it's the only country that already has the necessary supply chain in place to build the latest technology.

Sankar argues that the U.S. should face this development head-on by rebuilding the industrial base it has let slide. While Washington does not have to completely stop trade with China, it does have to take steps to build alternative markets and supply chains to avoid so that it has alternatives and not be left with no choice but to comply with Beijing's demands.

The Palantir CTO argues that the current situation will only get worse if the U.S. does not take action today, but there are still quite a few who refuse to see this. On this point, he quoted Upton Sinclair: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”

This will be a long and arduous road, though, especially as many are already used to cheap goods coming from China. But it's only with that realization that the United States can take the painful but necessary steps to ensure that it remains sovereign in the face of Beijing's goal to overtake the US in global supremacy.

Super Eagles

South Africa's Minister of Sports, Arts, and Culture, Gayton McKenzie, has declared that he does not want the Super Eagles of Nigeria to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Speaking during an interview with Radio 947 in Johannesburg, McKenzie accused Nigeria of attempting to undermine South Africa's qualification campaign.

The comment comes amid growing tension between both nations following a dramatic World Cup qualifying group. 

South Africa faced a major setback when FIFA deducted three points from their tally for fielding an ineligible player — a penalty that initially jeopardized their automatic qualification hopes.

Nigeria took advantage of the situation by winning their final two group matches to stay in contention for the top spot.

However, South Africa ultimately clinched the Group C ticket with a 3-0 win over Rwanda on the final day, sealing their place at the World Cup for the first time since 2010.

Nigeria, on the other hand, now faces a tough path through the continental playoffs to keep their qualification hopes alive — a prospect McKenzie says he strongly opposes.

“I heard you saying earlier that we [South Africa] were rooting also for Nigeria,” he said.

“I want to make it very clear that I wish for them not to qualify [for the 2026 FIFA World Cup].”

The 51-year-old former gangster-turned-minister claimed Nigeria worked against South Africa's World Cup ambitions, insisting that his stance is a response to perceived hostility.

“I knew what they did behind the scenes for us not to get there (qualify for the World Cup). I want them to lose; they will not go to the World Cup, and another African country must go,” he added.

“It's not that [I don't like Nigeria]. I give the energy you give, they don't like us and we don't like them, that is all.

“It is not personal. It's like [the rivalry] between [Kaiser] Chiefs and [Orlando] Pirates.”

Nigeria will face Gabon in the continental playoff in November, and if successful, they will advance to a final clash against either Congo DR or Cameroon for a chance to represent Africa at the intercontinental playoff.

As city leaders spruce up different areas around Midtown and downtown, some business owners say it's driving away customers because of the traffic. Many improvements are getting ready to host the FIFA World Cup.

ATLANTA - As Atlanta prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, city leaders are working to spruce up Midtown and downtown with new construction projects — but some business owners say the work is driving customers away.

What they're saying:

Ayman Kamel, owner of popular restaurants 5Church Midtown, 5Church Buckhead, and Alta Toro, said while he loves his work, the growing traffic problems are taking a toll on business.

""I wake up, and I love coming in here to do what I do best,"" Kamel said. ""This is what I love, and this is what I know how to do for a living.""

But lately, he said, traffic has become ""an absolute nightmare.""

""To come out of your house and have the hope to get to work on time — you have to factor an extra 15 minutes to an hour,"" Kamel said.

He blames ongoing highway construction and multiple street closures throughout Midtown for cutting into restaurant revenue.

""People are calling to either cancel reservations or to say we are going to be late because traffic is bad,"" Kamel said.

Cancellations and delays, he added, create a domino effect that hurts sales and the customer experience.

""Nobody is enjoying the experience, and that's going to impact the business in the long run,"" he said.

Kamel recently took to Instagram to urge city leaders to take action before local restaurants are forced to make difficult financial decisions.

""It's extremely frustrating and concerning because the landlord is not going to say, ‘Don't worry about it, the traffic is bad,'"" Kamel said. ""There are expenses and people relying on our guests to come. This is my neighborhood, and I want this to be the best neighborhood in the world.""

The other side:

The Midtown Alliance responded to FOX 5 with a statement addressing the construction, saying the projects are designed to improve safety.

""The projects Midtown Alliance coordinates with the Atlanta Department of Transportation focus on improving safety,"" the statement read. ""The improvements on Juniper Street — expected to be substantially complete by the end of the year — address safety gaps on a one-mile corridor that experienced 569 crashes involving motorists, pedestrians and cyclists over the five years prior to construction.""

Manchester United secured a stunning victory an Anfield to condemn Liverpool to an unbelievable fourth consecutive defeat as the visitors won a pulsating derby 2-1. There was controversy just seconds into the match after Bryan Mbeumo fired the visitors in front, despite a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister in the build-up. Cody Gakpo equalised for Arne Slot's side, but Harry Maguire's header in the 84th minute sealed a memorable win for United. 

Amorim's side made a flying start to the match, taking a dramatic lead in the second minute as United broke quickly upfield and Mbeumo fired low past Giorgio Marmadashvili. Liverpool midfielder Mac Allister took a blow to the head in the build-up, but referee Michael Oliver didn't spot it, leaving the home fans furious. 

The visitors were the better side in the opening half with both Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes missing gilt-edged chances to extend United's lead, and as the game progressed it seemed Amorim's team were likely to edge further in front. But Slot rang the changes on the hour and it was one of the substitutes, Federico Chiesa, who teed up Gakpo to fire home from close range and level the match. 

Anfield suddenly came to life as home fans sensed an unlikely victory, but it was United who scored again to stun the crowd as Maguire headed Fernandes' cross back across goal to seal the points and United's first win on this ground since back in January 2016.

MLS Decision Day lived up to expectations as teams learned their playoff fates and Messi sent a warning with a hat-trick

For about 120 seconds, it seemed as if the Colorado Rapids were on their way to the MLS postseason. Denver native Darren Yapi scored an 88th-minute goal to put them up 2-1 against LAFC, and Dick's Sporting Goods Park erupted - with good reason.

Their Rocky Mountain rivals, Real Salt Lake, were unexpectedly trading goals with St. Louis City SC - a team that finished 13th. All Colorado had to do was hold firm. But their luck ran out in the 90th minute, when Andrew Moran and LAFC hit the Rapids on the break for a deflating equalizer. Despite a late push, the match ended 2-2 - and with it, Colorado's season.

The cheers in Commerce City turned to boos.

That's the magic of Decision Day. Up until midnight on the East Coast, teams in the West were fighting for playoff positions. In the Eastern Conference, Lionel Messi emphatically sealed his first MLS Golden Boot with a three-goal night against Nashville SC, while San Diego FC climbed back atop the Western Conference after edging Vancouver in their season-long duel.

As the 2025 ATP Tour season nears a thrilling conclusion, the race to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals is reaching fever pitch. There are valuable points on offer this week at ATP 500 events in Vienna and Basel.

Jannik Sinner is the top seed at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, joined by Alexander Zverev, while Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton lead the charge at the Swiss Indoors Basel. ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each tournament.

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN VIENNA:
Top Seed Sinner: After being forced to retire in the third round of his Shanghai title defence, Sinner returns to Vienna eager to reset. The 2023 champion, who opens against Daniel Altmaier, owns a 12-4 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Turin Tussle: Alex de Minaur and Lorenzo Musetti will both look to strengthen their push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals. De Minaur is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, while Musetti — chasing his debut at the season finale — sits just 60 points behind in eighth.

Medvedev's Momentum: Fresh off a title run in Almaty and consecutive semi-finals in Beijing and Shanghai, Daniil Medvedev continues his late-season surge. Though 12th in the Live Race, the former World No. 1 still has the chance to qualify for his seventh straight appearance at the year-end championships. Andrey Rublev, 14th, and Karen Khachanov, 18th, also hunt crucial points in Vienna.

Rising Star Budkov Kjaer: Former Wimbledon boys' champion Nicolai Budkov Kjaer has captured four ATP Challenger Tour titles this season and is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, aiming to debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 19-year-old faces Tomas Martin Etcheverry in his opener.

Arevalo/Pavic Headline Doubles: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic are the top seeds in the double's draw. They are chasing their first title since triumphing in Rome in May.



FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BASEL:
Fritz, Shelton Lead Charge: Americans Fritz and Shelton will aim to consolidate their push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals as the top two seeds in Vienna. They are fifth and sixth, respectively, in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Fritz faces a popcorn opening match against surprise Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot.

Can Ruud Make Ground? With his title run in Stockholm, Casper Ruud maintained his position at 11th in the Live Race, but has also made ground on those in the qualification spots. Ruud finished runner-up at the season finale in 2022, and is aiming to qualify for the fourth time in his career. He faces lucky loser Quentin Halys in the first round.

#NextGenATP Mensik & Fonseca: Jakub Mensik and Joao Fonseca, two of the brightest young prospects on the ATP Tour, both return to action after opening-round losses in Shanghai and Brussels, respectively. Fonseca faces defending champion Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in his Basel debut.

Cousins Vacherot, Rinderknech Return: After their fairytale run in Shanghai, where World No. 204 Vacherot defeated Arthur Rinderknech in the final to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion, the duo returns to court. Vacherot has since rocketed inside the Top 40.

Bolelli & Vavassori's Turin Quest: Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori are the second seeds in the double's draw. The Italians are seventh in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings and aiming to return to the Nitto ATP Finals. They will face competition from top seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Zak Brown was quizzed on the ""repercussions"" Lando Norris admitted he received after making contact with his team mate Oscar Piastri in Singapore.

McLaren CEO Zak Brown has defended the decision not to make details of Lando Norris' ‘consequence' public, after his collision with team mate Oscar Piastri at the Singapore Grand Prix.

In the opening corners of the Marina Bay race, Norris made contact with the rear of Max Verstappen's Red Bull, before bouncing into Piastri's McLaren. With the Briton having gained a position over his team mate, Piastri requested that the places be reversed and voiced his unhappiness over the radio, having commented “that wasn't very teamlike” before asking: “So, are we cool with Lando just barging me out of the way?”

Ahead of the United States Grand Prix weekend, Norris admitted to facing ""repercussions until the end of the season"" over the incident, while Team Principal Andrea Stella explained the consequences had been accepted by both drivers.

With questions continuing over the nature of the repercussions, Brown was quizzed during Friday's press conference in Austin as to why he and the team did not feel the need to reveal what they entailed.

“We're racing against nine other teams, and I don't think you want to necessarily show your hand on how you go motor racing,” he explained. “We try to be as transparent as possible, but there's a reason why engineering debriefs are only with teams, otherwise you start inviting other teams in.

“I think that's the best we can do. We try to be as transparent as possible in saying that some action has been taken, so I think that has been very transparent.

""But at the end of the day, we're at a sporting event and we can't necessarily tell everyone everything, no different than our set up sheets aren't very public.”

‘Papaya Rules' – the code of conduct Piastri and Norris abide by on the racing track – have become a growing talking point as the pair engage in their championship battle, with Brown conceding the policy has “taken on a bit of a life of its own”.

He added: “We just want to make sure that while they're racing hard, they don't come together because that puts them at risk, that puts the team at risk, so we agreed with them in the off-season how we would handle certain situations.

“It was a pretty minor incident at the start of a Grand Prix. It's pretty chaotic [in those moments], it was a damp track, it clearly wasn't intentional, and so we worked through with them different consequences for different situations. It was a pretty minor situation, so it's a pretty minor consequence.”

Pressed again to share details of the ‘consequence' suffered by Norris, Brown said: “No, we don't want to get into that. I think that's private business between us.

""I know everyone is interested to know, but both drivers are in a great place and we just want to be able to set them up to be able to continue to race each other hard.”

It's quicker to switch to your AIO screen than to Alt-Tab.

Battlefield 6 has had an explosive launch, marking a return to critical acclaim and record-breaking player counts. Everyone wants to get in on the military shooter action, and it seems even your job can't stand in the way of that mission. German reviewer AllAroundPC just showed us the best way to make use of the little downtime between tasks — by playing Battlefield 6 on the tiny circular screen of a CPU liquid cooler (video embedded below). That's right, the apparatus designed to keep your processor's thermals in check can now double as a quickly deployable secondary display.

Many high-end AIOs these days come with built-in screens that have secondary display functionality baked in — such is the case with MSI's CoreLiquid P13 (Tom's Hardware review link), which is what “Tim” used in the demonstration. The P13 features a 2.1-inch IPS display with a resolution of 480 x 480. It's got a circular aspect ratio, so you do lose some screen real estate, but nothing bothersome enough to stop some creative XP farming. “I mean, maybe not the best setup, but a little XP farming? Why not, you could do that,” claims Tim while laser-focused on the AIO.

Adding to the absurdity is our resident gamer Tim's actual job — he's supposed to be reviewing monitors. He was meant to be testing a new OLED, which you can even see on his desk in the video, but when he's caught red-handed gunning down enemies in Battlefield, he responds cleverly: “Yeah, I am doing monitor tests here.” He's not wrong; it may not be OLED, and it certainly wouldn't be the first choice for competitive gaming, but as they say — it's never about the car, it's about the driver. Or in this case, I guess, how it's being driven.

The PC community is no stranger to unconventional gaming, with Doom long serving as the modern-day, unofficial benchmark for knighting worthy tech. Someone got it running on a literal wall charger. We also recently saw a whole gaming computer be built inside a Porsche wheel, and an entire setup made from Lego-compatible bricks. It's always great to see the hobby birth such creative concepts that, while not exactly practical, are always novel to look at and push the DIY nature of this rabbit hole forward.

	The 26-year-old pop star delivered two standout performances from her seventh studio album, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in September.


	For her first performance, Carpenter appeared in a dimly lit bedroom set, wearing nothing but a white T-shirt and pink SNL-branded underwear. She danced around the stage while performing Man's Best Friend's lead single “Manchild,” which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late June.

	











	Later in the episode, Carpenter returned in a bedazzled white karate gi and black belt for a dojo-themed performance of the reggae-pop track “Nobody's Son.” During the high-energy number, she dropped two F-bombs live on air while smashing wooden boards and knocking down fellow black belts. The expletives aired uncensored during the NBC live telecast and Peacock's simulcast but were muted during the West Coast broadcast and in versions later posted online, including on YouTube, according to the New York Post.




	While this marked her SNL hosting debut, Carpenter previously served as musical guest in May 2024 and made an appearance during the SNL50 special in February, where she duetted with Paul Simon and co-starred in a “Domingo” sketch alongside Pedro Pascal.


	Carpenter is currently back on her Short n' Sweet Tour — now doubling as promotion for Man's Best Friend — and is set to return to Los Angeles for six new dates, wrapping on Nov. 23.
