                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the midst of today's AI hysteria, have we forgotten about blockchain technology and the seductive Web3 promise of decentralization? Robbie Bach, longtime Xbox chief and lieutenant of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, certainly hasn't. In his new novel, The Blockchain Syndicate, the prescient Bach imagines not only a giant political crypto grift, but also warns about the siren song of Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). No, blockchain might not be as sexy or lucrative as LLMs these days - but Web3 still matters even if, as Bach suggests, its promise of a decentralized network remains more seductive than substantive. Crypto as “Giant Grift” Bach views cryptocurrency as a highly risky, speculative investment vehicle comparable to commodities like gold or silver, but warns there's “definitely a giant grift” happening, with vulnerable people—particularly older investors putting their savings at risk—being exploited by those taking advantage of the crypto craze. AI Bubble Will Burst (But Not Catastrophically) Bach believes we're in an AI investment bubble where valuations are unsustainable. He predicts a “sorting” of winners and losers over the next 12-18 months, with many AI investments failing to pay out, though he avoids the term “explosive pop” in favor of a more gradual reckoning. He sees it as neither inherently good nor bad—just a tool that can be used for legitimate purposes or criminal ones. He argues this skill at navigating massive transitions under Gates, Ballmer, and Nadella is more impressive than any single product innovation. FBI and CIA Are Irreplaceable Bach emphasizes that regardless of political views about current leadership, institutions like the FBI and CIA are essential for national security with no viable replacement. If they're not working well, the solution is to fix them, not abandon them—a theme central to his thriller's premise. Keen On America is a reader-supported publication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the ninth installment of the Professor Coin column, in which I bring important insights from published academic literature on cryptocurrencies to the Decrypt readership. In this article, I discuss Bitcoin energy usage, and the future for sustainable cryptos. When you hear the words “Bitcoin mining,” you might picture giant warehouses packed with whirring computers, gobbling up electricity like there's no tomorrow. That image isn't far from reality. It keeps the network secure and decentralized, but it also ties digital finance to very real energy and environmental costs. Professor Coin: What Gives Bitcoin Its Value? The go-to benchmark is the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), which estimates that Bitcoin mining consumes electricity on the scale of mid-sized countries. But here's the catch: Bitcoin's energy use doesn't rise smoothly. When Bitcoin's price surges, miners switch on more rigs, pushing up hashrate, difficulty, and electricity demand. When prices dip, older or less efficient machines go dark. Stoll, Klaaßen and Gallersdörfer (2019) pegged annual consumption around 46 TWh back then, with ~22 megatons of CO₂ emissions More recently, new data suggests that consumption has grown substantially. According to the 2025 Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report, Bitcoin's annual electricity usage is now estimated at 138 TWh, with network-wide emissions of approximately 39.8 Mt CO₂e. The same report also notes that 52.4 % of the energy used by miners comes from sustainable sources (renewables + nuclear) as of 2025. These updated figures help us see that while Bitcoin's environmental footprint remains significant, the composition of its energy mix is also shifting—offering a more nuanced narrative for 2025. How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Really Use? New research asks a broader question: what's the total environmental cost? A 2023 paper by Chamanara et al. (2023) estimates Bitcoin mining at ~173 TWh, adding in CO₂, water, and land impacts. Meanwhile, the UN University warned that mining draws heavily on freshwater in regions with scarce supply. This holistic picture means Bitcoin's footprint is now seen as multi-dimensional: electricity, emissions, water, land, and waste. Not every blockchain guzzles energy like Bitcoin. In September 2022, Ethereum's Merge replaced PoW with proof-of-stake (PoS). Same user experience, radically different environmental profile. This one move showed the world that crypto doesn't have to be a climate villain. How it Differs From Proof of Work Ethereum's success has raised uncomfortable questions for Bitcoin. If another major chain can deliver security and functionality without the same energy burn, should Bitcoin follow? Purists say no: PoW is what gives Bitcoin its incorruptible, apolitical security. Critics counter that clinging to PoW risks political backlash, carbon taxes, or even outright bans in certain jurisdictions. Not all miners are environmental bad actors. In Texas, mining farms strike deals with grid operators, curtailing power when demand spikes. In Iceland and Canada, miners plug into cheap hydropower. Recent engineering research even explores using mining to monetize excess methane from landfills or stranded renewables that would otherwise be wasted. Elon Musk Gushes About Bitcoin 'Energy' Demands—Years After Environmental Gripes The optimistic narrative goes like this: Bitcoin mining could act as a “buyer of last resort” for surplus green energy, smoothing out variability in solar and wind production. Studies like Hossain & Steigner (2024) and others suggest that, under the right conditions, mining could become an economic driver for renewable projects. But the jury is still out—whether miners truly accelerate the green transition or just opportunistically chase cheap power depends on location, incentives, and regulation. So where does that leave us in 2025? We're not just talking electricity, but also carbon, water, land, and e-waste. Ethereum's Merge proved that PoS can slash energy costs without breaking a network. Bitcoin, by contrast, has doubled down on PoW. Not all mining is equal—coal-based rigs in Kazakhstan are very different from hydro-powered farms in Quebec. Expect governments to ask not just “how much power?” but “what kind of power, where, and with what externalities?” Bitcoin will always carry the energy question with it. Whether it becomes a climate villain or an unlikely green ally depends on choices made by miners, policymakers, and communities in the next few years.

This article provides an in-depth analysis of these topics, exploring whale accumulation, technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and more to help you navigate the current crypto landscape. Whale accumulation, where large investors or institutions purchase significant amounts of cryptocurrencies during market dips, is a critical factor in altcoin reversals. This behavior often signals confidence in a potential market rebound. Altcoins in Focus: Cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Cardano, and emerging tokens like Broccoli have experienced increased whale activity. This trend is frequently accompanied by higher trading volumes, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. Technical analysis is a powerful tool for identifying potential trend reversals in altcoins. Bullish Divergences: When an altcoin's price forms lower lows while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) forms higher lows, it often indicates a potential reversal. For instance, altcoins like XRP and Solana have recently shown signs of recovery due to such technical patterns. Global economic conditions significantly influence the cryptocurrency market. Key macroeconomic factors currently shaping market trends include: Rate cuts often lead to increased risk appetite, benefiting cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical Tensions: Events such as the U.S.-China trade war drive investors toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin, which are perceived as a hedge against traditional market instability. Institutional Inflows: The growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs highlights increasing institutional participation, adding credibility and liquidity to the market. Bitcoin often acts as a stabilizing force in the cryptocurrency market, influencing investor confidence and altcoin performance. When Bitcoin holds strong, it boosts investor confidence, encouraging altcoin participation. While gold prices have declined, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, further solidifying its position as a unique asset class. The altcoin market is buzzing with innovative projects offering unique solutions and utility-driven use cases. While these projects show promise, thorough research is essential before engaging with any emerging altcoin. Fear and Greed Index: Currently in the "fear" zone, this metric historically precedes market recoveries, suggesting a potential buying opportunity. Current levels suggest the market may be nearing a bottom. Ethereum: The upcoming ETF inflows and its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) make Ethereum a top choice for institutional investors. The cryptocurrency market is a complex yet rewarding space for informed investors. Altcoin reversals, Bitcoin's stabilizing role, and macroeconomic factors are just a few elements shaping the current landscape. By leveraging tools like technical analysis and on-chain metrics, you can better navigate this ever-evolving market. Always approach with caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As AI continues to enter our lives in completely unexpected ways, with Sam Altman even recently announcing that OpenAI will allow erotica soon, how can society balance the emotional boundaries and ethics when intertwining so closely with technology?

Receive up to $100,000 worth of exclusive gifts for newcomers upon registration. Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Graham believes the human factor is infiltrating AI and that people are already relating to language models as if they were sentient. For Graham, that subtle politeness signals something deeper: a shift in how humans see and speak to technology. “It's a fundamentally different way that we're interacting with technology, which I find super fascinating,” he said. Beyond politeness, Graham is exploring what happens when those interactions evolve into extensions of self. “What we're talking about is extending humans into the digital realm, an extension of ourselves, a digital twin of ourselves with us being the analog twin,” he said. To make the concept tangible, Graham has even named his own digital twin “Marty,” a joking nod to common typos of his name. Still, he warns that the psychological effects of constant AI interaction could be profound. “I firmly believe AI psychosis is a real thing,” he said, citing early examples of people forming unhealthy emotional attachments to large language models. Graham likens the coming wave of AI dependence to humanity's fixation on smartphones and social media. On privacy, Graham remained blunt, stating most users underestimate how much they've already shared. “It's not ideal, but if I'm being honest, he does.” “The stakes from a privacy perspective have never been higher,” he said. That warning takes on new weight as OpenAI prepares  to allow erotic content on its platform, a decision that blurs the boundary between human intimacy and digital companionship. If large language models are soon to host or simulate erotic interaction, the question of who owns and secures those data becomes far more pressing. Graham believes blockchain technology offers one path forward: encrypting personal data and giving individuals ownership of their digital twins. For him, the convergence of AI and crypto isn't just technical; it's a matter of autonomy in an era where digital intimacy may soon be mediated and monetized by machines. “We are extremely focused at the intersection of AI and crypto,” Graham said. He pointed to Amiko, a startup backed by Ryze Labs, which recently pivoted toward digital-twin technology and “AI social” experiences. “They are squarely focused on digital twins and AI companions,” he said. “I think it has potential to be a smash hit.” “But it can be extremely helpful to solving many of these problems as well.” He returns to his central premise, that technology itself is neutral, but humans are not.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering a landmark reform that could let banks buy and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin – a move that might finally bring traditional finance and crypto under one roof. ➡️ Japan's FSA is considering reforms that would let banks trade and hold Bitcoin, signaling a major step toward institutional crypto adoption. ➡️ Over 12M crypto accounts in Japan highlight strong retail demand as regulators move to make the market safer and more transparent. ➡️ Institutional entry could fuel growth for the best altcoins, especially projects with real-world utility and scalable infrastructure. ➡️ Bitcoin Hyper, Best Wallet Token, and Remittix stand out as early movers ready to benefit from Japan's upcoming crypto wave. With over 12M crypto accounts already open in Japan (3.5x more than five years ago), the country's appetite for digital assets is undeniable. The FSA's plan includes letting banks register as licensed crypto exchange operators and creating a new ‘Crypto Bureau' to oversee the sector. If banks and large investors gain access to crypto, they won't just buy Bitcoin and Ethereum – they'll look for scalable, utility-driven projects with strong fundamentals. Using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers sub-second transactions and near-zero gas fees, creating a place where payments, DeFi, dApps, and even meme coins can finally thrive on Bitcoin. Think of it as Bitcoin's execution layer, where speed, interoperability, and culture meet. It's a full-blown blockchain designed for builders, degens, and institutions alike. While its parent platform, Best Wallet, delivers a sleek multi-chain experience, the $BEST token powers everything inside it – from reduced transaction fees and staking rewards to early access to new crypto presales and exclusive project launches. With $16.5M raised in presale, $BEST is attracting both retail and institutional interest. If Japanese banks begin entering crypto markets, tokens tied to real utility and adoption, like $BEST, could surge in relevance. Grab $BEST now to secure your stake in the next big crypto economy. Remittix ($RTX) is redefining how money moves across borders. Built as a PayFi protocol, it connects crypto wallets and traditional bank accounts in over 30 countries, offering lightning-fast transfers, minimal fees, and real exchange-rate transparency. Instead of relying on slow, outdated SWIFT networks, Remittix uses blockchain rails to settle payments in seconds – all while keeping compliance and KYC frameworks bank-friendly. As the FSA considers letting banks trade and hold crypto, projects like Remittix could bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, turning what's now experimental into everyday financial infrastructure. It's a potential backbone for the next generation of cross-border finance. Get into $RTX early and ride the wave as PayFi meets institutional crypto adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How many people ignored Bitcoin (BTC) at $100 or thought Binance Coin (BNB) was just another exchange token? Fast forward to Q4 2025, and those “maybe later” people are scrolling through price charts instead of portfolios. Now, LivLive ($LIVE) has entered the spotlight and could finally be that rare second chance people wait their whole lives for. In October 2025, crypto markets are buzzing again with new opportunities. While BNB and other major coins are in recovery mode, $LIVE is quietly setting itself up as the top crypto to buy for those tired of missing golden chances. Back when Binance Coin (BNB) launched, few believed it could become anything valuable. Today, that same BNB touched nearly $690, transforming early believers into millionaires. Those who bought at launch didn't just make gains, they changed their financial destiny forever. Yet while doubters hesitated, a handful of bold community members quietly built life-changing wealth. And right now, LivLive ($LIVE) looks like the chapter that latecomers have been waiting for. It's a real-world operating system that turns daily actions into digital rewards. Walking, shopping, attending events, or leaving reviews can now earn $LIVE tokens. Instead of scrolling aimlessly, people can earn through living actively. This project merges AR, blockchain, and wearable tech to make engagement profitable. Every step or scan becomes proof of action that creates value. With transparent tokenomics and lifestyle-based rewards, LivLive is quickly being recognized as the top crypto to buy for those who missed earlier moonshots like BNB and now want a token tied to real-life value. Stage 1 launched at $0.02, raising over $2 million USD with 94+ holders in its first round. Stage 2 increases to $0.04, while the official launch price is projected at $0.25, signaling a potential 1,150% ROI even before public trading begins. By using the Bonus Code: EARLY30, community members can grab an additional 30% $LIVE tokens. Here's the math: a $5,000 entry during Stage 1 could grow to $62,500 at launch, not counting bonuses and mining rewards. With growing media attention and social traction, LivLive ($LIVE) proves why it's the top crypto to buy in October 2025. Its presale performance, fair tokenomics, and active engagement model make it stand out as the top crypto to buy in 2025. The LivLive presale proves that opportunities are not gone; they've just evolved. Instead of scrolling past another breakout, this is the moment to act while others are still watching. Those holding $LIVE today might be the ones everyone talks about tomorrow.</p>

Cryptocurrency is a high-risk asset class, and investing carries significant risk, including the potential loss of some or all of your investment. The information on this website is provided for informational and educational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice. Crypto prices remain fairly stable on Sunday as Bitcoin and Ethereum trade within ranges near break-even, a situation welcomed by traders after over $1 billion of liquidations rattled the market again on Friday, and a historic $19 billion liquidation caused upheaval the Friday before. Bitcoin price predictions suggest that bulls could soon take charge, with liquidity zones and on-chain activity signalling that selling is slowing, and short traders are at risk of being wiped out. Ethereum's outlook is also bright, with SEC chair Paul Atkis recently acknowledging its ERC-3643 standard, a framework that encodes regulatory compliance directly into tokens. Meanwhile, a new Bitcoin Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper, has just exceeded $24 million in funding in its presale, signaling that another major player could be emerging. Bitcoin fell to $104,000 on Friday, which was a four-month low for the market-leading asset. However, investors quickly swooped in and took advantage of the discount. Glassnode posted on X that small Bitcoin holders (between 1 and 1000 BTC) “stepped up” to buy BTC on the dip, while large holders slowed their selling. Smaller $BTC holders are stepping up.Strong accumulation is underway among small to mid-sized cohorts (1–1000 BTC), while large holders have slowed distribution, signaling renewed confidence in spite of the recent shakeout. Adding to this outlook, data from the Glassnode platform shows a strong liquidation cluster of short positions above $113,000, with over $400 million set to be wiped out at $113,718 – $113,842 – and that's just on the Binance exchange alone. However, some analysts believe the BTC uptrend will expand well beyond $113,000, with Friedrich noting that it's currently rebounding on a key long-term support level and that this could propel it to $135,000 in the weeks ahead. In a recent speech, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins discussed how compliance requirements could be encoded into smart contracts, using ERC-3643 as an example. “These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643,” he said. With Ethereum's ERC-3643 token standard, compliance becomes programmable – token issuers can embed regulatory-adherent code on-chain, allowing only verified and authorized wallets to hold or transfer the asset. This can ensure alignment with KYC, AML, and securities laws without relying on intermediaries. Ethereum's ERC-3643 standard and its support from regulators could make it a major beneficiary of this growth. Traditionally, Bitcoin has been excluded from such discussions due to its lack of programmability. However, projects like Bitcoin Hyper aim to change that with smart contract-enabled Layer 2 networks. There's also a trustless canonical bridge that allows BTC transfers to and from the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2, providing seamless access for Bitcoin holders. Currently in a presale to fund development, Bitcoin Hyper recently exceeded $24 million raised, marking an important milestone that shows strong community support and massive potential for demand once it lists on the open market. This has attracted attention from top crypto analysts, with RJ from Cryptonews describing HYPER as “the next 100x project when the market recovers.” With Bitcoin expected to rebound and Ethereum strengthening its position in the RWA space, crypto prospects look bright, so Bitcoin Hyper could be launching at just the right time. Crypto assets that show resilience during a broad market downturn tend to have strong latent demand, making them excellent bets for when the market outlook improves. Snorter ($SNORT), a new Solana trading bot, is closing its token presale tomorrow (20 October), having now raised over $5 million from early backers. For years, the idea of U.S. states investing directly in Bitcoin or crypto ETFs seemed distant, but that reality may soon change. Crypto prices have faced significant selling pressure over recent days, owing to the US-China trade war and credit and liquidity risks in the US economy. However, top analysts continue to be bullish on large-cap assets, especially as they anticipate the US Federal Reserve to engage in emergency market-supportive actions. A new analysis from CryptoOnchain, using data shared by CryptoQuant, suggests Bitcoin may remain range-bound in the near term — but volatility risks are building fast. Bitcoin is holding near $115,500, but traders are turning their attention to the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Korean state-sponsored hackers are now embedding malicious code into blockchain networks to avoid detection. GTIG explains that EtherHiding involves placing small code snippets into smart contracts, which are hosted on decentralized blockchain networks. These networks are immutable, meaning that once code is added, it cannot be deleted or modified. This makes it difficult for cybersecurity systems to take down or stop the malware. The hackers start by compromising WordPress websites, often using stolen login data or unpatched software flaws. Once inside, they add a JavaScript loader into the site's code. This loader reaches out to the blockchain and pulls malware from a remote location. GTIG found that this method has been active since at least September 2023. This feature is now being used to hide and spread malware in a way that security teams cannot easily stop. GTIG reports that the use of decentralized systems allows attackers to operate without being noticed. “Although smart contracts offer innovative ways to build decentralized applications, their unchangeable nature is leveraged in EtherHiding,” GTIG noted. Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton called EtherHiding an “early-stage experiment” and warned that it could be made more dangerous by using automation tools. He said that future versions might include code that targets blockchain systems directly, especially if those systems are linked to wallets or transaction platforms. Cybersecurity experts believe this method shows a change in North Korea's cyber operations. Instead of only stealing cryptocurrency, hackers are now using the technology behind it to help distribute malware. Data from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs states that North Korean hackers have stolen more than $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency this year. Investigators say that the funds are used to support military projects and avoid global sanctions. The use of EtherHiding makes it easier for attackers to stay online and move their tools between platforms. They recommend blocking unknown scripts, disabling unauthorized downloads, and keeping WordPress plugins updated. Security teams are also encouraged to start scanning smart contracts for malicious content. Since the code is public, researchers can label and track harmful contracts more easily if they know what to look for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum remains in a range phase following the recent market rebound, but continues to hold above key institutional demand zones. The market has entered a period of consolidation between structural supports and resistances, suggesting that the next decisive move will likely be driven by liquidity displacement from this range.Technical Analysis After losing the channel's lower trendline support earlier this month, the asset has now retested it from below, confirming it as resistance. The structure suggests that Ethereum is currently in a mid-range equilibrium phase, where neither buyers nor sellers have clear control. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would likely trigger a deeper decline toward $3.4K, the same zone that underpins the broader bullish structure. Until confirmation occurs, Ethereum remains range-bound, oscillating between structural supply and demand. Recent on-chain data points to a renewed tightening in Ethereum's market structure. Following October 15, ETH's price has remained relatively stable just below the $4K level, but the underlying market composition has shifted meaningfully. Whale-sized spot orders (green clusters) have expanded, signalling renewed activity from deep-pocketed participants, while the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges, measured in USD terms, has dropped to one of the lowest levels of 2025. This combination, shrinking exchange reserves and growing whale spot activity, has historically indicated strategic accumulation by institutional or high-net-worth investors. With liquidity thinning across exchanges, even moderate inflows of new demand could produce amplified price reactions, as reduced sell-side availability magnifies volatility to the upside. Ethereum now appears to be entering another supply squeeze phase, echoing the quiet but powerful accumulation period of late 2020. During that cycle, consistent spot buying and exchange outflows preceded one of ETH's strongest multi-month rallies. If macro conditions stabilise and ETF-related inflows return, the current structural tightening could serve as the foundation for Ethereum's next major upward cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is drawing attention after reports it has dramatically boosted its bitcoin holdings, purchasing $2 billion worth and raising $2.3 billion through new stock and debt offerings. The move comes as bitcoin prices climb following Donald Trump's reelection. With all eyes on Trump Media & Technology Group's bitcoin pivot, momentum around the stock remains unsettled. In short, even explosive headlines have not reversed a downward trend, though some investors are eyeing potential upside if confidence builds around the company's new crypto strategy. If this kind of dramatic shift grabs your attention, now is the perfect time to broaden your radar and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership With such a bold pivot into cryptocurrency, the question now is whether Trump Media & Technology Group's share price reflects all the risk and potential, or if this volatility underscores a unique chance for investors to buy in ahead of possible growth. Trump Media & Technology Group is currently trading at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2x, which anchors its valuation against comparable firms. With a last close price of $16.18, the stock appears more attractively priced than its direct peers on this metric. For media and tech firms that are often asset-light and rapidly changing, this ratio remains a useful checkpoint for fair value, especially in the absence of sustained profitability or strong revenue growth. However, when compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry average P/B of 1.3x, DJT looks rather expensive. This raises questions about whether investors are pricing in future growth or simply paying a premium for the brand. There is insufficient data to calculate a fair ratio, so market direction may shift with new financials or catalysts. See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown. However, ongoing net losses and lack of clear revenue growth could challenge optimism, particularly if the crypto pivot fails to generate near-term profits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what does this mean for users and the broader crypto ecosystem? This includes tokens, NFTs, and potentially even physical assets, all available on a single platform. The aim is to eliminate the need for users to navigate through multiple interfaces, allowing them to trade any crypto asset across various blockchains without any technical hurdles. This is a significant pivot from their original focus as an NFT marketplace. By broadening their range of offerings, OpenSea is trying to attract both new users and retain existing ones who are deep into the NFT space. The $SEA token is set to launch in Q1 2026, and it will have a multi-faceted role. Not only will it be used for governance and staking, but it will also serve as a liquidity incentive. This is a move to instill a sense of ownership among users, which is crucial for long-term loyalty. But here's the kicker: OpenSea plans to buy back $SEA tokens using 50% of its launch revenue. This is meant to create demand for the token while rewarding those who hold onto it. By integrating governance and staking directly into the trading platform, OpenSea is not just enhancing user engagement; they're also opening the door to a more democratic method of asset management. Despite these ambitious plans, OpenSea finds itself in a tricky situation. The NFT market has seen a staggering decline in capitalization, plummeting from $25 billion in 2021 to around $5.2 billion. The timing of the $SEA token introduction couldn't be more critical, as competition heats up and regulatory scrutiny intensifies. As OpenSea broadens its offerings, it must also contend with complex regulatory frameworks, especially in Asia. There, fintech startups are facing increased pressure to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. The merging of NFTs with fungible tokens on a single platform is bound to attract regulatory attention and potentially prompt the creation of new rules targeting risks like fraud and market manipulation. OpenSea's transformation into a universal trading platform raises significant questions about regulatory compliance, particularly for fintech startups in Asia. The expansion beyond NFTs to include a wider array of assets presents intricate regulatory challenges, as startups will have to navigate diverse legal frameworks across jurisdictions. With increased regulatory scrutiny on the horizon, authorities will likely focus on token classification, investor protection, and AML compliance. OpenSea's transparent and community-centric approach could set a precedent for compliance practices among startups. Integrating NFTs into broader asset trading strategies offers potential rewards but also comes with risks for crypto-friendly SMEs in Europe. In summary, OpenSea's evolution into a universal trading platform with the $SEA token signifies a monumental shift in the crypto landscape. By enhancing user engagement and grappling with regulatory challenges, OpenSea aims to redefine digital asset trading. Yet, the complexities of a saturated market and the need for compliance will be critical as they pursue long-term success.

Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba's Ant Group and JD.com, have halted their stablecoin development projects following direct intervention from Beijing, according to the Financial Times.

The suspension affects yuan-based digital asset initiatives that major Chinese technology firms had been developing amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny from the central government.

Beijing recently directed brokerages and think tanks to cease promoting stablecoins, reflecting growing concern over private sector involvement in digital currency issuance and the government's desire to maintain control over monetary innovation.

The intervention aligns with broader Chinese efforts to counter foreign digital currency dominance while prioritizing state oversight of the domestic financial system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fundstrat's Tom Lee has echoed the sentiment that digital asset treasury hype may be coming to an end, but remains bullish on Ether, having purchased $1.5 billion worth since the market crash. BitMine Immersion Technologies has scooped up a total of 379,271 Ether (ETH) worth almost $1.5 billion since the record crypto market liquidation event last weekend. The acquisitions came in three separate purchases: 202,037 ETH after the weekend crash, 104,336 ETH on Thursday, and 72,898 ETH on Saturday, according to onchain data from Arkham Intelligence and ‘BMNR Bullz', which tracks the firm's purchases, though it has yet to be officially confirmed by BitMine. BitMine is the world's largest Ether treasury company with a stash of more than 3 million ETH, or 2.5% of the entire supply, worth $11.7 billion. It is already halfway toward its target of 5% and has only started accumulating the asset in early July, when ETH was hovering around the $2,500 level. “Ethereum could flip Bitcoin similar to how Wall Street and equities flipped gold post 71,” Lee told ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood on Thursday in his latest bullish statement on the asset.

Huobi founder Li Lin wants some of that alpha and has reportedly raised about $1 billion as part of a strategy to invest in an Ether treasury. Lee told CNBC after the trading day on Friday that investors were still “licking their wounds” from the record leverage flush, but there was also a bit of “gold envy” as the commodity has been a “huge performer this year.” Crypto markets are currently down 15% from their record high on October 7, while gold prices have retreated almost 3% from their peak on Thursday.
