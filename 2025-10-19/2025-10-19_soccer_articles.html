Manchester United secured a stunning victory an Anfield to condemn Liverpool to an unbelievable fourth consecutive defeat as the visitors won a pulsating derby 2-1. There was controversy just seconds into the match after Bryan Mbeumo fired the visitors in front, despite a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister in the build-up. Cody Gakpo equalised for Arne Slot's side, but Harry Maguire's header in the 84th minute sealed a memorable win for United. 

Amorim's side made a flying start to the match, taking a dramatic lead in the second minute as United broke quickly upfield and Mbeumo fired low past Giorgio Marmadashvili. Liverpool midfielder Mac Allister took a blow to the head in the build-up, but referee Michael Oliver didn't spot it, leaving the home fans furious. 

The visitors were the better side in the opening half with both Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes missing gilt-edged chances to extend United's lead, and as the game progressed it seemed Amorim's team were likely to edge further in front. But Slot rang the changes on the hour and it was one of the substitutes, Federico Chiesa, who teed up Gakpo to fire home from close range and level the match. 

Anfield suddenly came to life as home fans sensed an unlikely victory, but it was United who scored again to stun the crowd as Maguire headed Fernandes' cross back across goal to seal the points and United's first win on this ground since back in January 2016.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States Women's National Team (USWNT) has called up Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta for the upcoming FIFA international window, U.S. Soccer announced on Sunday. LaBonta will replace Seattle Reign FC midfielder Sam Meza, who was ruled out of the roster due to a minor injury. The USWNT announced its initial 26-player roster on Oct. 15. This is the second U.S. National Team call-up in LaBonta's career, the first which came earlier this year. LaBonta will join three Kansas City teammates – forward Michelle Cooper, midfielder Claire Hutton and forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor – for the October training camp. Now with four, the Current is tied with Gotham FC for the most players on this USWNT roster among all National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) teams. The first match, presented by AT&T, will take place on Thursday, Oct. 23, at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa., with kickoff set for 6 p.m. CT. The U.S. and Portugal will meet again in East Hartford, Conn., on Sunday, Oct. 26, at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field. That friendly, presented by Volkswagen, starts at 3 p.m. CT. The Stars and Stripes conclude their three-match set against New Zealand in Kansas City on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 7 p.m. CT. It marks the USWNT's first-ever match at CPKC Stadium, the first stadium purpose-built for a professional women's sports team. Limited tickets are available for purchase HERE. LaBonta's first appearance for the Stars and Stripes was on May 31 when she came on as a substitute in the 70th minute, helping the team to a 3-0 win against China PR. LaBonta solidified herself as one of the league's all-time greats from the penalty spot on Sept. 26, 2025, when she converted her 14th career regular season PK. That moved her up to be tied with Megan Rapinoe and Marta for first in NWSL history for most regular season PKs. All five of her goals this year have been from the penalty spot, and she has also added one assist. LaBonta has twice been named to the NWSL Best XI this year and her 10 career monthly Best XI honors rank third all-time. Sign up for latest news, offers & more!</p>

Instead, he channelled his frustration into relentless daily work, staying prepared for when the opportunity came again. WIth Real Madrid considering significant defensive reinforcements in 2026, Asencio must step up his performances even further if he is to retain a starting role in the team for the foreseeable future. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Injuries have not been kind to Eduardo Camavinga in recent times as he was one of the last players to make his debut under Xabi Alonso this season for Real Madrid. Having suffered an injury against Getafe in April, the player only made it back to the field for an official game in Real Madrid's clash against Espanyol last month. Since then, his minutes have been limited and understandably so as the manager has preferred to exercise caution. During the interview, he said, “Will I make my mark at Real Madrid? Camavinga went on to describe his experience as a dream realised, emphasising that he has cherished every moment at the club, regardless of the highs and lows that accompanied it. While addressing this matter, he clarified, “Are you going to ask me about the left-back?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunday's reports claim that former Tottenham Hotspur hero Son Heung-min is an option for Milan in the winter transfer window, as he is reportedly seeking a David Beckham-style loan deal to help him prepare ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Son left Tottenham after 10 years at the beginning of the summer, and has since joined LAFC in MLS, where he has scored nine goals from his first 10 league outings. In 2026, the MLS regular season ran from late-February to mid-October, and features a post-season that culminates with the MLS Cup final on December 6. Then, teams will take an extended break for the off-season. With the FIFA World Cup coming up in the summer, there have been reports that Son is interested in a loan move back to Europe to help him prepare, as Beckham did with his loan moves to Milan ahead of the 2010 tournament in South Africa. According to reports from transferfeed.com, Milan are among the potential destinations for Son this winter if he is allowed to leave LAFC on a temporary deal. His former side Tottenham, and a potential move to his native South Korea have also been mentioned as possible options. Peter Young is a Senior Reporter with Football Italia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get Recruited Faster with a Player Profile on SoccerWire.com SALÉ, Morocco – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team opened the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup with a resounding 3-0 win over Ecuador. Defender Meila Brewer, midfielder Nyanya Touray and forward Lauren Malsom all scored first-half goals. The United States will face China PR next on Tuesday, Oct. 21 (Noon ET; FS2) and closes the group stage versus World Cup-debutant Norway on Friday, Oct. 24 (9 a.m. This is also the first of five years that the competition will be held in Morocco. Ecuador made just its second appearance in this tournament and showed some early energy by picking up two first-half yellow cards. Soon enough, the Ecuadorian side proved to be no match for the young Americans, eventually getting doubled up on shots, 22-11. The Video Support System came into play in just the eighth minute when Johnson was clearly taken down in the box by Ecuador defender Scarlet Garaicoa. Antonucci bent an inswinger into the penalty box and crashing central defender Meila Brewer weaved through goalmouth traffic to smash her header into the net from five yards out. DiMaria fired a shot into the net in the 37th minute, but her run was correctly deemed offside. DiMaria was not to be denied, however, and she got behind the defense in the 41st minute on a slipped pass from Malsom. DiMaria's powerful left-footed shot was well-saved by Rodriguez, but she couldn't hold it, and the ball fell to Touray for her to tap home from three yards out to make it 2-0. It was Touray's fifth U-17 international goal in her ninth career cap. The Americans made it 3-0 just before halftime as Malsom scored her first World Cup goal and second of her U-17 international career. Johnson seemingly scored in the 89th minute, but she too was whistled for offside. USA goalkeeper Evan O'Steen earned the shutout, her fifth in the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, after she picked up four shutouts and Golden Glove honors at the 2024 edition of this tournament. USA – Nyanya Touray, 41st minute: Touray was in the right place at the right time to tap in a rebound from close range after Maddie DiMaria's shot had been pushed up into the air by Ecuador goalkeeper Maria Rodriguez. Malsom, a UNC freshman, struck her shot low and past the goalkeeper to give the USA a commanding halftime lead.

President Donald Trump has threatened to relocate 2026 World Cup matches from cities he deems unsafe.

Atlanta officials say they are not worried about the potential of that happening here.

Xabi Alonso has opened up on defender Raul Asencio's reliability ahead of Real Madrid's La Liga clash with Getafe. 

“He has a fantastic ability to read the game, is powerful in his duels, and the more effective he is in how he uses those attributes, the better," said Alonso. 

"The mistakes that were made at the Club World Cup can happen to anyone, but whenever he's been called upon this season he's shown high levels of performance and he's very reliable. 

"He's had to play a bit out of position at times but he's got that flexibility. He's a competitive guy, he's got that spirit that all the lads who come through the academy have. 

"You can see that, and there's room for improvement. The unease since the World Cup is well in the past now, he's a reliable player and he's very much available.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Claire Hutton and Ally Sentnor don't need words to communicate. Hutton was a high-school junior committed to UNC, and Sentnor was a sophomore playing for the 23-time NCAA Champion Tar Heels. But to Hutton, she was already, “OMG, that's Ally Sentnor.” Now, four years later, they're finally neighbors, living two doors apart in Kansas City. They finish each other's sentences, breaking into laughter, their chemistry radiating through the screen. What began as a shared passion at a college training camp has evolved into a bond strengthened by shared milestones, most recently, Sentnor's blockbuster trade from the Utah Royals to the Current in August, a move that turned their long-distance friendship into an everyday sisterhood. '” Sentnor told The Athletic as they recalled their first real in-person meeting at UNC's Chapel Hill campus. It didn't take long for me to trust her. I knew she was my friend,” Hutton recalled. Until recently, most of their friendship unfolded miles apart. Upon graduating early from high school in the summer of 2023, Hutton trained with an array of NWSL teams and eventually chose to forgo her collegiate career at UNC, signing a three-year contract with the Kansas City Current that December. Sentnor left college early after two consecutive NCAA tournament runs but continued her studies online to complete her degree. Hutton was eager for the trade to happen if it meant seeing her friend, and tried very hard not to jinx it. They kept their weekly calls carefully scripted so that Hutton's first question wasn't “Is it done?” They started with what was for dinner, then maybe circle back. When it landed, the off-field fit was instant. On the field, their connection leaves no space for words. It's Hutton's shoulder check, her pivot and the lane that opens because Sentnor has already slid into the seam. The unspoken sync has yet to result in a goal for the Current, but now they have a chance to do so with the U.S. in this upcoming international window next week. It will be their tenth camp together. The 2024 U20 World Cup was filled with drama. The young U.S. team left many games late, scoring winners well after 90 minutes. Sentnor, who captained the team in her second U20 World Cup, noticed Hutton struggling. “She leaned on me with the concussion, but she was my person that I could come back to the room and talk about everything throughout that tournament,” Sentnor recalls. “The responsibility (of being a captain) comes with drama and other things you have to deal with outside of soccer. Claire was my sounding board, which is so incredible because she was one of the youngest players on the team.” Hutton scored her first international goal for the USWNT on July 2, 2025, against Canada in a friendly match. It was a pinch-me moment for her. Still, neither player is under the guise that they are a guarantee for Emma Hayes' rosters for the next two years. “You can't just work hard for the month leading up to (the World Cup), it's the day in and day out right now that hopefully can get us selected for that World Cup team,” Sentnor says. “Every camp is a stepping stone, and the chance to represent our country on the biggest stage would be a dream come true.” For the next three matches against Portugal and New Zealand, Hayes decided to reintegrate seasoned Europe-based players like captain Lindsey Heaps, midfielder Lily Yohannes, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, and forward Alyssa Thompson. But she also did not disguise her delight at what Sentnor brings to the team. “She provides another option for us on the left-hand side that can tuck in as an extra 10,” she told reporters on Wednesday. “She may have added a little bit more flexibility than some other players in that situation.” With the nonstop pressure to perform at the top level, Sentnor and Hutton manage to keep their nerves at bay with cooking. We'll work to medium,” she said, revealing their shared love for a particular buffalo chicken recipe at the moment. In their free time, they keep a running list of Kansas City restaurants. Hutton's old superstition, ice cream the day before a match, died after one good game without it. “I guess the new superstition is no ice cream,” she says, unconvinced. But sweet treats will never not have a place in their kitchens. “One of the reasons we're so close as friends and are able to be such incredible teammates is because we truly want each other to succeed,” Sentnor said. “We want the people around us to succeed.” Hutton, a native of New York state, got to see the USWNT squad live, in Hartford, Connecticut, when she was a little girl playing soccer for the local Alleycats Soccer Club. “It was just a friendly, not even a World Cup match, but it was my first ever live soccer game,” Hutton said. “Seeing what these women represent, with all these fans here screaming and being involved in that, getting the signatures after, I feel like it was just that moment for me,” she said. On Oct. 26, she will take the field in that very same stadium. This time, as the one being celebrated. It's a full-circle moment, ten years in the making. “We were not around for the 99ers,” Sentnor said with a laugh. “I looked up to those girls and thought they were just untouchable. Like the coolest people ever existed,” she added. For just 19 and 22, they are proud to wear the crest, and they're equally determined to carry forward the work that Morgan's generation once carried. Morgan helped lead the USWNT's historic fight for equal pay and played a key role in the NWSL's collective bargaining negotiations. Now that they have equal pay secured with a strong CBA in place, Hutton and Sentnor's focus is on making “great” the baseline across the league. The job is not done until every NWSL team can offer the same opportunities as their owners at Kansas City offer, like their own stadium and state-of-the-art training facilities. “It can be very easy to get caught up in the individual game and the accolades and everything, but the way that Claire and I think about it is that we want everyone to feel a part of it,” Sentnor added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Argentina and Morocco battle in the 2025 FIFA Under-20 World Cup final on Sunday at the Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos in Chile. There have been seven different champions since then, but the South Americans will be desperate to bring the title back to Argentina once again. They have blitzed their opposition en route to the showpiece event, winning all six of their matches during the group stage and knockout rounds. They have scored 15 and conceded just two at the tournament to date and Diego Placente's side will enter the final brimming with confidence. Still, Mohamed Ouahbi's men will fancy their chances of springing a surprise. U.S. Readers—Subscribe for Insight, Analysis and More from SI FC. This is the first meeting between Argentina U20s and Morocco U20s. A post shared by Selección Argentina in English (@afaseleccionen) La Albiceleste have a host of players already representing top European sides in their ranks, including Bournemouth's Julio Soler, Porto's Tomás Pérez and Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni. However, it's Bayer Leverkusen's Alejo Sarco who's most likely to decide Sunday's final, with four goals under his belt already at the tournament. Argentina predicted lineup vs. Morocco (5-4-1): Barbi; Gorosito, Ramírez, Pérez, Villalba, Soler; Subiabre, Acuña, Delgado, Prestianni; Sarco. A post shared by Équipe du Maroc (@equipedumaroc) Dunkerque's Gessime Yassine could be Morocco's biggest threat in the final, with the winger having managed two goals and three assists across six competition appearances. Morocco predicted lineup vs. Argentina (4-2-3-1): Benchaouch; Majni, Baouf, Bakhty, Zahouani; Byar, Khalifi; Maamma, Essadak, Yassine; Zabiri. These fixtures are usually tight affairs and La Albiceleste will likely be able to edge a cagey clash. Morocco's array of attacking outlets could cause Argentina's rearguard issues, but they look unlikely to secure a first U-20 World Cup title—even if they have already managed their best ever finish in the competition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As city leaders spruce up different areas around Midtown and downtown, some business owners say it's driving away customers because of the traffic. Many improvements are getting ready to host the FIFA World Cup. ATLANTA - As Atlanta prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, city leaders are working to spruce up Midtown and downtown with new construction projects — but some business owners say the work is driving customers away. Ayman Kamel, owner of popular restaurants 5Church Midtown, 5Church Buckhead, and Alta Toro, said while he loves his work, the growing traffic problems are taking a toll on business. "This is what I love, and this is what I know how to do for a living." But lately, he said, traffic has become "an absolute nightmare." He blames ongoing highway construction and multiple street closures throughout Midtown for cutting into restaurant revenue. "It's extremely frustrating and concerning because the landlord is not going to say, ‘Don't worry about it, the traffic is bad,'" Kamel said. "There are expenses and people relying on our guests to come.
