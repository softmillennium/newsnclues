"New York is unaffordable to do so on Airbnb," she said, adding they wanted a place that was a similar size to their home. "I just wanted that same feel with the baby and also for my parents to come and stay with us in the city." That's when she discovered Kindred, a membership-based home swapping network that allows users to stay in each other's homes around the world. Priya and her husband ended up coming to New York for six weeks and staying in three different Kindred homes. Not only was the home swapping experience more affordable, but it was also more personal than traditional travel stays, she said. "It feels like I'm staying in a friend's house while they're away," she said. Sadhwani and her husband are part of a growing group of travelers who are turning to home swapping instead of hotels or short-term rentals, as travel costs are on the rise and remote work has provided more flexibility. "There's just a tremendous need and a tremendous desire for a new way to travel that's more human, way more affordable, and also more responsible for our cities," Justine Palefsky, cofounder and CEO of Kindred, told Business Insider. Since its founding in 2021, Kindred has grown to over 200,000 members. Some of the most popular destinations are New York, London, Los Angeles, Paris, and Amsterdam, and over 90% of the properties on Kindred are primary residences. Homes of all types are accepted on the app, from studio apartments to multi-bedroom mansions, but they all must meet the minimum standards of being safe, functional, and inviting, Palefsky said. "It doesn't need to be Architectural Digest, but it needs to have some amount of soul and personality," she said. Members can also build up credits by offering their homes when they're out of town and not staying at another Kindred. They can then spend those credits on nights at other Kindred homes. Palefsky said the swapping "allows the relationship to feel much more like a social contract instead of a financial contract." Meagan Cignoli, a sculptor based in West Hollywood, told Business Insider that Kindred is the first option she checks when planning a trip. She's even used it locally to stay in downtown Los Angeles or Santa Monica when she has a couple of days of work on the other side of town and doesn't want to deal with commuting back and forth. "The one bad thing is it has me so spoiled by the price that it's hard to swallow other options" when she's traveling to destinations without Kindred. Cignoli first started home swapping nearly 20 years ago, using platforms like Craigslist. She said a major benefit of Kindred is the variety and flexibility. And because each Kindred stay has a one-time cleaning fee regardless of how many nights they stay, guests get a better deal the longer the trip. Cignoli said it's enabled her to take much longer vacations than she would otherwise. Palefsky said Kindred's main challenge is sustaining its growth while maintaining trust. "This only works if people really feel comfortable joining with their primary residence, and that's a big leap," she said, adding that the company is "obsessed" with ensuring it's delivering a quality experience. Once accepted, members' identities are verified via government IDs. It helps her feel more comfortable about hosting people she doesn't know, and it also makes her travel experience more personal by providing an opportunity to get recommendations from a local.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel on Sunday struck targets in southern Gaza after saying its troops came under fire from Hamas militants, in the first major test of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire meant to halt more than two years of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consulted with Israel's security heads and directed the military to take "strong action" against any ceasefire violations, but didn't threaten to return to war. Israel's military said that militants shot at troops in areas of the southern Gaza city of Rafah that are Israeli-controlled according to agreed-upon ceasefire lines. A separate military statement said that Israel would respond to ceasefire violations with "great force" against Hamas. Hamas, which continued to accuse Israel of multiple ceasefire violations, said that it wasn't connected to any clashes in Rafah. An Israeli airstrike killed at least six Palestinians in central Gaza, health officials said. A third strike hit a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis in the south, killing at least one person, according to Nasser hospital. An Israeli military official told journalists there had been three incidents Sunday, two in southern Gaza and one in the north, and noted that the update was partial for now. Israel identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight. Netanyahu's office said the bodies belonged to Ronen Engel, a father of three from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai agricultural worker from Kibbutz Be'eri. Both were believed to have been killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war. Engel's wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a ceasefire in November 2023. It warned that any escalation by Israel would hamper search efforts. Israel on Saturday said the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would stay closed "until further notice" and its reopening would depend on how Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning the remains of all 28 deceased hostages. Hamas group says the devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas of Gaza have slowed the handover. Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died. The ministry has posted photos of bodies on its website to help families attempting to locate loved ones. Only 25 bodies have been identified, the Health Ministry said. After Israel and Hamas exchanged 20 living hostages for more than 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, the handover of remains is a major issue in the first stage of the ceasefire. Hamas said talks with mediators to start the ceasefire's second phase have begun. The next stages of the ceasefire are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory. Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesman, said late Saturday that the second phase of negotiations "requires national consensus." He said Hamas has begun discussions to "solidify its positions," without giving details. For now, "government agencies in Gaza continue to perform their duties, as the vacuum is very dangerous, and this will continue until an administrative committee is formed and agreed upon by all Palestinian factions," he said. It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Palestinians to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians. On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority's Interior Ministry in Ramallah announced procedures for Palestinians wishing to leave or enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. For those who want to leave Gaza, Palestinian Embassy staff from Cairo will be at the crossing to issue temporary travel documents that allow entry into Egypt. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack that sparked the war.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave some hints about more interest rate cuts, mentioning the weakness in the labor market. Bearing in mind an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and potential rate cuts, investors can consider adding some dividend stocks to their portfolios to ensure stable income. The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive dividend-paying stocks with strong fundamentals. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first dividend pick is EOG Resources (EOG), a crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company with reserves in the U.S. and Trinidad. The company recently announced a deal to buy Encino Acquisition Partners for $5.6 billion. EOG raised its quarterly dividend 5% to $1.02 per share, payable October 31. Recently, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on EOG and raised his price target to $145 from $140. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on EOG stock with a price target of $133. Notably, the 5-star analyst raised his earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow per share (CFPS) estimates for 2025 and 2026 due to his revised commodity outlook. Hanold is bullish on EOG and expects it to outperform its peer group over the next 12 months. "The leading-edge technological approach, strong balance sheet, low-cost operations and capital efficiency should continue to drive meaningful value and make EOG a core E&P holding," said Hanold. 79 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See EOG Resources Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. Another dividend-paying energy company is Coterra Energy (CTRA), an exploration and production company with operations focused in the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin. As part of his Q3 preview for oil & gas E&P companies, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Coterra, while cutting his price target to $32 from $35. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on CTRA stock with a price target of $26. Based on the recent stock performance, investor positioning and expectations, he said that Coterra is one of his "favorite names" heading into Q3 results. Sorbara believes that investors will continue to focus on management's oversight of the large oil production rampup in the second half of 2025 and its outlook for 2026. The analyst expects Q3 oil production to beat expectations, but lag estimates for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and free cash flow, likely due to "stale Consensus gas pricing." Meanwhile, Sorbara sees upside to Q4 oil production expectations due to the potential for incremental upside from the Harkey remediation wells. "We reaffirm our Buy rating, as we continue to find CTRA attractive on valuation (trading at an EV/EBITDA discount and above average FCF yield) with the potential for strong capital returns," said Sorbara, referencing free cash flow. 315 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. The company is scheduled to announce its third-quarter results on October 22. AT&T recently declared a quarterly dividend of 27.75 cents share, payable November 3. With an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T yields 4.3%. Heading into Q3 results, Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins reiterated a buy rating on AT&T with a base case price target of $32, calling the company a top-ranked pick. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an "outperform" rating on AT&T stock with a price target of $31. Rollins expects AT&T to deliver a strong operating performance in Q3 across its strategic products and segments. Further, Rollins estimates Q3 fiber net additions of 286,000 in a seasonally stronger quarter. The analyst highlighted that his headline Q3 forecasts are slightly below the Street's consensus estimates for revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and are in line with free cash flow expectations. "Wireless churn, upgrades and gross adds are likely to have an upward bias in 3Q given the more active replacement rates," noted Rollins. The analyst contends that AT&T's broadband opportunity remains an under-appreciated component of the company's annual financial growth prospects. 548 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dave Greenlaw, a human resources executive in Washington, D.C., about why he plans to attend an HR conference later this month where conservative activist Robby Starbuck — a vocal critic of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives — is scheduled to speak. SHRM is facing backlash over the matter, with some HR pros saying they are canceling their membership. Greenlaw, who has worked in HR for nearly 17 years and has been a member of SHRM for about four years, explained why he won't be following suit. This interview has been edited for space and clarity. There are so many factors that go into a productive workplace, different political beliefs and walks of life. SHRM historically has hosted speakers across the political spectrum, such as former Presidents Joe Biden, George Bush Sr., and Bill Clinton, and I think that's a good thing. It goes back to HR leaders needing to understand the full landscape, even when they might disagree with these people or their policies. What I think is valuable about this particular talk with Starbuck is that he is going to be on a panel with [lawyer and media personality] Van Jones that will be moderated by SHRM's CEO, Johnny C. Taylor, and they're both people of color. And Starbuck's views on DEI and LGBTQ issues — even though I personally find them abhorrent — he's a voice that I think might resonate with a certain populist out there, and it's important not to silence voices, even when you don't agree with them. What if you're an HR professional and all of a sudden you're handling something internally, and there's a disagreement with two people who are speaking about politics or DEI? Hearing Taylor, Starbuck, and Jones could give you perspective on the matter, and you can bring it back to your place of employment. A million things could come out of this conversation. It's also important to acknowledge why people are upset about this. A lot of people feel like Starbuck doesn't have a lot to add to the conversation because of certain things he's already said. I am a gay man, and I know the things that Starbuck has said are almost damaging to some of the members of my community. But you have to think of the bigger picture. If I'm always using my beliefs to make decisions on things — particularly when I'm an employer or an HR person — that's not necessarily fair to the other individual, and I don't think it's necessarily appropriate.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Zach Yadegari, an 18-year-old cofounder and CEO at Cal AI, an AI-powered nutrition and food tracking app, based in Miami. Business Insider has verified the financial claims mentioned in this article. This story has been edited for length and clarity. I sold my first app at 16 years old for almost $100,000. It was called Totally Science, an unblocked gaming website that allowed students to play games in school. Every app or game I've built has been to solve a problem in my own life. I was a skinny kid growing up and tried going to the gym to put on weight, but learned very quickly that most results come from diet. My cofounders and I set out to build a calorie-tracking app that integrates AI technology. Our app really took off over the next year and a half, bringing us to now, where we are a 30-person team and generating around $30 million in annual revenue. My parents put me in a coding camp when I was 7. I didn't learn that much, but it sparked my interest and showed me what was possible. I would spend hours a day watching people program different video games. BI's Young Geniuses series spotlights the next generation of founders, innovators, and thinkers who are trying to reshape industries and solve global challenges. I attempted to recreate some of the most complex video games with my own small tweaks. After watching "The Social Network," Mark Zuckerberg became a massive inspiration. He was the main reason I pursued programming past making video games. I got really good grades in school and had a social life with my friends. However, I spent multiple hours a day outside of school working on various projects. My cofounder, Henry, and I started building apps in the summer of 2023. It was just the two of us trying to figure things out from scratch, learning on our own. I messaged some people who built very successful apps to find mentors, and one of our other cofounders was one of the people I messaged. He had previously scaled a couple of apps to a few million downloads, and I had reached out to him for advice. After that, we started working with a few influencers on videos, and the new app took off faster than any of us could have ever imagined. I quickly became aware that we had all the pieces for success to a much greater extent than any other project I had worked on, and I put the money from my previous app sale into it. The most beautiful and proudest moments in my life so far have probably been meeting people in person who show me Cal AI on their phone. It's awesome to see that something I built is being used by people every single day. Ignore the noise, ignore the people telling you that it's impossible to do it at a young age, and ignore the people trying to push you down a specific path to accomplish your goals. I had Google, the internet, and YouTube as my tools, but for the next generation of founders, it's ChatGPT that they can use to teach themselves. Which is so much easier than watching YouTube videos, where I was limited to the content library that people have posted. This definitely takes up a significant amount of time and mental space. So fun in the short term, but not super productive. I want to talk about real-world problems, solutions, business models, and other things that most kids my age aren't interested in.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Salvatore, 44, the founder of Heritage Hospitality Group, a company with a few bars and coffee shops in Chicago. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I own Heritage Hospitality Group in Chicago, and we've been around since 2011. I did that for a few years as I pursued my interests throughout the hospitality industry. We now have five different brands: Froth, Heritage Outpost, Heritage Bikes & Coffee, Larry's, and Bunker. I love solving the problems that arise. I love coming up with new drinks. How have tariffs or other factors affected your business? Reach out to this reporter at mhoff@businessinsider.com. My teenager is now working at the shop as a dishwasher. We started this company when he was several months old. It's always been about the people, it's always been about the hospitality, and that keeps me going. COVID was one of the hardest points in my life operating a business. The current moment with inflation and policy uncertainty is starting to rival running a business during COVID. Any bicycle parts, anything coming from overseas, that's getting hit, whether it's tariffs or lack of inventory at this point, because the wholesalers don't have it either. Coffee bean prices have obviously gone up. Even things like cups, paper goods, anything that we rely on — essentially, nothing's manufactured in the States. It's a global economy, so everything gets hit. You can't operate a business with uncertainty. This uncertainty creates this temperature where I'm going to hold off on any major decisions because I don't know how that's going to affect my bottom line tomorrow. The uncertainty stems from a few factors. I'm frozen for at least six months. It's like we're operating in a hurricane with all these things flying in our faces, and we're just trying to make sure that the kitchen's open and the coffee's warm. But we're also raising prices due to across-the-board cost increases: labor, insurance, coffee, paper goods. We're raising prices in stages, starting with coffee. Next, we're looking at pastries, packaged drinks, and eventually our food menu. We're reviewing item by item over the next two months and adjusting where the margin hit is greatest. We're not taking a blanket approach — it's strategic and staged. At Froth, we raised the price of a cappuccino from $4.50 to $4.75. A 12-ounce drip coffee went from $3.00 to $3.15. At Heritage Bikes & Coffee, a cortado went from $4.25 to $4.50. Most changes were in that 5% range, rounded up. Right now, we are just increasing prices on coffee drinks, where we lost a ton of margin, and I needed to recoup some of that. So that's where the first step was. We'll continue to do that throughout the next few months and slowly but surely raise prices where it makes sense. Raising prices is really hard for me. It's been years since I've done that for coffee. It needed to be done because I see that we're making more revenue, but we have less margin for any profit to pay our folks. I have a hard time raising prices on my customers, who come in and spend their money on a coffee, bike, service, beer, or food. So I know how special that can be. I've always wanted that to be within striking distance of most people. We debated announcing the increase widely by email, but ultimately decided to explain it directly when asked, which felt more aligned with how we do things. I think people generally understand that everything is getting more expensive. When I look at what our margins are and how thin they've become in order to operate, I've had to raise those prices. Our margin for labor, it should be a certain point, a certain percentage of your income. We made operational changes focused on efficiency — eliminating overlapping shifts, reducing prep cook hours, and cutting a few key middle-management roles like kitchen manager, events, and social media. We implemented a hiring freeze in late September due to tariffs and economic uncertainty more broadly. We're being extremely selective so while there may be a few specific roles open (like event-based or part-time), we've halted active recruiting across the company. When you're operating at thin margins as it is, those matter hugely. So if you're talking about every expense that's gone up throughout your QuickBooks account, no matter how much revenue comes in, unless you have an incredible year, you can't keep up with the expenses unless you raise your prices. I always try to operate within our revenues. But it's going to get thin for sure. How have tariffs or other factors affected your business? Reach out to this reporter at mhoff@businessinsider.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will remain closed until further notice, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday, adding its reopening will depend on Hamas handing over the bodies of deceased hostages as the two sides continued to trade blame over ceasefire violations. Netanyahu's statement came shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Egypt announced that the Rafah crossing, the main gateway for Gazans to leave and enter the enclave, would reopen on Monday for entry into Gaza. Netanyahu's government and Hamas have been trading blame over violations of the U.S.-mediated ceasefire for days. Late on Saturday in Washington, the State Department said it had received "credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza." Hamas denied on Sunday accusations of an "imminent attack" or a "violation" of the ceasefire. It accused Israeli authorities of forming, arming and funding "criminal gangs" that carried out murders, kidnappings and aided looting. The Palestinian militant group said police forces in Gaza were performing their duty by pursuing those gangs to hold them accountable. Trump had said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal that he brokered. The militant group has launched a security crackdown in urban areas vacated by Israeli forces, demonstrating its power through public executions and clashes with local armed clans. Hamas, in a statement late on Saturday, said Netanyahu's decision "constitutes a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a repudiation of the commitments he made to the mediators and guarantor parties." Israel said it received two more bodies late on Saturday, meaning 12 out of 28 bodies have been handed over under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal agreed between Israel and Hamas last week. The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor confirming famine and health authorities overwhelmed. As part of the deal, Hamas released all 20 living Israeli hostages it had been holding for two years, in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners jailed in Israel. But Israel says that Hamas has been too slow to hand over the bodies of deceased hostages it still holds. The deal requires Israel to return 360 bodies of Palestinian militants for the deceased Israeli hostages and so far it has handed over 15 bodies in return for each Israeli body it has received. Rafah has largely been shut since May 2024. The ceasefire deal also includes the ramping up of aid into the enclave, where hundreds of thousands of people were determined in August to be affected by famine, according to the IPC global hunger monitor. After cutting off all supplies for 11 weeks in March, Israel increased aid into Gaza in July, scaling it up further since the ceasefire. Around 560 metric tons of food had entered Gaza per day on average since the U.S.-brokered truce, but this was still well below the scale of need, according to the U.N. World Food Programme.

Halloween is typically a big deal for the Jones family — they love to decorate, hand out candy and hot dogs, and enjoy a neighborhood shindig. That means big Halloween plans are out of the budget; so is an outing for his daughter and her friends to the new Taylor Swift movie. Across the country, government workers like Jones are cutting back on subscriptions, canceling vacations, skipping car repairs, pausing kids' dance classes, and delaying credit card payments. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay amid the shutdown, while the Trump administration pushes through new staff cuts. Most employees received one final prorated check this week for the days worked immediately before the shutdown; it could be their last until Congress reaches a funding deal. Business Insider interviewed more than two dozen workers across agencies and the military. Some said they are dipping into savings, while others worry they won't be able to afford medicine and rent next month. Meanwhile, thousands of federal employees who received termination notices since the start of the shutdown are left in limbo after an October 15 court ruling temporarily paused their layoffs. Federal workers told Business Insider that one check can be the difference between paying a bill or going into debt. A Pew analysis showed that nearly half of government employees earned under $89,000 annually as of March 2024, with 8% earning less than $50,000 — money that goes fast if families are paying for housing, childcare, groceries, and medicine. "A lot of us are living paycheck to paycheck, like most Americans, but even more so now we have to be cognizant of where every penny is going," Mark Cochran, a furloughed National Park Service employee in Pennsylvania and AFGE Local 3145 president, previously told Business Insider. One civilian Department of Defense worker has been hitting the phones: They've reached out to their mortgage company and two major banks to see if they can get a loan or forbearance. They've already applied for a bridge loan from the United States Senate Federal Credit Union. "I just wished that we could get more financial support from these public companies (even major ones) when it was not our fault." A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employee said they are trying to secure a mortgage loan approval this month, but "that fell through because of the missing paycheck," and a National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee said that they're delaying repairs to their roof and car. One Internal Revenue Service worker said medical challenges would become "drastically more expensive" if they lost their job. Another IRS employee said they're anxious about making credit card and loan payments. A few said they are working with colleagues to organize food drives or apply for SNAP and unemployment benefits. USAA, which offers interest-free loans equivalent to paychecks for impacted federal workers, said that they've approved and funded nearly $243 million for around 65,000 loans in the first week of opening the program. And the Navy Federal Credit Union, which offers a similar program, said that they're "seeing a significant uptick in participation." A filing from the Office of Management and Budget on October 10 indicated that between 4,132 and 4,232 federal workers were marked for layoffs, with some receiving RIF notices that day. For now, those planned cuts are paused by a court order, and the administration cannot legally enforce layoffs for employees who have already received notices or continue issuing new terminations. At one agency in particular, employees are feeling whiplash. An HHS spokesperson told Business Insider that some employees received incorrect notifications and "are not subject to the reduction in force." The CDC union confirmed that "around 700 employees received emails rescinding their illegal terminations. A few CDC workers told Business Insider that this lack of job security is having a tangible impact on their lives and financial planning. "We have an emergency cushion, but I am concerned about how long it's going to go on," one laid-off CDC worker — who wasn't called back — said, "We have talked about selling our house if we need to. We've also talked about tapping into retirement savings as a very last resort." Over the past eight months of DOGE firings and the government shutdown, the employee said they have had "pretty charged conversations about what our life is going to look like" with their spouse. "I guess it was a bit of relief if I still have a job and I know where my next paycheck is going to come from when the shutdown ends," they said, "But the ground has been shaken beneath us." Over 200,000 federal workers have lost their jobs, and thousands more have left their government posts through retirement, buyouts, quits, and deferred resignations since Trump took office in January. Senate Democrats and Republicans have not yet reached a funding agreement to end the government shutdown. Until then, some employees are draining their bank accounts to show up for unpaid shifts until they can't afford it anymore. I talked to a couple employees, they said, 'this is my last fill-up and I won't have any money,' because they don't have credit cards," Jones said. People are asking like, 'Hey, I'd love to come work — but may not have gas money.'"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From tech to airlines, large global companies have been slashing staff as the real-world impact of artificial intelligence plays out, spooking employees. But critics say AI has become an easy excuse for firms looking to downsize. Last month, tech consultancy firm Accenture announced a restructuring plan that includes quick exits for workers that aren't first able to reskill on AI. Meanwhile, fintech firm Klarna has reduced staff by 40% as it aggressively adopts AI tools. Language-learning platform Duolingo has stated that it will gradually stop relying on contractors and use AI to fill the gaps. Previously there may have been some stigma attached to using AI, but now companies are "scapegoating" the technology to take the fall for challenging business moves such as layoffs. It's rather really a projection into AI in the sense of 'We can use AI to make good excuses,'" Stephany said in an interview with CNBC. Companies can essentially position themselves at the frontier of AI technology to appear innovative and competitive, and simultaneously conceal the real reasons for layoffs, according to Stephany. "There might be various other reasons why companies are having to get rid of part of their workforce ... Duolingo or Klarna are really prime candidates for this because there has been overhiring during Corona [Covid-19 pandemic] as well," the professor said. "It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying "we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'" he added. One founder, Jean-Christophe Bouglé even said in a popular LinkedIn post that AI adoption is at a "much slower pace" than is being claimed and in large corporations "there's not much happening" with AI projects even being rolled back due to cost or security concerns. It looks like a big excuse, in a context where the economy in many countries is slowing down, despite what the incredible performance of stock exchanges suggest," said Bouglé, who co-founded Authentic.ly. Jasmine Escalera, a careers expert, said this concealment is "feeding the fear of AI" with employees globally concerned about their jobs being replaced as a result of AI. "So we already know that employees are scared because companies are not being honest, open and communicative about how they're implementing AI," Escalera told CNBC Make It. "Now companies are openly stating 'We're doing this [layoffs] because of AI' so it's feeding the frenzy." Escalera said big companies need to be more responsible as they set the tone for what's the norm in business decision making and avoid greenlighting "bad behavior." "We've successfully redeployed hundreds of employees into other areas like professional services, sales, and customer success," the Salesforce spokesperson added. Klarna directed CNBC to its co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's comments on X where he explained that the company shrank its workforce from 5,500 to 3,000 people in two years but "AI is only part of that story." Siemiatkowski linked the workforce reduction to slimming down its analytics team to one "success team," with many then leaving by natural attrition as well as the reduction of the company's customer success team. Duolingo did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. The Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center at Yale University, released a report on Wednesday which showed that U.S. labor has actually been little disrupted by AI automation since the release of ChatGPT in 2022. It found that AI hasn't yet caused widespread job losses. Additionally, New York Fed economists released research in early September which showed that AI use amongst firms "do not point to significant reductions in employment" across the services and manufacturing industry in the New York–Northern New Jersey region. Meanwhile, 12% of services firms said AI made them hire less workers in 2025. Stephany said there isn't much evidence from his research that shows large levels of technological unemployment due to AI. "Economists call this structural unemployment, so the pie of work is not big enough for everybody anymore and so people will lose jobs definitely because of of AI, I don't think that this is happening on a mass scale," he said. He added that concerns about technology putting an end to human work can be seen throughout history. "It reoccurred this century alone a dozen times, you can go back to ancient times where Roman emperors put hold to certain machines because they were worried about this and always the contrary happened. "It allowed for the emergence of entirely new jobs. If you think about the internet 20 years ago, nobody would have known what a social media influencer is, what an app developer is because it didn't exist."
