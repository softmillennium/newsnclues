                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Sabrina Carpenter pulled double duty on this weekend's Saturday Night Live, the show's censor couldn't quite keep up. While performing her track ‘Nobody's Son' from her seventh album Man's Best Friend, the 2x Grammy winner dropped two F-bombs that made it onto NBC‘s East Coast broadcast, as well as Peacock‘s simulcast. “He sure f*cked me up,” sang Carpenter twice in her karate-themed performance at Studio 8H. It's unclear if NBC will face a fine or other consequences from the FCC. Deadline has reached out to both for comment. But for many watching live, the moment did not go unnoticed. “Sabrina saying f*ck TWICE on live national television is the most Sabrina Carpenter thing ever she dgaf im crying,” wrote one fan on X. “Never leave Sabrina Carpenter unsupervised she's gonna drop the f bomb on national television,” another posted. “Sabrina Carpenter said f*ck on SNL justice for Jenny Slate,” someone else wrote. SNL previously faced similar controversy last season when Ego Nwodim‘s ‘Weekend Update' call-and-response bit elicited some expletives form the live studio audience. Marking her third appearance on the NBC sketch comedy show, Carpenter served as celebrity guest host and musical guest on this weekend's Saturday Night Live, also performing her song ‘Manchild'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sure, there was some recent chatter about whether Netflix would consider a competing for Warner Bros. "It's a Monumental Moment to Choose Yourself": Keri Russell Breaks Down 'The Diplomat's' "Contemplative" Season 3 Shift “Shares have lagged the Nasdaq … since end of June, with concerns over engagement growth and the competitive threat from AI-generated content weighing on sentiment,” Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote on Friday. “We remain bullish, expecting strong second-half 2025 financial results, including potential advertising upside and engagement growth.” He reiterated his “overweight” rating with a $1,500 stock price target. Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino similarly said: “Amid concerns of AI's possible impact on streaming economics and after very sharp third-quarter [stock] underperformance, we are buyers of Netflix.” He stuck to his “outperform” rating and $1,390 stock price target on the company. “Since May, the story has encountered Google's Veo 3, Meta's Vibes, Midjourney's AI video generator, and OpenAI's Sora 2,” the analyst wrote in his report entitled “Hey ChatGPT, Should I Buy NFLX?,” which is Netflix's stock ticker symbol. His conclusion: “Netflix's widening growth strategies, superior scale, and rich cash flow position it to extend its lead in long-form video streaming, which continues to take wallet share from pay-TV.” Investors and experts will also listen out for management commentary on the progress of its advertising tier business and newer initiatives, such as this week's news that Spotify video podcasts will come to Netflix in the U.S. in early 2026, followed by other markets. “Netflix's global engagement rose modestly quarter-over-quarter, reversing the second-quarter dip that came with a weaker content slate last quarter.” The expert highlighted that KPop Demon Hunters added “roughly 500 million viewing hours, with another about 400 million expected in the fourth quarter.” His conclusion: “There are always big hits that meaningfully move the engagement needle, though one of this magnitude is atypical for Netflix, or any player.” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich seemed to reference the KPop Demon Hunters success in her Netflix earnings preview, entitled “Hunting down hits.” She has a “buy” rating and $1,490 price objective on the stock. “We anticipate that Netflix's third-quarter results will be at least in line with guidance on key metrics including revenue, operating income and earnings per share,” she noted. “Netflix continued to execute on its high-profile live event's strategy, with Canelo-Crawford bringing in an estimated total of 41.4 million viewers, making it the most-viewed men's championship boxing match of the century. In August, KPopDemon Hunters became the most watched Netflix film of all time (325 million views), indicating the company's continued ability to scale massive hits out of relatively unknown IP.” Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris used those for a pun in a recent report, entitling it “Congratulations on Your Engagement.” “Investor conversations remain focused on Netflix viewership engagement trends and implications for longer-term revenue growth and margin expansion,” he wrote. “We expect member engagement to accelerate into year-end, benefiting from a fourth-quarter slate highlighted by the final season of Stranger Things, Jake Paul vs. “We believe the return of marquee shows (Squid Game June 27th; Wednesday Aug. 6th) and new hits (KPop Demon Hunters, Untamed) provided a tailwind to engagement/monetization.” “We continue to be bullish on the name given record-breaking KPop Demon Hunters viewership data, an attractive content slate in the second half of 2025, and a strong slate lineup in 2026,” he wrote. “We expect incremental growth in 2026, driven by a strong content lineup, the Spotify podcasting deal, push further into gaming, and AVOD ramp-up.” “If, as we suspect, there was in the second quarter, there was upside to that number, that would be the likeliest driver of revenue outperformance,” Kurnos highlighted. Kurnos remains cautious on Netflix's stock because of its high price and bid uncertainty. “We are going to opt to maintain the hold rating for now, with shares trading at almost 33 times 2026 estimated adjusted operating income, and, although a seemingly low probability, the lurking specter of Netflix taking a swing on the M&A front, creating some longer-tailed doubt in investor minds,” he wrote. And Yoon wrote: “We have considered the scenario, but not as a likely outcome, largely because it is unclear what strategic value Netflix would realize.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kylie Jenner not only made a decade-long music rumor a reality recently, but she also popped up at an event deemed “Kylie Jenner's 10 Years of Kylie Cosmetics Celebration with Friends & Family” on October 17 in West Hollywood. Reminding fans of her beloved King Kylie era of ever-changing hair colors, Kylie debuted pink hair that matched the latex dress that she wore for the night. Kylie opted for long locks that had just enough of a wave to turn the style into an old Hollywood-esque ‘do. Of course, the light bubblegum pink shade completely hailed back to the reality TV star's days of teal, dark blue and even green hair. She also opted for large (like, massive) rings on her fingers but went without a necklace. When Kylie stepped out with pink hair and wearing a latex dress in the same color, fans were floored by the look. That's why they flooded social media to show their appreciation and admiration. One person took to the comments of an Instagram post featuring Kylie, saying, “Da most beautiful pink lady in the world 🌎 🫠🍒” All I can think of is the song Barbie Girl,” another person wrote. A third fan said, “Kylie has got to be most beautiful woman there is.” “WOOOOW SHE LOOKS SO GOOD,” came from another social media user. Someone else wrote, “Omg she is back in her wigs era” I changed my hair color like once a week and cut my hair off and then put a wig on or put extensions in; and I've always switched up my style.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Kardashian turned heads by covering her face at the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles on October 18, 2025. Because it was difficult to see through her face cover, Kardashian required help getting to the spot where she and other celebrities posed for photographers. Telling Variety her look was by designer Glenn Martens for Maison Margiela, she said, “You know, I love Margiela. I flew in my favorite makeup artist Mario from New York, and this is kind of a last-minute thing, so I'm sure he's not so happy with it.” That's right — Kardashian had her makeup and hair fully done before covering it all with the fabric mask. “It does look very SKIMS-y,” Kardashian told Variety. “That's why I was drawn to it when the Margiela couture show came out. Kardashian did tell Variety she planned to remove her face cover once inside for the gala, so she could hobnob with fellow stars, including her own sisters, Kendall Jenner, who showed up for the gala in a black sleeveless gown. Among the other celebrities who rocked the blue carpet at the Academy Museum Gala were actresses Eva Longoria, dressed in a shimmering Elie Saab gown, and Lupita Nyong'o, who wore Chanel, according to Vogue. Charlie XCX stepped out in all-black Saint Laurent, per Just Jared, and Kaia Gerber wore a custom white lace gown and cape by Givenchy, the outlet reported. The star-studded affair also included guests such as Jon Hamm, Jennifer Hudson, Selena Gomez with her new husband Benny Blanco, Ed Sheeran, and Olivia Rodriuo. No word yet if any of them saw Kim Kardashian's face make an appearance at the bash. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on Donald Trump‘s commutation of Republican former congressman and fraudster George Santos‘ seven-plus year prison sentence, his decision to give Argentina a $20 billion financial aid package, and the president's recent Time magazine cover. Santos had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft—”which I think is when you push someone in a closet and change clothes with them,” Jost went on. Jost circled back to Santos, who repeatedly lied about his background and work history, later in the segment. “In the clinching game of the NLCS, Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani pitched six scoreless innings, struck out ten batters and hit three home runs,” Jost said, “a feat previously only accomplished by George Santos.” Co-anchor Michael Che weighed in on Trump's appearance on the cover of Time magazine, which he wasn't pleased with and which was mocked by California Gov. “President Trump criticized Time magazine for using a bad picture of him on the cover, saying ‘They disappeared my hair.' And I've got to agree: that thing do look waxed,” Che joked, zooming in on the 79-year-old's neck. Che also made a jab at his colleague while referencing the racist and antisemitic group chat between Young Republicans leaders that was exposed this week. Taylor Swift Donates $100,000 to Young Fan Battling Cancer Who Calls Star ‘My Friend' What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong “There was outrage this week over a leaked group chat between Republican leaders which praised Hitler and referred to Black Americans as ‘watermelon people,'” Che said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump joined a Gen Z boys' podcast about snacks in which he simultaneously dissected both Airheads and his chances of getting into heaven. On “Snack Homiez,” Trump (James Austin Johnson) told the podcast hosts—one of whom was played by Sabrina Carpenter—that “it's been a long time coming with regard to snacks and friendship and from the standpoint of podcasts.” When asked by Braylor (Chloe Fineman) what he thinks about vegetables, Trump admitted he has “never been one for the veggies.” “Ding-dongs, I like a ding-dong,” he explained. You know, it used to be seasonal. But I very smartly made a call, now we get it year 'round.” When Tayson (Carpenter) brought up Airheads, Trump naturally rambled about world affairs and kept exaggerating his questionable list of wars “solved.” You know, I've solved like seven wars at this point, right? It's like 100 wars I've solved, right?” he said. “Something like 200 wars, right?” he went on. Trump then offered a non-sensible explanation for commuting fraudster George Santos' prison sentence. “You know who I like is George Santos. We don't know anything about him. I don't know him at all but one of our favorite people,” Trump said, before referencing Saturday's No Kings protests nationwide against him. “People are marching because they're happy he's free. Maybe if I think about it, blue Airhead.” Trump then asked the podcast hosts about whether they though he would be getting into heaven—apparently a frequent concern of his of late. Do I fit the criteria in terms of Christian and with regard to St. Peter and pearly gates?” the 79-year-old asked. “Um, I don't know, sir,” Braylor replied.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sabrina Carpenter‘s Saturday Night Live hosting debut kicked off with a fun callback to none other than the viral Domingo skit — with a modern pop twist. True to the original skit, Kelsey's girl squad recounted their Nashville night out in front of her husband Matt (Andrew Dismukes) in full song form, set to the tune of some of the most popular modern tracks. Klaus Doldinger, Composer of 'Das Boot' and 'The NeverEnding Story,' Dies at 89 The original Domingo skit instantly went viral, originally featuring Carpenter's “Espresso” as Kelsey's bridesmaids confessed that she had cheated on her husband-to-be with Domingo. Pointing back to her last appearance on the show during SNL 50, she noted that “since then, my new album Man's Best Friend came out, which I'm so excited about. But some people got a little freaked out by the cover.” It was just this: me on all fours with an unseen figure pulling my hair. But what people don't realize is, that's just how they cropped it. The “Bed Chem” singer used the rest of her monologue to “clear up some misconceptions people have about me,” joking that “everyone thinks of me as this horndog pop star, but there's really so much more to me.” It's so big and it's hard…” she said, before continuing, “There is a real person underneath all the sparkles and the wigs and the corsets, and another thing you might not know about me is that I love to interact with the audience during my show, so I'd like to do that right now.” She went on to touch base with a few audience members before returning to the stage, where she continued another one of her concert traditions: “The last fun thing I like to do at my concerts is arrest someone for being hot. Kenan Thompson then hit the stage, where he joked that he was arresting the singer “for falsely impersonating an officer 200 times at your concerts. Earlier this week, the next wave of SNL guests were announced. Last Saturday's show was full of star-studded cameos, as former cast member Poehler brought back fellow SNL alumni Tina Fey and Seth Meyers throughout the episode. Fey also made a cameo to impersonate Kristi Noem in the cold open, while Poehler portrayed Pam Bondi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In her second time as a Saturday Night Live musical guest and as a first-time host, Grammy winner Sabrina Carpenter wasted no time in delving into controversy in her signature cheeky style. The late-night sketch show — which began late tonight due to college football — eschewed its typical political satire for a Domingo reunion during its Cold Open, featuring a reprisal by Marcello Hernandez and Carpenter. 'Saturday Night Live' Cold Open Features Sabrina Carpenter's Return In A Domingo Sketch “Some people got a little freaked out by the cover,” she said, alluding to fan concerns it was unfeminist. It was just this: me on all fours, with an unseen figure pulling my hair. But what people don't realize is that's just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it's clearly a picture from the 50th anniversary special of Bowen [Yang] helping me up by the hair — after Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line, saying something like, ‘Daddy need his mini quiche. '” (As reported earlier, Bowen Yang is absent this episode.) The “Espresso” singer continued, wanting to “clear up some misconceptions” about her public persona. “Everyone thinks of me as this horned-up pop star, but there's really so much more to me,” she quipped. Carpenter, who is the first person to be pulling double-duty this season, also pulled from her concert repertoire to interact with the audience. As she moved to “arrest” someone for being hot — a mainstay bit from her tour — veteran Kenan Thompson popped up to jail her in turn for impersonating a cop hundreds of times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We're here representing normal people — regular, peaceful Americans — who are against what this administration is doing, who are against the occupation of our cities and the disappearing of our neighbors off the streets,” says Jermaine Collins, a 34-year-old veteran of the war in Afghanistan, speaking to Rolling Stone beside a city dump truck, set up to block road access beside the National Gallery of Art. The event comes as the Trump administration becomes increasingly eager to directly confront its political opponents using the varied levers of state power — including by using anti-terror tools originally designed to fight foreign extremists against domestic targets, and by deploying the National Guard to major cities under federal authority. In Washington, squads of roving guardsmen in MultiCam uniforms and body armor carrying M17 pistols and M4 rifles have become a commonplace sight, but on Saturday the law enforcement presence was relatively light and relaxed. “We have friends who are in it [the D.C. National Guard]. The retiree and his three friends, all of whom asked not to be identified for fear of potential retribution by the American government, spoke to this reporter at length about what they see as a breakdown of politics-as-usual in the U.S. Describing themselves as political moderates, they say they are not optimistic that the Trump administration's “vindictive lawlessness” — as one described it — could be easily defeated, especially in the current emotionally charged and divisive partisan political environment. And yet, they are holding out hope that resistance to the administration will manifest in votes against Republicans at the ballot box during next year's midterm elections, despite what one called a “pathetic” performance by the Democratic Party. “I have to hope that events like today will help make inroads with the independents who were voting ‘Trump' in the last election.” Comedian Arrested in Giraffe Suit Says ICE Laughed at His Trump-Epstein Jokes ‘No Kings' Protest Organizers Aren't Afraid of Trump's Court Jesters “What we need is a major non-violent civil resistance movement in the U.S. that's capable of building levers of power that can be used against the administration and its supporters — especially the top tier of elites in American society that either actively support the administration or that are going along with it.” The goal of this, Wilson says, is to pressure elites and institutions to remove their support from what he calls “the emerging regime.” This reporter watched a lone man in a “Make America Great Again” hat and Donald Trump shirt walk through the crowds of protesters unmolested, staring defiantly as the people around him largely ignored his passing. That wasn't surprising to Collins, the Afghan vet. It's not what you've been seeing on Fox News and all that. There's not a bunch of — they framed us as ‘terrorists,'” he says. The administration and its allies have flip-flopped between downplaying and ignoring the protests, to describing them as major threats to national security. On Wednesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he wanted to introduce legislation allowing the Department of Justice to pursue prosecutions of the funders and organizers of “No Kings” under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act. “You look at this ‘No Kings' rally — there's considerable evidence that George Soros and his network is behind funding these rallies, which may well turn into riots.” Not only is Donald Trump wildly unpopular, but the vast majority of people in this country don't support dictatorships. “We don't have a country if we don't have the First Amendment, and people absolutely should exercise their freedom to peaceably assemble and petition their government,” Wolf says. “No matter what bluster comes out of the White House or their enablers, that is a fundamentally American freedom.” Nevertheless, Cruz's threats are part of a larger pattern in which the Trump administration has shown a willingness to go after protesters. In September, the president signed an executive order that labeled the leaderless anti-fascist collective movement known as Antifa a “Domestic Terrorist Organization.” On Thursday, federal prosecutors secured a grand jury indictment against members of a supposed “Antifa Cell” on charges of providing “material support to terrorism,” related to an incident at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Alvarado, Texas on July 4. In that incident, a group of individuals dressed in black raided the ICE facility, shooting fireworks and vandalizing property, according to the U.S. government, in an attack that amounted to an “ambush” and “attempted murder of federal officers.” It is believed to be the first time that terrorism charges have been applied to alleged followers of the anti-fascist movement. A temporary restraining order blocking that deployment was upheld by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, which in its ruling specifically noted that “Political opposition is not rebellion,” arguing that the evidence did not support the president federalizing troops over the objections of local authorities. “A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protesters advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows,” the court wrote, adding, “Nor does a protest become a rebellion merely because of sporadic and isolated incidents of unlawful activity or even violence committed by rogue participants in the protest.” Back at the protest in D.C. on Saturday, certainly there was little indication of open rebellion afoot. It's a different type of love, in a way, because you realize what your life could have been like, had you not had this opportunity,” says Nancy, a 57-year-old attorney from Maryland who — like many of the people with whom Rolling Stone spoke — asked not to be identified using her full name. “The rule of law is what differentiates a free people. And so I'm really, really concerned about the abrogation of the rule of law — and how easily it's happening. How almost without thought, we're getting numb to whatever breaches are occurring.” Regardless of someone's motivations or politics, organizers say, the most important thing anyone can do to defend the rights that they believe to be under threat is simply show up. Taylor Swift Donates $100,000 to Young Fan Battling Cancer Who Calls Star ‘My Friend' What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong Oftentimes, it's bluster and there's not a whole lot of bite behind the bark. “But I will just say that, throughout American history and across the world, courageous people have stood up in the face of harrowing circumstances and defended freedom,” Wolf adds, “and they've been on the right side of history when it was written.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

They are using every tool in their arsenal to silence voices of dissent.” Glenn Close, Spike Lee, Jean Smart & More Voice Support For No Kings Protests: "The Most Patriotic Thing That You Can Do" She continued, “These past few months we have seen direct attacks on Writers Guild members who use their platforms to criticize or question this administration. In July, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was abruptly canceled after Colbert made comments about Paramount's settlement with Trump. “These late-night shows not only provide hundreds of good union jobs, and much-needed laughs in these troubled times; they entertain and inform audiences all over the country,” Mulroney added. And it's clear that some people can't handle the truth.” In continuing, Mulroney singled out how the issue doesn't just pertain to Tinseltown: “This isn't just about Hollywood. This is about our fundamental right as human beings to disagree with those in power. “But we currently find ourselves in an era of consolidated media where an increasingly small number of gatekeepers control what we get to watch on television. We've all heard the FCC claim that ‘the public interest is best served by permitting free expression of views,' yet FCC Chairman Brendan Carr does not hesitate to support attacks on those who challenge the Administration's narrative.” She continued, “Make no mistake: Mega corporations pushed for a pro-business administration that would allow them to consolidate their control over media at the cost of free speech. In concluding her speech, Mulroney stated that the WGA will “not stand by and let these attacks go unaddressed.” “The Writers Guild stands here today, with all of you, to say loudly and proudly that we will speak our minds, write our truths, tell our stories, and fight like hell for free speech and an independent media. When our voices are strong and clear, when our words are powerful, we cannot be silenced. In preparation for No Kings today, the WGA West Instagram account posted photos of members coming together to make signs. Prominent Hollywood celebrities, like Glenn Close, Spike Lee and Jean Smart, have voiced their resounding support for the countrywide day of dissent. In Washington, D.C., Bernie Sanders, Bill Nye and journalist Mehdi Hasan issued warnings against the country's creep into fascism. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.
