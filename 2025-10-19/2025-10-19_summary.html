Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has accused the Trump administration of assassination.RODRIGO ARANGUA/AFP/Getty Images

U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country's leader “does nothing to stop” drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America.

In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as “an illegal drug dealer” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” He warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.” Colombia's defence minister, Pedro Sánchez, defending Petro and the nation's drug-fighting commitment, said, “If there's a country that has used all its capabilities and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking ... it's Colombia.”

Trump, while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, wrote on his Truth Social platform that Petro is “strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields” across Colombia, which the Republican president initially misspelled as Columbia before deleting his post and replacing it the correct spelling of the country. “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,” Trump said.

“AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA,” Trump said. He also said Petro had “a fresh mouth toward America.”

Hours later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. strike in the waters off South America, this time against a vessel he said was associated with a Colombian rebel group – the National Liberation Army, or ELN – and was carrying “substantial amounts of narcotics,” but did not say how that was known to U.S. intelligence agencies. He said on social media that three men aboard were killed in the Friday attack. A brief video clip he attached showed a boat in flames after an explosion. The State Department designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.

Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after a U.S. strike Thursday in Caribbean waters. The U.S. said on Saturday it was repatriating to Colombia and Ecuador two survivors from that attack, the sixth since early September. With Hegseth's announcement, at least 32 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers.

There was no immediate reaction from the ELN, with which Petro suspended peace talks in January after a violent incursion on the border with Venezuela. The group has denied involvement in drug trafficking, but Colombian authorities regularly report the dismantling of cocaine laboratories and the seizure of drugs believed to belong to the guerrillas.

U.S. strike on Caribbean boat leaves survivors, official says

In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to co-operate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia is the world's largest exporter of cocaine, and the cultivation of the critical ingredient of coca leaves reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations.

More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump's commands. “I ask all the soldiers of the United States' army, don't point your rifles against humanity” and “disobey the orders of Trump,” Petro said.

Petro said a Colombian man was killed in a Sept. 16 strike and identified him as Alejandro Carranza, a fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He said that Carranza has no ties to drug trafficking and that his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit.

“U.S. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote on X. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. We await explanations from the US government.”

Petro said that he has alerted the attorney-general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing.

“The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar's homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,” Petro wrote.

Meanwhile, Noticias Caracol, a Colombian news program, reported that the man injured in the most recent strike was hospitalized after he was repatriated and remains in serious condition.

It quoted Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti as saying that the Colombian “will be prosecuted, he will be received – forgive the harsh expression – as a criminal, because so far what is known is that he was carrying a boat full of cocaine, which in our country is a crime, and despite the fact that it was in international waters, his repatriation will be as if he were being prosecuted in the United States.”

Petro said the man had been aboard a “narco submarine.”

Ecuador's Ministry of the Interior confirmed in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Sunday that the U.S. had repatriated an Ecuadorian man injured in the most recent strike. Officials identified him as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila and said a doctor found him to be in good health.

The ministry noted that two prosecutors met with Tufiño Chila and determined he had not committed any crimes within the country's borders and that there was no evidence to the contrary.

PARIS—Thieves broke into Paris' Louvre museum by using a crane and smashing an upstairs window on Sunday, stealing priceless jewelry from an area that houses the French crown jewels before escaping on motorbikes, the French government said.

The robbery is likely to raise awkward questions about security at the museum, where officials had already sounded the alarm about lack of investment at a world-famous site that welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024.

A Guardian investigation finds the US soda and snack-food industries, threatened by RFK Jr's movement to change Americans' eating habits, have turned to a group of well-connected strategists, shadowy pollsters and ‘anti-woke' influencers

Major US soft-drink and snack-food corporations are waging a coordinated campaign that aims to pit Donald Trump's Maga faithful against Robert F Kennedy Jr's Make America Healthy Again movement, a Guardian investigation in partnership with environmental watchdog Fieldnotes has found. Their goal is to stymie the Maha-led effort to curb Americans' consumption of soda and ultra-processed foods.

To carry out the plan, the companies have turned to a partially formalized network of for-hire pollsters, strategists and political financiers with deep ties to the national Republican party – several of whom have taken steps that obscure their connection to the effort and to one another. In the process, the industry has also been aided less directly by a loose coalition of free-market ideologues who have previously worked to advance Trump's deregulatory agenda.

The effort features Maga influencers hired by a firm that promotes “anti-woke” movies; an obscure research group Lee Zeldin was working for when Donald Trump picked him to lead the US Environmental Protection Agency; and a media outlet backed by rightwing billionaires Leonard Leo and Charles Koch, among others.

The ongoing influence campaign is being spearheaded by the American Beverage Association with help from the Consumer Brands Association, two prominent trade groups in the food industry. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper, the three largest soft-drink corporations in the United States, as well as packaged-food conglomerates like General Mills, Kraft Heinz, Mondelēz and Nestlé, are among those that pay dues for the right to have a say in either or both of the trade groups' strategies.

All three soda-makers identified the Maha efforts as significant threats to their bottom lines in their most recent annual reports, delivered to investors after Trump nominated Kennedy to be secretary of US Health and Human Services. Coke and Dr Pepper went as far as to suggest such risks would be compounded if unnamed “government officials” were to voice health concerns about their products. The three soda makers did not respond to questions about the lobbying effort.

The companies' most pressing political concerns are two related RFK Jr-backed efforts: one to ban schools from serving foods with petroleum-based dyes, and the other to bar individuals receiving Snap benefits from using the federal nutrition assistance to purchase soft drinks.

Their not-so-subtle message to conservative lawmakers, delivered directly by lobbyists and indirectly via both an industry front group and paid social media influencers: oppose the Maha efforts or face a Maga backlash.

“Working-class families and individuals across America rose up to vote for President Trump on the promise of a new era that would lift them up, not leave them behind again,” the beverage lobby declared earlier this year in an unsigned memo as some of the first Maha-themed nutrition efforts were gaining conservative support in places like Utah and Arkansas. Supporting the Snap restrictions, the group continued, “would betray those voters and that promise”.

To date, the Maha nutrition efforts have largely stalled inside the Beltway but found far more success outside of it. A dozen states have already requested, and received, waivers from the US Department of Agriculture allowing them to restrict how Snap benefits can be used, and roughly a half dozen have passed legislation restricting food dyes in school meals.

The Utah state representative Kristen Chevrier, a Republican whose Snap and school-meals bills were signed into law by her governor in March, says that's likely because the industry's influence is concentrated in the nation's capital. “It's easier for the big food industries to control the federal government then it is for them to control a whole bunch of different states,” she said in an interview.

Chevrier, who describes herself as “a Maha mom before Maha was a thing”, said the lobbyists who approached her focused far more on their own profits than any political backlash she might face. Their priority was “how much money they were going to lose if people stopped buying soda with Snap dollars”, she said. “The lobbyists were sitting there at the table with me and I said: ‘Do you have any idea what this sounds like? That you're more concerned about the money you're going to lose than you are about the health of the vulnerable population that you're serving?”

Communications obtained via a public records request confirm that industry lobbyists attempted to use the Maga-versus-Maha messaging in their bid to derail the nutrition bills at the state level. And they've done so with veteran GOP strategists serving as middle operatives, creating the appearance of distance between the companies and their preferred narrative.

In late February, for instance, as two Maha bills were moving through the Arizona legislature, soda lobbyist Michael Gardner reached out to lawmakers to make his client's case against the Snap legislation, which was ultimately vetoed by the governor. He closed by directing the elected officials' attention to a then-recent article headlined “Trump voters want SNAP users to be able to buy soda”. The underlying source for that claim was a poll paid for by the American Beverage Association itself.

The firm hired to conduct the survey, Public Opinion Strategies, is owned by Glen Bolger, who previously worked for the National Republican congressional committee, the House GOP's main campaign arm. The American Beverage Association paid Bolger's firm nearly $2m in 2023, the most recent year for which the trade group's tax filings are publicly available.

Bolger and his firm are also part of a larger, formal network of political shops run by Phil Cox, who was once a top executive at Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family's primary dark-money group, and who is currently on the board of the Senate Leadership Fund and WinRed. Cox's network, GP3 Partners, includes more than a dozen other firms and boasts online of its “proven ability to play with lethal precision at scale”.

Completing this particular lobbying spin-cycle – from industry-funded poll to news coverage the industry's lobbyists could use to pressure lawmakers – was the outlet in which the article about the survey appeared, the Center Square. Despite claiming to be a provider of “high-quality statehouse and statewide news”, it has been identified by journalism experts at Columbia University as a purveyor of “pink slime”, meaning, partisan talking points presented as objective journalism. The Center Square is run by the Franklin News Foundation, a conservative non-profit that has received substantial funding from Donors Trust, Leonard Leo's primary dark-money vehicle, and that is part of the State Policy Network of rightwing thinktanks backed by Leo and the Koch family. (Chris Krug, the publisher of the Center Square, said in an email: “The Center Square maintains editorial independence, free from any external influence.”)

As Gardner was working to derail Arizona's Snap bill on behalf of the soda makers, a second industry lobbyist, the Consumer Brands Association's Erin Raden, was waging a similar, albeit more convoluted, effort in opposition to the state's school-meal bill, the records show.

In a March email to one of the bill's sponsors, Raden argued against the legislation and then, much as Gardner had, closed by pointing to an article posted by a rightwing news outlet that suggested Trump voters wanted such decisions left to the president. “I know you are hosting a town hall tomorrow and thought it might come up,” Raden wrote to the Republican senator Janae Shamp, who had introduced the bill in Arizona's upper chamber.

This time, the underlying poll on which the article was based was conducted by the Tyson Group on behalf of Plymouth Union Public Research. Unlike Public Opinion Strategies, which is well-known within certain Washington DC circles and publicly discloses its ties to GP3, Tyson Group has a far smaller and less transparent public presence. Its website lists just five employees. However, the firm doesn't disclose publicly that all five of those individuals also work at P2 Public Affairs, a much larger and more prominent conservative consulting firm – one that, like Public Opinion Strategies, is also part of Cox's GP3 umbrella organization.

The metadata on an internal memo for subsequent Tyson polling likewise shows that document was created by Katherine Swetman, who is not listed on Tyson's site as an employee but is listed on P2's as a marketing manager specializing in “targeted messaging”. (P2 and Tyson did not respond to questions about their structure or involvement in the campaign. The Consumer Brands Association said in a statement that it did not pay for the poll but believes “most voters across the country” would prefer a national standard for food additives.)

Plymouth Union Public Research is even more opaque. The group, also known as PUP Research, describes itself online as a 501(c)6 non-profit, but there is currently no record of it in the Internal Revenue Service database of such tax-exempt organizations. The group did not respond to questions about its leadership and staff. The firm does, however, show up in the ethics paperwork Zeldin filed in January as part of his confirmation process. In that filing, Zeldin disclosed serving as a director at the research firm from October 2024 to the time he filed the report on 11 January 2025.

While PUP Research doesn't disclose its leadership or employees, an apparent sister organization known as Plymouth Union Public Advocacy, or PUP Advocacy, does. The advocacy firm's website suggests it launched earlier this year with a seven-figure paid campaign in support of Trump's agenda, and that it is led by a trio of GOP veterans.

The Trump administration at times pushes back on the idea that Maha's nutrition agenda is an affront to its base. Earlier this year, after the Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders applied for one of the Snap waivers, the American Beverage Association labeled Sanders and the head of the USDA, Brooke Rollins, as the “food police” on X. (The American Beverage Association's CEO, Kevin Keane, has undertaken a tour of conservative podcasts and conferences, pushing a similar line that the government shouldn't be “making decisions for people” when it comes to nutrition.)

The post drew a swift rebuke from Rollins's X account. “It's disappointing that the American Beverage Association's leadership dragged its entire membership–and the patriotic American workers and their families they employ and represent–into direct conflict with this Administration's priorities for American health, well-being, and taxpayer protection,” she wrote. “These priorities–which those same American workers voted to endorse–will prevail.” She tagged Kennedy in her response.

As industry lobbyists were making their case to lawmakers directly, an industry-funded front group, Americans for Food and Beverage Choice, was running a small-dollar Facebook ad campaign featuring the industry's Snap-related polling in at least nine states, according to the Meta ad library database. The non-profit bills itself as a grassroots organization, but according to its 2023 tax filing, the most recent available, each of the four individuals who served as either a director or officer of the organization that year also was employed at the American Beverage Association, including Keane himself.

Meanwhile, a group of Maga-aligned influencers were taking the same pro-soda message nationwide by posting client-approved talking points on Elon Musk's X – all while not disclosing they were being paid to do so. “We cannot allow ‘Make America Healthy Again' messaging to be used to force needy Americans into not buying certain things,” tweeted conservative influencer Eric Daugherty, adding: “President Trump literally has a Diet Coke button in his Oval Office.”

The paid-influencer campaign was first documented by Nick Sortor, a conservative journalist and podcaster, who obtained internal documents from the social media marketing agency behind the effort, Influenceable LLC.

“This campaign highlights the dangers of government overregulation, with a specific focus on current efforts to restrict soda purchases through food-aid programs,” the company's instructions to the influencers read. “The narrative emphasizes how such regulation is an overreach that unfairly targets consumer choice, especially considering the president himself is a Diet Coke enthusiast.” For good measure, the influencers were also encouraged to share a photo of Trump drinking a soda while riding in a golf cart.

After being called out by Sortor, Daugherty and at least one other influencer deleted their posts. “Yeah, that was dumb of me,” Daugherty posted. “Massive egg on my face. In all seriousness, it won't happen again.”

Influenceable LLC is run by Camron and Liam Rafizadeh, brothers who have made a name for themselves by trafficking in anti-LGBTQ+ memes and pro-Trump talking points online. In 2019, the pair founded Today Is America Inc, which describes itself as “the fastest-growing pro-America Gen Z, Anti-woke company”.

While Influenceable's website does not list any specific political campaigns it has worked on, IRS filings show that it was paid $110,000 in 2023 by the Center for Renewing America, a Christian-nationalist organization founded by Russell Vought, Trump's current director of the office of management and budget.

Keane has denied that the American Beverage Association was behind the Influenceable campaign. Nonetheless, the proposed talking points strongly echo the industry's – including one that appears to cite the very poll the group paid for and then used to lobby state officials in Arizona and cited in the Facebook campaign run by the front group that Keane leads. “Polling shows,” the final talking point given to the influencers reads, “a majority of Trump voters oppose restrictions on soda purchases through SNAP.”

The Israeli military said on Oct. 19 that Hamas violated the cease-fire by firing an anti-tank missile at Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) operating in the Rafah area.

The IDF said it responded with strikes in the area to eliminate the threat and dismantle the tunnel shafts and military structures the Hamas terrorist group was using.

US consumers say price rises caused by president's tariffs contradicts his promise to make life more affordable

As a mother of two, Paige Harris has noticed a change in the way she shops for her family.

“Items that I have bought regularly have gone up in price steadily,” she said. “From hair dye to baby formula, our grocery list has gotten smaller while our budget has had to increase. Meats like steak are a no-go for our household.”

Harris, 38, lives and works as a teacher's assistant in Stella, North Carolina, and is one of almost 40 people who spoke to the Guardian about how they've been coping with the price of goods in the six months since Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariffs.

On Thursday, a study from S&P Global revealed that companies were expected to pay at least $1.2tn more in 2025 expenses than was previously anticipated. But the burden, according to the researchers, is now shifting to US consumers. They calculated that two-thirds of the “expense shock”, more than $900bn, will be absorbed by Americans. Last month, the Yale Budget Lab estimated tariffs would cost households almost $2,400 more a year.

Harris says the tariffs' impact on her daily life contradicts promises from the Trump administration to “cut prices and make living affordable for everyone”. She said: “You see prices soaring. It has become very clear that this administration did not and does not care about the everyday lives of Americans.”

Several Americans told the Guardian their weekly budgets had been drastically altered with the introduction of Trump's tariffs.

“Prices are way too high. I mostly shop at Costco and buy as little as possible anywhere else,” said Jean Meadows, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Huntsville, Alabama. “I can't imagine that stores haven't noticed the change. I think people are really afraid of what is coming.”

That sense of apprehension is reflected in a recent poll, exclusively conducted for the Guardian, where respondents identified the tariffs as the second biggest threat to the economy.

“The bread I buy has doubled in price within a year. We live on a fixed income that doesn't keep up with inflation,” said Myron Peeler, who is also retired and is the sole caregiver for his wife, who suffers from debilitating arthritis. The only saving grace, he said, is that his house and car are paid off.

Trump shows few signs of backing away from his tariff policy – a move the White House maintains will reinvigorate American manufacturing and increased revenue from trade partners.

Most recently, the president reignited a trade war with China by threatening a 100% tariff on Beijing as soon as November. This came after China moved to restrict exports of rare earth minerals needed for several everyday items from electric vehicle batteries to hospital equipment, a decision that Trump branded as “very hostile”. In an interview with Fox News, the president has admitted that the proposed tariff hike was “not sustainable”, but said he was left with little choice: “They forced me to do that”.

Currently, the average US tariffs on Chinese exports hovers around 58%, according to the Peterson Institute for Economics. It's a levy that is already taking a toll on Americans such as Michele, from north-eastern Pennsylvania.

“We need to buy new tires for a car, and can't, because affordable tires are no longer in stock and we can't afford $250 a tire,” she said.

Several people echoed Michele's feelings about availability, describing the situation as “empty shelves, higher prices”. Natalie, who lives in New Hampshire, said she hasn't seen certain pantry staples “for months”. She said: “The store shelves have become more and more bare … instead of multiple choices there may only be one or two, and name brands are being replaced by store brands.”

At 55, Natalie is semi-retired but is due to start part-time work at a supermarket, and she has seen a price rise in nearly everything she buys regularly. “Any brand of cat food has increased anywhere from 25% to double the price. One wet food my cats like went from $1.79 to $2.49 per can,” she said.

The new normal many Americans are bracing for, or already feeling, is not just the cost of groceries, for those such as Minnie, a food writer in Portland, Oregon, it's a change in lifestyle.

“I don't shop for non-essentials. No fall shopping trips for a new sweater or jeans. And we'll make all our Christmas presents this year,” said Minnie, 55. “We used to dine out once a week. Now we never eat out. Even fast-casual is insanely pricey. Everything is twice what it used to cost and we're very afraid of what's next, financially speaking.”

While the US inflation rate hovers around 2.9% – a substantial drop from the spikes of the Covid era – the tariffs haven't helped ease the impact on Americans' wallets. Richard Ulmer, 81, who has lived in Florida for 35 years, said this year has been “the worst from a financial standpoint”, adding that “everything” from his groceries to the electric bill has become more expensive.

For Cassie, a 25-year-old consultant based in Siler City, North Carolina, costs have shot up quickly compared to the “gradual price increases” during the first two years of the pandemic. Cassie has a strict $65 per week budget for groceries, but since Trump first announced his tariffs, she's been priced out of her normal routine, which included doing most of her weekly shopping at Walmart.

“Now I must visit at least four different stores in the area and other towns, often driving longer distances to find the best prices,” she said. “During the summer months and the Mexico/Latin America tariff announcement, Walmart and other stores in the area ran out of bananas for around two weeks. No one could get bananas in my area.”

As Moscow steps up its hybrid onslaught against the Baltic states, local Russian-speaking populations present a potential weak spot to exploit.

Russian is the mother tongue of roughly one-quarter and one-third of the populations of Estonia and Latvia, respectively, two small nations at NATO's eastern frontier.

Adopting a "wartime" mentality — fueled by the war in Ukraine and Russian aerial incursions — Tallinn and Riga increasingly see this minority as a potential risk, says Vendula Kazlauskas, an expert on the Baltic region at the Prague-based Association for International Affairs.

Seeking to curb Moscow's influence, Latvia and Estonia are phasing out the Russian language in education, tightening immigration rules, and targeting Russian-linked organizations.

These steps are driven both by security concerns and by the need for a "greater integration of the Russian-speaking minority," Kazlauskas explains.

After enjoying three decades of independence, the Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Following the end of World War II, while not recognized by the West, it remained in place until the 1990s.

The large Russian-speaking and ethnically Russian populations in the Baltic states are primarily the result of forced resettlement, immigration, and Russification policies implemented during the Soviet era.

Many Russian speakers in Latvia and Estonia remain stateless or hold Russian passports. Roughly 40,000 people in Latvia are Russian citizens, and over 80,000 in Estonia.

It's their own choice.

Those living in Latvia and Estonia can obtain a local passport and integrate if they pass the citizenship test, which narrows down to language proficiency and knowledge of the country's history.

Analysts say Russia has long been employing propaganda to target Russian speakers in the Baltics — some of whom have little knowledge of local languages — to sway public opinion and sow division.

"Russia persistently seeks to influence Estonia's Russian-speaking community," Igor Gretskiy, a researcher at the Tallinn-based International Center for Defense and Security (ICDS) think tank, told the Kyiv Independent.

"To that end, Russia weaponizes virtually every sphere of human activity: language, culture, sports, and so on."

Marek Kohv, a former Estonian defense official and a security expert at the ICDS, adds that Russia is using social media and online portals to promote narratives about the "decline of the West" and alleged oppression of Russian speakers.

These efforts only gained pace when Moscow launched its all-out aggression against Ukraine.

"After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we have seen a significant intensification of (Russian) influence activity in Estonia," Joosep Kaasik, the deputy secretary general for Internal Security at Estonia's Interior Ministry, told the Kyiv Independent.

In both Estonia and Latvia, attitudes toward the war in Ukraine vary notably between Russian-speaking and national-language communities.

Surveys showed that the Russian-speakers are less likely to blame Russia for the start of the war and are more skeptical about Ukraine's chances to liberate its territory than their compatriots.

Yet the Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltics are far from monolithic.

The 2025 yearbook by KAPO, Estonia's internal security agency, says that the Kremlin's support base in the country is primarily composed of older residents and is dissipating rapidly.

Reacting to this development, Russia "seeks to engage Estonia's Russian-speaking youth and draw them into its informational and value sphere," Kohv told the Kyiv Independent.

This propaganda campaign aligns with other hybrid operations, including cyberattacks, bomb threats, espionage, and vandalism, acts sometimes carried out by local Russians.

Recent weeks saw tensions surge in the region after three Russian fighter jets violated Estonian airspace on Sept. 19, just 10 days after Poland downed several Russian drones over its territory.

Russian drones have also "strayed" into the Lithuanian and Latvian airspace during past attacks on Ukraine.

As Western officials raise alarms about a possible open clash between Moscow and NATO in the coming years — a conflict where the Baltics would be at the front line — Riga and Tallinn try to ensure their entire populations are on their side.

After the all-out war in Ukraine broke out, both Latvia and Estonia took steps to better integrate their Russian-speaking minorities — a strategy that drew ire from Moscow.

The Latvian parliament amended its immigration laws in 2022 and again in 2024, mandating that Russian nationals living in the country pass a basic language test and undergo a security check.

Around 2,600 Russian citizens left the country in response, while 841 who failed to meet the requirements are facing deportation.

Estonia, in turn, barred non-EU citizens from voting in local elections, a move that primarily affected Russian citizens who did not have local passports.

Latvia passed a law on the separation of the Latvian Orthodox Church from the Russian Orthodox Church in 2022, while Estonia approved similar legislation three years later.

The two countries are also phasing out Russian as the language of instruction in education to improve national language skills.

"However, the steps taken by both countries are a double-edged sword," Kazlauskas says.

"While understandable given their internal situation, security concerns, and historical experience," Russian propaganda can use them to "justify the need to 'protect' oppressed Russian-speaking compatriots — potentially serving as a pretext for aggression."

Criticism came even from the West, as the Council of Europe chastised both countries over their new language laws.

But local authorities say firmly that these efforts are aimed at safeguarding national security and social cohesion.

"We cannot – and we should not – simply ignore the fact that our population (or part of it) is systematically targeted by propaganda and disinformation by the Russian regime," Estonia's Kaasik told the Kyiv Independent.

"For our small nation, countering this long-term threat is a question of self-preservation."

Donald Trump has shared an AI-generated video of himself as a fighter pilot wearing a crown and bombing protestors with a brown liquid.

A day after insisting on Fox News that he is “not a king”, the US president posted the video of himself in a fighter jet emblazoned with the phrase “King Trump” while millions of Americans marched in “No Kings” protests against his government's policies.

In the clip, which was posted on his Truth Social media platform and the official White House communications X account, Mr Trump wears a green military jumpsuit and a golden crown encrusted with jewels as he flies the jet over New York City.

With the song “Danger Zone” by Kenny Loggins blaring in the background, the jet bombs unsuspecting “No Kings” protesters marching through Times Square with what appears to be faeces.

More than seven million people across the US participated in “No Kings” protests on Saturday to demonstrate against what they saw as Mr Trump's growing authoritarianism.

Senior Republican figures, including Mike Johnson, the house speaker, have derided the peaceful protests as “hate America” rallies and accused demonstrators of being linked with Antifa.

Mr Trump also pushed back against being characterised as a king during an interview with Fox News on Friday.

“They say they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,” he said.

But that position appeared to change within 24 hours as he posted the “King Trump” video on social media.

JD Vance also posted an AI video depicting Mr Trump as a King on Saturday.

The video posted by the US vice-president showed Mr Trump donning a crown and cape before drawing a sword, with the camera then panning to a Kente cloth-clad Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats kneeling in submission.

The latter video was a reference to a widely mocked photo of Ms Pelosi and several dozen other Democrats wearing the traditional African textiles and taking the knee in tribute to George Floyd after he was killed by police in 2020.

The US president also referred to himself as a king in February, when he posted an AI-generated Time Magazine cover of himself wearing a crown, with the text, “long live the king”.

Protesters in hundreds of US cities marched against Mr Trump's broad expansion of presidential powers, including the deployment of the National Guard and ICE in Democrat-led cities.

Left-wing politicians, including Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker, delivered speeches and posted videos of themselves in attendance.

Despite fears of violence and multiple states mobilising Guard troops, organisers said the protests were largely peaceful.

Connor Weston, 27, reportedly declared himself a ‘non-offending pedophile' and threatened to kill himself

An Ohio man is facing criminal charges after he allegedly stormed a stage at a Wikipedia conference in New York City with a gun – as well as a sign declaring himself a “non-offending pedophile” – and threatened to kill himself.

Connor Weston, 27, was reportedly tackled by organizers of WikiConference North America 2025, thwarting tragedy, before police said officers booked him on counts of criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment.

The Dayton resident had evidently paid to attend the four-day conference when he disrupted its opening ceremony at 9am Friday in Manhattan's Civic Hall. He jumped on to a stage at the venue, pointed a gun at his head and the ceiling, and expressed a desire to take his life while a sign draped around his neck declared him to be an “anti-contact non-offending pedophile”, police and multiple media reports said.

According to the New York Times, conference safety team member Richard Knipel rushed the stage and clutched Weston from behind amid the chaos.

The Times wrote that another conference safety team member, Andrew Lih, soon went up to help Knipel.

“I grabbed his arm,” Lih told the outlet. “He was still clutching his gun pretty hard. I pried his fingers away from it, removed it from his hands and put it down.”

A police spokesperson said that officers took Weston into custody after receiving multiple 911 calls. There were no injuries reported.

The Times reported that conference attenders thanked Knipel by lavishing him with Barnstars, which are Wikipedia's official tokens of appreciation.

The chief of the non-profit group that runs Wikipedia, Maryana Iskander, reportedly told the crowd that Knipel and Lih “have been very busy”. “I thank them for saving my life,” she added.

Knipel works for City University of New York, tasked with making its research more publicly accessible while contributing to Wikipedia and sites that are related to the famed online encyclopedia curated in real time by volunteers. Cuny in March referred to Knipel on its website as its first “Wikemedian-in-residence”, saying his job is funded by philanthropic funding from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark.

Meanwhile, the Times described Lih as a digital strategist who works with museums and libraries.

Wikipedia canceled the rest of the conference's events Friday. The gathering resumed Saturday.

Friday was apparently not the first time Weston had publicly labeled himself an “anti contact, non offending pedophile”. A social media video circulated in July shows a man providing Weston's name, age and home town; applying that term to himself; and saying he can “choose not to harm minors … but can't choose to stop being attracted to them”.

The man in the clip matched the likeness of Weston as seen in a photo taken Friday while police put him in the back of a patrol car after his arrest. In both Friday's photo and the earlier video, he had the same “anti-contact non-offending pedophile” sign.

As NBC News noted, Johns Hopkins University defines non-offending pedophiles as “a unique population of individuals who experience sexual interest in children, but despite common misperceptions, have neither had sexual contact with a child nor have accessed illegal child sexual exploitation material”.

Wikipedia has a rule indefinitely blocking and banning from the platform any editors “who identify themselves as pedophiles”.

Two tear-stained years have weighed heavy on Jojo Rabia. Nearly every day since his two sons were killed by Hamas-led militants, he has come to a memorial built at the site of a desert music festival where hundreds died.

“Every day is like this. The same,” Mr. Rabia said this week, his face grim. 

But his expression changed when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump, who came to Israel last week as Hamas returned the final living hostages, who had been held captive for more than two years.

“Oh, he's the man,” Mr. Rabia said with a wide grin. 

“Look, he brought back all the hostages. It's unbelievable. If it was someone other than Trump, I'm not sure all of this would have happened.”

Mr. Trump has grown accustomed to flattery, the language employed by friends and foes alike as they seek to gain favours and avoid his wrath.

But perhaps nowhere else on earth is the U.S. President as universally adored as he is in Israel, where his recent success in negotiating the release of the hostages has won him the ability to shape the future of the country like few other presidents – and heroic status. 

At the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, he was lauded by Speaker Amir Ohana as “a giant of Jewish history,” a “colossus who will be enshrined in the pantheon of history. Thousands of years from now, the Jewish people will remember you,” he said, as Mr. Trump listened, nodding.

For many in Israel, this was a fitting description, not hyperbole. Mr. Trump's popularity has leapt across the deep political schisms that have riven Israeli society between those who favour Benjamin Netanyahu and those who have mounted street-filling protests against his agenda.

In Israel, Mr. Netanyahu is a mere politician. Mr. Trump is something else; a man who has shown that “when push comes to shove, he's going to be there,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.

The support of the U.S. has always been fundamental to the national interests of a Jewish state in a primarily Muslim region. A U.S. President who shows himself able to bring deliverance from hostile forces touches something existential, said Mr. Plesner.

“People feel it on a personal level.”

But Mr. Trump has also established an unusual relationship with Israelis. He and his envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff, lent an ear to those who suffered from the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. They personally engaged with families of hostages when those families complained that they struggled to communicate with their own leadership in Israel. 

“Trump, the most undemocratic leader in American history, provided a responsiveness to Israeli desires that its own government refused to do,” said Dahlia Scheindlin, a public opinion researcher and political advisor based in Israel.

Israelis have felt affection for other U.S. leaders before.

But the current love of Mr. Trump “gives him more leverage and influence in Israel than any U.S. president I've ever known. More even than Clinton, who was truly loved by centre and left, but not by right,” said John Lyndon, executive director of Alliance for Middle East Peace, an advocacy group. 

With that comes the ability to have an effect on the future of the Middle East, if Mr. Trump so chooses. The U.S. President has used language that suggests he alone will dictate what future course of action Israel chooses in Gaza. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” he said this week, when asked what would happen if Hamas refuses to disarm. 

“Here we are, basically handing over the reins over whether Israel can go to war or not to the American president,” said Ms. Scheindlin. “It's rather remarkable that Trump gets to decide. But that's the reality.”

Inside Gaza, local militias struggle to break free from Hamas rule

For Israel, one important question is how much Mr. Trump will continue to care. The release of the hostages was a dramatic moment. Seeking middle ground between Israelis and Palestinians, by contrast, is a problem that has resisted a satisfactory solution for many generations.

“The biggest parameter is what he wants, and whether he is willing to spend his political capital and attention on the issue,” Mr. Plesner said. “If he is, we can really witness a historic change in a positive way.”

If not, history holds numerous examples of other failed attempts. Yet for many Israelis, there is faith that Mr. Trump can do it. 

“I think the guy's a moron and in some respect, he might be,” said Ilan Cohen, a former Israeli official who now lives in the U.S. But, he said, “in view of what he did, I give a lot of respect to his skill.”

Benjamin Givon, a retired mechanical engineer who lives north of Tel Aviv, believes real change is possible if Mr. Trump keeps focus on the Middle East, although he worries about what will happen if the President turns to other issues.

“I know what will happen, which is that after a while, maybe two months, he will go on to the next thing. And we will have to stay here to solve the problem ourselves,” Mr. Givon said.

Still, he added, “we are lucky that the crazy guy is on our side.”

MOSCOW, October 19. /TASS/. The signing of an agreement between Moscow and Washington would be the best outcome of a meeting of Presidents of Russia and the United States, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Budapest, former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, now head of the G.O.R.K.I. Center at St. Petersburg State University, told TASS in an interview.

"In any case, bilateral relations will also be on the agenda. I think the ideal outcome for the Russian side would be the signing of a bilateral trade agreement and a comprehensive resumption of bilateral contacts, as has already been discussed in telephone conversations and meetings at all levels. This includes everything from the restoration of direct flights to sports and cultural contacts," she said.

She added that both sides have about "14 days to prepare the relevant documents. Perhaps there are already drafts that the parties have exchanged. 14 days is not much, but it's better than five, as it used to be."

On October 16, Putin and Trump had their eighth telephone talk since the beginning of the year. After the conversation, which lasted 2.5 hours, Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said that Moscow and Washington would immediately begin preparing a new meeting of the leaders, which could take place in Budapest. According to him, the Hungarian capital was proposed by the American leader, and the Russian president supported the idea. Later, Trump said that the meeting could take place within two weeks. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban ordered the creation of an organizing committee to prepare for the summit, specifying that this work "began on Thursday evening.".

BUENOS AIRES, October 19. /TASS/. Colombian President Gustavo Petro demanded an explanation from the United States after the US military struck a boat in the territorial waters of the South American republic.

"Representatives of the U.S. government have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in our territorial waters. Fisherman Alejandro Caranza had nothing to do with drug trafficking, his daily activity was fishing," he wrote on X.

The Colombian president also appealed to the country's Prosecutor General's office to immediately provide protection to the victims' relatives and consider their participation in international trials.

On October 18, US President Donald Trump said that the US military had destroyed a large drug submarine that was heading towards the United States.

Ukrainian soldier and chess grandmaster Ihor Kovalenko won the individual gold medal at the European Team Chess Championships, The Guardian reported on Oct. 17, citing tournament organizers.

Kovalenko, 36, had not competed in chess for three years while serving on the front lines. He returned to competitive playing just a month ago, and is currently ranked world No. 48.

His performance, 6.5 points out of 8, secured him the highest percentage score of the entire event and helped Ukraine win team gold in the open category and silver in the women's event.

Kovalenko achieved key victories, including one over Serbia's reigning European champion Aleksander Indjic, and held England's Gawain Jones to a draw in the final round.

According to a chess.com feature, Kovalenko serves as a radio operator in Ukraine's army, enduring frequent 12-hour shifts in trenches. 

For his service, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded him the order “For Courage” in 2023.

Soldiers should "stay where they stay," Zelensky said, and not offer new territory to Putin, who has reportedly demanded full control of Donetsk Oblast as a condition for ending the war. 

The survey further found that 66% of those polled are against paying citizens' benefits to Ukrainian war refugees.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on another Trump–Zelensky meeting in Washington, following Russian President Vladimir Putin's intervention to dissuade the U.S. from supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles.

Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine hand over full control of Donetsk Oblast to Russia as a condition for ending the war during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump this week, The Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials.

The attack took place at around 5:40 p.m. local time, hitting a residential neighborhood and damaging homes and outbuildings.

Vienna had previously held up the sanctions over a demand that the EU compensate Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International for losses inflicted by Russian penalties.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that the meeting had not gone as Zelensky had hoped. 

International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said "both sides engaged constructively" with the agency to enable the repair plan.

A Latin American citizen was fatally stabbed after a dispute in the western Ukrainian city of Ternopil, local police said. 






The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 136 drones launched by Russia overnight.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.—The U.S. State Department said Saturday that it has “credible reports” that the Hamas terrorist group could violate the cease-fire with an attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

If the attack takes place, it “would constitute a direct and grave violation” of the agreement forged by President Donald Trump to end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, the statement said.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of killing an innocent fisherman during what President Donald Trump described as a strike on a drug-smuggling vessel.

The US military has destroyed several boats in the Caribbean since September as part of Trump's campaign to eliminate “narcoterrorists” trafficking cocaine and fentanyl.

According to Petro, a Colombian “lifelong fisherman” was killed on September 16.

“US government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in our territorial waters. Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to drug traffickers and his daily activity was fishing,” Petro wrote on X on Saturday.

He added that the boat was drifting due to an engine failure and sent a distress signal. “We are waiting for an explanation from the US government,” he wrote.

Petro has a longstanding feud with Trump, who he accused of violating human rights during his crackdown on illegal immigrants. Last month, the US revoked Petro's visa after he called on US soldiers to disobey Trump's orders.

On Saturday, Trump said a Colombian national and an Ecuadorian national picked up from a “drug-carrying submarine” would be deported to their home countries “for detention and prosecution.” He said earlier that the US destroyed the vessel, killing two of the four “known narcoterrorists” on board.

Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine hand over full control of Donetsk Oblast to Russia as a condition for ending the war during a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump this week, The Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials.

According to the report, Putin indicated he was willing to give up parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for complete control over Donetsk.

Some White House officials described the proposal as “progress,” while a senior European diplomat cautioned that Ukraine would likely view the proposal in a very different light.

“It's like selling them their own leg in exchange for nothing,” the diplomat said.

Trump has not publicly addressed the Kremlin's demand but, following his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, urged both sides to “stop the killing and make a deal.”

This development marks a shift from Putin's earlier position in April, when he rejected a U.S. proposal to freeze hostilities along current front lines and instead insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

Putin and Trump are expected to continue discussions at a planned summit in Hungary, which is set to take place in the coming weeks.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Oct. 17 that he had spoken with Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, adding that preparations for the U.S.—Russia summit are ongoing.

TEL AVIV, October 19. /TASS/. With the mediation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Israeli military in the Gaza strip has received two more coffins with remains of hostages who died in the enclave, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

According to the statement, the coffins will be delivered to the Israeli territory for identification.

"The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned," the premier's office said.

On the morning of October 13 this year, radicals from the Palestinian movement Hamas, in accordance with the peace settlement agreements in Gaza, released 20 Israeli hostages who had remained in the enclave after two years. Later that evening, through the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Israeli side received the first four coffins with the remains of the deceased abductees. Israeli authorities immediately expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that only four bodies out of 28 were returned in the first phase. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called this a deviation from the agreement and warned that further delays by the radicals would have consequences. On October 14, four more coffins were handed over to Israel.

Netanyahu announced on October 18 that the Rafah crossing on the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will remain closed "until further notice," with the issue of its reopening to be considered after Hamas implements the terms of the agreement on the return of the remains of deceased hostages,.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a major gas processing plant in southern Russia, sparking a fire and forcing it to suspend its intake of gas from Kazakhstan, Russian and Kazakh authorities said Sunday. 

U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that Kyiv may have to give up territory in exchange for an end to Moscow's more than 3 1/2-year invasion, in the latest of apparent reversals on how to pursue peace. 

The Orenburg plant, run by state-owned gas giant Gazprom and located in a region of the same name near the Kazakh border, is part of a production and processing complex that is one of the world's largest facilities of its kind, with an annual capacity of 45 billion cubic meters. It handles gas condensate from Kazakhstan's Karachaganak field, alongside Orenburg's own oil and gas fields.

According to regional Gov. Yevgeny Solntsev, the drone strikes set fire to a workshop at the plant and damaged part of it. The Kazakh Energy Ministry on Sunday said, citing a notification from Gazprom, that the plant was temporarily unable to process gas originating in Kazakhstan, “due to an emergency situation following a drone attack.” 

Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement Sunday that a “large-scale fire” erupted at the Orenburg plant, and that one of its gas processing and purification units was damaged. 

Kyiv has ramped up attacks in recent months on Russian energy facilities it says both fund and directly fuel Moscow's war effort.




Meanwhile, Ukrainian prosecutors claim that Moscow is modifying its deadly aerial-guided bombs to strike civilians deeper in Ukraine. Local authorities in Kharkiv said Russia struck a residential neighborhood using a new rocket-powered aerial bomb for the first time.

Kharkiv's regional prosecutor's office said in a statement that Russia used the weapon called the UMPB-5R, which can travel up to 130 kilometers (80 miles), in an attack on the city of Lozava on Saturday afternoon. The city lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of Kharkiv, a considerable distance for the weapon to fly. 

Russia continued to strike other parts of Ukraine closer to the front line. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, at least 11 people were injured after Russian drones hit the Shakhtarske area. At least 14 five-story buildings and a store were damaged, said acting regional Gov. Vladyslav Haivanenko.

Ukraine's General Staff also claimed a separate drone strike hit Russia's Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery, in the Samara region near Orenburg, sparking a blaze and damaging its main refining units. 

The Novokuibyshevsk facility, operated by Russian gas major Rosneft, has an annual capacity of 4.9 million tons, and turns out over 20 kinds of oil-based products. Russian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the Ukrainian claim or discuss any damage. 

Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement early Sunday that its air defense forces had shot down 45 Ukrainian drones during the night, including 12 over the Samara region, one over the Orenburg region and 11 over the Saratov region neighboring Samara. 

In turn, Ukraine's air force reported Sunday that Russia during the night launched 62 drones into Ukrainian territory. It said 40 of these were shot down, or veered off course due to electronic jamming. 

Trump appeared to edge back in the direction of pressing Ukraine to give up on retaking land it has lost to Russia, in exchange for an end to Moscow's aggression. 

Asked in a Fox News interview conducted Thursday whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be open to ending the war “without taking significant property from Ukraine,” Trump responded: “Well, he's going to take something.”

“They fought and he has a lot of property. He's won certain property,” Trump said. “We're the only nation that goes in, wins a war and then leaves.”

The interview was aired on Sunday on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” but was conducted before Trump spoke to Putin and Zelenskyy last week. 

The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by the U.S. leader. In recent weeks, Trump had shown growing impatience with Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war.

In Thursday's interview, he was noncommittal about sending Tomahawk missiles requested by Ukraine, saying “I'm looking at it” but expressing concern about depleting U.S. weapons stocks.

“We need them for ourselves too,” Trump said. “We can't give all our weapons to Ukraine. We just can't do that.”

Russians and Ukrainians interviewed by The Associated Press last week voiced hopes for progress at an upcoming summit between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary, but said they anticipated no major breakthrough. 

The two leaders agreed in a phone call Thursday to meet in the coming weeks, according to Trump, who also sat down with Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday. 

Contrary to Kyiv's hopes, Trump did not commit to providing it with Tomahawks following that meeting. The missiles would be the longest-range weapons in Ukraine's arsenal and would allow it to strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow, with precision.

Deliveries of Tomahawks could provide leverage to help push the Kremlin into negotiations, analysts say, after Trump expressed frustration over Putin's refusal to budge on key aspects of a possible peace deal.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country's leader “does nothing to stop” drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America. 

In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as “an illegal drug dealer” who is “low rated and very unpopular.” He warned that Petro “better close up” drug operations “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.” Colombia's defense minister, Pedro Sánchez, defending Petro and the nation's drug-fighting commitment, said, “If there's a country that has used all its capabilities and also lost men and women fighting drug trafficking ... it's Colombia.”

Trump, while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, wrote on his Truth Social platform that Petro is “strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields” across Colombia, which the Republican president initially misspelled as Columbia before deleting his post and replacing it the correct spelling of the country. “Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,” Trump said.

“AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA,” Trump said. He also said Petro had “a fresh mouth toward America.”

Hours later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. strike in the waters off South America, this time against a vessel he said was associated with a Colombian rebel group — the National Liberation Army, or ELN — and was carrying “substantial amounts of narcotics,” but did not say how that was known to U.S. intelligence agencies. He said on social media that three men aboard were killed in the Friday attack. A brief video clip he attached showed a boat in flames after an explosion. The State Department designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.




Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after a U.S. strike Thursday in Caribbean waters. The U.S. said on Saturday it was repatriating to Colombia and Ecuador two survivors from that attack, the sixth since early September. With Hegseth's announcement, at least 32 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers.

There was no immediate reaction from the ELN, with which Petro suspended peace talks in January after a violent incursion on the border with Venezuela. The group has denied involvement in drug trafficking, but Colombian authorities regularly report the dismantling of cocaine laboratories and the seizure of drugs believed to belong to the guerrillas.

In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia is the world's largest exporter of cocaine, and the cultivation of the critical ingredient of coca leaves reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations. 

More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro's visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump's commands. “I ask all the soldiers of the United States' army, don't point your rifles against humanity” and “disobey the orders of Trump,” Petro said.

Petro said a Colombian man was killed in a Sept. 16 strike and identified him as Alejandro Carranza, a fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He said that Carranza has no ties to drug trafficking and that his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit.

“U.S. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” Petro wrote on X. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. We await explanations from the US government.”

Petro said that he has alerted the attorney general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing.

“The United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bolívar's homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,” Petro wrote.

Meanwhile, Noticias Caracol, a Colombian news program, reported that the man injured in the most recent strike was hospitalized after he was repatriated and remains in serious condition. 

It quoted Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti as saying that the Colombian “will be prosecuted, he will be received — forgive the harsh expression — as a criminal, because so far what is known is that he was carrying a boat full of cocaine, which in our country is a crime, and despite the fact that it was in international waters, his repatriation will be as if he were being prosecuted in the United States.”

Petro said the man had been aboard a “narco submarine.”

Ecuador's Ministry of the Interior confirmed in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Sunday that the U.S. had repatriated an Ecuadorian man injured in the most recent strike. Officials identified him as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila and said a doctor found him to be in good health.

The ministry noted that two prosecutors met with Tufiño Chila and determined he had not committed any crimes within the country's borders and that there was no evidence to the contrary.

            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US conducted a strike Friday on a ship that American intelligence officials believed was involved in illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean.
    


            Hegseth wrote in a post on X that the vessel was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization and had “substantial amounts of narcotics” on board. He said the three men on the ship were all killed and no US forces were harmed.
    


            This is the seventh known strike in a series of recent attacks by the US military on vessels that the Trump administration says are involved in drug trafficking. It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board.
    


            “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”
    


            The strikes are a part of the Trump administration's hardening stance against South American countries involved in smuggling illicit drugs into the US. The president recently authorized the CIA to operate in Venezuela and has been weighing military action inside of the country as part of a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro.
    


            Trump has also clashed publicly with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the US last week of murdering an innocent Colombian national during one of its Caribbean ship strikes. Trump announced Sunday he would be canceling all US payments and subsidies to the country.

            This is the seventh known strike in a series of recent attacks by the US military on vessels that the Trump administration says are involved in drug trafficking. It comes days after another strike on an alleged drug boat that CNN reported appeared to be the first time an attack did not kill everyone on board. President Donald Trump said Saturday the survivors of that strike were released to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia.
    


            “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote Sunday. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”

            Petro responded on X, calling Trump “ignorant” and denying his involvement in illegal drug trade.
    


            The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported. The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it appears to give grounds for the president designating drug traffickers as enemy combatants and having them summarily killed without legal review.
    


            Historically, people involved in drug trafficking have been considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.
    


            The Senate blocked a push earlier this month to limit Trump's ability to command the military to strike alleged drug boats without congressional authorization.
    


            Sens. Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski were the only Republican lawmakers to cross party lines and support the resolution.
    


            “We basically are summarily executing people who are accused of something. It's a terrible idea,” Paul, who joined with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine to force a vote on reining in Trump's war powers, told CNN on Thursday.

            Disgraced former Rep. George Santos, fresh off his release from prison after President Donald Trump commuted his sentence on Friday night, dismissed his critics, telling CNN he's focused on the future after eating a “very large slice of humble pie” during his time behind bars.
    


            Santos, who had been serving a seven-year term for the fraud charges that got him ousted from Congress, said he had just been released from solitary confinement when his fellow inmates saw news of the commutation on television and told him.
    


            “I had no expectations,” the New York Republican told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.
    


            Some Republicans from New York weren't happy with the president's decision. Rep. Nick LaLota posted on social media that Santos “didn't merely lie — he stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”
    


            LaLota added that Santos should “devote the rest of his life to demonstrating remorse and making restitution to those he wronged.”
    


            Rep. Andrew Garbarino, in a statement to the Washington Times, said Santos “has shown no remorse. The less than three months that he spent in prison is not justice.”
    


            Santos said on Sunday his former colleagues are “entitled to their opinion.”
    


            “People are going to hate me. It doesn't matter whoever gets clemency in the future, whoever that person might be. I'm pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that's just the reality of our country.”
    


            He claimed he had received a “a seven-year disproportionate sentence that is anything but political if you talk to anybody who really looks at these kinds of cases.”
    


            Santos is no longer required to pay any further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions, according to a copy of his clemency grant which was posted on social media by US Pardon Attorney Ed Martin.
    


            Asked whether he will pay his donors back, Santos said Sunday he will “do my best to do whatever the law requires of me.”
    


            “The investment was made to win a race. I won that race,” Santos said. “There was no fraud there.”
    


            He said he is now “going to look to the future,” apologizing to the American people and people in his former district, saying he was in a “chaotic ball of flames” at the time he committed his crimes.
    


            Santos said his experience in prison, especially in solitary confinement, has inspired him to focus on helping with prison reform efforts, something he had spoken with the president about.
    


            “It's actually creating recidivism because it's not doing what it's supposed to do,” Santos said of the prison system. “I told this to the president, that I'd love to be involved with prison reform, and not in a partisan way.”
    


            Santos said he did not see himself returning to politics in the next 10 years.
    


            “I'm 37 years old. I can tell you this, not that I can see if in the next decade. … I'm all politicked out,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans are growing increasingly concerned about their ability to find a good job under President Donald Trump, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll finds, in what is a potential warning sign for Republicans as a promised economic boom has given way to hiring freezes and elevated inflation.

High prices for groceries, housing and health care persist as a fear for many households, while rising electricity bills and the cost of gas at the pump are also sources of anxiety, according to the survey.

Some 47% of U.S. adults are “not very” or “not at all confident” they could find a good job if they wanted to, an increase from 37% when the question was last asked in October 2023.

Electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults at a time when the expected build-out of data centers for artificial intelligence could further tax the power grid. Just more than one-half said the cost of groceries are a “major” source of financial stress, about 4 in 10 said the cost of housing and health care were a serious strain and about one-third said they were feeling high stress about gasoline prices.

The survey suggests an ongoing vulnerability for Trump, who returned to the White House in January with claims he could quickly tame the inflation that surged after the pandemic during Democratic President Joe Biden's term. Instead, Trump's popularity on the economy has remained low amid a mix of tariffs, federal worker layoffs and partisan sniping that has culminated in a government shutdown.

Linda Weavil, 76, voted for Trump last year because he “seems like a smart businessman.” But she said in an interview that the Republican's tariffs have worsened inflation, citing the chocolate-covered pecans sold for her church group fundraiser that now cost more.

“I think he's doing a great job on a lot of things, but I'm afraid our coffee and chocolate prices have gone up because of tariffs,” the retiree from Greensboro, North Carolina, said. “That's a kick in the back of the American people.”

The poll found that 36% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy, a figure that has held steady this year after he imposed tariffs that caused broad economic uncertainty. Among Republicans, 71% feel positive about his economic leadership. Yet that approval within Trump's own party is relatively low in ways that could be problematic for Republicans in next month's races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, and perhaps even in the 2026 midterm elections.

At roughly the same point in Biden's term, in October 2021, an AP-NORC poll found that 41% of U.S. adults approved of how he was handling the economy, including about 73% of Democrats. That overall number was a little higher than Trump's, primarily because of independents — 29% approved of how Biden was handling the economy, compared with the 18% who currently support Trump's approach.

The job market was meaningfully stronger in terms of hiring during Biden's presidency as the United States was recovering from pandemic-related lockdowns. But hiring has slowed sharply under Trump with monthly job gains averaging less than 27,000 after the April tariff announcements.

People see that difference. 

Four years ago, 36% of those in the survey were “extremely” or “very” confident in their ability to get a good job, but that has fallen to 21% now.

Biden's approval on the economy steadily deteriorated through the middle of 2022 when inflation hit a four-decade high, creating an opening for Trump's political comeback.

In some ways, Trump has made the inflation problems harder by choosing to cancel funding for renewable energy projects and imposing tariffs on the equipment needed for factories and power plants. Those added costs are coming before the anticipated construction of data centers for AI that could further push up prices without more construction.

Even though 36% see electricity as a major concern, there are some who have yet to feel a serious financial squeeze. In the survey, 40% identified electricity costs as a “minor” stress, while 23% said their utility bills are “not a source” of stress.

Kevin Halsey, 58, of Normal, Illinois, said his monthly electricity bills used to be $90 during the summer because he had solar panels, but have since jumped to $300. Halsey, who works in telecommunications, voted Democratic in last year's presidential election and described the economy right now as “crap.”

“I've got to be pessimistic,” he said. “I don't see this as getting better.”

At a fundamental level, Trump finds himself in the same economic dilemma that bedeviled Biden. There are signs the economy remains relatively solid with a low unemployment rate, stock market gains and decent economic growth, yet the public continues to be skeptical about the economy's health.

Some 68% of U.S. adults describe the U.S. economy these days as “poor,” while 32% say it's “good.” That's largely consistent with assessments of the economy over the past year.

In addition, 59%, say their family finances are “holding steady.” But only 12% say they're “getting ahead,” and 28% say they are “falling behind.”

The sense of economic precarity is coming from many different directions, with indications that many think middle-class stability is falling out of reach.

The vast majority of U.S. adults feel at least “minor” stress about the cost of groceries, health care, housing, the amount they pay in taxes, what they are paid at work and the cost of gas for their cars. 

In the survey, 47%, say they are “not very” or “not at all” confident they could pay an unexpected medical expense while 52% have low confidence they will have enough saved for their retirement. Also, 63%, are “not very” or “not at all” confident they could buy a new home if they wanted to.

Young adults are much less confident about their ability to buy a house, though confidence is not especially high across the board. About 8 in 10 U.S. adults under age 30 say they are “not very confident” or “not at all confident” they would be able to buy a house, compared with about 6 in 10 adults 60 and older.

For 54% of U.S. adults, the cost of groceries is a “major source” of stress in their life right now. 

Unique Hopkins, 36, of Youngstown, Ohio, said she is now working two jobs after her teenage daughter had a baby, leaving Hopkins with a sense that she can barely tread water as part of the “working poor.” She voted for Trump in 2016, only to switch to Democrats after she felt his ego kept him from uniting the country and solving problems.

“It's his way or no way,” she said. “Nobody is going to unite with Trump if it's all about you, you, you.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted Oct. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

            The San Jose Sharks have apologized after an apparent offensive message seeming to praise Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was displayed on the arena's scoreboard during the team's Hispanic heritage celebration on Saturday night against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
    


            Video shared with CNN showed the scoreboard displaying: “SJ SHARKS FANS LOVE ICE !! GET ‘EM BOYZ !” Some fans at SAP Center in San Jose, California,﻿ can be heard booing in response.
    


            Sharks fan Jessica Clark told CNN she and her group were “appalled” by the message. “They're my favorite team — I even have tattoos — but this was something that should've been caught,” she said.
    


            In a statement posted on X later, the NHL team said: “During the first intermission of tonight's game, an offensively worded message which had been externally submitted was inadvertently displayed on the in-arena scoreboard.”
    


            Sharks Sports & Entertainment said the message did not reflect the organization's values and had not been detected during its standard review process. The team expressed deep regret and said it is investigating the origin of the message.
    


            The incident occurred during “Los Tiburones Night,” the Sharks' ninth annual celebration of “the team's commitment to the Bay Area's vibrant Hispanic community,” according to the club's website.
    


            The Sharks would go on to lose to the Penguins 3-0.

Actor John Cusack attended a "No Kings" protest in Chicago on Saturday, telling CNN he was frustrated by ICE operations in the City.

Actor John Cusack sent a message to President Donald Trump during a "No Kings" protest in Chicago on Saturday during an interview with CNN, telling the president to "go to hell."

"What's interesting is that he doesn't understand that all the labor rights around the world came from this town, this place," Cusack told CNN. "So if he thinks this place is going to be a fascist hub — no chance."

"Go to hell," he said, saying that was the message from Chicago when prompted by a reporter.

"No Kings" demonstrations broke out across the country on Saturday to protest the Trump administration. 

Cusack, an outspoken progressive, told CNN that the country was founded on "no kings."

REPUBLICANS TORCH ANTI-TRUMP 'NO KINGS' PROTESTS, SAY DEMS FEAR ANGERING LEFTISTS IN SHUTDOWN FIGHT

"Everyone knows the score, right? The authoritarians divide and conquer, and they create an ‘other,' and then they pick on it, pick on the person, harass them, jail them, and that's all used as a direction so they can steal as much as they can [and] maintain power," Cusack said. "We all know history. So, that's what he's doing, and we have masked goons roaming the streets, hiding their faces, abducting people."

The "No Kings" protests first mobilized back in February on President's Day to denounce the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and cuts to the federal government. 

The movement gained national prominence in June, when Trump held a military parade honoring the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, which also fell on his 79th birthday.

Ann Marie Lawrence, a Maryland mother and women's weight-loss coach, shares her quick-and-easy recipe for a one-pot Philly cheesesteak pasta dish that contains 32 grams of protein.

Diners already concerned about the cost of eating out may be disappointed to learn that many restaurants are considering raising prices to keep up with inflated food and drink costs.

Restaurant management software company Toast recently released its 2025 Voice of the Restaurant Industry Survey, revealing that improving profitability was the top concern for operators headed into next year.

Operators ranked inflation (20%), marketing (16%) and hiring (16%) as their top three business pain points.

Nearly half of all 712 restaurant decision-makers surveyed (48%) said they plan to increase menu prices if inflation continues to be a factor.

The National Restaurant Association estimates that, to maintain a 5% profit margin, the average restaurant needs to raise prices by 31%, according to data compiled by the D.C.-based industry trade group earlier this year.

"Raising menu prices is typically a last resort for restaurant operators, but with the rising costs of food and labor, their operating math still has to work," Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Restaurant Association, told Fox News Digital.

Small business owners like Michael Brafman, who operates The Sandwich Board in New York City, are concerned about it.

VEGAS TIPPING DROPS DRASTICALLY AS VISITORS SAY SERVICE DOESN'T MATCH HIGHER COSTS

"The basic math is whatever product you have, you divide it by .3, and that's what the product should cost to the consumer to operate at that healthy margin," Brafman told Fox News Digital. "If the prices continue to increase, there's only [so much] that the consumer will be willing to pay."

The sandwich shop owner said he wrestled with this issue during the egg crisis.

"I held out a long time to raise the [price] of our egg sandwiches," Brafman said.

Menu prices that are too high can scare off customers — which is a concern for restaurant operators. (iStock)

He added, "You can only get away with charging so much for an egg sandwich. . . . Nobody's spending $17 on an egg sandwich just so you can keep your margins."

He tacked on an extra dollar, he said, "which was very marginal, but people were concerned."

Increasing menu prices can be an added challenge when the business is new.

"Nobody's spending $17 on an egg sandwich just so you can keep your margins," a New York City restaurant owner told Fox News Digital. (iStock)

"It's always a tenuous line to walk," Brafman said. "It is a game of chicken."

Since opening The Sandwich Board last year, Brafman said he's seen a spike in the cost of proteins.

"Proteins are increasing exponentially — eggs, dairy, meat, poultry, all of the core parts of the sandwich," he said. "When a steak per pound goes from $7 to $11, that's an unrealistic price increase."

Passing that off to customers could spell bad news for cost-conscious diners.

"I have people [who] come here repeatedly per week, and that's the fear," said Brafman. "How many times will they stop coming because the cost is prohibitive?"

John Loeffler, innkeeper and chef at The Inn at Gristmill Square and Waterwheel Restaurant in Virginia, said he's been watching similar trends play out, just at a different price tier.

"Beef is always a huge, huge seller for us. It is one of our more popular items," Loeffler told Fox News Digital. 

In June, a whole loin of certified Angus ribeye cost $14.75 a pound, he said. Today, it's $17.99.

As costs climb, keeping guests happy becomes about more than the food alone, Loeffler said.

"How do you make money, sell people something that they feel good about and feel a value, even at a higher price point?" he said. "I think that's the challenge facing all restaurants — adding value as menu prices go up."

John Loeffler, chef at The Inn at Gristmill Square's Waterwheel Restaurant in Virginia (shown at left), told Fox News Digital the rising cost of beef has forced him to consider other ways to provide value to his customers.

After 30 years in the business, Loeffler said he's learned to think differently about profit.

"I think about margins less than percentages," he said.

His approach often means absorbing part of the cost to preserve the dining experience.

"At the end of the day, we're in the business of taking care of people, nourishing them, making them feel good … and making them feel good about spending money. That's our job."

Maye Musk, mother of Elon Musk, details why she left the Democratic Party and responds to criticism against her son, on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

FIRST ON FOX: A Trump-aligned political consulting firm set out to investigate the ideological swing of affluent, college-educated white women who were once considered moderate, but have since moved farther to the left, uncovering what researchers describe as a new voting bloc of left-wing women: "Resistance Grandmas."

"We are so knowledgeable about everything," one woman said in a Northern Virginia focus group video reviewed by Fox News Digital, referring to herself and the other women who joined the session while slamming President Donald Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill." "When [Trump voters] start being personally impacted, that's when I'm hopeful that a little bit of something is gonna change."

"It's gonna be a catastrophe," another woman chimed in, as another middle-aged woman added, "However, they will find a way to blame Democrats."

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a report conducted by the National Public Affairs (NPA), the polling arm of Trump campaign-aligned American Made Media Company, in September, as well as the full two-hour focus group session in northern Virginia that showcased the beliefs of 10 white, liberal, middle-aged, college-educated, upper–middle-class suburban women.

SQUAD 2.0: MEET AMERICA'S NEXT WAVE OF RADICAL DEMOCRATS SHAPING THE PARTY'S FUTURE

The women who participated in the focus group were not informed it was conducted by a Trump-aligned polling firm, they were only told that they were brought in to discuss political topics for a focus group commissioned by another research firm. The researcher leading the focus group told the women at the start of the meeting that she had "no stake" in their comments "one way or the other," and that the women "could say whatever comes to mind."

"Pretty much anything is fair game," the focus group leader told the women. 

Fox News Digital is not publishing footage of the video or names of the women but reviewed extensive footage of the session for the purposes of this article. 

The focus group was conducted to study how affluent middle-aged and older white women have increasingly shifted to the political left in recent years, and was sparked by a racist sign displayed outside a Northern Virginia school board meeting in August targeting Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears. 

"In the year since President Trump's historic victory, commentators have obsessed over what they call the radicalization of young white men. But a quieter, just as revealing transformation has swept another group once known for moderation and civility: older, affluent white women. This change came into sharp focus last August in Arlington, Virginia," NPA's report outlines. 

The Virginia gubernatorial cycle is at a fever pitch, with the election just over two weeks away pitting ex-CIA agent and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger against Republican Earle-Sears. In August, a white woman was spotted holding a Jim Crow-era-reminiscent sign targeting Earle-Sears, who is Black, when the candidate attended a school board meeting. 

"Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then blacks can't share my water fountain," the sign read, igniting outrage from conservatives and others who called it racist.

The women in the focus group overwhelmingly characterized the sign as written in poor taste, describing its words as "ugly," but also justified it by arguing Republicans have "already taken it too far with their trans bans." Another woman used the N-word while comparing the sign to those of the segregated Jim Crow era of the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries in the American South. 

"What's the best analogy for a trans person not being able to use a particular bathroom in our recent modern history?" one participant asked the group. 

Another woman chimed in: "You used to have hotels that said 'No n----rs, no Jews, no dogs at these hotels. Is that… I don't know if that's the same thing."

"Like, I don't think I would feel uncomfortable, and I definitely wouldn't hold up that sign," the first woman said in response. "But this person, I think, was just trying to find an appropriate analogy."

The NPA report explained that polling data since the 2012 election, which pitted former Democrat President Barack Obama against Republican Mitt Romney, showed that "voting patterns among white voters and women haven't moved much in a decade."

The shift to the left, the report argued, is not due to gender or race, but rather income and education. 

"In 2012, college graduates leaned Republican, 51-47, while postgraduates favored Democrats 55-42. By 2024, that pattern had flipped and widened: Harris won college grads 53-45 and postgrads 59-38. Non-college voters went the other way. High-school grads and those with some college, once evenly split, gave Trump a 56-43 lead," the report found. 

"Income followed suit. Voters earning under $50,000, once a 60-38 Obama bloc, shifted to a 50-48 Trump edge. Those earning over $100,000 flipped from a 54-44 Romney majority to a 51-47 Harris win," it continued. 

The report took issue with the media asking and diving into explanations on "what ‘broke' young white men" to move farther to the right and help re-elect Trump in 2024, but argued the question should instead be: "What radicalized rich white women, and whether they even realize it."

The women in the focus group overwhelmingly presented themselves as arbiters of knowledge, reporting that they have the "luxury" of reading news articles from different outlets, while other voters are more concerned about costs of living and putting food on the table. 

DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING A CRITICAL MISTAKE — AND VOTERS ARE LETTING THEM KNOW

One woman in the group recounted that her cousin living in a Heartland state was a lifelong Democrat who announced ahead of the 2024 election that he was leaning towards voting for Trump, which the woman said made her nearly fall "off my chair." 

The cousin, a male farmer, reported to her that the Biden administration had not helped U.S. farmers. 

"He doesn't know. He's not paying attention to China's not buying wheat or soybeans," the female voter said. "He's just concerned about his daily life and making enough money to support his family. And so I don't think they're paying attention."

"I think a lot of times people are just very focused on … how it impacts them on that day and not reading The Washington Post or The New York Times or other things that we all have access to and, you know, have the luxury of doing," she added.

Another woman reported to the group that she had turned in her longtime friend after she found out she had breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The FBI launched a tip line shortly after Jan. 6, 2021, where people could report those who were "instigating violence in Washington, D.C." 

"She said, ‘We were just walking around,'" the woman in the focus group recounted of the conversation with her friend about Jan. 6. "And I know she slipped. I know she didn't mean to tell me she was in the Capitol."

"And I said, 'It wasn't a f---ing open house. You weren't, you weren't buying the Capitol,'" she continued, as other women in the group remarked, "Wow" and "Good for you."

The woman said she has not spoken to her former friend since, and submitted a tip to authorities that she was in the Capitol the day of the protests. 

"And then I had that whole inner turmoil of, ‘Do I go on that website and say I think that she would' …. I went back and forth on that for probably two weeks and asked some people. And finally, I just went on and said 'she was there, and I don't know what role she had, what it was,'" she said. "She was in that building by her own admission."

"As the session ended, they voiced a small hope that the country might still find a way back to calm and common purpose. Whether that hope can survive a culture built on outrage is uncertain. But their conversation left one clear lesson Beneath polls and party lines, the real contest for the nation's future is over how Americans think, speak, and live with one another," the report concluded. 

The women in the group called on the Democrat Party to find cohesion and to disseminate their message to party leaders across the country in order to win upcoming elections. 

"Democrats need to stop primarying for the lesser Republican. So what's happening is … Democrats are voting between two Republican primary candidates, and they're voting for the idiot, crazy, right-wing guy so that they don't have to compete against this actual intelligent person. And that's where we're getting these nutcases," one woman said. 

Another woman said the DNC should combat everything Trump says, including when the president pinned blame on radical liberal violence for the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September.

"I think it comes from the DNC. I think they need to organize. I think they need a cohesive message. I think they need to be vocal every time Trump says something, even about Charlie Kirk. Yes. No one should be killed for what they believe in. A hundred percent. But they are turning him into a martyr," one woman said.

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            There's a remarkable new report from the CNN Investigates team about crypto ATMs, devices that may be at your corner store and which allow people to exchange money for cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin.

Crypto crime scene: How the companies behind crypto ATMs profit as Americans lose millions to scams



            I was struck by the detail that CNN documented at least a dozen potential fraud cases tied to a single ATM. That's an indication not just that one ATM has a problem, but that these cases of fraud are rampant in the US.
    


            Shame at being duped may keep many people from reporting that they've fallen victim to fraud, and when they do, authorities are frequently at a loss to help. But now, by using crypto ATMS — there's probably one near your house — scammers have changed the way things work. And companies that operate the machines are profiting from it.
    


            The companies behind these crypto ATMs strongly disputed allegations that they profit from scams and listed various efforts to protect consumers. There's more about all of that in the story.
    


            I talked to three of the CNN reporters who worked on the investigation, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Curt Devine, and Majlie de Puy Kamp. They answered my questions by email. Our conversation is below:
    


What made you realize these crypto ATMS were a story? Was it something specific?



            We previously wrote about state attorneys general attending lavish foreign trips paid for by the industries they oversee, including a luxury trip to Rome earlier this year. Our colleagues traveled to Italy to document the trip and noticed someone stand out among the attendees. This person appeared younger than other attendees and was not a recognizable official or lobbyist. This turned out to be Ben Weiss, the CEO of CoinFlip, a crypto ATM company that had been sued by the state of Iowa for allegedly profiting from scams (which the company disputes). We didn't know much about crypto ATM companies at the time, but we realized this was an industry that was both gaining influence among government officials and coming under scrutiny.
    


These scams seem to go by a script where the victim is intimidated by a threatening phone call and an urgent demand for money. What have the crypto ATMs changed?



            Crypto ATMs have made it easier to quickly send large volumes of currency to places out of reach of US law enforcement. Rather than sending victims to buy a bunch of gift cards for $500 each, for example, scammers can send them to one machine to deposit thousands of dollars at one time and then funnel the currency overseas.
    


            Scammers also prey on the average person's lack of knowledge about the machines themselves. From our experience reporting this story, many people aren't familiar with crypto ATMs or how they work. Scammers tend to exploit this, especially when they are pretending to be law enforcement or government officials. They send often elderly victims to these machines under the assumption that the crypto ATM is a legitimate way to pay off (made up!) fines, fees, or debts to companies or the government. In one incident, a scammer referenced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Donald Trump established to make a victim more comfortable with stuffing cash into ones of these machines.
    


So many people — including me — have gotten these phishing calls from people who have personal information about you. They're scary. Many people probably figure out it's a scam before handing over money. How often are the calls successful?



            That is difficult to answer, but given how prevalent these scam texts are, we have to assume they are lucrative for criminals. The FBI told us Americans lost around $240 million to crypto ATM scams in the first half of this year. What's interesting is that we've seen people from all walks of life fall for these scams, including doctors and CEOs.
    


            It's easy to blame the scam victim for falling for the ruse, but the fact of the matter is, if the scam is targeted right, you will probably fall for it too. And these days there is so much information on people available online that it doesn't take much for a scam to be targeted enough to be believable.
    


Is there evidence that there is an organized effort behind these? What do we know about the people doing the targeting?



            In most local cases we reviewed, the scammer's identity remains a mystery. But in some cases, specific people have been charged — like a citizen of India indicted last year, who prosecutors called “a high-level member of a sophisticated, organized, transnational fraud ring.” That case remains pending and much of it is sealed. Some Americans have also been charged. We also know there are scam compounds in places like Myanmar, where thousands of people are held against their will and forced to work for low wages to carry out financial scams that target Americans. So it's certainly possible that some of the scammers who try to push people in the US to transfer them cash through crypto ATMs are themselves victims of crimes.
    


You tied multiple scams to a single ATM. How long did that process take? Is there a way for people to figure out if ATMs near them have been used in scams?



            We requested records from police departments, the Federal Trade Commission and state offices across the country and went through each incident report to log the details in a spreadsheet. It took us about four months to receive the records and log more than 700 cases. It was in that process of manually reading through every report that we started to notice recurring addresses for the same location or store. Once we put everything together, the spreadsheet became a trove of information allowing us to see how much money people had lost, what sort of scam had targeted them and which ATMs they used.
    


            It would be time-consuming to replicate that process, and the point is not whether a particular crypto ATM has been repeatedly used by scammers. The point is that these scams are now rampant, so if someone says you need to deposit money into one of these machines to pay a fine or avoid a penalty, that's almost certainly a scam.
    


The crypto ATM owners say most of the transactions are legitimate. Is there any data to back up that claim?



            That is a great question, with a bit of a convoluted answer. Some of the companies have pointed to a report by the analytics group TRM Labs, which found that 1.2% of cash-to-crypto transactions were illicit in 2023. That's a relatively small figure.
    


            But some law enforcement investigations that have obtained data from particular crypto ATM companies and interviewed customers have alleged scams account for much higher percentages of those companies' business. The DC attorney general alleged that more than 90% of deposits in one company's ATMs came from fraud over the span of months, which that company disputes.
    


One thing that sticks out is that there appears to be little law enforcement can do after a person uploads cash to the crypto ATM. What are the roadblocks to recovering money?



            Once you insert cash into a crypto ATM, that currency can rapidly be transferred just about anywhere in the world. The problem with recovering the money afterward is that scammers often direct the funds to cryptocurrency exchanges outside of US jurisdiction that are less likely to cooperate with US law enforcement.
    


Are lawmakers talking about some kind of regulation? What are some of the remedies being discussed?



            More than a dozen states have passed laws that seek to blunt crypto ATM scams. They impose requirements like daily transaction limits on the machines, which seek to reduce what scam victims may lose. As lawmakers have sought to crack down, crypto ATM companies have hired lobbyists across the country and have even pushed their own model legislation with fewer protections. In Missouri, for example, legislators passed regulations this year that matched model legislation passed along by CoinFlip in another state nearly word-for-word, with no transaction limits. Some federal lawmakers have pushed for tighter rules, but remember, the Trump administration has relaxed oversight of the crypto industry. So these regulation debates may play out for years to come.

Professors from Rutgers University and beyond have flocked to an online fundraiser to donate money to fellow academic Mark Bray, who recently fled to Spain after President Donald Trump announced a crackdown on Antifa and its financiers. 

A Rutgers University professor nicknamed "Dr. Antifa," who fled the U.S. for Spain after saying his home address had been doxxed, and his family threatened, portrayed doxxing as a legitimate tactic for use against political opponents in his seminal work. 

Mark Bray, who now teaches his history courses for the public New Jersey university online from abroad, is best known for his book, "Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook," published in 2017. 

That book, which is based on 61 interviews with "current and former anti-fascists from seventeen countries in North America and Europe," references doxxing in a positive light three times.

'DR. ANTIFA'S' MEDITERRANEAN MOVE PARTIALLY FINANCED BY FELLOW RUTGERS PROFESSORS, OTHER AMERICAN ACADEMICS

On page 87, Bray quoted a Danish Antifa interviewee named Rasmus Preston, who said doxxing is "'a very important tool to create conflict within far-right movements' by causing a ‘constant mental burden.'"

In another instance, Bray relayed the story of Antifa Nebraska scoring a "major victory" by doxxing a political opponent, noting that the far-left group "printed thousands of flyers with his name, photo, and information on his Nazism and plastered them around town, forcing him to drop out of college, take down his social media, and go into hiding."

The book offers an appendix where Bray invited his interview subjects to provide advice to fellow or prospective Antifa members. A source named Brett A advocated in favor of doxxing as one of many tools in Antifa's political war. 

"Ideally, you want a diverse squad with members who have different talents," Brett said. "Some folks will be best used on the front lines in confrontations (usually strong, fit people who can fight if need be), some folks need to be really good with intel gathering (monitoring right-wing pages, doxxing, etc.), some folks need to be good at graphic design for flyer campaigns, some folks need to be well-versed in security culture, etc. The more diverse your organization is, the better equipped it will be at effectively organizing and staying safe."

Brett alluded to another tactic supported in Bray's book: violence. 

Antifascism is not just one tactic, but many, and those include "combinations of physical confrontations, doxxing, infiltration."

VETERAN JOURNALIST FLIPS SCRIPT ON MEDIA 'RUNNING COVER' FOR ANTIFA VIOLENCE: 'ANARCHIST COMMUNISM'

Fascists are defined ambiguously as the "Far Right," which Bray speculated could evolve into something worse than fascism. Throughout the book, though, he referenced the MAGA movement and opposition to the Trump administration. 

Bray openly praised the violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown's death involving police.  

"Moreover, these riots pushed police brutality and black oppression to the forefront of the national consciousness in a way that ‘nonviolent' tactics could not have achieved on their own," he wrote. "Yes, most Americans were repulsed by the sight of looting and burning, but for once they were forced to take note of the scale of injustice. Subsequently, Black Lives Matter cultivated a very significant base of popular support despite having a ‘violent flank.'"

On page 64 of the book, Bray relayed the story of Italian Antifa groups Autonomia Operaia and Lotta Continua from the 1970s. He described those groups as "militants wearing ski masks and bandannas, armed with clubs, iron bars, Molotov cocktails, and sometimes handguns."

He justified the groups' violent outbursts with a talking point often used in far-left circles in the U.S. today.

"While the expressed purpose of such marches may have been opposition to fascism, the state and the entire capitalist system were implicated in fascist violence, and therefore legitimate targets for widespread looting and property destruction," Bray wrote. 

The book later claims that "anti-fascism must necessarily be anticapitalist."

Later, he described the Autonomen in Germany, a group descended from Autonomia Operaia. He fawned over the group for inventing black bloc, the now-ubiquitous black head-to-toe uniform Antifa groups wear worldwide.

He described a "direct action" where the group "dressed in black with their faces covered by motorcycle helmets, balaclavas, or other masks to create a uniform, anonymous mass of revolutionaries prepared to carry out militant actions, sometimes involving weapons such as flagpoles, clubs, projectiles, and Molotov cocktails." 

Censorship is viewed as a powerful tool in fighting the people Bray calls fascists, too. 

His book roundly rejects free speech absolutism, and rages against "liberal anti-fascists" whom he characterizes as being too stalwart in their defense of open debate.

‘DR ANTIFA' RUTGERS PROFESSOR ANNOUNCES MOVE TO EUROPE AFTER TPUSA PETITION CALLS FOR HIS FIRING

"When militant anti-fascists successfully deprive fascists or white supremacists of a platform to promote their agenda, ‘liberal anti-fascists' often argue that shutting them down is counterproductive because it only gives them more attention.… Anti-fascists argue that any rhetorical benefit gained from such confrontations is outweighed by their reduced ability to disseminate it," Bray wrote.

"Liberal anti-fascists," Bray complained, have too much "faith in the inherent power of the public sphere to filter out fascist ideas, and in the institutions of government to forestall the advancement of fascist politics."

Bray even briefly touched on internet censorship, which he favors. 

"The Internet is a platform that anti-fascists cannot completely contest, though efforts to persuade Reddit and other forums to ban racist threads have borne some fruit," he said. 

The history professor fled the U.S. to Spain after President Donald Trump announced that he would designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. After that, the Turning Point USA chapter started a petition to have Bray fired.

State officials on the front lines of preparing for natural disasters and responding to emergencies say severe cuts to federal security grants, restrictions on money intended for readiness and funding delays tied to litigation are posing a growing risk to their ability to respond to crises.

It's all causing confusion, frustration and concern. The federal government shutdown isn't helping.

“Every day we remain in this grant purgatory reduces the time available to responsibly and effectively spend these critical funds,” said Kiele Amundson, communications director at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.

The uncertainty has led some emergency management agencies to hold off on filling vacant positions and make rushed decisions on important training and purchases. 

Experts say the developments complicate state-led emergency efforts, undermining the Republican administration's stated goals of shifting more responsibility to states and local governments for disaster response.

In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the new requirements were necessary because of “recent population shifts” and that changes to security grants were made “to be responsive to new and urgent threats facing our nation.”




Several DHS and FEMA grants help states, tribes and territories prepare for climate disasters and deter a variety of threats. The money pays for salaries and training, and such things as vehicles, communications equipment and software. 

State emergency managers say that money has become increasingly important because the range of threats they must prepare for is expanding, including pandemics and cyberattacks.

FEMA, a part of DHS, divided a $320 million Emergency Management Performance Grant among states on Sept. 29. But the next day, it told states the money was on hold until they submitted new population counts. The directive demanded that they omit people “removed from the State pursuant to the immigration laws of the United States” and to explain their methodology.

The amount of money distributed to the states is based on U.S. census population data. The new requirement forcing states to submit revised counts “is something we have never seen before,” said Trina Sheets, executive director of the National Emergency Management Association, a group representing emergency managers. “It's certainly not the responsibility of emergency management to certify population.”

With no guidance on how to calculate the numbers, Hawaii's Amundson said staff scrambled to gather data from the 2020 census and other sources, then subtracted he number of “noncitizens” based on estimates from an advocacy group.

They are not sure the methodology will be accepted. But with their FEMA contacts furloughed and the grant portal down during the federal shutdown, they cannot find out. Other states said they were assessing the request or awaiting further guidance.

In its statement, DHS said FEMA needs to be certain of its funding levels before awarding grant money, and that includes updates to a state's population due to deportations.

Experts said delays caused by the request could most affect local governments and agencies that receive grant money passed down by states because their budgets and staffs are smaller. At the same time, FEMA also reduced the time frame that recipients have to spend the money, from three years to one. That could prevent agencies from taking on longer-term projects.

Bryan Koon, president and CEO of the consulting firm IEM and a former Florida emergency management chief, said state governments and local agencies need time to adjust their budgets to any kind of changes.

“An interruption in those services could place American lives in jeopardy,” he said.

In another move that has caused uncertainty, FEMA in September drastically cut some states' allocations from another source of funding. The $1 billion Homeland Security Grant Program is supposed to be based on assessed risks, and states pass most of the money to police and fire departments.

New York received $100 million less than it expected, a 79% reduction, while Illinois saw a 69% reduction. Both states are politically controlled by Democrats. Meanwhile, some territories received unexpected windfalls, including the U.S. Virgin Islands, which got more than twice its expected allocation.

The National Emergency Management Association said the grants are meant to be distributed based on risk and that it “remains unclear what risk methodology was used” to determine the new funding allocation.

After a group of Democratic states challenged the cuts in court, a federal judge in Rhode Island issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 30. That forced FEMA to rescind award notifications and refrain from making payments until a further court order.

The freeze “underscores the uncertainty and political volatility surrounding these awards,” said Frank Pace, administrator of the Hawaii Office of Homeland Security. The Democratic-controlled state received more money than expected, but anticipates the bonus being taken away with the lawsuit.

In Hawaii, where a 2023 wildfire devastated the Maui town of Lahaina and killed more than 100 people, the state, counties and nonprofits “face the real possibility” of delays in paying contractors, completing projects and “even staff furloughs or layoffs” if the grant freeze and government shutdown continue, he said.

The myriad setbacks prompted Washington state's Emergency Management Division to pause filling some positions “out of an abundance of caution,” communications director Karina Shagren said.

Emergency management experts said the moves have created uncertainty for those in charge of preparedness.

The Trump administration has suspended a $3.6 billion FEMA disaster resilience program, cut the FEMA workforce and disrupted routine training.

Other lawsuits also are complicating decision-making. A Manhattan federal judge last week ordered DHS and FEMA to restore $34 million in transit security grants it had withheld from New York City because of its immigration policies.

Another judge in Rhode Island ordered DHS to permanently stop imposing grant conditions tied to immigration enforcement, after ruling in September that the conditions were unlawful — only to have DHS again try to impose them.

Taken together, the turbulence surrounding what was once a reliable partner is prompting some states to prepare for a different relationship with FEMA.

“Given all of the uncertainties,” said Sheets, of the National Emergency Management Association, states are trying to find ways to be “less reliant on federal funding.”

Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest on what's happening in Gaza after Hamas agreed to a peace deal with Israel on ‘The Story.'

The Israeli military conducted strikes against Hamas in Gaza after accusing the terrorist organization of repeatedly violating its ceasefire agreement on Sunday.

An Israeli military official confirmed the strikes to Fox News on Sunday, pointing to attacks by Hamas since Friday. The IDF later confirmed that it was taking actions in Gaza. 

"Earlier today, terrorists fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire toward IDF troops operating to dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the Rafah area, in southern Gaza, in accordance with the ceasefire agreement," the IDF said in a statement.

"In response, the IDF has begun striking in the area to eliminate the threat and dismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity," it continued.

Israel has responded by striking areas in the north and south of the Gaza Strip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says he has instructed the minister of defense and other security heads to "act forcefully" in reaction to the attacks.

Hamas claims it has "no knowledge" of any attacks against Israeli forces, releasing a statement on Sunday saying it was still abiding by the terms of the agreement.

"We affirm our full commitment to implementing everything that has been agreed upon, foremost among which is the ceasefire in all areas of the Gaza Strip. We have no knowledge of any events or clashes taking place in the Rafah area," the group wrote.

"We have no connection to any events occurring in those areas, nor can we communicate with any of our fighters there if any of them remain alive," it added.

The reported attacks on Israeli troops come after Hamas spent days fighting Palestinian rival groups after the ceasefire went into effect.

According to Reuters, Hamas executed at least 33 people in recent days in what officials described as a campaign to "show strength" after the ceasefire. Israeli sources say most of those killed belonged to families accused of collaborating with Israel or supporting rival militias.

The U.S. Department of State warned on Saturday that Hamas may break the peace agreement with a "planned attack" on Palestinian civilians.

"This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts," the department said in a statement on social media. "The guarantors demand Hamas uphold its obligations under the ceasefire terms."

"The United States and the other guarantors remain resolute in our commitment to ensuring the safety of civilians, maintaining calm on the ground and advancing peace and prosperity for the people of Gaza and the region as a whole," the statement continued.

President Donald Trump warned Hamas on Friday that continued attacks on Palestinians would force the U.S. and Israel to intervene.

"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them," he wrote on X.

LONDON (AP) — London police are probing whether Prince Andrew asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre.

The Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” media reports that Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear Giuffre by asking an officer on the force to find out if she had a criminal record.

The report by the Mail on Sunday followed Buckingham Palace's announcement Friday that Andrew agreed to relinquish use of Duke of York and other remaining royal titles after emails emerged showing he had remained in contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he previously admitted.

Giuffre's family welcomed news of the duke's demise but said King Charles III should go further and strip Andrew's title as prince. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41.

The emails were the last straw for the House of Windsor after years of tawdry headlines about Andrew's dodgy friends and suspicious business deals. 

The move to insulate the monarchy from Andrew's scandals has been ongoing since November 2019 when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles after a disastrous interview when he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. 

Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein's victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier. 




The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his dukedom demotion when emails emerged last week showing he emailed Epstein on Feb. 28, 2011. Andrew told Epstein in the note that they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it.”

The Mail reported that in 2011, as the newspaper was about to publish a now-infamous photo of the prince with his arm around the partly bare midriff of Giuffre, Andrew provided his bodyguard with Giuffre's date of birth and confidential social security number to find out if she had a checkered past. 

It's not clear if the officer complied with the request. Giuffre's family said she didn't have a criminal record.

With that report and Giuffre's posthumous memoir being published Tuesday, the scandal will not soon evaporate.

British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who was serving as the government's representative on the Sunday morning news programs, said a police officer should not be enlisted in a smear campaign.

“These are deeply concerning allegations,” Miliband told the BBC. “I think people want to look at those allegations and what the substance is behind them. But if that is correct, that is absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used.”

Andrew in 2022 reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn't admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre's suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.

In his statement Friday, Andrew said he continues to “vigorously deny” the accusations.

            The pivotal question in November's New Jersey and Virginia governor races may be whether the outcome is shaped more by President Donald Trump's electoral strengths or by his weaknesses.
    


            Four years ago, the GOP candidates in both races benefited from one of Trump's most important political gains: improving the GOP vote among working-class racial minorities. But they were able to minimize the impact of his most conspicuous political vulnerability: a shift away from the Republican Party in white-collar suburbs.
    


            This year, though, the equation seems reversed. Heading into the final weeks, that dynamic has provided a consistent mid-single-digit edge in polls for Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and a wider advantage for Abigail Spanberger in Virginia.
    


            On the one hand, in this off-off-year election, most experts agree that Republican nominees Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey and Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia face uphill climbs to activate the low-propensity voters — often younger and nonwhite — whom Trump mobilized in surprising number last year.
    


            “The question for Republicans is: Are those very unique Trump voters that got him closer in New Jersey and Virginia and some other blue states (only) Trump voters or are they Republican voters?” said Mike DuHaime, a longtime New Jersey Republican strategist. “That is what will be answered this year.”
    


            On the other, the Republican candidates could face much larger deficits next month in white-collar suburbs such as Fairfax County, Virginia, and Bergen County, New Jersey, than they did in 2021, when Joe Biden occupied the White House and Trump was much less visible. “We know through a lot of conversations and organizing … that those voters are frustrated and upset with what they are seeing from the Trump administration,” said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a pro-abortion rights group.
    


            Both sides believe New Jersey is a more competitive race than Virginia, partly because Ciattarelli is a stronger candidate than Earle-Sears, but also because Virginia more acutely feels the impact of the sweeping cutbacks in the federal workforce and contracting ranks engineered by Trump and by the formerly Elon Musk-fronted DOGE project.
    


Virginia is also easier for Democrats because Spanberger is running to replace Glenn Youngkin, the term-limited Republican governor whose approval rating has sagged somewhat, while Sherrill is trying to succeed Phil Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor, whose ratings have also drooped. If Sherrill wins, it will mark the first time since the 1960s that the same party has won three consecutive New Jersey gubernatorial elections.Even so, in recent decades, both states have almost always chosen governors from the party that lost the White House the year before — especially when the new president faces as much disapproval for his job performance as Trump does now.
    


“If you've got a president of your own party at minus 13 to minus 15 (job approval) in an off-off-year, it's always significant,” said Democratic activist Terry McAuliffe. McAuliffe should know: He narrowly won election as Virginia's governor in 2013 while Barack Obama's approval was faltering amid the rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act, and then lost a comeback bid to Youngkin in 2021 as Biden's rating cratered in the aftermath of the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.
    


            McAuliffe's close win in 2013 was the only time since 1973 that Virginia elected a governor from the party that won the White House the previous year. The pattern hasn't been quite as inviolate in New Jersey, but the only gubernatorial candidates from the same party as the president who have won there in recent decades were Murphy in 2021 and moderate Republican Tom Kean during Ronald Reagan's presidency in 1981 and 1985.
    


            Inevitably, local issues have shaped the outcome of these contests. But on many occasions, the New Jersey and Virginia contests have prefigured shifts in both the national arguments between the parties and the allegiances of key voter blocks. On several recent occasions, that has made them an early gauge of tremors that rumble through the next midterm and even presidential elections.
    


            “To a great extent, both parties look at (these elections) as kind of spring training, but also as a harbinger,” said Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee during his years in the chamber.
    


            That role is evident in the oscillating recent signals from these governors' races in the well-educated suburbs of both states.
    


            In the 2017 governor races, against the backdrop of Trump's tumultuous first year in office, those places played a key role in the resounding victories of Democrats Ralph Northam in Virginia and Phil Murphy in New Jersey. In Virginia, Northam carried the four big suburban Northern Virginia jurisdictions — Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties — by a crushing 242,000-vote margin. That was more than double McAuliffe's advantage in those same places four years earlier. Northam also comfortably carried Henrico and Chesterfield, two big previously Republican-leaning counties outside Richmond, where McAuliffe had only narrowly prevailed.
    


            Up the coast in New Jersey, Murphy reached nearly 57% of the vote in Bergen County and posted huge gains compared with the Democratic performance in the 2009 and 2013 governor elections in Somerset, Morris and Monmouth counties (though he still fell short in the latter two). All four rank among the most highly educated counties in the state.
    


            The momentum Democrats displayed in 2017 across the white-collar suburbs of Virginia and New Jersey carried forward. In 2018, about three-fourths of the 40 Republican House seats that Democrats flipped contained more college graduates than the national average, according to a CNN analysis of census data at the time. And in 2020, Biden posted enormous margins over Trump in such places around the country; for instance, Biden carried the big four suburban Northern Virginia jurisdictions by over 450,000 votes, and soared past Murphy's 2017 performance in the well-educated New Jersey suburbs.
    


            Both the atmosphere and the outcome were very different in these places in the 2021 governor's races. With Trump no longer occupying center stage, Republicans regained ground among well-educated voters by connecting with them on hot-button cultural issues including crime and education. Both Youngkin and Ciattarelli (who was also the Republican nominee that year), ran hard against Covid-19 lockdowns and how teachers taught race-related issues while championing “parents' rights” in schools. Looming behind all those GOP messages was the decline in Biden's approval rating that began late that summer.
    


            Boosted by all those forces, the two Republicans notably recovered ground in well-educated suburbs in the 2021 governor contests. The full implications of that recovery were blunted in the 2022 midterm election by the powerful backlash among many well-educated voters to the Supreme Court's decision that summer rescinding the constitutional right to abortion.
    


            But in 2024, as concern about inflation eclipsed the focus on abortion, the suburban trend evident three years earlier in New Jersey and Virginia resurfaced. Vice President Kamala Harris still won most white-collar suburban counties outside the South. But she didn't match Biden's share of the vote four years earlier in any of the big well-educated New Jersey counties, and she carried the four big Northern Virginia jurisdictions by nearly 100,000 fewer votes than he did.
    


            In retrospect, McAuliffe said, it's clear that the Democratic suburban erosion in the 2021 governor races was the true signal and the 2022 midterms were “the anomaly,” tied to abortion. Biden and other Democrats, McAuliffe said, “took the wrong message out of that” about the challenges the party would face in 2024.
    


            The 2021 governor results, especially in New Jersey, confirmed another negative trend for Democrats. Trump somewhat improved his showing in 2020 over 2016 among minority voters nationwide, especially those without a four-year college degree. In 2021, Ciattarelli in particular advanced further from those beachheads. He significantly narrowed Murphy's advantage from 2017 in Passaic and Hudson, the two New Jersey counties with the largest share of Hispanic residents, and improved even in Essex, the county centered on Newark, which has a large Black population. In 2024, Trump ran even better than Ciattarelli in all three of those counties, even becoming the first GOP presidential nominee in the 21st century to win Passaic.
    


            Similar trends across the 2021 and 2024 elections were evident in some Virginia communities with large nonwhite populations, such as Prince William County. Like the slight Democratic dip with white-collar suburbanites, the more substantial shift among minority populations that fully blossomed in 2024 was already budding in the 2021 Virginia and New Jersey governor races.
    


            The underlying political environment in the two states has diverged more than usual this year. Budget cuts that have hurt both federal workers and contractors, compounded by the ongoing government shutdown, have created a unique headwind for Republicans in Virginia. “There is no other state that gets so impacted and touched by the federal government,” said McAuliffe. Davis, the former Republican representative, agreed: “I think the energy up here in the blue parts of the state is going to be very, very high.” In New Jersey, no single issue has focused discontent with the Trump administration in the same manner.
    


            But the similarities between the contests are more notable. Spanberger and Sherrill are both centrist Democrats with national security backgrounds who were elected to the House of Representatives as part of the 2018 blue wave. Both have run careful, disciplined campaigns that have drawn criticism from some Democrats for failing to ignite much enthusiasm or passion, but also praise from analysts in both parties for avoiding missteps. “They are running a race where they believe … that if she doesn't make a mistake she'll win,” DuHaime, the New Jersey Republican strategist, said of Sherrill. Virginia Republicans describe Spanberger in virtually identical terms.
    


            Sherrill and Spanberger have each maintained a predominant focus on the cost of living. That contrasts with their Republican opponents, who have attempted to revive several of the wedge issues that have benefited the GOP in recent years. Those include immigration enforcement, resistance to climate policies that they say will raise energy costs, and especially in Virginia, stoking concern about policies affecting transgender students. (Reproductive Freedom for All has mounted a robust campaign to reach pro-choice voters in both races — these are the only states that have not elected a governor since the Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022 — but the candidates have not stressed the issue.)
    


            Yet Democrats are almost uniformly confident those attacks are not landing as powerfully this year. Earle-Sears “is obviously running that playbook, but nobody thinks she is in the driver's seat of the election,” said Democratic strategist Bradley Komar, who ran Northam's winning 2017 Virginia campaign.
    


            Jesse Ferguson, a longtime Democratic strategist working in Virginia, argued that Trump's 2024 ad hitting Harris on transgender issues (whose famous tag line was, “Kamala's for they/them, President Trump is for you”) was so effective not only because of Harris' stance on those questions, but because the ad crystallized Trump's argument that Democrats were focused on esoteric concerns, not the daily financial struggles of ordinary families.
    


            Now, Ferguson said, Trump has inverted that equation by devoting so much of his presidency to retribution against perceived enemies and crackdowns against blue states and cities. “The fundamental problem Republicans will have in ‘25 and ‘26 is that they no longer look like they are focused on costs and the economy; they look like they are focused on retribution and revenge and culture wars,” said Ferguson.
    


            Both Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears have embraced Trump almost unreservedly. In his recent debate with Sherrill, Ciattarelli insisted, in an answer reminiscent of Harris' damaging comments about Biden last year on The View, “I think he's right about everything that he's doing.” Earle-Sears has avoided criticizing Trump even over the big federal layoffs that have pounded Northern Virginia.
    


            That deference tracks the overall shift within the GOP toward Trump, but it contrasts sharply with the 2021 governor races. In those contests, neither Ciattarelli nor Youngkin repudiated Trump, but both kept some distance. “Youngkin … was able to walk that tightrope very effectively in amplifying the conservative base turnout while also winning independent voters that he needed,” said Mark Rozell, Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University in Virginia. “Earle-Sears has not shown that same strategic skill.”
    


            Republicans in both states say Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears probably have no choice but to hug Trump tightly for fear of discouraging turnout from his base supporters. But that strategy has helped Democrats lash them to a president whose disapproval rating stood at 55% in both a recent Schar School/Washington Post Virginia poll and a September Quinnipiac University survey in New Jersey (the last time that poll measured Trump's approval there). In those polls, slightly more than 9 in 10 of Trump disapprovers were backing Spanberger, while Sherrill was carrying nearly 9 in 10 of them, according to results provided to CNN by both pollsters. The Republican nominees were carrying comparable majorities among voters who approved of Trump's performance — but that was only a little more than 4 in 10 in each state.
    


            The discontent with Trump gives Spanberger and Sherrill a good chance to rebuild the margins for Democrats that eroded in white-collar suburbs across the two states in 2021 and 2024. The Schar/WP and most recent Quinnipiac surveys have found each woman carrying a majority of white college graduates, as did a Fairleigh-Dickinson University poll of New Jersey released Friday .
    


            Political strategists in both states are less certain about how much ground Democrats can regain with minority communities. But Rafael Collazo, executive director of the Unidos US Action Fund, which focuses on Latino voters, said “the door is open” for Democrats to begin reversing their losses because of discontent over high prices and Trump's aggressive deportation policies. “There is definitely buyer's remorse” among some of Trump's 2024 Latino supporters, Collazo says, “but that doesn't necessarily mean Democrats are automatically going to recruit those voters.”
    


            Democrats still face localized challenges in each contest. The controversy over recently revealed threatening 2022 text messages from Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Attorney General in Virginia, has provided Republicans in this year's races “a focus they haven't had before,” Rozell said. And widespread discontent with New Jersey's outgoing Gov. Murphy, particularly over rising electricity costs, has provided Ciattarelli with probably his best asset in the race.
    


            Yet in both states, in both parties, most analysts would be surprised if those local factors allowed the GOP to surmount a national current that is once again primarily flowing away from Trump. (Ciattarelli has stayed more competitive than Earle-Sears, but even his support has almost never exceeded 45% in any poll — the level around which New Jersey Republicans often tap out.) A victory for Republicans in either race would be an ominous sign for Democrats that discontent with Trump may not be enough to overcome their own substantial image problems, even in favorable states. But solid wins in both places would give Democrats hoping for a wave in 2026 — the first reliable indication that one may be approaching the shore.

            To celebrate her 70th birthday, retired government worker Peggy Cole says she and a friend drove nearly 10 hours from her hometown of Flint, Michigan, to join a protest in Washington, DC, on Saturday.
    


            Cole said she felt compelled to mark the milestone at the large demonstration because it's a “scary time” for Americans and democracy is at stake.
    


            “It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don't do anything about it,” Cole said.
    


            The event was one of more than 2,700 “No Kings” rallies held across the country on Saturday, protesting what organizers describe as President Donald Trump's “authoritarian” agenda. That's hundreds more events than were planned for the first go-round in June, when about 5 million people across the country took to the streets to protest Trump's administration as he held a military parade in Washington.
    


            Nearly 7 million people showed up for Saturday's rallies – including more than 100,000 people in New York, organizers and officials said. Along with larger events in major cities, small pockets of “No Kings” protesters cropped up along busy thoroughfares, in small town squares and at municipal parks in red and blue states alike.
    


            The largely peaceful protests followed a tumultuous summer of mass immigration raids, demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal troops into Democratic-led cities.
    


            Police in Portland and New York City reported that the protests concluded with no arrests.
    


            Trouble came later in the day when some individuals targeted protesters: A woman in South Carolina was arrested for brandishing a firearm while driving near a demonstration and a man in Georgia was seen on video taking a protester's flag and pushing another demonstrator to the ground.
    


            While the Trump administration and some GOP officials have painted anti-Trump protests as the work of “violent left-wing radicals,” the organization behind the “No Kings” events, the Indivisible Project, says it is committed to “nonviolent action” and had trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation. That became especially important amid growing political violence across the country, some organizers said.
    


            Some demonstrators wore yellow – a symbol of unity and a reference to other nonviolent resistance movements, according to organizers. “Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings,” reads a flyer on the “No Kings” website.
    


            Other protesters wore costumes, including inflatable chickens, frogs and dinosaurs, which some said emphasized the peaceful nature of the demonstrations. “It's really hard to call something a war zone, when you look at something and it's just a block party and people in Halloween costumes,” said a Los Angeles protester who wore a unicorn costume as he danced to music.
    


            Protesters could be heard loudly cheering and chanting slogans into megaphones, including, “This is what democracy looks like,” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.” They waved American flags along with signs opposing ICE, authoritarianism and billionaires.
    


            CNN field teams spoke with attendees at rallies across the country. Here's what protesters had to say:
    


            Many protesters emphasized the importance of democracy – an institution they fear is eroding with Trump's attempts to expand executive power.
    


            “We're a democracy. And that, in a democracy, people can stand up and voice their opinions. And that we are not going to be silenced,” Joan Press told CNN at a protest in Atlanta.
    


            A rally that kicked off the Atlanta protest featured high-profile speakers, including Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.
    


            “In this moment, in which we are seeing a president and an administration arrogating to himself power that doesn't belong to him, our message is very clear,” Warnock later told CNN. “This is not about the people in power, it's about the power in the people.”
    


            Kimberly Diemert, an organizer and communications director for the Georgia chapter of 50501, a “decentralized” movement that has helped lead the wave of nationwide protests, reminded the crowd about the city's civil rights legacy.
    


            “Atlanta is the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement as well as democracy … we don't want to lose that,” Diemert said.
    


            In New York City, one demonstrator held a sign reading: “We protest because we love America, and we want it back.”
    


            The protester, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons, said she's been protesting since the 1960s, but this time feels different.
    


            “In the 60s we wanted to expand rights – women's rights, gay rights, minority rights, voting rights,” she said. “But all that's being taken away now. Now our entire democracy is being threatened, the basic tenets, the press, the judiciary.”
    


            She described feeling “very sad, a sense of loss, fear” under the Trump administration.
    


            “I'm hoping together, we can all save democracy,” she said.
    


            Dressed in Revolutionary War-era clothing and wigs, members of the group All in for Democracy attended the “No Kings” protest in Washington, DC.
    


            “I just see all of our institutions changing, and I don't want us to change as a country and as a people,” said DC resident Lee Ayres, sporting a coat, wig and hat. “I want all of America to realize the Declaration of Independence is about no kings.”
    


            Many demonstrators called out what they feel is a threat to freedom of expression in the US.
    


            “It doesn't seem like we're able to peacefully or safely (express ourselves) right now, without fear of repercussions” from the government, work or families, said Bobbie Castillo, who traveled hours from her hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, to DC for her first protest ever.
    


            Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” rallied the crowd at the DC protest, arguing that Trump and his associates “cannot tolerate dissent.”
    


            “To them, our free speech is frightening. They are arresting people and denying due process in courts. They tried to silence television hosts,” Nye, a former TV host, said.
    


            Participants in smaller cities and towns said they were struck by the size of the turnout Saturday.
    


            In Ashland, Oregon, Joel Lesko said the day was about “joyfully celebrating our love for America, for free speech, for the importance of community and using our voices for diversity and inclusion and democracy.”
    


            After attending a protest in ruby-red Hendersonville, North Carolina, author Lynn Ames told CNN, “If you love this country, saving democracy is a priority no matter where you live, including in small-town America. Maybe especially in small-town America.”
    


            Many protesters connected their attendance to the ongoing immigration crackdown and the federal government's forceful response to anti-ICE protests that first erupted in Los Angeles following local raids. The demonstrations have since spread to numerous other cities, including Chicago, New York City, Dallas and Portland.
    


            Trump's attempts to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-controlled cities – which he argues is necessary to quell violence and support his deportation initiatives – have drawn legal challenges by state and local officials.
    


            Demonstrators in Los Angeles – where federal immigration raids triggered massive protests in June and led to Trump sending in the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes – emphasized rights for immigrants and called for a stop to the Trump administration's deportation campaign.
    


            Sitting in front of LA's City Hall, Gilberto Beas told CNN the protest is “a message for ICE to stop doing what they're doing.”
    


            Maria Rivera Cummings, who was born in Los Angeles and is of Mexican descent, said: “We're all immigrants and everyone has rights here.”
    


            At a demonstration in DC, Michael Langfeldt said he was protesting what he sees as “hatred” toward immigrants and the deployment of the military to US cities.
    


            “I feel like there's a lot of overreach in the federal government, specifically in like the executive branch,” he told CNN. “Congress doesn't do anything about it.”
    


            Hailey, a 24-year-old demonstrator in an inflatable frog suit, told CNN that she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland, who have faced off against federal law enforcement for weeks. Protesters there have donned inflatable costumes at rallies outside an ICE facility — in part to dispute Trump's characterization of the city as “war-ravaged.”
    


            “I think it's hard to see a country that you love descend into fascism,” Hailey told CNN.
    


            In Chicago, which has been an epicenter for the resistance to Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, many carried Mexican flags and signs like “Hands off our Democracy” and “ICE OUT!”
    


            Actor John Cusack, a Chicago resident known for being outspoken about Hollywood and the US government, said the city's message to the Trump administration is: “Go to hell!”
    


            “No, you can't put troops on our streets. You can't create enough chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act so you can stay in power,” the actor said, addressing the president.
    


            Dakota Englert, from Coal City, Illinois, said she came to stand up for basic humanity.
    


            “We all bleed the same color … I feel for the people that are being separated from their families, the people that are being hurt, killed,” Englert said.
    


            Other protesters expressed concerns about cuts to federal programs — particularly health care.  The protests come as the federal government is shut down, with GOP lawmakers and the White House locked in a standoff with Democrats over a funding bill.
    


            Danielle Guinto, a mother of two, said she worries about the major federal changes to Medicaid and other health-related policies that could impact her children's health, as well as the rising cost of living.
    


            “I just don't understand how you can rip food out of people's mouths, how you can separate, rip people out of their homes,” she told CNN at the Chicago demonstration. “How can you look at a family with fear in their eyes and you're just going to go take them away?”
    


            Anthony Lee, who works at the Food and Drug Administration and was one of many federal workers who were furloughed following the shutdown, said he came to the demonstration to protect public services. Lee, president of the National Treasury Employees Union chapter in DC, attended the event with a group of unionized federal workers.
    


            “I've been a public servant for over 20 years, and to see the destruction, really, of our government, our public services, over the last several months has been really scary,” Lee said.
    


            Another federal government employee who was furloughed said she joined the DC protest because the Trump administration has affected her livelihood and “demonized” federal workers.
    


            “The elimination of all these jobs are creating mass threats (for people to be able) to keep their home, to keep a roof over their head, send their kids to college and the hope of the American dream,” said Monica, who declined to share her last name out of fear of retaliation.
    


            Elizabeth Nee, a 25-year-old social worker from Maryland, told CNN she's seeing an impact at the psychiatric hospital she works at in Baltimore.
    


            “We have a lot of people who are coming in and they're unhoused, a lot of people on Medicaid. Everything's at risk right now,” she said.
    


            Speaking at the DC protest, Sen. Bernie Sanders called out Trump and his billionaire allies, like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.
    


            “This moment is not just about one man's greed, one man's corruption or one man's contempt for the Constitution,” Sanders said. “This is about a handful of the wealthiest people on Earth who, in their insatiable greed, have hijacked our economy and our political system in order to enrich themselves at the expense of working families throughout this country.”

When London-based Priya Sadhwani and her husband were on parental leave, they decided to take an extended trip to New York City to visit family. After searching for vacation rental options, she realized it wasn't feasible for a monthlong trip.

"New York is unaffordable to do so on Airbnb," she said, adding they wanted a place that was a similar size to their home. "I just wanted that same feel with the baby and also for my parents to come and stay with us in the city."

That's when she discovered Kindred, a membership-based home swapping network that allows users to stay in each other's homes around the world. No money is exchanged between hosts and guests. Instead, guests pay Kindred a standard cleaning fee and a service fee that averages $15 to $30 per night. Priya and her husband ended up coming to New York for six weeks and staying in three different Kindred homes. In total, they paid around $1,800 for their stays.

Not only was the home swapping experience more affordable, but it was also more personal than traditional travel stays, she said. One of the hosts even left diapers in her daughter's size and cheesecake in the fridge because the owners were starting a cheesecake business.

"It feels like I'm staying in a friend's house while they're away," she said.

Sadhwani and her husband are part of a growing group of travelers who are turning to home swapping instead of hotels or short-term rentals, as travel costs are on the rise and remote work has provided more flexibility.

"There's just a tremendous need and a tremendous desire for a new way to travel that's more human, way more affordable, and also more responsible for our cities," Justine Palefsky, cofounder and CEO of Kindred, told Business Insider.

Since its founding in 2021, Kindred has grown to over 200,000 members. Some of the most popular destinations are New York, London, Los Angeles, Paris, and Amsterdam, and over 90% of the properties on Kindred are primary residences. In 2023, Kindred raised $15 million in Series A funding led by New Enterprise Associates.

Homes of all types are accepted on the app, from studio apartments to multi-bedroom mansions, but they all must meet the minimum standards of being safe, functional, and inviting, Palefsky said.

"It doesn't need to be Architectural Digest, but it needs to have some amount of soul and personality," she said.

Kindred is a give-to-get marketplace. It's free to join and no money is exchanged between host and guest, but in order to stay in someone else's home, members need to offer up their own home.

Sometimes the app connects people for direct swaps — for instance, a member in Los Angeles could swap their home with a member in New York for two weeks. Members can also build up credits by offering their homes when they're out of town and not staying at another Kindred. They can then spend those credits on nights at other Kindred homes.

Palefsky said the swapping "allows the relationship to feel much more like a social contract instead of a financial contract."

Meagan Cignoli, a sculptor based in West Hollywood, told Business Insider that Kindred is the first option she checks when planning a trip. She's stayed in Kindred homes in Portugal, Greece, Mexico, and Joshua Tree. She's even used it locally to stay in downtown Los Angeles or Santa Monica when she has a couple of days of work on the other side of town and doesn't want to deal with commuting back and forth.

"Now, when I look at hotels or Airbnbs, I'm shocked by the price," she said.

"The one bad thing is it has me so spoiled by the price that it's hard to swallow other options" when she's traveling to destinations without Kindred.

Cignoli first started home swapping nearly 20 years ago, using platforms like Craigslist. She said a major benefit of Kindred is the variety and flexibility. By offering another member a weekend at her one-bedroom apartment, she can earn credits to stay a weekend at a four-bedroom house with a pool.

And because each Kindred stay has a one-time cleaning fee regardless of how many nights they stay, guests get a better deal the longer the trip. Cignoli said it's enabled her to take much longer vacations than she would otherwise.

Palefsky said Kindred's main challenge is sustaining its growth while maintaining trust.

"This only works if people really feel comfortable joining with their primary residence, and that's a big leap," she said, adding that the company is "obsessed" with ensuring it's delivering a quality experience.

To use the app, would-be homeswappers apply. Once accepted, members' identities are verified via government IDs. New members are required to complete "a quick home verification before their first trip," according to Kindred's website, to make sure "homes on the platform are accurately represented."

Sadhwani said she makes a point of having a video chat with anyone she's swapping with. It helps her feel more comfortable about hosting people she doesn't know, and it also makes her travel experience more personal by providing an opportunity to get recommendations from a local.

She's also been amazed at how respectful Kindred members have been when staying in her home, and how easy it's been to make friends with other members.

Kindred is now Sadhwani's preferred way to travel, and it's even dictating where her family decides to go next.

"Instead of looking for a destination, we're looking for a fun Kindred home to visit."

Israel on Sunday struck targets in southern Gaza after saying its troops came under fire from Hamas militants, in the first major test of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire meant to halt more than two years of war.

Militants used a rocket-propelled grenade, and Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery, the military said.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consulted with Israel's security heads and directed the military to take "strong action" against any ceasefire violations, but didn't threaten to return to war.

Israel's military said that militants shot at troops in areas of the southern Gaza city of Rafah that are Israeli-controlled according to agreed-upon ceasefire lines. No injuries were reported. A separate military statement said that Israel would respond to ceasefire violations with "great force" against Hamas.

Hamas, which continued to accuse Israel of multiple ceasefire violations, said that it wasn't connected to any clashes in Rafah.

The Palestinian group also said that talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.

An Israeli airstrike killed at least six Palestinians in central Gaza, health officials said. The strike hit a makeshift coffeehouse on the coastal side of the town of Zawaida, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government.

Another Israeli strike killed at least two people close to the Al-Ahly soccer club in the Nuseirat refugee camp, the ministry said. The strike hit a tent and wounded eight others, said Awda hospital, which received the casualties.

A third strike hit a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis in the south, killing at least one person, according to Nasser hospital.

An Israeli military official told journalists there had been three incidents Sunday, two in southern Gaza and one in the north, and noted that the update was partial for now.

Israel identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight.

Netanyahu's office said the bodies belonged to Ronen Engel, a father of three from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai agricultural worker from Kibbutz Be'eri.

Both were believed to have been killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which sparked the war. Engel's wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a ceasefire in November 2023.

Hamas, in the past week, has handed over the remains of 12 hostages.

Hamas' armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said that it had found the body of a hostage and would return it on Sunday "if circumstances in the field" allowed. It warned that any escalation by Israel would hamper search efforts.

Israel on Saturday said the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would stay closed "until further notice" and its reopening would depend on how Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning the remains of all 28 deceased hostages.

Hamas group says the devastation and Israeli military control of certain areas of Gaza have slowed the handover. Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned.

Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died. The ministry has posted photos of bodies on its website to help families attempting to locate loved ones. The bodies were decomposed and blackened. and some were missing limbs and teeth.

Only 25 bodies have been identified, the Health Ministry said.

After Israel and Hamas exchanged 20 living hostages for more than 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, the handover of remains is a major issue in the first stage of the ceasefire. A major scale-up of humanitarian aid, including the opening of the Rafah crossing, for people entering or leaving Gaza, is the other central issue.

Hamas said talks with mediators to start the ceasefire's second phase have begun.

The next stages of the ceasefire are expected to focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory.

Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesman, said late Saturday that the second phase of negotiations "requires national consensus." He said Hamas has begun discussions to "solidify its positions," without giving details.

According to the U.S. plan, the negotiations will include disarming Hamas and the establishment of an internationally backed authority to run Gaza.

Kassem reiterated that the group won't be part of the ruling authority in a postwar Gaza. He called for the prompt establishment of a body of Palestinian technocrats to run day-to-day affairs.

For now, "government agencies in Gaza continue to perform their duties, as the vacuum is very dangerous, and this will continue until an administrative committee is formed and agreed upon by all Palestinian factions," he said.

The Rafah crossing was the only one not controlled by Israel before the war. It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Palestinians to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.

On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority's Interior Ministry in Ramallah announced procedures for Palestinians wishing to leave or enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. For those who want to leave Gaza, Palestinian Embassy staff from Cairo will be at the crossing to issue temporary travel documents that allow entry into Egypt. Palestinians who wish to enter Gaza will need to apply at the embassy.

The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.

Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross.

Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack that sparked the war.

On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave some hints about more interest rate cuts, mentioning the weakness in the labor market.

Bearing in mind an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and potential rate cuts, investors can consider adding some dividend stocks to their portfolios to ensure stable income. The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive dividend-paying stocks with strong fundamentals.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first dividend pick is EOG Resources (EOG), a crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company with reserves in the U.S. and Trinidad. The company recently announced a deal to buy Encino Acquisition Partners for $5.6 billion. The deal will be accretive to EOG's free cash flow, supporting its commitment to shareholder returns.

EOG raised its quarterly dividend 5% to $1.02 per share, payable October 31. With an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG offers a yield of 3.8%.

Recently, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on EOG and raised his price target to $145 from $140. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on EOG stock with a price target of $133.

Hanold updated his estimates, valuations and EOG stock price target to reflect higher oil price expectations. Notably, the 5-star analyst raised his earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow per share (CFPS) estimates for 2025 and 2026 due to his revised commodity outlook. Hanold now expects EPS of $10.07 and $9.46 for 2025 and 2026, respectively, up from the prior projections of $9.54 and $7.15. Hanold initiated EPS and CFPS estimates of $11.63 and $23.59 for 2027 and at $12.97 and $25.65 for 2028, respectively.

Hanold is bullish on EOG and expects it to outperform its peer group over the next 12 months. "The leading-edge technological approach, strong balance sheet, low-cost operations and capital efficiency should continue to drive meaningful value and make EOG a core E&P holding," said Hanold.

Hanold ranks No. 79 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.5%. See EOG Resources Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.

Another dividend-paying energy company is Coterra Energy (CTRA), an exploration and production company with operations focused in the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin. Coterra paid a quarterly dividend of 22 cents per share in the  Q2 of 2025 and yields 3.4%.  

As part of his Q3 preview for oil & gas E&P companies, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Coterra, while cutting his price target to $32 from $35. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on CTRA stock with a price target of $26.

Given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, Sorbara is more cautious and selective in the near term. Based on the recent stock performance, investor positioning and expectations, he said that Coterra is one of his "favorite names" heading into Q3 results.

Sorbara believes that investors will continue to focus on management's oversight of the large oil production rampup in the second half of 2025 and its outlook for 2026. The analyst expects Q3 oil production to beat expectations, but lag estimates for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and free cash flow, likely due to "stale Consensus gas pricing." Meanwhile, Sorbara sees upside to Q4 oil production expectations due to the potential for incremental upside from the Harkey remediation wells.

"We reaffirm our Buy rating, as we continue to find CTRA attractive on valuation (trading at an EV/EBITDA discount and above average FCF yield) with the potential for strong capital returns," said Sorbara, referencing free cash flow.

Sorbara ranks No. 315 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See EOG Resources Financials on TipRanks.

Wireless telecom giant AT&T (T) is this week's third dividend pick. The company is scheduled to announce its third-quarter results on October 22. AT&T recently declared a quarterly dividend of 27.75 cents share, payable November 3. With an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T yields 4.3%.

Heading into Q3 results, Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins reiterated a buy rating on AT&T with a base case price target of $32, calling the company a top-ranked pick. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an "outperform" rating on AT&T stock with a price target of $31.

Rollins expects AT&T to deliver a strong operating performance in Q3 across its strategic products and segments. Despite intense competition in wireless, the 5-star analyst expects AT&T to report 300,000 postpaid phone net additions in the Q3, with 2.5% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenue.

Further, Rollins estimates Q3 fiber net additions of 286,000 in a seasonally stronger quarter. He expects AT&T's fixed wireless access (FWA) to continue to expand with net additions of 210,000. The analyst highlighted that his headline Q3 forecasts are slightly below the Street's consensus estimates for revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and are in line with free cash flow expectations.

"Wireless churn, upgrades and gross adds are likely to have an upward bias in 3Q given the more active replacement rates," noted Rollins. The analyst contends that AT&T's broadband opportunity remains an under-appreciated component of the company's annual financial growth prospects.

Rollins ranks No. 548 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.7%. See AT&T Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dave Greenlaw, a human resources executive in Washington, D.C., about why he plans to attend an HR conference later this month where conservative activist Robby Starbuck — a vocal critic of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives — is scheduled to speak.

The event is being organized by the world's largest HR association, the Society for Human Resource Management. SHRM is facing backlash over the matter, with some HR pros saying they are canceling their membership. Greenlaw, who has worked in HR for nearly 17 years and has been a member of SHRM for about four years, explained why he won't be following suit.

This interview has been edited for space and clarity.

I completely disagree with Robby Starbuck's views. But my personal take is that HR leaders need to understand the full landscape of the workforce and the workplace, even when it might be uncomfortable.

There are so many factors that go into a productive workplace, different political beliefs and walks of life. Whether it's your sexuality, the color of your skin, your religion, whatever, I think it's really important to have that full perspective, particularly as an HR professional, because you're dealing with so much.

SHRM historically has hosted speakers across the political spectrum, such as former Presidents Joe Biden, George Bush Sr., and Bill Clinton, and I think that's a good thing. It goes back to HR leaders needing to understand the full landscape, even when they might disagree with these people or their policies.

What I think is valuable about this particular talk with Starbuck is that he is going to be on a panel with [lawyer and media personality] Van Jones that will be moderated by SHRM's CEO, Johnny C. Taylor, and they're both people of color. And Starbuck's views on DEI and LGBTQ issues — even though I personally find them abhorrent — he's a voice that I think might resonate with a certain populist out there, and it's important not to silence voices, even when you don't agree with them.

Even though Starbuck might say some terrible things, I think it's so important to acknowledge it and be prepared. What if you're an HR professional and all of a sudden you're handling something internally, and there's a disagreement with two people who are speaking about politics or DEI?

Hearing Taylor, Starbuck, and Jones could give you perspective on the matter, and you can bring it back to your place of employment. A million things could come out of this conversation. It's also important to acknowledge why people are upset about this. A lot of people feel like Starbuck doesn't have a lot to add to the conversation because of certain things he's already said. And I get that, too, and I understand the anger and frustration around it. But I think I see more of a broader, bigger picture.

I am a gay man, and I know the things that Starbuck has said are almost damaging to some of the members of my community. But you have to think of the bigger picture. Not everyone in the world is gay. Not everyone identifies and believes what I do. And when you're an HR professional, that is what you really have to keep in mind.

If I'm always using my beliefs to make decisions on things — particularly when I'm an employer or an HR person — that's not necessarily fair to the other individual, and I don't think it's necessarily appropriate. So I think it's important to hear these perspectives, have different types of temperament, and work with different voices.

Business Insider has verified the financial claims mentioned in this article. This story has been edited for length and clarity.

I sold my first app at 16 years old for almost $100,000. It was called Totally Science, an unblocked gaming website that allowed students to play games in school. It earned me thousands a year for two years through Google AdSense before I sold it.

Every app or game I've built has been to solve a problem in my own life. I was a skinny kid growing up and tried going to the gym to put on weight, but learned very quickly that most results come from diet. My cofounders and I set out to build a calorie-tracking app that integrates AI technology.

I moved to San Francisco a couple of months after launching with one of the other cofounders, and we spent the summer of our junior year in high school there alone, just the two of us, 17-year-olds, building out the team from scratch.

Our app really took off over the next year and a half, bringing us to now, where we are a 30-person team and generating around $30 million in annual revenue.

My parents put me in a coding camp when I was 7. I didn't learn that much, but it sparked my interest and showed me what was possible. YouTube taught me the rest. I would spend hours a day watching people program different video games.

I attempted to recreate some of the most complex video games with my own small tweaks. This didn't quite pan out as a 10-year-old trying to replicate what a team of 100 people had accomplished, but I learned a great deal. After watching "The Social Network," Mark Zuckerberg became a massive inspiration. He was the main reason I pursued programming past making video games.

I wasn't that different from other kids. I got really good grades in school and had a social life with my friends. However, I spent multiple hours a day outside of school working on various projects. Even in class, I would always be building projects.

My cofounder, Henry, and I started building apps in the summer of 2023. It was just the two of us trying to figure things out from scratch, learning on our own. I messaged some people who built very successful apps to find mentors, and one of our other cofounders was one of the people I messaged. He had previously scaled a couple of apps to a few million downloads, and I had reached out to him for advice. He joined the team.

After that, we started working with a few influencers on videos, and the new app took off faster than any of us could have ever imagined. I quickly became aware that we had all the pieces for success to a much greater extent than any other project I had worked on, and I put the money from my previous app sale into it.

Henry and I spent July in San Francisco working on it, and that's when Cal AI became more established. We realized this wasn't just a flash in the pan, but something we could actually scale up.

The most beautiful and proudest moments in my life so far have probably been meeting people in person who show me Cal AI on their phone. It's awesome to see that something I built is being used by people every single day.

My advice to anyone would be to get started. Ignore the noise, ignore the people telling you that it's impossible to do it at a young age, and ignore the people trying to push you down a specific path to accomplish your goals.

It's becoming easier and easier to be a founder. There's a reason the age of these entrepreneurial kids making the headlines is getting younger. I had Google, the internet, and YouTube as my tools, but for the next generation of founders, it's ChatGPT that they can use to teach themselves. Which is so much easier than watching YouTube videos, where I was limited to the content library that people have posted.

I just enrolled as a student at the University of Miami, but I'm taking a pretty light course load right now. I'm still working on Cal AI, but I'm no longer needed in the day-to-day operations as much. We've put a lot of systems in place over the last year and a half, where I now just have to oversee the vision and guide us in the right direction.

The aspect of college that consumes a lot of time is the social life. The primary reason I'm enrolled in college right now is to meet and socialize with people my age and make friends. This definitely takes up a significant amount of time and mental space. So fun in the short term, but not super productive.

The biggest challenge is finding other like-minded people to relate to. I don't want to talk about random classes. I want to talk about real-world problems, solutions, business models, and other things that most kids my age aren't interested in.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Salvatore, 44, the founder of Heritage Hospitality Group, a company with a few bars and coffee shops in Chicago. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I own Heritage Hospitality Group in Chicago, and we've been around since 2011. It started as a bicycle manufacturing company, and I paired that with a café. I did that for a few years as I pursued my interests throughout the hospitality industry. We now have five different brands: Froth, Heritage Outpost, Heritage Bikes & Coffee, Larry's, and Bunker.

I love the customers. I love solving the problems that arise. I love experimenting with food. I love coming up with new drinks. I love my employees, and the interactions I have with everybody I get to work with.

My teenager is now working at the shop as a dishwasher. That's so fun to see. We started this company when he was several months old.

It's always been about the people, it's always been about the hospitality, and that keeps me going. I love it.

COVID was one of the hardest points in my life operating a business. Everything was uncertain, and everything was shut down. We paused, we took a break, and figured it out.

Now, it feels like everything's uncertain, but no one's giving it the attention it needs. The current moment with inflation and policy uncertainty is starting to rival running a business during COVID.

Any bicycle parts, anything coming from overseas, that's getting hit, whether it's tariffs or lack of inventory at this point, because the wholesalers don't have it either. Coffee bean prices have obviously gone up. Tariffs on South America, Brazil in particular, have carried that weight of the tariffs.

Even things like cups, paper goods, anything that we rely on — essentially, nothing's manufactured in the States. It's a global economy, so everything gets hit.

The biggest issue is not knowing what is going on. You can't operate a business with uncertainty.

Every day is a win or a loss, and you can't really run a business that way. This uncertainty creates this temperature where I'm going to hold off on any major decisions because I don't know how that's going to affect my bottom line tomorrow.

The uncertainty stems from a few factors. It's tariffs, it's political, it's immigration, it's labor. We're going into the slow season. That's going to be uncertain. I'm frozen for at least six months.

It's like we're operating in a hurricane with all these things flying in our faces, and we're just trying to make sure that the kitchen's open and the coffee's warm.

Tariffs are a key reason. But we're also raising prices due to across-the-board cost increases: labor, insurance, coffee, paper goods. Everything is up. Tariffs were the tipping point.

We're raising prices in stages, starting with coffee. Next, we're looking at pastries, packaged drinks, and eventually our food menu. We're reviewing item by item over the next two months and adjusting where the margin hit is greatest. We're not taking a blanket approach — it's strategic and staged.

At Froth, we raised the price of a cappuccino from $4.50 to $4.75. A 12-ounce drip coffee went from $3.00 to $3.15. A cold brew went from $4.75 to $5.00. At Heritage Bikes & Coffee, a cortado went from $4.25 to $4.50. Most changes were in that 5% range, rounded up.

I don't want to bombard everybody, but it needs to be done. Right now, we are just increasing prices on coffee drinks, where we lost a ton of margin, and I needed to recoup some of that. So that's where the first step was. We'll continue to do that throughout the next few months and slowly but surely raise prices where it makes sense.

Raising prices is really hard for me. It's been years since I've done that for coffee. It needed to be done because I see that we're making more revenue, but we have less margin for any profit to pay our folks.

I have a hard time raising prices on my customers, who come in and spend their money on a coffee, bike, service, beer, or food. Growing up, we didn't really go out of our way to go out to coffee or go to the local restaurants. So I know how special that can be. I've always wanted that to be within striking distance of most people.

We debated announcing the increase widely by email, but ultimately decided to explain it directly when asked, which felt more aligned with how we do things.

Reactions have been surprisingly quiet. Most people haven't noticed or haven't said anything. A few regulars asked about the change, and when we explained it was tariff and cost-related, they nodded and moved on. I think people generally understand that everything is getting more expensive.

When I look at what our margins are and how thin they've become in order to operate, I've had to raise those prices.

We cut staff in September due to tariffs, but also to streamline operations in response to thinning margins.

There are some key points where we thought we could run more efficiently. Our margin for labor, it should be a certain point, a certain percentage of your income. We couldn't meet that.

We made operational changes focused on efficiency — eliminating overlapping shifts, reducing prep cook hours, and cutting a few key middle-management roles like kitchen manager, events, and social media.

I'd love to be able to have someone on social media and marketing. It would help business, but I don't think it would help it enough to make up for their salary at this point.

We implemented a hiring freeze in late September due to tariffs and economic uncertainty more broadly. We're being extremely selective so while there may be a few specific roles open (like event-based or part-time), we've halted active recruiting across the company.

People are coming in. People are buying. Even with that, even with great revenue coming in, because coffee prices went up, because paper goods went up, because labor went up, because insurance went up, every line item in our expense sheet has gone up.

When you're operating at thin margins as it is, those matter hugely. So if you're talking about every expense that's gone up throughout your QuickBooks account, no matter how much revenue comes in, unless you have an incredible year, you can't keep up with the expenses unless you raise your prices.

As a group, as a management, we talk about finances weekly. We're planning for those slower months, making sure that we are realistic about the hours we can provide for our staff. We're realistic about what we can offer, what we can buy, just trying to run a skeleton operation until we understand where the other side of this is. I'm not necessarily going to have to take out loans or anything.

I always try to operate within our revenues. As long as we can do that week to week, we keep track of what's going on week to week, we make sure we're running cost of goods, labor within line of a certain formula, we'll be OK. But it's going to get thin for sure.

The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will remain closed until further notice, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday, adding its reopening will depend on Hamas handing over the bodies of deceased hostages as the two sides continued to trade blame over ceasefire violations.

Netanyahu's statement came shortly after the Palestinian embassy in Egypt announced that the Rafah crossing, the main gateway for Gazans to leave and enter the enclave, would reopen on Monday for entry into Gaza.

Netanyahu's government and Hamas have been trading blame over violations of the U.S.-mediated ceasefire for days. Late on Saturday in Washington, the State Department said it had received "credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza."

The State Department said the planned attack against Palestinian civilians would be a "direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement."

"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire," the department said in a statement, without providing further details.

Hamas denied on Sunday accusations of an "imminent attack" or a "violation" of the ceasefire.

It accused Israeli authorities of forming, arming and funding "criminal gangs" that carried out murders, kidnappings and aided looting. 

The Palestinian militant group said police forces in Gaza were performing their duty by pursuing those gangs to hold them accountable. 

"The movement calls on the U.S. administration to stop repeating the occupation's misleading narrative," it added. 

Trump had said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas fails to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal that he brokered.

The militant group has launched a security crackdown in urban areas vacated by Israeli forces, demonstrating its power through public executions and clashes with local armed clans.

Hamas, in a statement late on Saturday, said Netanyahu's decision "constitutes a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a repudiation of the commitments he made to the mediators and guarantor parties."

It also said the continued closure of the Rafah crossing would prevent the entry of equipment needed to search for and locate more hostage bodies under the rubble, and would thus delay the recovery and handover of the remains.

Israel said it received two more bodies late on Saturday, meaning 12 out of 28 bodies have been handed over under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal agreed between Israel and Hamas last week.

The war has caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with nearly all inhabitants driven from their homes, a global hunger monitor confirming famine and health authorities overwhelmed.

The dispute over the return of bodies, and shipments of life-saving humanitarian aid, underlines the fragility of the ceasefire and still has the potential to upset the deal along with other major issues that are included in U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan to end the war. 

As part of the deal, Hamas released all 20 living Israeli hostages it had been holding for two years, in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners jailed in Israel.

But Israel says that Hamas has been too slow to hand over the bodies of deceased hostages it still holds. The militant group says that locating some of the bodies amid the vast destruction in Gaza will take time.

The deal requires Israel to return 360 bodies of Palestinian militants for the deceased Israeli hostages and so far it has handed over 15 bodies in return for each Israeli body it has received.  

Rafah has largely been shut since May 2024. The ceasefire deal also includes the ramping up of aid into the enclave, where hundreds of thousands of people were determined in August to be affected by famine, according to the IPC global hunger monitor. 

After cutting off all supplies for 11 weeks in March, Israel increased aid into Gaza in July, scaling it up further since the ceasefire.

Around 560 metric tons of food had entered Gaza per day on average since the U.S.-brokered truce, but this was still well below the scale of need, according to the U.N. World Food Programme.

Formidable obstacles to Trump's plan to end the war still remain. Key questions of the Hamas disarming, the governance of Gaza, the make-up of an international "stabilization force", and moves towards the creation of a Palestinian state have yet to be resolved.

The federal government shutdown has become the Grinch who stole Halloween for Johnny Jones.

Halloween is typically a big deal for the Jones family — they love to decorate, hand out candy and hot dogs, and enjoy a neighborhood shindig. But Jones, who works for the Transportation Security Administration, isn't getting a paycheck during the shutdown. That means big Halloween plans are out of the budget; so is an outing for his daughter and her friends to the new Taylor Swift movie.

"We're probably another couple of weeks from having to prepare to start selling stuff. I've already started identifying things that I could liquidate easily to get cash," said Jones, who is the president of local 1040 of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union.

Across the country, government workers like Jones are cutting back on subscriptions, canceling vacations, skipping car repairs, pausing kids' dance classes, and delaying credit card payments.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay amid the shutdown, while the Trump administration pushes through new staff cuts. Most employees received one final prorated check this week for the days worked immediately before the shutdown; it could be their last until Congress reaches a funding deal. The same goes for government contractors, which include people working in cafeteria and janitorial roles at federal buildings, on Capitol Hill, and at national museums and historical sites.

Business Insider interviewed more than two dozen workers across agencies and the military. Some said they are dipping into savings, while others worry they won't be able to afford medicine and rent next month. The White House has hinted that furloughed workers and those still on the job may not receive back pay. Meanwhile, thousands of federal employees who received termination notices since the start of the shutdown are left in limbo after an October 15 court ruling temporarily paused their layoffs.

Federal workers told Business Insider that one check can be the difference between paying a bill or going into debt.

A Pew analysis showed that nearly half of government employees earned under $89,000 annually as of March 2024, with 8% earning less than $50,000 — money that goes fast if families are paying for housing, childcare, groceries, and medicine.

"A lot of us are living paycheck to paycheck, like most Americans, but even more so now we have to be cognizant of where every penny is going," Mark Cochran, a furloughed National Park Service employee in Pennsylvania and AFGE Local 3145 president, previously told Business Insider.

One civilian Department of Defense worker has been hitting the phones: They've reached out to their mortgage company and two major banks to see if they can get a loan or forbearance. So far, prospects have been grim.

"My pay covers me through October but if the shutdown continues past October into November I won't have enough savings to pay for the bills," the DoD worker said. It's been a stressful time, they said, as they scramble to get last-minute credit card and loan applications together. They've already applied for a bridge loan from the United States Senate Federal Credit Union. "I just wished that we could get more financial support from these public companies (even major ones) when it was not our fault."

A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employee said they are trying to secure a mortgage loan approval this month, but "that fell through because of the missing paycheck," and a National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee said that they're delaying repairs to their roof and car. One Internal Revenue Service worker said medical challenges would become "drastically more expensive" if they lost their job. Another IRS employee said they're anxious about making credit card and loan payments.

Cochran and others added that they are worried about how their diminished spending will impact small businesses in their community. A few said they are working with colleagues to organize food drives or apply for SNAP and unemployment benefits. 

Just days after the shutdown began, unemployment claims in DC started to spike, while an analysis by The Century Foundation found that around 10,500 federal workers across the country have filed for unemployment since the shutdown began.

Many are looking for stopgaps, too. USAA, which offers interest-free loans equivalent to paychecks for impacted federal workers, said that they've approved and funded nearly $243 million for around 65,000 loans in the first week of opening the program. The Maryland Department of Labor received more than 550 applications between October 6 and October 14 for its federal worker loans. And the Navy Federal Credit Union, which offers a similar program, said that they're "seeing a significant uptick in participation."

"It's very difficult for me to advocate to an employee, 'Hey, take a loan out so you can come to work,'" Jones, the AFGE local 1040 president, said.

Layered on the paycheck uncertainty is whether workers will even have jobs to return to.

A filing from the Office of Management and Budget on October 10 indicated that between 4,132 and 4,232 federal workers were marked for layoffs, with some receiving RIF notices that day. Administration sources told Business Insider that the numbers in the filing are "just a snapshot in time" and OMB head Russell Vought said during an appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show that the layoffs will total about 10,000.

For now, those planned cuts are paused by a court order, and the administration cannot legally enforce layoffs for employees who have already received notices or continue issuing new terminations.

At one agency in particular, employees are feeling whiplash. A few hundred workers at the Centers for Disease Control received RIF notices at the end of last week, then were told over the weekend that they could remain in their posts. An HHS spokesperson told Business Insider that some employees received incorrect notifications and "are not subject to the reduction in force." The CDC union confirmed that "around 700 employees received emails rescinding their illegal terminations. More than 600 workers remain unjustly fired."

A few CDC workers told Business Insider that this lack of job security is having a tangible impact on their lives and financial planning.

"We have an emergency cushion, but I am concerned about how long it's going to go on," one laid-off CDC worker — who wasn't called back — said, "We have talked about selling our house if we need to. We've also talked about tapping into retirement savings as a very last resort."

Another CDC employee mistakenly received the layoff email. They said they're the breadwinner for their family, and have considered cutting back on activities for their kids and applying for an emergency loan. Over the past eight months of DOGE firings and the government shutdown, the employee said they have had "pretty charged conversations about what our life is going to look like" with their spouse.

"I guess it was a bit of relief if I still have a job and I know where my next paycheck is going to come from when the shutdown ends," they said, "But the ground has been shaken beneath us."

Over 200,000 federal workers have lost their jobs, and thousands more have left their government posts through retirement, buyouts, quits, and deferred resignations since Trump took office in January.

Senate Democrats and Republicans have not yet reached a funding agreement to end the government shutdown. "The Trump Administration is encouraging the Democrats to stop the pain and reopen the government with the bipartisan funding proposal they supported just 6 months ago and 13 times under Biden," Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, previously told Business Insider.

Until then, some employees are draining their bank accounts to show up for unpaid shifts until they can't afford it anymore.

"Gas stations don't take IOUs. I talked to a couple employees, they said, 'this is my last fill-up and I won't have any money,' because they don't have credit cards," Jones said. "They're literally like, this is the last tank of gas I'm going to have until I get paid again. I was like, this is just too much. People are asking like, 'Hey, I'd love to come work — but may not have gas money.'"

From tech to airlines, large global companies have been slashing staff as the real-world impact of artificial intelligence plays out, spooking employees. But critics say AI has become an easy excuse for firms looking to downsize.

Last month, tech consultancy firm Accenture announced a restructuring plan that includes quick exits for workers that aren't first able to reskill on AI. Days later, Lufthansa said it was going to eliminate 4,000 jobs by 2030 as it leans on AI to increase efficiency.

Salesforce also laid off 4,000 customer support roles in September, saying that AI can do 50% of the work at the company. Meanwhile, fintech firm Klarna has reduced staff by 40% as it aggressively adopts AI tools.

Language-learning platform Duolingo has stated that it will gradually stop relying on contractors and use AI to fill the gaps.

The headlines are grim, but Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, said there might be more to job cuts than meets the eye.

Previously there may have been some stigma attached to using AI, but now companies are "scapegoating" the technology to take the fall for challenging business moves such as layoffs.

"I'm really skeptical whether the layoffs that we see currently are really due to true efficiency gains. It's rather really a projection into AI in the sense of 'We can use AI to make good excuses,'" Stephany said in an interview with CNBC.

Companies can essentially position themselves at the frontier of AI technology to appear innovative and competitive, and simultaneously conceal the real reasons for layoffs, according to Stephany.

"There might be various other reasons why companies are having to get rid of part of their workforce ... Duolingo or Klarna are really prime candidates for this because there has been overhiring during Corona [Covid-19 pandemic] as well," the professor said.

Some companies that flourished during the pandemic "significantly overhired" and the recent layoffs might just be a "market clearance."

"It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying "we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'" he added.

This pattern has sparked conversation online. One founder, Jean-Christophe Bouglé even said in a popular LinkedIn post that AI adoption is at a "much slower pace" than is being claimed and in large corporations "there's not much happening" with AI projects even being rolled back due to cost or security concerns.

"At the same time there are announcements of big layoff plans 'because of AI.' It looks like a big excuse, in a context where the economy in many countries is slowing down, despite what the incredible performance of stock exchanges suggest," said Bouglé, who co-founded Authentic.ly.

Jasmine Escalera, a careers expert, said this concealment is "feeding the fear of AI" with employees globally concerned about their jobs being replaced as a result of AI.

"So we already know that employees are scared because companies are not being honest, open and communicative about how they're implementing AI," Escalera told CNBC Make It. "Now companies are openly stating 'We're doing this [layoffs] because of AI' so it's feeding the frenzy."

Escalera said big companies need to be more responsible as they set the tone for what's the norm in business decision making and avoid greenlighting "bad behavior."

A Salesforce spokesperson clarified to CNBC that the company deployed its own AI agent, Agentforce, which reduced the number of customer support cases and eliminated the need to "backfill support engineer roles," they said.

"We've successfully redeployed hundreds of employees into other areas like professional services, sales, and customer success," the Salesforce spokesperson added.

Klarna directed CNBC to its co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's comments on X where he explained that the company shrank its workforce from 5,500 to 3,000 people in two years but "AI is only part of that story."

Siemiatkowski linked the workforce reduction to slimming down its analytics team to one "success team," with many then leaving by natural attrition as well as the reduction of the company's customer success team.

Lufthansa and Accenture declined to comment on the matter and did not share any further details on their AI restructuring strategy. Duolingo did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center at Yale University, released a report on Wednesday which showed that U.S. labor has actually been little disrupted by AI automation since the release of ChatGPT in 2022.

The lab examined U.S. labor market data from November 2022 to July 2025 using a "dissimilarity index" which measured how much the occupational mix—the share of workers in different jobs—has shifted since AI's debut and compared it to other technological shifts such as the introduction of computers and the internet. It found that AI hasn't yet caused widespread job losses.

Additionally, New York Fed economists released research in early September which showed that AI use amongst firms "do not point to significant reductions in employment" across the services and manufacturing industry in the New York–Northern New Jersey region.

It found that 40% of service firms said they were using AI this year, up from 25% last year, while manufacturing firms saw a similar jump from 16% last year to 26% this year, but very few were using AI to layoff workers.

Only 1% of the services firm reported AI as the reason for laying off workers in the past six months, down from 10% that had laid off workers using AI in 2024. Meanwhile, 12% of services firms said AI made them hire less workers in 2025.

By contrast, 35% of services firms have used AI to retrain employees and 11% have hired more as a result.

Stephany said there isn't much evidence from his research that shows large levels of technological unemployment due to AI.

"Economists call this structural unemployment, so the pie of work is not big enough for everybody anymore and so people will lose jobs definitely because of of AI, I don't think that this is happening on a mass scale," he said.

He added that concerns about technology putting an end to human work can be seen throughout history.

"It reoccurred this century alone a dozen times, you can go back to ancient times where Roman emperors put hold to certain machines because they were worried about this and always the contrary happened. The machine made companies, industries more productive.

"It allowed for the emergence of entirely new jobs. If you think about the internet 20 years ago, nobody would have known what a social media influencer is, what an app developer is because it didn't exist."

In the midst of today's AI hysteria, have we forgotten about blockchain technology and the seductive Web3 promise of decentralization? Robbie Bach, longtime Xbox chief and lieutenant of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, certainly hasn't. In his new novel, The Blockchain Syndicate, the prescient Bach imagines not only a giant political crypto grift, but also warns about the siren song of Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). No, blockchain might not be as sexy or lucrative as LLMs these days - but Web3 still matters even if, as Bach suggests, its promise of a decentralized network remains more seductive than substantive.









1. Crypto as “Giant Grift” Bach views cryptocurrency as a highly risky, speculative investment vehicle comparable to commodities like gold or silver, but warns there's “definitely a giant grift” happening, with vulnerable people—particularly older investors putting their savings at risk—being exploited by those taking advantage of the crypto craze.

2. AI Bubble Will Burst (But Not Catastrophically) Bach believes we're in an AI investment bubble where valuations are unsustainable. He predicts a “sorting” of winners and losers over the next 12-18 months, with many AI investments failing to pay out, though he avoids the term “explosive pop” in favor of a more gradual reckoning.

3. Blockchain: Powerful Tool, Double-Edged Sword Despite AI hype, Bach argues blockchain remains highly relevant and current. He sees it as neither inherently good nor bad—just a tool that can be used for legitimate purposes or criminal ones. He's particularly intrigued by its dual nature: ultimate transparency yet also ultimate obfuscation through anonymity.

4. Microsoft's Secret Weapon: Adaptability Bach credits Microsoft's longevity to its ability to make “tectonic shifts” across generations—from DOS to Windows, to cloud computing, to AI. He argues this skill at navigating massive transitions under Gates, Ballmer, and Nadella is more impressive than any single product innovation.

5. FBI and CIA Are Irreplaceable Bach emphasizes that regardless of political views about current leadership, institutions like the FBI and CIA are essential for national security with no viable replacement. If they're not working well, the solution is to fix them, not abandon them—a theme central to his thriller's premise.

Oops, something went wrong

Professor Andrew Urquhart is Professor of Finance and Financial Technology and Head of the Department of Finance at Birmingham Business School (BBS).

This is the ninth installment of the Professor Coin column, in which I bring important insights from published academic literature on cryptocurrencies to the Decrypt readership. In this article, I discuss Bitcoin energy usage, and the future for sustainable cryptos.

When you hear the words “Bitcoin mining,” you might picture giant warehouses packed with whirring computers, gobbling up electricity like there's no tomorrow. That image isn't far from reality.

Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, its proof-of-work (PoW) system has been both its greatest strength and its biggest controversy. It keeps the network secure and decentralized, but it also ties digital finance to very real energy and environmental costs.

Professor Coin: What Gives Bitcoin Its Value?

The go-to benchmark is the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), which estimates that Bitcoin mining consumes electricity on the scale of mid-sized countries. But here's the catch: Bitcoin's energy use doesn't rise smoothly. Instead, it follows market cycles. When Bitcoin's price surges, miners switch on more rigs, pushing up hashrate, difficulty, and electricity demand. When prices dip, older or less efficient machines go dark.

Stoll, Klaaßen and Gallersdörfer (2019) pegged annual consumption around 46 TWh back then, with ~22 megatons of CO₂ emissions More recently, new data suggests that consumption has grown substantially.

According to the 2025 Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report, Bitcoin's annual electricity usage is now estimated at 138 TWh, with network-wide emissions of approximately 39.8 Mt CO₂e. The same report also notes that 52.4 % of the energy used by miners comes from sustainable sources (renewables + nuclear) as of 2025.

These updated figures help us see that while Bitcoin's environmental footprint remains significant, the composition of its energy mix is also shifting—offering a more nuanced narrative for 2025.

How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Really Use? Less Than You Might Think

New research asks a broader question: what's the total environmental cost? A 2023 paper by Chamanara et al. (2023) estimates Bitcoin mining at ~173 TWh, adding in CO₂, water, and land impacts.

Meanwhile, the UN University warned that mining draws heavily on freshwater in regions with scarce supply. And it's not just the running of machines: de Vries (2021) estimated tens of kilotons of e-waste annually from discarded ASIC rigs, since miners churn through hardware every couple of years. This holistic picture means Bitcoin's footprint is now seen as multi-dimensional: electricity, emissions, water, land, and waste.

Here's where the story gets interesting. Not every blockchain guzzles energy like Bitcoin. In September 2022, Ethereum's Merge replaced PoW with proof-of-stake (PoS). Overnight, its energy use dropped by ~99.9%. Same user experience, radically different environmental profile. This one move showed the world that crypto doesn't have to be a climate villain.

What is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work

Ethereum's success has raised uncomfortable questions for Bitcoin. If another major chain can deliver security and functionality without the same energy burn, should Bitcoin follow?

Purists say no: PoW is what gives Bitcoin its incorruptible, apolitical security. Critics counter that clinging to PoW risks political backlash, carbon taxes, or even outright bans in certain jurisdictions.

Not all miners are environmental bad actors. Some argue they are part of the solution, not the problem. In Texas, mining farms strike deals with grid operators, curtailing power when demand spikes. In Iceland and Canada, miners plug into cheap hydropower. Recent engineering research even explores using mining to monetize excess methane from landfills or stranded renewables that would otherwise be wasted.

Elon Musk Gushes About Bitcoin 'Energy' Demands—Years After Environmental Gripes

The optimistic narrative goes like this: Bitcoin mining could act as a “buyer of last resort” for surplus green energy, smoothing out variability in solar and wind production. Studies like Hossain & Steigner (2024) and others suggest that, under the right conditions, mining could become an economic driver for renewable projects.

But the jury is still out—whether miners truly accelerate the green transition or just opportunistically chase cheap power depends on location, incentives, and regulation.

So where does that leave us in 2025? Here are the big takeaways:

Bitcoin's footprint is real and significant. We're not just talking electricity, but also carbon, water, land, and e-waste.

Design matters. Ethereum's Merge proved that PoS can slash energy costs without breaking a network. Bitcoin, by contrast, has doubled down on PoW.

Nuance is needed. Not all mining is equal—coal-based rigs in Kazakhstan are very different from hydro-powered farms in Quebec.

Policy pressure is rising. Expect governments to ask not just “how much power?” but “what kind of power, where, and with what externalities?”

Bitcoin will always carry the energy question with it. Whether it becomes a climate villain or an unlikely green ally depends on choices made by miners, policymakers, and communities in the next few years.

For now, one truth is clear: in crypto, the invisible isn't weightless. The future of digital money is tied, quite literally, to the power grid.

Oops, something went wrong

Professor Andrew Urquhart is Professor of Finance and Financial Technology and Head of the Department of Finance at Birmingham Business School (BBS).

This is the ninth installment of the Professor Coin column, in which I bring important insights from published academic literature on cryptocurrencies to the Decrypt readership. In this article, I discuss Bitcoin energy usage, and the future for sustainable cryptos.

When you hear the words “Bitcoin mining,” you might picture giant warehouses packed with whirring computers, gobbling up electricity like there's no tomorrow. That image isn't far from reality.

Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, its proof-of-work (PoW) system has been both its greatest strength and its biggest controversy. It keeps the network secure and decentralized, but it also ties digital finance to very real energy and environmental costs.

Professor Coin: What Gives Bitcoin Its Value?

The go-to benchmark is the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), which estimates that Bitcoin mining consumes electricity on the scale of mid-sized countries. But here's the catch: Bitcoin's energy use doesn't rise smoothly. Instead, it follows market cycles. When Bitcoin's price surges, miners switch on more rigs, pushing up hashrate, difficulty, and electricity demand. When prices dip, older or less efficient machines go dark.

Stoll, Klaaßen and Gallersdörfer (2019) pegged annual consumption around 46 TWh back then, with ~22 megatons of CO₂ emissions More recently, new data suggests that consumption has grown substantially.

According to the 2025 Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report, Bitcoin's annual electricity usage is now estimated at 138 TWh, with network-wide emissions of approximately 39.8 Mt CO₂e. The same report also notes that 52.4 % of the energy used by miners comes from sustainable sources (renewables + nuclear) as of 2025.

These updated figures help us see that while Bitcoin's environmental footprint remains significant, the composition of its energy mix is also shifting—offering a more nuanced narrative for 2025.

How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Really Use? Less Than You Might Think

New research asks a broader question: what's the total environmental cost? A 2023 paper by Chamanara et al. (2023) estimates Bitcoin mining at ~173 TWh, adding in CO₂, water, and land impacts.

Meanwhile, the UN University warned that mining draws heavily on freshwater in regions with scarce supply. And it's not just the running of machines: de Vries (2021) estimated tens of kilotons of e-waste annually from discarded ASIC rigs, since miners churn through hardware every couple of years. This holistic picture means Bitcoin's footprint is now seen as multi-dimensional: electricity, emissions, water, land, and waste.

Here's where the story gets interesting. Not every blockchain guzzles energy like Bitcoin. In September 2022, Ethereum's Merge replaced PoW with proof-of-stake (PoS). Overnight, its energy use dropped by ~99.9%. Same user experience, radically different environmental profile. This one move showed the world that crypto doesn't have to be a climate villain.

What is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work

Ethereum's success has raised uncomfortable questions for Bitcoin. If another major chain can deliver security and functionality without the same energy burn, should Bitcoin follow?

Purists say no: PoW is what gives Bitcoin its incorruptible, apolitical security. Critics counter that clinging to PoW risks political backlash, carbon taxes, or even outright bans in certain jurisdictions.

Not all miners are environmental bad actors. Some argue they are part of the solution, not the problem. In Texas, mining farms strike deals with grid operators, curtailing power when demand spikes. In Iceland and Canada, miners plug into cheap hydropower. Recent engineering research even explores using mining to monetize excess methane from landfills or stranded renewables that would otherwise be wasted.

Elon Musk Gushes About Bitcoin 'Energy' Demands—Years After Environmental Gripes

The optimistic narrative goes like this: Bitcoin mining could act as a “buyer of last resort” for surplus green energy, smoothing out variability in solar and wind production. Studies like Hossain & Steigner (2024) and others suggest that, under the right conditions, mining could become an economic driver for renewable projects.

But the jury is still out—whether miners truly accelerate the green transition or just opportunistically chase cheap power depends on location, incentives, and regulation.

So where does that leave us in 2025? Here are the big takeaways:

Bitcoin's footprint is real and significant. We're not just talking electricity, but also carbon, water, land, and e-waste.

Design matters. Ethereum's Merge proved that PoS can slash energy costs without breaking a network. Bitcoin, by contrast, has doubled down on PoW.

Nuance is needed. Not all mining is equal—coal-based rigs in Kazakhstan are very different from hydro-powered farms in Quebec.

Policy pressure is rising. Expect governments to ask not just “how much power?” but “what kind of power, where, and with what externalities?”

Bitcoin will always carry the energy question with it. Whether it becomes a climate villain or an unlikely green ally depends on choices made by miners, policymakers, and communities in the next few years.

For now, one truth is clear: in crypto, the invisible isn't weightless. The future of digital money is tied, quite literally, to the power grid.

Trading instruments

Powerful tools

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic and ever-evolving ecosystem, characterized by sharp price movements and emerging trends. Among the most discussed phenomena are altcoin reversals and Bitcoin's stabilizing influence on the broader market. This article provides an in-depth analysis of these topics, exploring whale accumulation, technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and more to help you navigate the current crypto landscape.

Whale accumulation, where large investors or institutions purchase significant amounts of cryptocurrencies during market dips, is a critical factor in altcoin reversals. This behavior often signals confidence in a potential market rebound. Here's what you need to know:

Altcoins in Focus: Cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Cardano, and emerging tokens like Broccoli have experienced increased whale activity. This accumulation often precedes price reversals, as it reflects strong demand at lower price levels.

Market Implications: Whale activity can create upward pressure on prices, particularly for altcoins with smaller market capitalizations. This trend is frequently accompanied by higher trading volumes, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment.

Technical analysis is a powerful tool for identifying potential trend reversals in altcoins. Key metrics and patterns to monitor include:

Bullish Divergences: When an altcoin's price forms lower lows while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) forms higher lows, it often indicates a potential reversal.

Resistance Levels: Breaking through critical resistance levels can signal a shift from bearish to bullish momentum. For instance, altcoins like XRP and Solana have recently shown signs of recovery due to such technical patterns.

Moving Averages: The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are widely used to identify long-term trends. A "golden cross" (when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA) is often seen as a bullish signal.

Global economic conditions significantly influence the cryptocurrency market. Key macroeconomic factors currently shaping market trends include:

Federal Reserve Policies: Interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve impact market liquidity. Rate cuts often lead to increased risk appetite, benefiting cryptocurrencies.

Geopolitical Tensions: Events such as the U.S.-China trade war drive investors toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin, which are perceived as a hedge against traditional market instability.

Institutional Inflows: The growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs highlights increasing institutional participation, adding credibility and liquidity to the market.

Bitcoin often acts as a stabilizing force in the cryptocurrency market, influencing investor confidence and altcoin performance. Here's why:

Key Support Levels: Bitcoin's ability to maintain critical support levels, such as $110,000, provides a psychological anchor for the market. When Bitcoin holds strong, it boosts investor confidence, encouraging altcoin participation.

Correlation with Traditional Assets: Bitcoin's correlation with gold has weakened recently. While gold prices have declined, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, further solidifying its position as a unique asset class.

The altcoin market is buzzing with innovative projects offering unique solutions and utility-driven use cases. Notable mentions include:

Tapzi: A Web3 gaming ecosystem designed to capitalize on the growing gaming industry.

Bitcoin Hyper: A Bitcoin Layer 2 solution leveraging Solana's technology for faster and cheaper transactions.

MAGACOIN FINANCE: A project gaining attention for its presale opportunities and potential for high returns.

While these projects show promise, thorough research is essential before engaging with any emerging altcoin.

Market sentiment and on-chain data provide valuable insights into the state of the cryptocurrency market. Key indicators include:

Fear and Greed Index: Currently in the "fear" zone, this metric historically precedes market recoveries, suggesting a potential buying opportunity.

MVRV Ratios: The Market Value to Realized Value ratio helps identify overbought or oversold conditions. Current levels suggest the market may be nearing a bottom.

Stablecoin Dominance: Rising stablecoin market caps often indicate increased liquidity, which can drive momentum in the crypto market.

Ethereum and Solana continue to attract significant institutional interest due to their robust ecosystems and innovative partnerships:

Ethereum: The upcoming ETF inflows and its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) make Ethereum a top choice for institutional investors.

Solana: Partnerships such as the Uniswap integration highlight Solana's growing influence in the crypto space, further boosting investor confidence.

The cryptocurrency market is a complex yet rewarding space for informed investors. Altcoin reversals, Bitcoin's stabilizing role, and macroeconomic factors are just a few elements shaping the current landscape. By leveraging tools like technical analysis and on-chain metrics, you can better navigate this ever-evolving market.

While the potential for high returns exists, the crypto market remains highly volatile. Always approach with caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.

At Token 2049 in Singapore, Matthew Graham, founder of Ryze Labs, delivered one of the event's most provocative keynotes: a vision of a world where every human has a digital twin, an AI version of themselves that can think and even feel like them.

In an interview with CCN fresh from that keynote, Graham explored the complex future of living with that technology.

As AI continues to enter our lives in completely unexpected ways, with Sam Altman even recently announcing that OpenAI will allow erotica soon, how can society balance the emotional boundaries and ethics when intertwining so closely with technology?

Graham believes the human factor is infiltrating AI and that people are already relating to language models as if they were sentient.

“Have you ever found yourself saying please or thank you to Google?” he asked.

“Probably not, right? But you may have, and I think many people have, found themselves communicating to LLMs … in a way that is highly personal.”

For Graham, that subtle politeness signals something deeper: a shift in how humans see and speak to technology.

“It's a fundamentally different way that we're interacting with technology, which I find super fascinating,” he said.

Beyond politeness, Graham is exploring what happens when those interactions evolve into extensions of self.

Ryze Labs has been experimenting with “digital twins,” AI versions of individuals capable of holding conversations and managing aspects of their digital lives.

“What we're talking about is extending humans into the digital realm, an extension of ourselves, a digital twin of ourselves with us being the analog twin,” he said.

Graham describes a near-term world in which a person's twin could field questions from colleagues, comfort a parent, or schedule meetings while its human counterpart sleeps.

“Your away message is your digital twin,” he said. “It'll kind of feel like me. It'll have my personality.”

To make the concept tangible, Graham has even named his own digital twin “Marty,” a joking nod to common typos of his name.

Yet the exercise reflects serious thinking about identity and control in the age of AI.

The founder views technology as “fundamentally amoral — not moral, not immoral, but amoral — having no moral characteristics until applied.”

Still, he warns that the psychological effects of constant AI interaction could be profound.

“I firmly believe AI psychosis is a real thing,” he said, citing early examples of people forming unhealthy emotional attachments to large language models.

“We're already seeing both the extraordinary and the really quite dangerous.”

Graham likens the coming wave of AI dependence to humanity's fixation on smartphones and social media.

“We're also addicted to our phones,” he said. “AI will be no different — a double-edged sword.”

On privacy, Graham remained blunt, stating most users underestimate how much they've already shared.

“Sam Altman has my nudes basically,” he joked. “It's not ideal, but if I'm being honest, he does.”

Behind the humor, however, a serious warning lay underneath.

“The stakes from a privacy perspective have never been higher,” he said.

That warning takes on new weight as OpenAI prepares  to allow erotic content on its platform, a decision that blurs the boundary between human intimacy and digital companionship.

If large language models are soon to host or simulate erotic interaction, the question of who owns and secures those data becomes far more pressing.

Graham believes blockchain technology offers one path forward: encrypting personal data and giving individuals ownership of their digital twins.

“This is again a crypto story,” he said. “All these privacy protections can be on-chain and immutable.”

For him, the convergence of AI and crypto isn't just technical; it's a matter of autonomy in an era where digital intimacy may soon be mediated and monetized by machines.

That crossover between AI and blockchain is where Ryze Labs is betting big.

“We are extremely focused at the intersection of AI and crypto,” Graham said.

He pointed to Amiko, a startup backed by Ryze Labs, which recently pivoted toward digital-twin technology and “AI social” experiences.

“They are squarely focused on digital twins and AI companions,” he said. “I think it has potential to be a smash hit.”

Despite the risks, Graham remains cautiously optimistic.

“Technology has ripped apart the fabric of society in a lot of ways,” he said. “But it can be extremely helpful to solving many of these problems as well.”

He returns to his central premise, that technology itself is neutral, but humans are not.

“It's really up to us to steer the ship,” he said. “Technology is amoral. That's my fundamental view.”

The world's biggest fintech conference just wrapped in Mumbai with over 100,000 attendees, more than 800 speakers, and one glaring omission: any meaningful discussion of cryptocurrencies or stablecoins—despite Bitcoin hitting an all-time high above $125,000 the same week.

At the three-day Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai that kicked off Oct. 7, organizers instructed speakers to steer clear of "political, crypto, religious, or personal remarks on stage or at the venue," Reuters reported, citing a document containing speaker guidelines.

India is leaning towards not creating legislation to regulate the crypto sector, a stark contrast to the approach taken by Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, which have actively courted cryptocurrency and stablecoin businesses.

Instead of embracing digital currencies, Indian regulators spotlighted the country's central bank digital currency, called the e-rupee, with the Reserve Bank of India launching pilots for deposit tokenisation and a sandbox for fintechs. More than 50 products debuted at the event, including PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) global wallet platform and biometric authentication for payments, but crypto remained conspicuously absent.

“The policy ambivalence has a chilling effect on the development of commercial use cases for stablecoins in India,” Delhi-based Black Dot Public Policy Advisors Founder Mandar Kagade told Reuters.

The numbers tell a compelling story about what's at stake. U.S. dollar stablecoins have amassed a market capitalization of over $300 billion, while the overall crypto market cap has climbed to more than $4 trillion. Meanwhile, India's fintech sector raised just $3.5 billion last year, the lowest since 2020 and well off the peak of $9.2 billion in 2021.

At least six industry executives said that while entering the crypto sector could offer fresh business lines and help attract investment, there is little appetite in the absence of regulatory blessing.

“There is cause for fair degree of caution on stablecoins,” Reserve Bank of India Innovation Hub CEO Sahil Kini said while addressing the Oct. 7 session. “I don't think this kind of stance changes overnight.”

The regulatory vacuum isn't just stifling innovation—it's driving talent overseas. “It's becoming real whether we like it or not, so it's imperative to figure out how to engage with it,” independent consultant Vivekdeep Gupta told Reuters.

Gupta pointed to a “huge amount of energy but lack of regulatory clarity is also causing brain-drain,” noting a preference for companies in the sector to incorporate overseas.

Mumbai-based venture capital firm Blume Ventures Vice President Joseph Sebastian suggested a measured path forward. “Regulators need to have an iterative approach instead of the complete aversion they have towards stablecoins currently,” he told Reuters. “The first step can be allowing inward remittances via U.S. dollar stablecoins as the regulatory grey-zone also complicates the picture for startups and investors.”

The silence at India's marquee fintech event speaks volumes: while the rest of the world debates how to regulate crypto, India has effectively decided not to participate in the conversation at all. For investors watching India's massive market, that absence may prove more significant than any policy statement.

Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering a landmark reform that could let banks buy and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin – a move that might finally bring traditional finance and crypto under one roof.

KEY POINTS:
➡️ Japan's FSA is considering reforms that would let banks trade and hold Bitcoin, signaling a major step toward institutional crypto adoption.
➡️ Over 12M crypto accounts in Japan highlight strong retail demand as regulators move to make the market safer and more transparent.
➡️ Institutional entry could fuel growth for the best altcoins, especially projects with real-world utility and scalable infrastructure.
➡️ Bitcoin Hyper, Best Wallet Token, and Remittix stand out as early movers ready to benefit from Japan's upcoming crypto wave.

With over 12M crypto accounts already open in Japan (3.5x more than five years ago), the country's appetite for digital assets is undeniable.

The FSA's plan includes letting banks register as licensed crypto exchange operators and creating a new ‘Crypto Bureau' to oversee the sector.

If banks and large investors gain access to crypto, they won't just buy Bitcoin and Ethereum – they'll look for scalable, utility-driven projects with strong fundamentals.

That could put the spotlight on the best altcoins and early crypto presales poised to grow as institutional money flows in.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a real Layer-2 built to transform the world's biggest cryptocurrency from a ‘store of value' into a living, breathing ecosystem.

Using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers sub-second transactions and near-zero gas fees, creating a place where payments, DeFi, dApps, and even meme coins can finally thrive on Bitcoin.



Think of it as Bitcoin's execution layer, where speed, interoperability, and culture meet.

Developers can build directly on top of Bitcoin Hyper, while users enjoy seamless cross-chain movement between Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and beyond. It's a full-blown blockchain designed for builders, degens, and institutions alike.

And if Japan's banks start entering the crypto scene, infrastructure-grade projects like HYPER could be the first to feel the institutional lift.

Get in early on real Bitcoin innovation with Bitcoin Hyper.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the backbone of a rapidly expanding ecosystem built for the next wave of crypto adoption.

While its parent platform, Best Wallet, delivers a sleek multi-chain experience, the $BEST token powers everything inside it – from reduced transaction fees and staking rewards to early access to new crypto presales and exclusive project launches.

Holding $BEST means being part of a growing economy rather than a single app.

Token holders enjoy premium benefits and governance rights, positioning them at the center of the platform's growth.



The project's ‘Upcoming Tokens' feature, which lets users join presales safely from within the app, directly drives $BEST's demand – every new project and transaction strengthens the token's utility.

Right now, you can buy $BEST for $0.025815. With $16.5M raised in presale, $BEST is attracting both retail and institutional interest.

If Japanese banks begin entering crypto markets, tokens tied to real utility and adoption, like $BEST, could surge in relevance.

Grab $BEST now to secure your stake in the next big crypto economy.

Remittix ($RTX) is redefining how money moves across borders.

Built as a PayFi protocol, it connects crypto wallets and traditional bank accounts in over 30 countries, offering lightning-fast transfers, minimal fees, and real exchange-rate transparency.



Instead of relying on slow, outdated SWIFT networks, Remittix uses blockchain rails to settle payments in seconds – all while keeping compliance and KYC frameworks bank-friendly.

As the FSA considers letting banks trade and hold crypto, projects like Remittix could bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, turning what's now experimental into everyday financial infrastructure.

At $0.1166 per token and $27.5M raised in presale, Remittix has quickly become one of the best altcoins in the payments niche. It's a potential backbone for the next generation of cross-border finance.

Get into $RTX early and ride the wave as PayFi meets institutional crypto adoption.

If you're scanning the horizon for the best altcoins ready to benefit from the institutional wave, $HYPER, $BEST and $RTX offer distinct angles – infrastructure, utility wallet and finance-payments respectively.

Top crypto to buy conversations always begin with regret. How many people ignored Bitcoin (BTC) at $100 or thought Binance Coin (BNB) was just another exchange token? Fast forward to Q4 2025, and those “maybe later” people are scrolling through price charts instead of portfolios. Now, LivLive ($LIVE) has entered the spotlight and could finally be that rare second chance people wait their whole lives for.

In October 2025, crypto markets are buzzing again with new opportunities. LivLive ($LIVE) is doing more than creating a token; it's building a real-world operating system that turns everyday actions into rewards. While BNB and other major coins are in recovery mode, $LIVE is quietly setting itself up as the top crypto to buy for those tired of missing golden chances.

Back when Binance Coin (BNB) launched, few believed it could become anything valuable. Priced at just $0.10, it was seen as another “exchange-only” token. Today, that same BNB touched nearly $690, transforming early believers into millionaires. Those who bought at launch didn't just make gains, they changed their financial destiny forever.

The regret runs deep for those who dismissed it. Many called it too risky, too new, or too uncertain. Yet while doubters hesitated, a handful of bold community members quietly built life-changing wealth. That's the painful beauty of crypto: hesitation is often the most expensive choice. But the market keeps giving new chances to rewrite the story. And right now, LivLive ($LIVE) looks like the chapter that latecomers have been waiting for.

LivLive ($LIVE) isn't another pump-and-dump token. It's a real-world operating system that turns daily actions into digital rewards. Walking, shopping, attending events, or leaving reviews can now earn $LIVE tokens. Instead of scrolling aimlessly, people can earn through living actively.

This project merges AR, blockchain, and wearable tech to make engagement profitable. Every step or scan becomes proof of action that creates value. With transparent tokenomics and lifestyle-based rewards, LivLive is quickly being recognized as the top crypto to buy for those who missed earlier moonshots like BNB and now want a token tied to real-life value.

The LivLive presale already shows strong traction. Stage 1 launched at $0.02, raising over $2 million USD with 94+ holders in its first round. Stage 2 increases to $0.04, while the official launch price is projected at $0.25, signaling a potential 1,150% ROI even before public trading begins.

By using the Bonus Code: EARLY30, community members can grab an additional 30% $LIVE tokens. With 65% of supply for the people (25% presale + 40% mining) and only 5% for the team, the tokenomics scream fairness and long-term commitment.

Key benefits include:

Here's the math: a $5,000 entry during Stage 1 could grow to $62,500 at launch, not counting bonuses and mining rewards. With growing media attention and social traction, LivLive ($LIVE) proves why it's the top crypto to buy in October 2025.

It absolutely deserves that title. LivLive ($LIVE) has combined real-world functionality with blockchain efficiency.

NFT trading has emerged as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, generating millions of dollars in trading volume across various platforms and blockchains. Despite market fluctuations, the NFT space continues to thrive, driven by innovation, new trends, and increasing user adoption. This article delves into the latest developments in NFT trading, analyzes key trends, and highlights insights shaping the future of this dynamic market.

OpenSea, once recognized solely as an NFT marketplace, has evolved into a multi-chain crypto trading aggregator. This strategic transformation enables users to trade NFTs, memecoins, and other cryptocurrencies across 22 blockchains. The impact of this shift has been profound, with OpenSea reporting a resurgence in trading volume, reaching $2.6 billion in October 2023. Notably, 90% of this volume stemmed from token trading, underscoring the platform's diversification strategy.

OpenSea's multi-chain approach enhances accessibility and trading options for users.

The platform's focus on self-custodial trading simplifies the experience, making it as intuitive as traditional financial apps.

OpenSea's airdrop campaign for its upcoming token boosted low-value NFT trades, increasing sales volume by 29% in Q3 2025.

Base, Coinbase's layer-2 network, has emerged as a formidable competitor in the NFT space. Over the past 30 days, Base experienced a 70% surge in NFT trading volume, reaching $47.67 million. This growth has allowed Base to surpass established competitors like Immutable and Solana, solidifying its position as a rising star in the blockchain ecosystem.

Seamless integration with decentralized applications (dApps) has driven user engagement.

Competitive transaction fees and scalability make Base an attractive option for NFT traders.

The network's focus on fostering innovation has contributed to its rapid adoption.

The NFT market experienced significant growth in Q3 2025, with sales reaching 18.1 million—a 45% increase from Q2. This surge generated $1.6 billion in trading volume, reflecting renewed interest in the sector. Additionally, the number of unique wallets trading NFTs rose from 1.66 million in Q1 2025 to 2.14 million in Q3, with wallets doubling their trading activity.

Increased adoption of NFTs in sports, collectibles, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

Innovative trading strategies, such as NFT micro-strategies, are attracting new users.

Platforms like OpenSea and Base are making NFT trading more accessible and efficient.

While gaming-related NFTs experienced a decline in Q3 2025, with trading volume dropping by 17% and transaction numbers falling by 32%, sports NFTs have seen a remarkable resurgence. Trading volume for sports NFTs spiked by 337%, reaching $71 million, while sales increased by 143%.

Partnerships with major sports leagues and athletes are boosting visibility.

Fans are increasingly engaging with tokenized sports memorabilia and experiences.

The rise of fantasy sports and gamified NFT platforms is attracting new audiences.

Profile Picture (PFP) NFTs, such as CryptoPunks, Moonbirds, and Pudgy Penguins, have become a dominant force in the NFT market. In Q3 2025, PFP NFTs saw a 187% increase in trading volume, reaching $544 million.

Their cultural significance and community-driven value make them highly desirable.

Limited supply and high demand create a sense of exclusivity.

Integration with social media platforms enhances their utility and visibility.

The NFT market is evolving beyond collectibles, with increasing integration into decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenized real-world assets. For instance, Courtyard NFTs tokenize physical collectible cards, bridging the gap between digital and physical assets. In Q3 2025, Courtyard NFTs sold 1.55 million items, generating over $145 million in transaction volume.

Tokenized RWAs provide a new avenue for asset ownership and trading.

DeFi protocols enable automated trading strategies, such as TokenWorks' PunkStrategy, which allows exposure to high-value NFTs like CryptoPunks.

These innovations are attracting both retail and institutional investors.

Despite its growth, the NFT market faces challenges, such as the collapse of the art NFT sector. Trading volume for art NFTs has dropped by 93% since its 2021 peak, falling from $2.9 billion to $23.8 million in Q1 2025. However, this decline has prompted a shift toward sustainability and long-term value creation.

Emerging trends like NFT micro-strategies and tokenized RWAs are driving innovation.

Sports and PFP NFTs are attracting new user demographics.

Blockchain advancements, particularly on Ethereum, Polygon, and Base, are enhancing scalability and reducing costs.

NFT trading continues to generate millions in volume, driven by innovation, diversification, and user adoption. Platforms like OpenSea and Base are leading the charge, while new trends such as sports NFTs, PFPs, and tokenized RWAs are reshaping the market.

Crypto prices remain fairly stable on Sunday as Bitcoin and Ethereum trade within ranges near break-even, a situation welcomed by traders after over $1 billion of liquidations rattled the market again on Friday, and a historic $19 billion liquidation caused upheaval the Friday before.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $106,400, while Ethereum is at $3,800. Bitcoin's price has fallen by 8.8% over the past month, and Ethereum's by 14%. However, with the market appearing to stabilize, is a bullish reversal on the horizon, or will there be more pain first?

Bitcoin price predictions suggest that bulls could soon take charge, with liquidity zones and on-chain activity signalling that selling is slowing, and short traders are at risk of being wiped out.

Ethereum's outlook is also bright, with SEC chair Paul Atkis recently acknowledging its ERC-3643 standard, a framework that encodes regulatory compliance directly into tokens. Meanwhile, a new Bitcoin Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper, has just exceeded $24 million in funding in its presale, signaling that another major player could be emerging.

Bitcoin fell to $104,000 on Friday, which was a four-month low for the market-leading asset. However, investors quickly swooped in and took advantage of the discount.

Glassnode posted on X that small Bitcoin holders (between 1 and 1000 BTC) “stepped up” to buy BTC on the dip, while large holders slowed their selling. According to the data analytics firm, this indicates “renewed confidence despite the recent shakeout.”

Adding to this outlook, data from the Glassnode platform shows a strong liquidation cluster of short positions above $113,000, with over $400 million set to be wiped out at $113,718 – $113,842 – and that's just on the Binance exchange alone.



Generally, the price moves into zones with the most liquidity, indicating that $113,000 could be the next target for BTC. However, some analysts believe the BTC uptrend will expand well beyond $113,000, with Friedrich noting that it's currently rebounding on a key long-term support level and that this could propel it to $135,000 in the weeks ahead.

In a recent speech, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins discussed how compliance requirements could be encoded into smart contracts, using ERC-3643 as an example. This marks a subtle yet significant hint about how regulators view blockchain standards as a way to ensure on-chain compliance in a typically permissionless environment. 

“These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643,” he said.

With Ethereum's ERC-3643 token standard, compliance becomes programmable – token issuers can embed regulatory-adherent code on-chain, allowing only verified and authorized wallets to hold or transfer the asset. This can ensure alignment with KYC, AML, and securities laws without relying on intermediaries. If conditions aren't met, the transaction doesn't proceed.

Coinlaw data estimates that the value of tokenized real-world assets will reach $5.5 trillion by 2029, representing a 43% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from the time the forecast was made. Ethereum's ERC-3643 standard and its support from regulators could make it a major beneficiary of this growth. 



Traditionally, Bitcoin has been excluded from such discussions due to its lack of programmability. However, projects like Bitcoin Hyper aim to change that with smart contract-enabled Layer 2 networks.

Bitcoin Hyper is creating the world's first ZK-rollup-based Bitcoin Layer 2, advancing beyond previous Bitcoin scaling solutions that used sidechains or federated bridges – and so don't fully inherit Bitcoin's base-layer security.

The project runs on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for execution, enabling smart contract support and the ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. It will periodically send its state back to the Bitcoin Layer 1, where transactions are stored, making Bitcoin Hyper as immutable and neutral as Bitcoin itself.



There's also a trustless canonical bridge that allows BTC transfers to and from the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2, providing seamless access for Bitcoin holders.

Currently in a presale to fund development, Bitcoin Hyper recently exceeded $24 million raised, marking an important milestone that shows strong community support and massive potential for demand once it lists on the open market.

This has attracted attention from top crypto analysts, with RJ from Cryptonews describing HYPER as “the next 100x project when the market recovers.”

With Bitcoin expected to rebound and Ethereum strengthening its position in the RWA space, crypto prospects look bright, so Bitcoin Hyper could be launching at just the right time.

The current HYPER presale price is $0.013135, but this won't last long as price increases are scheduled to occur throughout the campaign, and the next is in under one day.







Crypto assets that show resilience during a broad market downturn tend to have strong latent demand, making them excellent bets for when the market outlook improves. Ethena (ENA) fits the bill perfectly.  While most large-cap assets are in the red and Bitcoin is down nearly 4%, the Ethena price is up 30% over the past […]

Snorter ($SNORT), a new Solana trading bot, is closing its token presale tomorrow (20 October), having now raised over $5 million from early backers. The project aims to disrupt the trading bot space and become the leading choice for Solana meme coin traders, offering unparalleled features, easy access via Telegram, and the lowest fees on […]

For years, the idea of U.S. states investing directly in Bitcoin or crypto ETFs seemed distant, but that reality may soon change. After the first attempt failed earlier this year, Florida has introduced a revised digital asset bill that could finally open the door for institutional-level Bitcoin exposure at the state level.  The proposed legislation […]

Crypto prices have faced significant selling pressure over recent days, owing to the US-China trade war and credit and liquidity risks in the US economy.  However, top analysts continue to be bullish on large-cap assets, especially as they anticipate the US Federal Reserve to engage in emergency market-supportive actions.  Prominent crypto analyst and X influencer, […]

A new analysis from CryptoOnchain, using data shared by CryptoQuant, suggests Bitcoin may remain range-bound in the near term — but volatility risks are building fast.

Bitcoin is holding near $115,500, but traders are turning their attention to the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision.

North Korean state-sponsored hackers are now embedding malicious code into blockchain networks to avoid detection. According to Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), this new method—called EtherHiding—uses smart contracts on public blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain to store malware. The campaign allows the attackers to deliver and control harmful code through systems that are nearly impossible to block or alter.

GTIG explains that EtherHiding involves placing small code snippets into smart contracts, which are hosted on decentralized blockchain networks. These networks are immutable, meaning that once code is added, it cannot be deleted or modified. This makes it difficult for cybersecurity systems to take down or stop the malware.

The hackers start by compromising WordPress websites, often using stolen login data or unpatched software flaws. Once inside, they add a JavaScript loader into the site's code. This loader reaches out to the blockchain and pulls malware from a remote location. Since this connection is off-chain, it leaves almost no transaction record and requires little to no gas fees.

GTIG found that this method has been active since at least September 2023. The campaign began under the name CLEARFAKE, which used fake browser update alerts to trick users into installing malicious software.

One of the key features of blockchain technology is that once data is recorded, it cannot be changed. This feature is now being used to hide and spread malware in a way that security teams cannot easily stop. Because the malware is hosted inside smart contracts, blocking or deleting it would require changes to the blockchain itself, which is not possible.

GTIG reports that the use of decentralized systems allows attackers to operate without being noticed. Most anti-malware tools do not check smart contracts for harmful code, so these threats can stay active for long periods without detection.

“Although smart contracts offer innovative ways to build decentralized applications, their unchangeable nature is leveraged in EtherHiding,” GTIG noted.

Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton called EtherHiding an “early-stage experiment” and warned that it could be made more dangerous by using automation tools. He said that future versions might include code that targets blockchain systems directly, especially if those systems are linked to wallets or transaction platforms.

Cybersecurity experts believe this method shows a change in North Korea's cyber operations. Instead of only stealing cryptocurrency, hackers are now using the technology behind it to help distribute malware.

Data from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs states that North Korean hackers have stolen more than $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency this year. Investigators say that the funds are used to support military projects and avoid global sanctions.

The use of EtherHiding makes it easier for attackers to stay online and move their tools between platforms. Since the code is hosted on decentralized networks, even taking down the original website does not stop the malware from spreading.

GTIG advises users and web developers to take extra steps to secure their systems. They recommend blocking unknown scripts, disabling unauthorized downloads, and keeping WordPress plugins updated.

Security teams are also encouraged to start scanning smart contracts for malicious content. Since the code is public, researchers can label and track harmful contracts more easily if they know what to look for.

The group also stressed the need for tighter website security. Preventing the initial breach of WordPress sites is a key step in stopping these attacks before the loader can be installed.

Privately-issued stablecoins are under new scrutiny after a venture capital executive said they carry risks similar to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Jeremy Kranz, founder and managing partner of Sentinel Global, described these digital assets as “central business digital currencies,” warning they offer the same levels of surveillance, control, and vulnerability, while also adding private sector risks. His comments come as stablecoins top $300 billion in market capitalization.

Jeremy Kranz said that stablecoins, although issued by private firms, are often no different from government-issued CBDCs when it comes to user control. He noted that large financial institutions can freeze or block access to stablecoin funds under regulations like the Patriot Act.

“If JP Morgan issued a dollar stablecoin and controlled it through the Patriot Act… they can freeze your money and unbank you,” Kranz said. He emphasized that the same backdoors, surveillance tools, and programmable features exist in these digital assets, whether controlled by a government or a corporation.

Kranz said this level of control poses real challenges to financial freedom. While stablecoins are marketed as decentralized or user-first, the reality often includes centralized authority over assets, similar to traditional banks or government institutions.

Stablecoin issuers that use overcollateralization—holding cash and short-term U.S. government securities—can face pressure when too many users redeem tokens at once. Kranz warned that such scenarios can resemble a “bank run,” where liquidity may dry up fast.

Stablecoins like USDC and others aim to maintain a 1:1 dollar peg. However, if redemption volumes spike beyond available collateral, users may face delays or losses. “They are vulnerable if too many holders try to redeem at the same time,” Kranz said.

Algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins carry different risks. These tokens maintain their peg through code or complex market strategies. However, they are exposed to de-pegging events caused by market volatility, technical issues, or flash crashes in crypto markets.

Interest in stablecoins surged after the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill in the United States. The bill aims to regulate privately-issued stablecoins but has received criticism from several lawmakers. Some say it creates a legal path for a digital dollar under private control.

U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called the bill a “CBDC Trojan Horse.” In a July post on X, she said, “This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor central bank digital currency.” She warned that it could lead to a cashless society where money becomes programmable and subject to control.

The bill has intensified debate around digital currency control and privacy. Lawmakers and industry experts remain divided on whether the bill protects users or increases centralized oversight.

The total stablecoin market cap surpassed $300 billion in October, according to data from DeFiLlama. Kranz said the pace of change in crypto and tokenization is extremely fast and unpredictable. He compared it to “10 black swan events” happening all at once.

He warned that while the technology could help create new financial tools, it can also be misused. “Technology is neutral,” Kranz said, “but outcomes depend on who controls it and how it's used.”

Investors, he said, must read the fine print and understand the risks before holding or using stablecoins. He added that stablecoins are not immune to failure, market volatility, or regulatory intervention, regardless of whether they are centralized or algorithmic.

Ethereum remains in a range phase following the recent market rebound, but continues to hold above key institutional demand zones. The market has entered a period of consolidation between structural supports and resistances, suggesting that the next decisive move will likely be driven by liquidity displacement from this range.Technical Analysis

By ShayanThe Daily Chart

On the daily timeframe, Ethereum continues to trade between two major zones: the institutional supply area around $4.6K–$4.7K and the institutional demand zone near $3.4K–$3.5K. After losing the channel's lower trendline support earlier this month, the asset has now retested it from below, confirming it as resistance.

The structure suggests that Ethereum is currently in a mid-range equilibrium phase, where neither buyers nor sellers have clear control. The 100-day MA, which previously provided dynamic support, has now flipped into a resistance zone near $4.1K–$4.2K, while the 200-day MA near $3.1K remains the last line of structural defence.

As long as the price remains above the $3.4K institutional demand, Ethereum's macro trend stays intact. However, failure to maintain this level could expose the market to a deeper retracement toward the $3.0K–$2.9K liquidity cluster, where the 200-day MA and prior accumulation base converge.

The 4-Hour Chart

The 4-hour structure reveals a descending wedge pattern, forming after a sharp rejection from the $4.2K breakdown zone. The repeated rejections at this confluence of descending and ascending trendlines reflect the ongoing tug-of-war between short-term buyers and sellers.

At the same time, the lower boundary of the wedge aligns closely with the broader institutional demand zone, suggesting that Ethereum is approaching a point of compression where volatility expansion is imminent.

If the price breaks above the descending trendline and closes above the $4K–$4.1K resistance, it could confirm a reversal, targeting $4.4K–$4.6K. Conversely, a breakdown below $3.7K would likely trigger a deeper decline toward $3.4K, the same zone that underpins the broader bullish structure. Until confirmation occurs, Ethereum remains range-bound, oscillating between structural supply and demand.

Sentiment Analysis

By Shayan

Recent on-chain data points to a renewed tightening in Ethereum's market structure. Since mid-October, two significant dynamics have emerged simultaneously: exchange reserves have declined sharply, while average spot order sizes have increasingly been dominated by large whale transactions.

Following October 15, ETH's price has remained relatively stable just below the $4K level, but the underlying market composition has shifted meaningfully. Whale-sized spot orders (green clusters) have expanded, signalling renewed activity from deep-pocketed participants, while the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges, measured in USD terms, has dropped to one of the lowest levels of 2025.

This combination, shrinking exchange reserves and growing whale spot activity, has historically indicated strategic accumulation by institutional or high-net-worth investors. With liquidity thinning across exchanges, even moderate inflows of new demand could produce amplified price reactions, as reduced sell-side availability magnifies volatility to the upside.

Ethereum now appears to be entering another supply squeeze phase, echoing the quiet but powerful accumulation period of late 2020. During that cycle, consistent spot buying and exchange outflows preceded one of ETH's strongest multi-month rallies. If macro conditions stabilise and ETF-related inflows return, the current structural tightening could serve as the foundation for Ethereum's next major upward cycle.

Stock Analysis

Reviewed by Kshitija Bhandaru

Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is drawing attention after reports it has dramatically boosted its bitcoin holdings, purchasing $2 billion worth and raising $2.3 billion through new stock and debt offerings. The move comes as bitcoin prices climb following Donald Trump's reelection.

See our latest analysis for Trump Media & Technology Group.

With all eyes on Trump Media & Technology Group's bitcoin pivot, momentum around the stock remains unsettled. The latest $2 billion crypto bet comes on the heels of a difficult stretch. Its most recent 30-day share price return is -4.37%, while the total shareholder return over the past year sits at -45.3%. In short, even explosive headlines have not reversed a downward trend, though some investors are eyeing potential upside if confidence builds around the company's new crypto strategy.

If this kind of dramatic shift grabs your attention, now is the perfect time to broaden your radar and discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership

With such a bold pivot into cryptocurrency, the question now is whether Trump Media & Technology Group's share price reflects all the risk and potential, or if this volatility underscores a unique chance for investors to buy in ahead of possible growth.

Trump Media & Technology Group is currently trading at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2x, which anchors its valuation against comparable firms. With a last close price of $16.18, the stock appears more attractively priced than its direct peers on this metric.

The price-to-book ratio compares the company's market value to its net assets. For media and tech firms that are often asset-light and rapidly changing, this ratio remains a useful checkpoint for fair value, especially in the absence of sustained profitability or strong revenue growth.

DJT's P/B of 2x stands out as a relative bargain compared to its peer average of 2.9x. This suggests the market is either underestimating its asset value or questioning its ability to deliver returns from those assets. However, when compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry average P/B of 1.3x, DJT looks rather expensive. This raises questions about whether investors are pricing in future growth or simply paying a premium for the brand. There is insufficient data to calculate a fair ratio, so market direction may shift with new financials or catalysts.

Result: Price-to-Book of 2x (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, ongoing net losses and lack of clear revenue growth could challenge optimism, particularly if the crypto pivot fails to generate near-term profits.

XRP$2.4143 and Solana's SOL$191.96 stand out as the major cryptocurrencies with a key sentiment gauge showing bullish momentum, while their peers bitcoin BTC$109,181.46, and ether ETH$4,014.29 remain stuck in the gloom.

This key sentiment gauge, known as the 25-delta risk reversal, is actually an options strategy involving the simultaneous purchase of a 25-delta call and sale of a 25-delta put, or vice versa. The '25-delta' refers to options that are moderately out-of-the-money, meaning their strike prices are away from the current market price and therefore relatively inexpensive.

This strategy reveals market sentiment by comparing implied volatilities of these bullish call options calls and put options, which offer downside protection. A positive risk reversal indicates traders are paying a premium for calls over puts, signaling bullish expectations, while a negative reading reflects bearish bias. Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, accounting for over 80% of the crypto options activity.

As of writing, XRP and SOL risk reversals were positive across all available expiries – Oct. 31, Nov. 28, Dec. 26 – on Deribit, indicating a bias for calls, according to data source Amberdata. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market while a put buyer is looking to hedge his portfolio against or profit from an expected price drop.

The renewed bullishness follows a spike in demand for puts following the Oct. 10 crash that saw XRP's price tank as low as $1.77 from $2.80 on some exchanges. As of writing, XRP changed hands at $2.33, according to CoinDesk data. SOL crashed to $188 from $220 on the same day and has since remained under pressure, just as XRP.

The constructive sentiment starkly contrasts bitcoin's risk reversals which shows puts trading at a premium relative to calls across all tenors, right out to the September 2026 expiry. Clearly, BTC traders remain concerned about downside risks.

In ETH's case, the bearishness prevails out to the December expiry options, followed by bullish pricing in subsequent expiry options. 

Risk reversals are widely tracked to gauge market sentiment; however, it is worth noting that while generally reliable, risk reversals tied to XRP and SOL may be less precise indicators due to the relatively smaller market size, volume, and open interest compared to the billions seen in bitcoin and ether options markets.

Besides the persistent put bias in Bitcoin options, especially in quarterly and longer-dated expiries, this can be partly attributed to the widespread practice of call overwriting, where traders sell higher-strike call options against their long spot holdings to generate additional yield. In other words, the put bias reflects yield generation efforts rather than outright bearish market sentiment.

While XRP options have flipped bullish, perpetual futures for XRP exhibit a more balanced market, consistent with the neutral funding rates and sentiment seen in perpetual futures for BTC, SOL and ETH. 

At press time, annualized perpetual funding rates (charged every eight hours) hovered near zero, indicating a neutral sentiment, according to data source Velo. This subdued demand for leveraged bullish exposure across these major cryptocurrencies is typical traders struggling to regain confidence following a price crash.

The recent market crash liquidated leveraged futures bets worth $20 billion, causing massive wealth destruction. 

Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of an asset, like cryptocurrencies, without an expiration date. These contracts use a funding rate mechanism, which is a periodic payment exchanged between traders holding long and short positions to keep the futures price aligned with the underlying asset's spot price.

When funding rates are positive, it means perpetual futures are trading at a premium to the spot price, signaling increased demand for leveraged bullish exposure. Negative rates suggest otherwise.

OpenSea is embarking on a new journey, moving from being a leading NFT marketplace to a platform where all on-chain assets can be traded seamlessly. The introduction of the $SEA token is a key aspect of this transformation. But what does this mean for users and the broader crypto ecosystem?

OpenSea is not just sticking to NFTs anymore; they're expanding their horizons to encompass all on-chain assets. This includes tokens, NFTs, and potentially even physical assets, all available on a single platform. The aim is to eliminate the need for users to navigate through multiple interfaces, allowing them to trade any crypto asset across various blockchains without any technical hurdles. 

This is a significant pivot from their original focus as an NFT marketplace. By broadening their range of offerings, OpenSea is trying to attract both new users and retain existing ones who are deep into the NFT space. The ambition is to become a cornerstone in the on-chain economy, responding to a growing demand for a more inclusive trading environment.

The $SEA token is set to launch in Q1 2026, and it will have a multi-faceted role. Not only will it be used for governance and staking, but it will also serve as a liquidity incentive. Interestingly, 50% of the total token supply is earmarked for the community. This is a move to instill a sense of ownership among users, which is crucial for long-term loyalty.

But here's the kicker: OpenSea plans to buy back $SEA tokens using 50% of its launch revenue. This is meant to create demand for the token while rewarding those who hold onto it. By integrating governance and staking directly into the trading platform, OpenSea is not just enhancing user engagement; they're also opening the door to a more democratic method of asset management.

Despite these ambitious plans, OpenSea finds itself in a tricky situation. The NFT market has seen a staggering decline in capitalization, plummeting from $25 billion in 2021 to around $5.2 billion. However, trading activity remains high, and OpenSea reported $2.6 billion in trading volume in October 2025, primarily propelled by token trading.

The timing of the $SEA token introduction couldn't be more critical, as competition heats up and regulatory scrutiny intensifies. As OpenSea broadens its offerings, it must also contend with complex regulatory frameworks, especially in Asia. There, fintech startups are facing increased pressure to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. The merging of NFTs with fungible tokens on a single platform is bound to attract regulatory attention and potentially prompt the creation of new rules targeting risks like fraud and market manipulation.

OpenSea's transformation into a universal trading platform raises significant questions about regulatory compliance, particularly for fintech startups in Asia. The expansion beyond NFTs to include a wider array of assets presents intricate regulatory challenges, as startups will have to navigate diverse legal frameworks across jurisdictions.

With increased regulatory scrutiny on the horizon, authorities will likely focus on token classification, investor protection, and AML compliance. OpenSea's transparent and community-centric approach could set a precedent for compliance practices among startups. By simplifying the user experience while adhering to regulations, OpenSea emphasizes the need for proactive engagement with regulators in the ever-evolving Web3 landscape.

Integrating NFTs into broader asset trading strategies offers potential rewards but also comes with risks for crypto-friendly SMEs in Europe.

Potential Rewards:
- Diversification and unique asset access.
- Market growth and mainstream adoption.
- Innovative revenue models.
- Operational efficiency.

Potential Risks:
- Market volatility and illiquidity.
- Regulatory complexity.
- Fraud and intellectual property issues.
- Money laundering risks.

In summary, OpenSea's evolution into a universal trading platform with the $SEA token signifies a monumental shift in the crypto landscape. By enhancing user engagement and grappling with regulatory challenges, OpenSea aims to redefine digital asset trading. Yet, the complexities of a saturated market and the need for compliance will be critical as they pursue long-term success.

Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba's Ant Group and JD.com, have halted their stablecoin development projects following direct intervention from Beijing, according to the Financial Times.

The suspension affects yuan-based digital asset initiatives that major Chinese technology firms had been developing amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny from the central government.

Beijing recently directed brokerages and think tanks to cease promoting stablecoins, reflecting growing concern over private sector involvement in digital currency issuance and the government's desire to maintain control over monetary innovation.

The intervention aligns with broader Chinese efforts to counter foreign digital currency dominance while prioritizing state oversight of the domestic financial system.

 BitMine has $1.5 billion worth of Ether following the market crash, as Tom Lee remained bullish despite saying the DAT bubble may have burst. 

Fundstrat's Tom Lee has echoed the sentiment that digital asset treasury hype may be coming to an end, but remains bullish on Ether, having purchased $1.5 billion worth since the market crash.

BitMine Immersion Technologies has scooped up a total of 379,271 Ether (ETH) worth almost $1.5 billion since the record crypto market liquidation event last weekend.

The acquisitions came in three separate purchases: 202,037 ETH after the weekend crash, 104,336 ETH on Thursday, and 72,898 ETH on Saturday, according to onchain data from Arkham Intelligence and ‘BMNR Bullz', which tracks the firm's purchases, though it has yet to be officially confirmed by BitMine.

BitMine is the world's largest Ether treasury company with a stash of more than 3 million ETH, or 2.5% of the entire supply, worth $11.7 billion. It is already halfway toward its target of 5% and has only started accumulating the asset in early July, when ETH was hovering around the $2,500 level. 

“Ethereum could flip Bitcoin similar to how Wall Street and equities flipped gold post 71,” Lee told ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood on Thursday in his latest bullish statement on the asset. 

The continued aggressive accumulation of Ether occurs despite Lee's opinion that the digital asset treasury bubble may have burst.

Lee stated that many DATs are trading below their net asset value (NAV), or the worth of their underlying crypto holdings. “If that's not already a bubble burst… How would that bubble burst?” he told Fortune on Thursday.

Research firm 10x Research also reported on Saturday that major DATs such as Metaplanet and Strategy were trading near or below their NAVs. 

However, this is not all bad news as DATs with strong capital bases and trading-savvy management teams “may still generate meaningful alpha,” they said. 

Huobi founder Li Lin wants some of that alpha and has reportedly raised about $1 billion as part of a strategy to invest in an Ether treasury.   

Lee told CNBC after the trading day on Friday that investors were still “licking their wounds” from the record leverage flush, but there was also a bit of “gold envy” as the commodity has been a “huge performer this year.”

Crypto markets are currently down 15% from their record high on October 7, while gold prices have retreated almost 3% from their peak on Thursday.

Scientists at The University of Western Australia's node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) have made a remarkable discovery: a massive structure stretching about 185,000 light-years between two galaxies, NGC 4532 and DDO 137, located some 53 million light-years from Earth.

According to a study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the team also detected a huge tail of gas extending another 1.6 million light-years beyond the bridge, making it the largest feature of its kind ever recorded.

Lead researcher Professor Lister Staveley-Smith from ICRAR UWA explained that the finding provides an important new insight into how galaxies influence each other.

"Our modeling showed that the tidal forces acting between these galaxies, alongside their proximity to the massive Virgo cluster of galaxies, played a crucial role in the gas dynamics we observed," Professor Staveley-Smith said.

He added that as the galaxies orbited one another and moved toward the superheated gas cloud surrounding the Virgo cluster, which reaches temperatures about 200 times hotter than the Sun's surface, they experienced "ram pressure." This effect stripped gas from the galaxies and heated it as they passed through the dense environment.

"The process is akin to atmospheric burn-up when a satellite re-enters the Earth's upper atmosphere, but has extended over a period of a billion years," he said.

"The density of electrons and the speed at which galaxies are falling into the hot gas cloud are enough to explain why so much gas has been pulled away from the galaxies and into the bridge and surrounding areas."

The discovery was made as part of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Survey (WALLABY), a large-scale project that maps hydrogen gas throughout the Universe using the ASKAP radio telescope, owned and operated by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency.

Co-author Professor Kenji Bekki of ICRAR UWA said the team identified the enormous gas structures through high-resolution observations of neutral hydrogen, a key ingredient in star formation.

"Neutral hydrogen plays a crucial role in the formation of stars, making this finding fundamental to understanding how galaxies interact and evolve, particularly in dense environments," Professor Bekki said.

Professor Staveley-Smith said the system had strong similarities with our own Milky Way and Magellanic System, providing a unique opportunity to study such interactions in detail.

"Understanding these gas bridges and their dynamics provides critical insights into how galaxies evolve over time, how galactic gas is redistributed, and the varying conditions under which galaxies may or may not form stars," he said.

"This contributes to our broader understanding of the most massive structures in the Universe and their life cycles, which helps us grasp more about their vast complexities and history of star formation."

Scientists at the Francis Crick Institute and Vividion Therapeutics have discovered chemical compounds that can precisely prevent the cancer-driving gene RAS from connecting with a key pathway responsible for tumor growth.

The potential treatment is now moving into its first human clinical trial. If proven safe and effective, it could become a way to treat a wide range of cancers while minimizing harm to healthy cells.

The RAS gene plays a central role in controlling how cells grow and divide, but mutations in this gene occur in roughly one in five cancers. When mutated, RAS becomes permanently active, continually sending signals that push cells to keep growing and multiplying.

Inside the cell, RAS sits on the membrane and acts as the starting signal in a chain of growth processes. Completely shutting down RAS or the enzymes it controls has proven difficult, because these same pathways are essential for normal cell function. One of the enzymes linked to RAS, called PI3K, also helps regulate blood sugar through insulin. Blocking PI3K entirely can lead to side effects such as hyperglycemia.

In their study, published on October 9 in Science, the team combined chemical screening with biological testing to identify compounds that stop RAS and PI3K from interacting, while leaving normal cell activity intact.

Researchers at Vividion Therapeutics pinpointed a set of small molecules that permanently attach to the surface of PI3K near the spot where RAS would normally bind. Using an assay created by the Crick researchers, they confirmed that these compounds successfully blocked the RAS-PI3K interaction but still allowed PI3K to perform its other roles, including those related to insulin signaling.

The Crick team and their collaborators at Vividion then tested one of the compounds in mice with RAS-mutated lung tumors. The treatment stopped tumor growth, and the researchers found no signs of elevated blood sugar levels.

Next, they tried combining the new compound with one or two additional drugs that target enzymes within the same pathway. Together, the treatments produced stronger and longer-lasting tumor suppression than any of the drugs used alone.

The scientists also tested the compound in mice with tumors carrying mutations in another cancer-linked gene, HER2, which is often overactive in breast cancer and also connects with PI3K. Tumor growth was again halted, even though the effect did not rely on RAS. This finding suggests that the new compound could potentially help stop the growth of a broader range of cancers.

The drug has now entered the first clinical trial in humans to test for safety and side effects in people with both RAS and HER2 mutations. The trial will also assess if the potential treatment is more effective in combination with other drugs targeting RAS.

Julian Downward, Principal Group Leader of the Oncogene Biology Laboratory at the Crick, said: "Given the RAS gene is mutated across a wide range of cancers, we've been exploring how to stop it interacting with cell growth pathways for many years, but side effects have held back the development of treatments.

"Our collaborative effort has overcome this challenge by targeting the PI3K and RAS interaction specifically, leaving PI3K free to bind with its other targets. It's exciting to see these clinical trials starting, highlighting the power of understanding chemistry and fundamental biology to get to something with potential to help people with cancer."

"This discovery is a great example of how new discovery approaches can open up completely novel ways to tackle cancer," said Matt Patricelli, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Vividion. "By designing molecules that stop RAS and PI3K from connecting, while still allowing healthy cell processes to continue, we've found a way to selectively block a key cancer growth signal. It's incredibly rewarding to see this science now progressing in the clinic, where it has the potential to make a real difference for patients."

A large-scale investigation has found that people who regularly consume both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and low- or no-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs) face a significantly greater likelihood of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).1

Presented at UEG Week 2025, the research followed 123,788 adults from the UK Biobank who had no signs of liver disease at the start of the study. Participants' drink habits were recorded through repeated 24-hour dietary questionnaires, allowing researchers to explore how both SSB and LNSSB consumption related to MASLD, liver fat buildup, and deaths linked to liver disease.

Individuals who drank more than 250 grams of either type of beverage per day had notably higher risks: a 60% increased likelihood of developing MASLD for those consuming LNSSBs (HR: 1.599) and a 50% increase for those drinking SSBs (HR: 1.469). During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 1,178 participants developed MASLD and 108 died from liver-related causes. Although SSBs were not significantly connected to liver-related mortality, LNSSB consumption was. Both kinds of drinks were also associated with higher levels of liver fat.

MASLD, previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), occurs when excess fat builds up in the liver. Over time, this can trigger inflammation (hepatitis) and lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.2 Now the most common chronic liver condition worldwide, MASLD affects more than 30% of people and is rapidly becoming a leading cause of liver-related deaths.3

Lead researcher Lihe Liu explained, "SSBs have long been under scrutiny, while their 'diet' alternatives are often seen as the healthier choice. Both, however, are widely consumed and their effects on liver health have not been well understood."

"Our study shows that LNSSBs were actually linked to a higher risk of MASLD, even at modest intake levels such as a single can per day. These findings challenge the common perception that these drinks are harmless and highlight the need to reconsider their role in diet and liver health, especially as MASLD emerges as a global health concern."

Liu also discussed the possible biological reasons behind the findings: "The higher sugar content in SSBs can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin, promote weight gain and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation. LNSSBs, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings and even stimulating insulin secretion."

The authors emphasized that these findings support limiting both SSBs and LNSSBs as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy, targeting not only liver disease but also cardio-renal-metabolic health. Replacing either beverage with water significantly reduced MASLD risk -- by 12.8% for SSBs and 15.2% for LNSSBs -- while substitution between the two types of beverages offered no risk reduction.

Liu added, "The safest approach is to limit both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. Water remains the best choice as it removes the metabolic burden and prevents fat accumulation in the liver, whilst hydrating the body."

The researchers now aim to explore causal mechanisms more deeply through long-term, randomized and genetic trials with a focus on how sugar and its substitutes interact with the gut microbiome and influence liver disease.

How did the universe come into existence, and what early processes shaped everything that followed? A new study published in Physical Review Research takes aim at this fundamental question. Scientists from Spain and Italy have introduced a model that reimagines what happened moments after the universe was born. Their approach could upend long-standing ideas about the forces and events that governed the universe's earliest evolution.

To explore these beginnings, the researchers ran advanced computer simulations that question the traditional "inflation" theory. According to that theory, the universe expanded at an extraordinary rate within a tiny fraction of a second after it came into existence. The inflation model relies on several interconnected variables, all of which must align to make the theory work.

The newly proposed model offers a simpler explanation. It suggests that gravitational waves -- predicted by general relativity -- may be the true driving force behind the universe's formation, giving rise to galaxies, stars, planets, and ultimately life on Earth. The researchers link this idea to a mathematical construct known as De Sitter space, named for Dutch mathematician Willem De Sitter, who collaborated with Albert Einstein in the 1920s on understanding the structure of the cosmos.

"For decades, we have tried to understand the early moments of the Universe using models based on elements we have never observed," said Dr. Raúl Jiménez, who studies experimental sciences & mathematics at ICREA in Spain and is a co-author on the study. "What makes this proposal exciting is its simplicity and verifiability. We are not adding speculative elements but rather demonstrating that gravity and quantum mechanics may be sufficient to explain how the structure of the cosmos came into being."

The concept of gravitational waves dates back to 1893 and 1905, when Oliver Heaviside and Henri Poincaré first proposed related ideas. Albert Einstein expanded on this in 1916, describing gravitational waves as ripples in the fabric of space-time in his general theory of relativity. These waves can originate from powerful cosmic events such as supernovae, merging black holes, and colliding neutron stars. Because they are incredibly faint, detecting them requires highly sensitive instruments. It was not until September 2015 that scientists at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with facilities in Washington and Louisiana, achieved the first confirmed detection.

The birth of the universe continues to be one of science's greatest puzzles. The Big Bang theory remains the prevailing explanation, yet many questions persist -- especially about what might have occurred before that explosive beginning.

Carl Sagan once reflected on humanity's deep connection to the cosmos, saying, "The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself."

We may never know exactly how the universe began and the processes responsible for you reading this article right now. But like the simplicity this study presents, perhaps this study is simply a way for us to know the universe itself a little bit better.

What new discoveries about the origins of the universe will researchers make in the coming years and decades? Only time will tell, and this is why we science!

As always, keep doing science & keep looking up!

Bluesky is a social media platform loved by liberals, leftists, progressives, woke people, or whatever you want to call dislikers of Donald Trump. When a bunch of Donald Trump-associated accounts started using Bluesky ahead of this weekend in order to provoke a food fight, some were outraged or trolled back, but Bluesky's robust blocking feature and cultural norms around ignoring right-wing trolls and harassers made their presence mostly a non-issue.

On Friday afternoon, the Trump 2.0 White House account, @whitehouse-47.bsky.social, announced its momentous arrival by posting a vaguely triumphalist montage of clips that referenced a lot of inside jokes for Republicans that probably don't even register for outsiders, like one about Joe Biden's autopen.

To clarify that this was not meant to earnestly signal the opening of a channel for information exchange between citizens and the head of the U.S. federal government, the text of the post was a sarcastically cheerful provocation: “What's up, Bluesky? We thought you might've missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you. Can't wait to spend more quality time together! ❤️🇺🇸”

— The White House (@whitehouse-47.bsky.social) October 17, 2025 at 2:21 PM



The replies from the Bluesky faithful included a whole lot of invocations of Trump's alleged connections to Jeffrey Epstein, and references to the #NoKings movement.

Mostly, however, the account got blocked. According to the Bluesky block tracking site Clearsky, @whitehouse-47.bsky.social is already the second most blocked account on Bluesky, just below Vice President J.D. Vance, who joined the site over the summer and has since secured a durable position atop the ranking.

The White House's bid for attention was accompanied by similar introductory posts from the departments of State, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Commerce, the so-called “Department of War,” and many other cabinet departments and executive branch offices. Their posts and videos mostly just greet the users of Bluesky and hint at future dialogue in the same sarcastic tone at the initial White House post.

These accounts all show tens of thousands of blocks in the past 24 hours as of this writing—more blockers than followers in most cases. Some, like the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, earned themselves follower counts under 1,000. Most have spent the weekend posting platitudes, and receiving double-digit repost counts as users avoid taking the bait.

If the White House communications people who likely orchestrated all this were hoping to be able to generate epic lib meltdown content, it's doubtful the mostly muted reaction was worth their effort. That's because blocking on Bluesky is public, conspicuous, and designed to be total. Embeds will break. Reply chains will crumble. Further clashes, friction, and cognitive dissonance will drop off abruptly. The blocker and blockee will basically vanish from one another's universes.

Bluesky blocking culture also includes the use of block lists, one-stop-shopping for blocking all accounts in some category or group with a single tap. There is even, somewhat more controversially, at least one block list of all users who interacted with the White House account rather then simply blocking it. The many, many blocked nodes in the network weaken the network effect of posting on a platform, which in turn appears to have resulted in low engagement for a bunch of accounts associated with the most powerful person in the world.

Bluesky critics like Mark Cuban call Bluesky an echo chamber, and it's hard to argue that they're entirely wrong. But all the Trump White House set out to do this weekend in that echo chamber was make a screeching noise, and since users are equipped with very effective earplugs, it wasn't even all that annoying.

It's quicker to switch to your AIO screen than to Alt-Tab.

Battlefield 6 has had an explosive launch, marking a return to critical acclaim and record-breaking player counts. Everyone wants to get in on the military shooter action, and it seems even your job can't stand in the way of that mission. German reviewer AllAroundPC just showed us the best way to make use of the little downtime between tasks — by playing Battlefield 6 on the tiny circular screen of a CPU liquid cooler (video embedded below). That's right, the apparatus designed to keep your processor's thermals in check can now double as a quickly deployable secondary display.

Many high-end AIOs these days come with built-in screens that have secondary display functionality baked in — such is the case with MSI's CoreLiquid P13 (Tom's Hardware review link), which is what “Tim” used in the demonstration. The P13 features a 2.1-inch IPS display with a resolution of 480 x 480. It's got a circular aspect ratio, so you do lose some screen real estate, but nothing bothersome enough to stop some creative XP farming. “I mean, maybe not the best setup, but a little XP farming? Why not, you could do that,” claims Tim while laser-focused on the AIO.

Adding to the absurdity is our resident gamer Tim's actual job — he's supposed to be reviewing monitors. He was meant to be testing a new OLED, which you can even see on his desk in the video, but when he's caught red-handed gunning down enemies in Battlefield, he responds cleverly: “Yeah, I am doing monitor tests here.” He's not wrong; it may not be OLED, and it certainly wouldn't be the first choice for competitive gaming, but as they say — it's never about the car, it's about the driver. Or in this case, I guess, how it's being driven.

The PC community is no stranger to unconventional gaming, with Doom long serving as the modern-day, unofficial benchmark for knighting worthy tech. Someone got it running on a literal wall charger. We also recently saw a whole gaming computer be built inside a Porsche wheel, and an entire setup made from Lego-compatible bricks. It's always great to see the hobby birth such creative concepts that, while not exactly practical, are always novel to look at and push the DIY nature of this rabbit hole forward.

The Trump administration is taking its social media attacks on Democratic opponents to an unlikely platform, with the White House and numerous other government agencies joining Bluesky on Friday.

In its first post, the new White House account uploaded a highlight reel of Trump footage and memes, along with the message, “What's up, Bluesky? We thought you might've missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you.”

Other government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of State, the Department of War, and the Department of Transportation all appeared to follow the White House by creating new Bluesky accounts, and all of them quickly posted messages attacking Democrats over the ongoing government shutdown.

“We heard this is a great place to have an open and honest dialogue, so we're here to talk about how the Democrat shutdown is undermining our country on the world stage,” wrote the Department of State. (Legal experts have suggested that similar statements from government agencies likely violate the Hatch Act.)

The messages were generally written in a cheerful, trolling tone, suggesting that the administration's social media teams were anticipating and even hoping for a negative response on a social network that's widely known as a left-leaning alternative to Elon Musk's X. And Bluesky users delivered, with many responses to the initial White House post bringing up Trump's relationship with infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

“The reason they're coming after this place is because they can't control the people on it and it drives them nuts,” wrote The Onion CEO Ben Collins.

At the same time, many popular Bluesky accounts urged their followers to simply “block and move on,” with comedian Paul F Tomkins declaring that it's “Weirdly fun to block the White House.”

Less than 48 hours after joining, the White House has already become one of the most blocked accounts on Bluesky. According to ClearSky, which tracks Bluesky blocking stats, the White House account is blocked by around 91,000 accounts, while being followed by only 10,000. The only account that's been blocked by more Bluesky users belongs to Vice President JD Vance, who joined back in June. 

While the various new government accounts hadn't quite reached those heights by Sunday morning, they accounted for all of the top 5 most blocked accounts in the last 24 hours.  And other right-wing accounts seemed to be boasting about following the Trump administration to Bluesky and getting widely blocked.

But I think the way the US is set up (districting, gerrymandering, redlined, electoral college, etc) makes it far too easy for fringe beliefs to take over and dictate policy. So having states simply being more independent puts up far more barriers to all of us just losing our freedom.I live in IL. (Not near Chicago). My kids public school only gets about 15% of its funding from the federal govt. We could just finally stop having our stupid flat income tax and make up the shortfall. It might set back the universal preschool system, perhaps (which would be a tragedy but better than complete destruction).Meanwhile, schools might not even exist in many other states if federal funding disappeared.

That said, as a fly on the wall, my obvious observation from people at large is a direct correlation between how much power they believe  states should have and whether or not they belong to the party in power.  So it's definitely worth the exercise of seeing if you'd feel the same way still if your exact clone ran the federal government.

Let's say we get rid of Medicare, Medicaid, social security, and research funding at the federal level. What happens next?The West Coast and North East form compacts, companies, or nonprofits that provide healthcare, retirement and funding for their schools. The south, parts of the Midwest, and the plains fail to do so (at least to the same level) and within a generation we have two separate countries and war.

Fight back against _what_? Look: our universities really do need reform, and the perceptive observer should be able to see that independent of political opinions. The current administration may be an imperfect vehicle for reform, but I don't see anyone else trying.In particular, universities need to return to pursuing truth. Not every department at every school has abandoned the goal of seeking pure knowledge, granted, but the reality is that many have oriented themselves towards building a "better world" by preaching (there is no other word) the "right" ideas well past the point where they intersect with the real world.It is damn hard for me to muster sympathy for the universities. I recall that they spent a decade demanding statements of ideological affiliation as a precondition of hiring, that they pollute the epistemic commons by suppressing inconvenient facts, and that they rationale injustice against individuals by gesturing at universal, cosmic justice that they claim they alone have the power to discern.I see no reason to send public money to seminaries that have murdered universities, donned their skins, and demand respect as institutes of knowledge.

It sadly does not mean that universities are laser-focused on seeking truth, and are free from ideological biases, often very obvious. Regarding truth, one of the leading theories in humanities is that of Michel Foucault, which states that there cannot be any objective truth, and what is considered true is determined by power structures.I'm glad to see though that the four universities are making a stand, and value independence above whatever "federal benefits" the administration may offer. It's sad that these are only 4 out of 9.

What do you mean by laser focused? Do you have specific policies to address this? If not then this is a natural part of the unfocused nature of knowledge work, and the natural weakness of human organizations.University research and knowledge work in general is backtracking search, not gradient descent in a friendly loss landscape.

But surely it also can't be the case that colleges demand what are basically declarations of political allegiance in the form of DEI statements, institutional trust is nosediving and ideological capture is to blame in large part. I hope this push from the administration fails, but I also hope something changes because otherwise the result is going to be worse than if universities actually submitted to these demands.

Because while I agree that>The pursuit of truth is difficult and has its pitfalls but it naturally leads to the dominance of certain viewpointsI'm certain that demanding essays from which you could perfectly predict voting patterns is not the mark of viewpoints that prioritize the pursuit of truth.

Consider crime. Restorative justice has failed everywhere it's been tried . Utterly. Comprehensively. Totally. Everywhere it's tried, restorative justice increases crime and degrades the public spirit.Yet universities continue to push it, despite all evidence, because it flatters a certain worldview. That this viewpoint is universal in academia isn't the organic victory of a good idea, but ideological groupthink that becomes a menace to society when it escapes the quad.And it's not only that equitable justice is the dominant viewpoint: it's that no competing viewpoint are allowed. To disagree is to be a bad person, and universities today wield every institutional weapon they have against "bad" people who hold "bad" ideas. This is not an environment conducive to knowledge formation.No university department that pushes "equitable justice" as summa bonum should receive public money. It's just nonsense.So it is for many university programs these days. As J.S. Mill wrote: "He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion."

Universities? Can you point to a university whose explicit policy is restorative justice? That's not how universities generally work. You're probably taking issue with an individual department which naturally has a certain research and academic history.Are you prepared to cite the works prepared and researched by individuals at a university or lab which counter the research on restorative justice?If not then either it doesn't exist and we're operating on anecdata or it does exist and the research system is proceeding exactly as intended. You are also comparing the outcomes of policy to the work of scientists and philosophers without analyzing the specifics of imperfect policy meeting an imperfect world.Research and knowledge work in general is often wrong. That's not the point. For decades large parts of the genome were believed to be garbage. That wasn't amended by the government it was amended by researchers following the scientific process. The politicization of the process doesn't speed it up, it simply introduces an outside malignant influence to an otherwise slow but steady process of inquiry.

It's good that this is being reversed. It turns out that many who are celebrating it are liberals and minority members. The Progressive media doesn't cover much of them but we see them elsewhere. Their ratings are plummeting which shows their viewers are tired of what they're doing.All of these trends started with Trump who seems to be the only person willing or capable of handling it. A wicked man to be sure but very helpful in breaking Progressive's control of institutions. Also, showing their hypocrisy as they complain about people doing to them what they've been doing for decades now. If it's so bad, they should likewise cease all ideological activities in all institutions. (They won't.)

This is the original compact https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/1...1 The Compact explicitly makes federal funding conditional on compliance, meaning that universities must either align with federal definitions of “excellence” and “neutrality” or lose access to research grants, contracts, student loans, and tax exemptions. In practice, this could establish a centralized federal control mechanism over university policies effectively nationalizing large portions of higher education decision-making without direct legislation.Sections 2 and 4 (“Marketplace of Ideas” and “Institutional Neutrality”) appear to promote pluralism, but they impose mandatory structural changes to ensure “no single ideology dominant”. This could require ideological balancing in faculty hiring, curricula, and departmental governance. The threat of Department of Justice enforcement transforms “neutrality” into a federally monitored ideological litmus test, likely constraining academic freedom more than protecting it.Section 6 defines “male,” “female,” “woman,” and “man” strictly by biological function and requires single-sex spaces to be maintained on that basis. This departs from current federal civil rights interpretations under Title IX and would effectively prohibit recognition of gender identity in campus policy rolling back existing protections for transgender and nonbinary students.By forbidding universities from commenting institutionally on “societal and political events” unless directly related to operations, the Compact silences institutional voices on issues like racial justice, climate change, or foreign policy—even if faculty consensus supports public engagement. The “marketplace of ideas” clause simultaneously allows punishment of university employees or centers deemed “dominant” in ideology, directly threatening critical studies programs (e.g., gender studies, ethnic studies).Section 8 introduces anti-money-laundering and KYC requirements typically reserved for banks, applied here to universities. It also mandates information sharing with DHS and the State Department and caps foreign student enrollment at 15%, with a 5% per-country limit. Combined with civics instruction requirements for foreigners, this moves higher education toward national security oversight and ideological vetting creating a form of state-managed educational nationalism.The enforcement section deputizes the Department of Justice to investigate compliance and allows it to reclaim all federal funds and even PRIVATE contributions during a violation year. This mechanism represents an extraordinary form of financial coercion that could bankrupt noncompliant universities, effectively forcing universal submission or privatization.

By forbidding universities from commenting institutionally on “societal and political events” unless directly related to operations, the Compact silences institutional voices on issues like racial justice, climate change, or foreign policy—even if faculty consensus supports public engagement. The “marketplace of ideas” clause simultaneously allows punishment of university employees or centers deemed “dominant” in ideology, directly threatening critical studies programs (e.g., gender studies, ethnic studies).Section 8 introduces anti-money-laundering and KYC requirements typically reserved for banks, applied here to universities.

The only unnecessary part is explicitly calling out conservative opinions, some of which will have no place in some university subjects, e.g. a geology student insisting the Earth is 6000 years old.

We certainly don't issue degrees based only on what expertise they identify as. We don't allow them in office based on whether they identify as President or Principal. We should likewise not use their feelings or unsubstantiated beliefs to determine if they're a man or a woman when biology has the answer almost every time. Intersex, the exceptions, we'll handle on a case by case basis.

When executive demands something of private citizens and private entities, it means they are bossing over said people/entities. Nobody elected the executive to boss over people. When Congress attempts to set these same regulations, these entities get a chance to reach out to their reps and ask for changes. When Congress sets regulations, power is dispersed among 400+ reps.You are thinking about the outcome of the regulations feeling the same. "No kings" are demanding that the means to setting rules be distributed among reps - when the rulemaking is distributed, you'll find that the rules demanded will change - because most people don't want these exact rules as they stand. And they don't want to submit to a fickle corrupt executive who will change these rules selectively on a dime on a random Friday.

Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar says people need to wake up.

Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar said that the U.S. should end its dependence on China, and that the first thing it should do is to recognize its dependence is a problem. According to his opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. and China are already engaged in an economic war with each other, and other people should wake up to this reality. However, Sankar says that many business leaders still refuse to see this, and still wholeheartedly believe in the Chinese message of its "peaceful rise."

The opinion piece points out that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently expressed his opinion that the label 'China hawk' is not a badge of honor Americans should wear, it is really 'a badge of shame.' Huang also said it "doesn't have to be all us or them. It could be us and them."

Mulling over the Nvidia CEO's philosophy, the Palantir CTO wrote, "The first step to ending our dependence on China is admitting we have a problem." Sankar continued, "We can continue as useful idiots, decrying ‘China hawks' who point out that we're funding our own demise. Or we can wake up to the reality that we're already in an economic war in which every purchase and investment will help determine which system survives."

While Sankar does not directly call out Huang as a “useful idiot,” the implication is certainly there, given his reference to the Nvidia CEO's comments. The Nvidia CEO has always been against export controls on the most powerful chips, saying that such a move could backfire against the U.S., as it would allow Chinese companies like Huawei to define global standards.

Instead, Huang wants his chips to be readily available in China, so that American technology can become the backbone of global AI technology. We should note, though, that China used to be Nvidia's biggest export market, where it once had 95% market share — it has since dropped to zero because of export controls and the ongoing trade war between the two global rivals.

Sankar's take on this is that China is just using foreign companies to support its goals until it can develop a credible home-grown challenger. These companies would then flood the global market with cheaper goods, while, at the same time, Beijing is taking steps to limit the access of the original foreign business to the Chinese market. He does not lay the blame on China alone, though.

American companies have been an undeniable part of China's growth, with juggernauts like Apple, Tesla, Intel, General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Coca-Cola, among others, investing heavily in the country. This massive inflow of cash, technology, and know-how has allowed it to rise and become the leading global manufacturer. In fact, some experts say that companies stay in China not because of cheap labor, but because it's the only country that already has the necessary supply chain in place to build the latest technology.

Sankar argues that the U.S. should face this development head-on by rebuilding the industrial base it has let slide. While Washington does not have to completely stop trade with China, it does have to take steps to build alternative markets and supply chains to avoid so that it has alternatives and not be left with no choice but to comply with Beijing's demands.

The Palantir CTO argues that the current situation will only get worse if the U.S. does not take action today, but there are still quite a few who refuse to see this. On this point, he quoted Upton Sinclair: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”

This will be a long and arduous road, though, especially as many are already used to cheap goods coming from China. But it's only with that realization that the United States can take the painful but necessary steps to ensure that it remains sovereign in the face of Beijing's goal to overtake the US in global supremacy.

What Happened: The ranking member of a key House subcommittee demanded answers this week from the Environmental Protection Agency about why it has yet to make public a report documenting the health risks posed by a forever chemical found in the water of millions of Americans.

In a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday, Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, cited a ProPublica story from last week that quoted government scientists saying the report had been ready for publishing in April but had yet to be released. Pingree — the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies — asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for “clear answers” about why the report had not been made public, who directed its delay and when Zeldin would commit to releasing it.

What They Said: Pingree referred to the delay in publishing the report as part of “a growing pattern of interference with the Agency's scientific work” and pointed to the Integrated Risk Information System, the EPA program that wrote it. IRIS, which was created during Ronald Reagan's presidency, analyzes the health harm chemicals can cause. “The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program,” she wrote, asking whether scientists had been removed or reassigned from the program and, if so, why.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA's decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.

Pingree noted that the delay appears to contradict Zeldin's repeated public statements about protecting the public from PFAS compounds, which contaminate soil and water in Maine and throughout the country. “Our state is really hoping for help from the federal government. And when you see the federal government turn their back on you and decide to withhold the data … that's really discouraging,” she told ProPublica. “Reading that piece made my blood boil.”

Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people. The report in question found that the chemical interferes with human development by causing lower birth weights and, based on animal evidence, likely causes damage to the liver and to male reproductive systems, including reductions in testosterone levels, sperm production and the size of reproductive organs.

PFNA was a component of firefighting foam and a processing aid to make a kind of plastic used in circuit boards, valves and pipes. Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.

ProPublica's reporting found that IRIS has been drastically reduced under the Trump administration. The program, which calculates values that can be used to set limits for pollutants in drinking water and cleanup levels for toxic sites, has been a frequent target of industry. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has set the direction for President Donald Trump's second administration, called for IRIS to be eliminated. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress introduced legislation called the “No IRIS Act.” Of 55 EPA scientists Publica identified as having worked on recent IRIS assessments, only eight remain in the office, according to a source familiar with the program.

Why It Matters: The report calculated the amount of PFNA that people can be exposed to without being harmed — a critical measurement that can be used to set limits for cleaning up PFNA in contaminated areas called Superfund sites and for removing the chemical from drinking water. This calculation will prove critical to communities around the country as they battle polluters over who will pay to remove PFNA and other forever chemicals from the environment.

Response: Last week, an EPA spokesperson told ProPublica that the report on PFNA would be published when it was finalized but did not answer questions about what still needed to be done or when that would likely happen. The agency's press office did not respond to questions about Pingree's letter.

If you're sensitive to tech disasters, you might want to look away now: A recent Reddit thread tells the story of an unfortunate user who found 30 years of photos and work locked away and inaccessible in Microsoft OneDrive.

The individual made use of their cloud storage account to consolidate files from various hard drives, which had to be discarded due to a move. The plan was to then move the files back from OneDrive to new hard drives, but before the user was able to do this, their account was locked by Microsoft—without any reason given.

It's still not clear why the account was locked or why Microsoft has so far ignored the user's appeals to restore access, but it's a warning to the rest of us—and a reminder to put a few basic protections and precautions in place.

It used to be a truth universally acknowledged that data wasn't properly backed up until it was backed up twice, in two separate locations. You can copy your important files to an external hard drive, but if it's in the same room as your laptop, then theft, fire, or flood can wipe out both copies at the same time.

Today, having two backups of everything—so three copies in total—might seem excessive, as cloud storage services so rarely go down. We've all become used to the idea that the data we've logged with Microsoft, Google, Apple, or other providers is always going to be available, so we don't need to worry about it.

Apps will often push you to delete local copies of your files.

What's more, apps will often push you to keep all your original files in the cloud, and then be selective about what gets saved locally—you might see Google Photos offer to clear up space on your phone in this way, for example. If everything's safely stored in the cloud, do you really need local copies too?

Well, yes, actually you do. Problems with cloud storage might be rare, but as our example above shows, cloud accounts can be locked, hacked, or hit by bugs, which means you need to store local copies of your files on as many devices as you can. There's always the chance as well that you'll inadvertently delete a swathe of cloud files without realizing it, which will again leave you relying on the files on your devices.

Dropbox can store files exclusively in the cloud, until you need them.

Ideally, you want to have your cloud drives syncing to at least two devices, preferably in separate locations. Even better, set up some kind of local storage backup to a hard drive or network drive in addition to whatever cloud storage protection you've put in place. You might even consider signing up for two cloud storage services, if you have the budget.

Here's one example: In Dropbox, from the Preferences screen you can head to the Sync tab to manage how files are handled. The Online-only option will free up a lot of local hard drive space, but using the Available offline option means you can get at your files if you're locked out of your Dropbox account or you lose your internet connection.

This is less directly related to the opening scenario mentioned above, because Microsoft has apparently locked the cloud account in question without any warning—there's not a whole lot you can do about that in advance, but you can take other steps to minimize the risk of losing access in other ways.

This starts with choosing a strong username and password: The latter should be lengthy and impossible to guess. Ideally, you want to be using a password manager to manage all of your digital accounts, and you should also turn on two-step authentication wherever it's offered (it's available with most apps and services now). Do this and your username and password on their own won't be enough to access your account.

Two of the recovery options for Apple accounts.

It's also important to double-check your backup and recovery options for your cloud accounts. This typically involves making sure details like backup email addresses and cell numbers are always up to date and active. You might need to rely on them if you can't get into your accounts and get at your files in the normal way.

With Apple and iCloud accounts, for example, you can set up both a Recovery Contact (who will help you regain access) and a Recovery Key (a 28-character code you can use instead of your password). To get these options set up, select your account name and then Sign-In & Security in iOS Settings or macOS System Settings.

Google will tell you where your account is logged in.

We've talked about keeping your files available in multiple locations, but you should also make sure your accounts aren't active on any older or unused devices where they don't need to be—it increases the risk of something happening to your data or someone else gaining access to your account.

Most cloud storage services will give you the option of seeing which devices are connected to your account, usually through one of the settings menus. When it comes to Google accounts, you can open up your account details on the web, then click Security and Manage devices to see where you're logged in.

The camera equipment fared far better.

The final report from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding the implosion of the OceanGate Titan submersible in 2023 has now been published (h/t Scott Manley on YouTube). Earlier this week, we were surprised to see the tragic Titan submersible's $62 SanDisk memory card found undamaged at the wreckage site. However, Docket #60 (PDF) of the final report shows that the computer equipment was far more severely damaged in the implosion. Specifically, the onboard trio of Nuvo-5000LP series fan-less PCs, for example, are almost unrecognizable in a “Large Electronic and Metal Mass.”

 




Above we can just about see some remnants of the red metal plating and cooling fins from the fanless Nuvo PC chassis.

According to the report, the above clump of electronic materials and their supporting structure(s) weighs approximately 100 pounds (~45kg). This used to be three Nuvo-5000LP series fan-less PCs that acted as the submersible's mission computer. The OceanGate Titan computer system was used to log vessel performance as well as acoustic hull monitoring and other diagnostic information.

Page four of report Docket #60 shows a smaller, compressed mass of electronics. While some fabric or carpet seems to be visible in this lump, we are assured that “no human remains were externally visible anywhere on the mass.”

Due to the extremely compressed, tangled nature of these two large remnants, the investigators decided to use computed tomography (CT) scans as a first step. They reasoned that “If the compressed memory components could be imaged in the CT scan, then a pathway could be established that provided a route for using destructive tools that could reach and extract the memory components.”

Of course, the thrust of the investigation was still to find out more about the Titan's succumbing to the immense pressures it was under. So, they looked for ‘survivable space' in the scans, where an SSD PCB could potentially survive intact.

Unfortunately, the third-party lab's 320 kilovolts (kV) CT scanner couldn't penetrate deep enough to find any ‘survivable void' spaces, and no memory devices could be identified. The investigators ruled out using more powerful CT scanners as they thought the extra power could actually “damage data stored on any surviving NVM chips.”

Eventually, the large mass was passed onto the Fire Research Laboratory (FRL) at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), notes the report. Eventually, the ATF extracted the two PCBs pictured below, thought to have come from a pair of 2.5-inch SSDs.

 




By the time of the source report's publication, all data recovery efforts have been unsuccessful. It is explained that both PCBs saw deformations across three axes, and three BGA NVM chips were missing from each of the PCBs. Moreover, the remaining flash memory chips showed signs of cracks and distortion.

Finally, no data was forthcoming from similar investigations into the smaller electronics mass. Looking for storage components among electronics parts collected into Box One and Box 2, was also fruitless.

If you've been eyeing Govee's popular floor lamps but want something more compact for your desk or nightstand, you're in luck. The brand has become a go-to for smart lighting that actually creates atmosphere without looking tacky or overdone: Their table lamps deliver that same quality vibe in a smaller package, and right now, the Govee RGBIC Smart Table Lamp 2 has dropped to an all-time low of just $63 on Amazon, down from $79.

One of the biggest improvements here is Matter compatibility which surprisingly makes a big impact if you've had issues with smart home systems in the past. Rather than being tied to one ecosystem, this lamp plays nice with Alexa, Google Home, and even Apple HomeKit via Matter. You can use it with whichever voice assistant you end up liking best, and the installation is actually pretty easy. No more app hopping and trying to find devices that don't wish to communicate with one another. Plug it in and you're set on all your platforms.

The RGBIC technology is where this lamp shines: Unlike lower-end RGB lamps that only display a single color at a time, the RGBIC system displays multiple colors simultaneously in various locations on the lamp. You get 500 lumens of light which is far brighter than previous Govee table lamps and plenty for reading or working. The color temperature is also adjustable between 2700K and 6500K so you can have warm lighting in the evening or cool, bright white light when you are trying to focus during the day.

Govee had 64 preloaded scene modes including holiday settings like Valentine's Day and eight music sync modes that pulse in beat to your rhythm. When you've got guests visiting or you simply want to establish a mood, these scenes work for you. It's with the DIY mode, though, that things get thrilling. You can create your own lighting effects within the app, save them out, and even share them with friends. Children can mess around with colors and designs, and adults can create individual looks for parties or holidays.

The Pat-to-Wake feature is one of those little details that really does make a big difference in the evenings. Rather than feeling around for your phone or switch in the dark, you simply tap the lamp once to be able to see. You do need to set up the Bedtime Switch under the app first, and it only turns on the lamp (and not off), but it's such a convenience when you're waking up at 3 AM and you need some light but don't want to burn yourself.

Timer and scheduling functionality provide functional applications in addition to the flashy light effects: Schedule the lamp to come on gradually in the morning as a wake-up light, or have it turn off automatically once you're asleep. All of these things make the lamp less of an appliance that you need to struggle with and more something that is integrated into your daily life.

For $63, this lamp receives an awful lot of functionality in the deal. The corded model is fantastic because it eliminates the worry about battery life, and the construction seems sturdy enough to survive. If you've ever wondered about smart lights but didn't feel like dropping money on pricey Philips Hue systems, this Govee lamp is the excellent gateway that doesn't sacrifice much in the feature arena.

When I last reviewed a mechanical keyboard from Das Keyboard—the 5QS Mark II—I was not favorable. I felt the storied keyboard company was stuck in the past, focusing on features that didn't create any real improvements in usability and failing to innovate on its core typing experience, which was nearly identical to keyboards from almost two decades ago.

Its latest release, the DeltaForce 65, seems to be a direct response to these kinds of criticisms—Das Keyboard has seemingly abandoned the gimmicks of its past designs, instead focusing on building a modern keyboard from the ground up. While this $200 keyboard stands out from its other offerings, it hardly manages to sit at the same level of its contemporaries. There aren't any cut corners in this keyboard's physical design and assembly, but strange software and layout choices make the entire user experience feel disjointed.

The typing experience with this keyboard is … alright. It's nothing special, not worth writing home about, but it's not bad. The switches are light to type on, being tried-and-true Gateron Red switches with a 45-gram actuation weight. These are a proven design that feels smooth and has been used for years without issue, but they won't blow you away, especially if you're somewhat familiar with modern mechanical switches. They feel a bit wobbly, and when combined with the flex-cut printed circuit board (PCB), they produce a fairly thin and plasticky sound when typing, which is only partially mitigated by the keyboard's sound-dampening foam.

The gasket mount system is simple, and there's nothing wrong with that. There is some flex, and it has a relaxed, comfortable typing feel, but it doesn't compete with the “bouncy” typing of a board like the Mchose GX87. It's fairly muted, without the distinct high-pitched “clacky” sound, or deep “thocky” sound, of a more acoustically-tuned keyboard. The DeltaForce sits in a middle ground that's neutral and tame, without much extraneous noise or depth.

The stabilizers rattle a bit. They've been lubricated from the factory, and for the most part this lubing is well done, but the left side of the space bar still rattles. This is an easy fix to make (you don't even have to open up the keyboard), and the stabilizers themselves—plate-mounted, screw-in stabilizers—are a relatively premium option that should stay rattle-free after being properly lubricated and tuned.

The case is made of a relatively lightweight aluminum. This doesn't have the same heft as some premium metal cases, but still feels more solid than most plastic cases. Inside, there are three PCBs connected together by ribbon cables: The main board with all of the switches, a daughterboard that holds the USB-C port, and an additional board that houses the knob. This means the USB-C port is able to sit closer to the desk, and that neither the port or the knob will be subject to the flexing of the main PCB during typing, a small detail I worry about with nearly every gasket-mount keyboard I test. As far as internal assembly goes, this keyboard gets full marks.

A series of shallow grooves line either side of the case's bottom half. These seem to mimic the side sculpts of some limited-run custom keyboards, and they have a functional purpose, making it easier to lift the keyboard. The design is mirrored in the aluminum knob in the top right corner, which has a similar motif. I really like that these designs are not only ornamental but actually have a functional purpose during regular use.

Going further into the aesthetic choices of this keyboard, it loses me a bit with the keycaps. I'm not a big fan of the camouflage design. The shapes don't always line up across keycaps, and it overall seems tacky. However, the print quality is top-notch, with no fuzziness or discoloration, consistent even along the keycaps' sides. Because the keycaps are white with multicolored printing on top, the RGB lighting is able to bounce between the white plastic plate and the white undersides of the keycaps, appearing brighter and diffusing more evenly across the keyboard.

With a polling rate of 1,000 Hz (meaning the keyboard sends 1,000 messages to the computer every second), the DeltaForce 65 feels snappy and responsive. This combines with the relatively light Gateron Red switches to make a keyboard that's effective for gaming while still being comfortable to type on. It doesn't compare to high-end gaming keyboards with Hall effect switches and 8,000-Hz polling rates, which are going to be faster and more customizable, but for casual gaming, it's more than enough.

The compact size of the keyboard is ideal for gaming, saving a significant amount of space compared to a full-size keyboard. This allows for more mouse space and lets your hands sit closer together for more rapid movement between the mouse and keyboard. To make up for the loss of the function row up top, you can hold the FN key and press the corresponding number key (i.e., FN+1 = F1), and the FN key can be used with some other keys for the Home, Pause, Print Screen, and other removed keys. The knob in the top right is easy to reach and has a satisfying notchiness to it. It's programmed to adjust volume by default, but can be remapped to nearly anything else.

As far as programmability, VIA is the star of the show here. The DeltaForce65 uses an open source system known as QMK for its programmability, and VIA is an in-browser interface based on QMK that allows for seamless, rapid customization of the keyboard's layout. The system is incredibly powerful and intuitive to use, and a common capability of many modern mechanical keyboards.

However, the DeltaForce65 is not officially supported by QMK/VIA, meaning users will have to download the .JSON firmware file from Das Keyboard and manually upload it into VIA to customize the keyboard's layout, as opposed to being completely plug-and-play like many Keychron keyboards. Because of this, if the Das Keyboard website goes down (or the page hosting the user manual is removed), users will be out of luck for customization unless the .JSON file has been archived elsewhere. The lack of official support also means one of the main benefits of VIA—convenient in-browser operation—is less compelling. Instead of simply entering a URL and being able to customize your keyboard, you will also need to download the .JSON file and insert it into the website.

For the most part, the layout can easily be customized using VIA. Any of the keys can be remapped to produce any input, and the RGB lighting can be tweaked with countless presets built into VIA. There's a lot of potential for setting up macros, scripts, and other complex key combinations—when it works.

The main hiccup I ran into was with the shift keys. From what I can tell, it seems the designers of this keyboard's layout wanted to make it so pressing Shift + Esc would type a tilde (~). However, they seemingly did this by conditionally mapping the shift key to both Shift and Function (FN), with the keyboard recognizing the key as Shift when typing a letter or number, and Function when pressing a modifier key. Along with making it easy to type a tilde, it makes the Backspace key mostly useless when holding down either Shift button: When using the keyboard in some browsers, like Firefox, it registers Shift + Backspace as the Delete key. When using Google Chrome, or Google Docs from any browser, Shift + Backspace does absolutely nothing. I can't find a way to fix this issue: Any key mapped as Left or Right Shift in QMK will do this.

Beyond this, some of the other key combinations listed by Das Keyboard don't work either. Win + Esc is supposed to type a backtick, with no success, and Fn + Backspace, which is supposed to register as a Delete key, doesn't work either. After asking Das Keyboard about this issue, I was told these were problems with the unit I received, so the company sent another keyboard. After some testing, these issues were still present in the second unit.

The DeltaForce 65 represents a modernization of Das Keyboard's design philosophy. The gasket-mount system feels bouncy and pliable without seeming flimsy, the flex cuts on the PCB are functional, and both the hot-swap sockets and the exposed screws on the underside show an understanding of consumers and a desire to not only allow but endorse end-user customization.

As much as I like this keyboard's design, the problems with the layout are fairly significant. They prevent the keyboard from being used as intended, and significantly limit its functionality. It's a frustrating issue, and I can't foresee an easy solution when neither reflashing the keyboard's firmware nor editing the layout has any effect. More than anything else, it's disappointing to see a good keyboard ruined by a few decisions that didn't pan out.

T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost.

Trade in any smartphone in any condition and claim an iPhone 17 Pro without spending a dime. New customers joining the Experience More or Experience Beyond plans don't even need a trade-in to secure a standard iPhone 17. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17.

This isn't a limited-time offer gimmick meant only to pull in a few customers before reverting back to stealth mode: T-Mobile's got the infrastructure and faith backing such aggressive promotions because they run the fastest network in America, according to Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence data. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device.

T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The company has also optimized its integration with iOS, making these iPhone 17 promotions a natural extension of their network strategy rather than a desperate attempt to attract subscribers.

The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.

Safety measures became an insurmountable barrier.

Microsoft introduced BitLocker storage encryption to Windows Vista in 2007. It was initially limited to only the Enterprise and Ultimate editions at the time, but since then, BitLocker has become an integral part of the operating system. Starting with Windows 11, BitLocker is turned on by default when you sign in with a Microsoft account in the OOBE. In theory, this is a novel practice — encrypting your storage without manual interception, but it can easily lead to unwanted problems.

That's what happened to an unfortunate user on Reddit, who was locked out of their data that vanished into the binary mazes of encryption, seemingly forever.

Feeling that their PC was lagging and not working to its fullest potential, u/Toast_Soup (let's call them Soup) decided to reset their PC and install a fresh copy of Windows. It's important to note at this point that Soup had six drives in its system; one of which is the boot drive, of course, and two massive data backups, each worth three terabytes, on the D: and E: disks. After the reinstall, when Soup booted into Windows, the latter two drives were essentially gone, encrypted by BitLocker, despite it never having been turned on in the first place.

See, Soup wasn't aware of the automatic encryption Microsoft enforces these days, so the thought to check first never even crossed their mind. Windows kept asking for a key that Soup never noted down (or even knew existed, for that matter), and without it, the drives are encrypted forever. There's no way to retrieve any data through recovery software — which Soup tried many of — because they can't break the BitLocker encryption. Its entire point is to act as a safeguard against bad actors, so as far as the drives are concerned, you're just trying to steal the data stored inside.

Lost and feeling hopeless, Soup performed another fresh reinstall, but to no avail, as the BitLocker screen appeared again, requesting a new key for the boot drive. Thankfully, Soup was aware of the game by now and knew to jot down that one, so they got inside Windows, but the two earlier drives were still locked. The comments on the post attempted to help our victim, suggesting that they check their Microsoft account settings. However, Soup clarified that only the key for the boot drive (C:) appears there, and nothing else.

 




The best part is that this isn't even the extent of BitLocker's overreach. While nothing quite beats getting permanently (we hope not) locked out of your own data, a couple of years ago, we found out that BitLocker is surprisingly resource-intensive as well. In our testing, it slowed down random read/write speeds of the affected SSDs by up to 45% because it forces your CPU to encrypt and decrypt every single thing. This can genuinely slow down performance and make your PC feel sluggish, which is likely what Soup was experiencing in the first place. The signs were all there.

It's important to note that the software version of BitLocker that runs on your CPU differs from the hardware version (called "OPAL"). That runs even better than no drive encryption at all, but it's not the one that automatically turns itself on. Some comments from the Reddit thread suggest that even with a local account on Windows 11 Home, changes as small as tweaking the boot order can trigger BitLocker — if it isn't already enabled when you first set up your OS.

BitLocker doesn't behave like this on Windows 10, or if you upgraded directly from that to 11. But, at this point, for Soup, there's nothing else that can be done beyond wiping those drives and starting over. We suggest staying vigilant in matters like these, where unwieldy corporations take away your autonomy to exercise what they feel is right. Check and turn off BitLocker following our original guide. Make sure to note down any important keys, and always keep backups of sensitive data that you can't afford to lose.

Or enjoy the vinegar odor, because you like marinated pickles, and pitting because you like ant videos.

Some thermal pastes are good for air cooling, others for liquid cooling, some are generally efficient, others are not. But as our colleague Igor Wallosek discovered, there is a thermal paste that stinks and damages coolers. That thermal paste — Amech (Aimac) SGT-4 made in South Korea — appears to be quite popular in online stores around the world because it is cheap and gets favorable user reviews. Yet, SGT-4 appears to be a chemically reactive blend that stinks due to acidic vapors, permanently damages CPUs and coolers with pitting from corrosion, and causes coolers to glue to the chip. The TIM also doesn't meet its thermal ratings due to the pitting.

SGT-4 (not among the best thermal greases that Tom's Hardware has tested) is based on PMDS; however, chemical testing and user evidence indicate that it is not a standard silicone-based thermal paste, as it adds a reactive acetoxy-curing RTV silicone, a substance that seems to release acetic acid when it contacts moisture, based on Igor's findings. This additive — likely methyltriacetoxysilane, according to Igor's Lab — was apparently used to make the grease cohesive and adhesive when applied at thin bond lines, but its reaction produces acidic vapors that cause metal oxidation and the smell of vinegar. 

During operation, the acetic acid gradually corrodes copper surfaces, causes pitting and discoloration, and glues surfaces together, according to both Igor and his readers. Although the substance glues the cooler to the CPU, Igor Lab's measurements found that thermal conductivity was far below the manufacturer's claims, probably due to pitting (called 'ant nest corrosion') caused by the acid. Normally, thermal greases are applied to fill in the imperfections of the surfaces of the cooler and the cooled system, thus enhancing cooling performance. This appears not to be the case with the SGT-4, as instead of filling the voids, it creates new ones.

Community posts on Quasarzone — a South Korean website — confirm a host of problems, such as erased CPU markings, copper discoloration, and pitting on copper. Despite the fact that Amech prefers to be an incognito 'brand' with no website, users from South Korea have found a way to contact it. 

The manufacturer's reaction was not exactly supportive: instead of addressing the evidence, Amech representatives issued personal insults, dismissed the findings as baseless, and insisted the product complied with RoHS and REACH environmental standards that prove that the grease does not contain any hazardous substances. Meanwhile, such certifications are irrelevant to metal reactivity or being precursors of hazardous substances, especially under normal usage conditions.

To make matters even worse, the Amech reps repeatedly referred to Igor's unveilings as 'a person from Germany' to discredit the source while avoiding any technical rebuttal. They have never disclosed the paste's composition either. As a result, by mid-October, trust in the company had collapsed completely among the community.

Individuals with multiple long-term conditions are two and a half times more likely to die following COVID-19 infection than others. When children were assessed separately the risk for mortality among those with multiple long-term conditions increased to almost three times (2.8) the risk of those without. The mortality rates are 22% and 8% respectively. 

That is according to an authoritative systematic review and meta-analysis of over four million patients with COVID-19 published today (Thursday 17 October) in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. 

The authors are calling for patients with multiple long-term conditions to be prioritised in healthcare policies. 

This systematic review is believed to have considered the largest ever cohort of patients with COVID-19 in a study investigating the impact of multiple long-term conditions. The review synthesised evidence from 111 observational studies of patients with confirmed COVID-19 published between January 2020 and May 2023. These studies were conducted across 51 countries and most involved high risk or hospitalized patient cohorts with COVID-19, which could account for the high rates of mortality found in the study.

This major study thus provides an updated picture of the impact of COVID-19 for people with multiple long-term conditions.

While previous research has identified risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease - such as older age, male sex, socioeconomic deprivation, being from an ethnic minority background and having a pre-existing condition - there has been limited research into, or reporting of, the outcomes for patients with multiple long-term conditions. The authors say this should be a matter of growing concern as a third of adults globally - and more than a quarter in England - have two or more long-term health conditions.

This major review found that following COVID-19 infection, and relative to people with a single or no long-term condition, patients with multiple long-term conditions have:

Dr. Shukrat Salisu-Olatunji, a PhD student at the University of Leicester and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration (ARC) East Midlands, was the lead author of the study. She said:

"Our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that there is a significantly higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes for people living with multiple long-term conditions, compared with those without. Furthermore, relative to those without pre-existing long-term conditions, children and young people with multiple long-term conditions experienced more adverse COVID-19 outcomes. This may suggest that increased vulnerabilities could be associated more with the extremes of age rather than simply older age, as has been previously reported.

"We hope that health policies will prioritise people with multiple long-term conditions, especially in times of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic."

This study puts into the spotlight the high risk of poorer outcomes for people with multiple long-term conditions. This systematic review is timely as the publication of the recent NHS Darzi Review highlights the biggest challenge facing the nation as the ageing population, who are living longer often in ill-health with multiple long-term conditions."

A multicenter Phase II clinical trial led by researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center demonstrated significant tumor shrinkage and disease control in patients with advanced pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), two rare and potentially life-threatening neuroendocrine tumors.

The results of this study, led by Camilo Jimenez, M.D., professor of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented concurrently at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress (Abstract 1705O).

The trial demonstrated that the HIF-2α inhibitor belzutifan showed meaningful antitumor activity with a 26% objective response rate, a significant achievement particularly for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers. These effects lasted an average of more than 20 months, indicating a sustained clinical benefit for those who responded to treatment.

It's notable that nearly one-third of patients (32%) who were taking blood pressure medication were able to reduce their dosage by half for at least six months. This is an important finding, as PPGL tumors often produce excess hormones that raise blood pressure. These results suggest that belzutifan may have also helped manage symptoms related to hormone-secreting tumors.

The primary significance of this study is demonstrating that HIF-2α inhibition with belzutifan can achieve meaningful clinical benefit in patients with advanced, progressive PPGL. In a population with no remaining standard-of-care options, we observed durable disease control and a manageable safety profile, supporting the rationale for HIF-2α as a therapeutic target in this rare tumor type."

Camilo Jimenez, M.D., Professor of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are difficult-to-treat cancers that affect roughly 2,000 people annually in the U.S. One of the main drivers of tumor growth in PPGL is the HIF-2α protein. In healthy cells this protein adjusts to changes in oxygen levels, but genetic mutations or changes in cell metabolism can cause HIF-2α to become abnormally active, triggering signals that help the tumor grow and spread.

HIF-2α inhibitors, such as belzutifan, have been successful in shrinking tumors and slowing disease progression in other cancers driven by HIF-2α overactivity, such as kidney cancer and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Building on this knowledge, researchers evaluated the effectiveness of these inhibitors in patients with advanced PPGL.

On the LITESPARK-015 Phase II trial, 72 patients with locally advanced, metastatic, unresectable PPGL who had exhausted all other standard-of-care treatment, were treated with belzutifan.

In May 2025, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved belzutifan for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients ages 12 years and older with advanced, unresectable, or metastatic PPGL who do not require immediate surgery. Belzutifan is the first oral and only approved therapy for this disease, making it a new standard of care for this patient population. 

"The approval of belzutifan offers new hope. As an oral treatment, it has been shown to shrink tumors, reduce symptoms, and improve quality of life with low toxicity. It represents a meaningful step forward in care for people living with these rare cancers," Jimenez said.

2025 – FDA approves belzutifan for treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with PPGL

2023 – FDA approves belzutifan for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after treatment with a PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitor and a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF‑TKI)

2021 - FDA approves belzutifan for adults with von Hippel‑Lindau (VHL) disease who require treatment for associated tumors (RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors), when surgery is not immediately necessary

Results from a trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center showed that a targeted therapy combination improved outcomes for patients with metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) – a type of kidney cancer – whose disease progressed following immunotherapy.

Data from the LenCabo Phase II trial were presented today by Andrew W. Hahn, M.D., assistant professor of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2025 (Abstract LBA94).

The randomized study found that patients whose disease got worse after immunotherapy and who were treated with the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus lived longer without disease progression compared to those who received cabozantinib.

"This is the first randomized trial to directly compare these two commonly used second-line treatments," Hahn said. "These findings offer insights into treatment sequencing and the importance of generating head-to-head data to guide clinical decisions."

The trial enrolled 90 patients with metastatic or advanced ccRCC or RCC who had previously received one or two treatments, including at least one immunotherapy targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.

Of those treated with lenvatinib and everolimus, 62.5% saw cancer progression in comparison to 76% of those who received cabozantinib. Those treated with lenvatinib plus everolimus had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 15.7 months compared to 10.2 months for those receiving cabozantinib.

Current first-line treatment for patients with metastatic ccRCC consists of immune checkpoint inhibitors, sometimes combined with targeted therapies. If the cancer stops responding to these treatments, the next treatment options include lenvatinib and everolimus, or cabozantinib.

This trial was designed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of second-line therapies to identify the regimen that provides longer PFS and improved patient outcomes.

The findings suggest that lenvatinib plus everolimus may offer a more meaningful benefit as second-line treatment and may guide future treatment selection for patients in need.

In a landmark moment at the ESMO Congress 2025, pivotal studies have unveiled compelling evidence that a new class of anti-cancer agents-antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)-can dramatically improve outcomes for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. 

The results from the phase III DESTINY-Breast05 and DESTINY-Breast11 trials, presented in a Presidential Symposium, mark a paradigm shift in breast cancer treatment, positioning ADCs not only as powerful therapeutic agents when the disease has already progressed but also as potential new standards of care in patients with early disease.  

There is a particular need for therapies to ensure patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer achieve pathological complete response following neoadjuvant therapies-i.e., delivered before surgery-, and a high unmet need to treat residual disease in those who do not, to prevent the development of metastasis."

Dr. Evandro de Azambuja from the Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium

Currently, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is the only ADC approved for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who show residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant therapy and are at a high risk of recurrence. In the DESTINY-Breast05, Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a new-generation ADC delivering a topoisomerase I inhibitor, showed to improve invasive disease-free survival and disease-free survival by 53% compared with T-DM1 (for both: hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34–0.66; p<0.0001). Also, T-DXd confirmed its high brain activity, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in brain metastasis-free interval over T-DM1 (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.35–1.17). 

"The generally manageable safety profile and the superior efficacy data suggest that T-DXd should replace T-DM1 as the new standard of care for patients with HER2-positive, residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy," notes de Azambuja. 

The use of T-DXd also showed impressive findings earlier in the treatment pathway- before surgery- as reported in the DESTINY-Breast11 trial where 927 untreated patients with high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer received either the ADC followed by standard HER2-targeted therapy (THP) or the conventional anthracycline-based regimen (ddAC-THP). The cycles of T-DXd, sequenced with THP, led to a significant increase in the rate of pathological complete response at surgery (67.3% versus 56.3%; p=0.003). "The T-DXd regimen has also the added advantage of an improved safety profile compared with the anthracycline-containing regimen," comments de Azambuja noting the relevant reduction in cardiac toxicities which was observed with the ADC compared with the conventional treatment. 

"In conjunction, these two studies establish T-DXd as a critical treatment option for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, ultimately providing a new tool for treatment tailoring for what was once considered the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, and which today represents the one with the highest chance of cure," highlights Dr Paolo Tarantino from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 

After having reshaped the treatment of multiple types of metastatic cancers over the last few years, novel ADCs such as T-DXd are now "raising the bar" in the curative setting due to innovations in their design and mechanism of action. However, their use presents new challenges that need to be addressed. "For instance, 

toxicity profiles must be carefully defined and substantial effort to prevent permanent or fatal toxicities is required. Dosing, duration and sequencing of ADCs must also be optimised to achieve maximal efficacy with the least side-effects, and equally critical is the identification of predictive biomarkers that may allow better tailoring of ADC therapy and minimise overtreatment," clarifies Tarantino. 

The presentation of the DESTINY-Breast05 and DESTINY-Breast11 trials results at the ESMO Congress 2025 cements the event's role as a catalyst for global oncology progress. With ADCs now demonstrating superiority in both pre- and post-surgical settings, the oncology community stands at the threshold of a new chapter-one defined by smarter targeting, earlier intervention and deeper biological understanding. 

"Besides the immediate practical impact, in fact, data presented today are expected to have a broader impact on the future of ADC research, marking the formal entrance of the new generation of drugs in the curative arena. This is a therapeutic strategy with tremendous potential, which we are only just starting to unleash, promising to reduce rates of recurrence and improve survival across multiple cancers in the years to come," concludes Tarantino.

Manchester United secured a stunning victory an Anfield to condemn Liverpool to an unbelievable fourth consecutive defeat as the visitors won a pulsating derby 2-1. There was controversy just seconds into the match after Bryan Mbeumo fired the visitors in front, despite a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister in the build-up. Cody Gakpo equalised for Arne Slot's side, but Harry Maguire's header in the 84th minute sealed a memorable win for United. 

Amorim's side made a flying start to the match, taking a dramatic lead in the second minute as United broke quickly upfield and Mbeumo fired low past Giorgio Marmadashvili. Liverpool midfielder Mac Allister took a blow to the head in the build-up, but referee Michael Oliver didn't spot it, leaving the home fans furious. 

The visitors were the better side in the opening half with both Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes missing gilt-edged chances to extend United's lead, and as the game progressed it seemed Amorim's team were likely to edge further in front. But Slot rang the changes on the hour and it was one of the substitutes, Federico Chiesa, who teed up Gakpo to fire home from close range and level the match. 

Anfield suddenly came to life as home fans sensed an unlikely victory, but it was United who scored again to stun the crowd as Maguire headed Fernandes' cross back across goal to seal the points and United's first win on this ground since back in January 2016.

The Latest | Oct 19, 2025

The United States Women's National Team (USWNT) has called up Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta for the upcoming FIFA international window, U.S. Soccer announced on Sunday. LaBonta will replace Seattle Reign FC midfielder Sam Meza, who was ruled out of the roster due to a minor injury. The USWNT announced its initial 26-player roster on Oct. 15. 

This is the second U.S. National Team call-up in LaBonta's career, the first which came earlier this year.  

LaBonta will join three Kansas City teammates – forward Michelle Cooper,  

midfielder Claire Hutton and forward/midfielder Ally Sentnor – for the October training camp. Now with four, the Current is tied with Gotham FC for the most players on this USWNT roster among all National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) teams. 

The USWNT begins the upcoming FIFA window with two matches against Portugal. The first match, presented by AT&T, will take place on Thursday, Oct. 23, at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa., with kickoff set for 6 p.m. CT. The U.S. and Portugal will meet again in East Hartford, Conn., on Sunday, Oct. 26, at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field. That friendly, presented by Volkswagen, starts at 3 p.m. CT. Both contests will broadcast on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English; on Peacock in Spanish; and on the radio on Westwood One Sports. The first match will also air on Peacock in Spanish and FDP Spanish Radio while the second will be available in Spanish on Universo.  

The Stars and Stripes conclude their three-match set against New Zealand in Kansas City on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 7 p.m. CT. It marks the USWNT's first-ever match at CPKC Stadium, the first stadium purpose-built for a professional women's sports team. The match will broadcast on TNT, TruTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish, and on the radio on Westwood One Sports and FDP Spanish Radio. Limited tickets are available for purchase HERE. 

LaBonta's first appearance for the Stars and Stripes was on May 31 when she came on as a substitute in the 70th minute, helping the team to a 3-0 win against China PR. She became the oldest player to debut for the USWNT in the program's 40-year history at 32 years old. She then subbed in during the 58th minute in a 4-0 shutout over Jamaica on June 3.  

The Kansas City captain has anchored the club during its record-breaking 2025 campaign, helping lead the Current to their first NWSL Shield in franchise history. LaBonta solidified herself as one of the league's all-time greats from the penalty spot on Sept. 26, 2025, when she converted her 14th career regular season PK. That moved her up to be tied with Megan Rapinoe and Marta for first in NWSL history for most regular season PKs. All five of her goals this year have been from the penalty spot, and she has also added one assist. LaBonta has twice been named to the NWSL Best XI this year and her 10 career monthly Best XI honors rank third all-time.

Raul Asencio was perhaps not the best of performers for Real Madrid during the early summer's FIFA Club World Cup tournament.

The young defender simply couldn't get going and was outshone by new signing Dean Huijsen, who has become the club's standout player this season.

His poor FIFA Club World Cup campaign, coupled with a slow start to the season, led many to believe that his days at Santiago Bernabeu could be numbered.

However, it is the injury of the same Huijsen that may have now opened the door for Asencio to once again make a mark at Real Madrid.

As reported by MARCA, the young centre-back is once again starting to win the trust of new coach Xabi Alonso, who has been ruthless at times with his team selection this season.

Once under intense scrutiny, Asencio now reconnected with the traits that first helped him make a mark at the Bernabeu – his speed, decisiveness, and fearless personality on the pitch.

Inside the dressing room, too, Asencio has earned deep respect for his humility and tireless work ethic, qualities that have made him a valued presence among his teammates.

Even after the World Cup setback and despite Dean Huijsen's rise and Militao's return, Asencio refused to let his confidence dip. 

Instead, he channelled his frustration into relentless daily work, staying prepared for when the opportunity came again. He was always ready to come in handy for his team, as evidenced by the number of times the defender operated at right-back.

However, the job is half done so far. WIth Real Madrid considering significant defensive reinforcements in 2026, Asencio must step up his performances even further if he is to retain a starting role in the team for the foreseeable future.

Injuries have not been kind to Eduardo Camavinga in recent times as he was one of the last players to make his debut under Xabi Alonso this season for Real Madrid.

Having suffered an injury against Getafe in April, the player only made it back to the field for an official game in Real Madrid's clash against Espanyol last month. 

Since then, his minutes have been limited and understandably so as the manager has preferred to exercise caution.

Having started and played 75 minutes for France against Iceland in the recent international break, however, Camavinga has shown that he is ready to take up more responsibility and the manager will look to give him more prominence in the coming weeks.

Speaking to TF1 a recent interview, the Real Madrid midfielder was asked if he thought he had what it takes to leave a mark at the club, especially given the sky-high standards and expectations.

The player, unsurprisingly, was confident in his abilities to do the same. During the interview, he said, “Will I make my mark at Real Madrid? Yes, for sure.”

Camavinga went on to describe his experience as a dream realised, emphasising that he has cherished every moment at the club, regardless of the highs and lows that accompanied it.

“I'm living a dream. Not everyone gets the chance to play for the best club in the world. I have to make the most out of it.”

Finally, the Frenchman reiterated that he was happy at the club and that he did not see any reason to think otherwise about his present or future at the Spanish capital.

“I'm very happy at Real Madrid.”

Lastly, there are reports that in order to get a place in France's 2026 World Cup squad, Camavinga's best bet is to make himself available as a left-back. 

While addressing this matter, he clarified, “Are you going to ask me about the left-back? Left-back, no. Midfielder, yes.

David Alaba has regained full fitness after overcoming an injury nightmare and is now prepared to fight for a regular place in the Real Madrid starting lineup under Xabi Alonso. The Austrian defender no longer wants to be the team's fifth-choice centre-back behind Dean Huijsen, Eder Militao, Antonio Rudiger and Raul Asencio after working so hard to get back on the pitch.

MLS Decision Day lived up to expectations as teams learned their playoff fates and Messi sent a warning with a hat-trick

For about 120 seconds, it seemed as if the Colorado Rapids were on their way to the MLS postseason. Denver native Darren Yapi scored an 88th-minute goal to put them up 2-1 against LAFC, and Dick's Sporting Goods Park erupted - with good reason.

Their Rocky Mountain rivals, Real Salt Lake, were unexpectedly trading goals with St. Louis City SC - a team that finished 13th. All Colorado had to do was hold firm. But their luck ran out in the 90th minute, when Andrew Moran and LAFC hit the Rapids on the break for a deflating equalizer. Despite a late push, the match ended 2-2 - and with it, Colorado's season.

The cheers in Commerce City turned to boos.

That's the magic of Decision Day. Up until midnight on the East Coast, teams in the West were fighting for playoff positions. In the Eastern Conference, Lionel Messi emphatically sealed his first MLS Golden Boot with a three-goal night against Nashville SC, while San Diego FC climbed back atop the Western Conference after edging Vancouver in their season-long duel.

Harry Kane has earned “crazy” praise after posting Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo-esque numbers, with the Bayern Munich superstar reaching 400 goals at club level. Those are numbers that few players in the modern era can claim to have achieved, with the most prolific of No.9s continuing to prove that he deserves to occupy a standing alongside the greats.

Sunday's reports claim that former Tottenham Hotspur hero Son Heung-min is an option for Milan in the winter transfer window, as he is reportedly seeking a David Beckham-style loan deal to help him prepare ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Son left Tottenham after 10 years at the beginning of the summer, and has since joined LAFC in MLS, where he has scored nine goals from his first 10 league outings. 

The MLS season is scheduled differently to the Serie A season. In 2026, the MLS regular season ran from late-February to mid-October, and features a post-season that culminates with the MLS Cup final on December 6. Then, teams will take an extended break for the off-season. 

With the FIFA World Cup coming up in the summer, there have been reports that Son is interested in a loan move back to Europe to help him prepare, as Beckham did with his loan moves to Milan ahead of the 2010 tournament in South Africa. 

According to reports from transferfeed.com, Milan are among the potential destinations for Son this winter if he is allowed to leave LAFC on a temporary deal. 

His former side Tottenham, and a potential move to his native South Korea have also been mentioned as possible options.

SALÉ, Morocco – The U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team opened the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup with a resounding 3-0 win over Ecuador. Defender Meila Brewer, midfielder Nyanya Touray and forward Lauren Malsom all scored first-half goals. (HIGHLIGHTS)

In the other Group C match, China PR rolled over Norway, 5-0, meaning the USA sits in second place in the group after the first match day. The United States will face China PR next on Tuesday, Oct. 21 (Noon ET; FS2) and closes the group stage versus World Cup-debutant Norway on Friday, Oct. 24 (9 a.m. ET; FS2).

This is the first FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup featuring 24 nations, up from 16 teams that battled for the title in the eight previous editions of the tournament. This is also the first of five years that the competition will be held in Morocco. The top two finishers in each of the six groups, along with the four best third-place teams, will advance to the Round of 16 knockout stage.

Ecuador made just its second appearance in this tournament and showed some early energy by picking up two first-half yellow cards. Soon enough, the Ecuadorian side proved to be no match for the young Americans, eventually getting doubled up on shots, 22-11.

The USA got off to a quick start as Chicago Stars forward Micayla Johnson sprinted into the penalty area from the right side and forced Ecuador goalkeeper Maria Rodriguez to push her driven shot over the crossbar in the fourth minute.

The Video Support System came into play in just the eighth minute when Johnson was clearly taken down in the box by Ecuador defender Scarlet Garaicoa. The penalty was not given live. The USA asked for a review, but referee Ionela Alina Peşu waved off the claim.

After another penalty shout went unheeded, the play resulted in the USA earning a corner kick from the left side in the 19th minute. Antonucci bent an inswinger into the penalty box and crashing central defender Meila Brewer weaved through goalmouth traffic to smash her header into the net from five yards out. It was the first career goal at this level for the 16-year-old.

The USA kept the pressure on, and in the 22nd minute, forward Maddie DiMaria sent a driven header off the crossbar six yards out after a nice cross from Johnson from the right side. DiMaria, who is one of the four 2009-born players on the roster, earned her first U-17 cap. DiMaria fired a shot into the net in the 37th minute, but her run was correctly deemed offside.

DiMaria was not to be denied, however, and she got behind the defense in the 41st minute on a slipped pass from Malsom. DiMaria's powerful left-footed shot was well-saved by Rodriguez, but she couldn't hold it, and the ball fell to Touray for her to tap home from three yards out to make it 2-0. It was Touray's fifth U-17 international goal in her ninth career cap.

The Americans made it 3-0 just before halftime as Malsom scored her first World Cup goal and second of her U-17 international career. It was Johnson who got her behind the defense with a deft touch with the outside of her right foot into the center of the penalty area. Malsom collected the ball, burst in front of a defender and finished to the left of the goalkeeper from 13 yards out to give the USA a commanding lead a minute into first stoppage time.

The USA ended the half with a flurry of shots and corner kicks, and the South Americans were likely relieved to hear the halftime whistle.

The young squad put the ball in the net less than three minutes into the second half. It was DiMaria again, but once again she was correctly flagged for offside. Johnson seemingly scored in the 89th minute, but she too was whistled for offside.

Forward KK Ream of the Utah Royals, who came on in the 70th minute, had a great chance in the 71st minute on a breakaway, but she was stoned by ‘keeper Rodiguez, and the three first-half scores turned out to be the only ones of the game.

Ecuador had a bit more of the play in the second half but didn't seriously threaten the U.S. goal. USA goalkeeper Evan O'Steen earned the shutout, her fifth in the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, after she picked up four shutouts and Golden Glove honors at the 2024 edition of this tournament.

USA – Meila Brewer (Scottie Antonucci), 19th minute: The U.S. pressure earned several corner kicks early, and the Americans capitalized on the set play. Antonucci served a drive cross from the left side, and it was met by the head of Brewer, who powered her shot into the net from close range to give the USA an early lead. USA 1, ECU 0.

USA – Nyanya Touray, 41st minute: Touray was in the right place at the right time to tap in a rebound from close range after Maddie DiMaria's shot had been pushed up into the air by Ecuador goalkeeper Maria Rodriguez. USA 2, ECU 0.

USA – Lauren Malsom (Micayla Johnson), 45+1st minute: The USA's center forward finished clinically from the center of the penalty area just behind the spot after Johnson had expertly slipped a pass behind the defense. Malsom, a UNC freshman, struck her shot low and past the goalkeeper to give the USA a commanding halftime lead. USA 3, ECU 0 FINAL

Atlanta officials say they are not worried about the potential of that happening here.

Xabi Alonso has opened up on defender Raul Asencio's reliability ahead of Real Madrid's La Liga clash with Getafe. 

“He has a fantastic ability to read the game, is powerful in his duels, and the more effective he is in how he uses those attributes, the better," said Alonso. 

"The mistakes that were made at the Club World Cup can happen to anyone, but whenever he's been called upon this season he's shown high levels of performance and he's very reliable. 

"He's had to play a bit out of position at times but he's got that flexibility. He's a competitive guy, he's got that spirit that all the lads who come through the academy have. 

"You can see that, and there's room for improvement. The unease since the World Cup is well in the past now, he's a reliable player and he's very much available.”

NWSL

 KC Current

Claire Hutton and Ally Sentnor don't need words to communicate. They just connect.

The 19-year-old defensive midfielder and the 21-year-old forward for the Kansas City Current and the U.S. women's national team have been inseparable ever since they met at a youth soccer camp in 2022 at the University of North Carolina. Hutton was a high-school junior committed to UNC, and Sentnor was a sophomore playing for the 23-time NCAA Champion Tar Heels. But to Hutton, she was already, “OMG, that's Ally Sentnor.”

Now, four years later, they're finally neighbors, living two doors apart in Kansas City. The joy is written all over their faces as they talk to The Athletic over Zoom.

They finish each other's sentences, breaking into laughter, their chemistry radiating through the screen. What began as a shared passion at a college training camp has evolved into a bond strengthened by shared milestones, most recently, Sentnor's blockbuster trade from the Utah Royals to the Current in August, a move that turned their long-distance friendship into an everyday sisterhood.

They say they are kindred spirits.

“We always knew of each other, but it wasn't until we started going to youth camps with each other that we were like, ‘Oh my gosh, we're so similar!'” Sentnor told The Athletic as they recalled their first real in-person meeting at UNC's Chapel Hill campus.

“I just knew I was going to be friends with her. It didn't take long for me to trust her. I knew she was my friend,” Hutton recalled.

Until recently, most of their friendship unfolded miles apart.

Upon graduating early from high school in the summer of 2023, Hutton trained with an array of NWSL teams and eventually chose to forgo her collegiate career at UNC, signing a three-year contract with the Kansas City Current that December.

Sentnor left college early after two consecutive NCAA tournament runs but continued her studies online to complete her degree. She was the top pick in the 2024 NWSL draft and joined the Royals. After a strong rookie season, she was traded to the Current in a record-breaking deal this summer. Hutton was eager for the trade to happen if it meant seeing her friend, and tried very hard not to jinx it.

“At one point, I stopped texting Claire because if I got her hopes up and the trade fell through, I'd be the worst friend,” Sentnor recalled the months leading up to her arrival at the Current. “I told her, ‘I'll let you know when it's done.'”

They kept their weekly calls carefully scripted so that Hutton's first question wasn't “Is it done?” They started with what was for dinner, then maybe circle back. When it landed, the off-field fit was instant.

On the field, their connection leaves no space for words.

“I get the ball and I almost always know she'll be in that pocket,” Hutton explained. It's Hutton's shoulder check, her pivot and the lane that opens because Sentnor has already slid into the seam. No wave, no signals. Just the pass and the give-and-go that makes a complex rotation look like muscle memory.

The unspoken sync has yet to result in a goal for the Current, but now they have a chance to do so with the U.S. in this upcoming international window next week.

It will be their tenth camp together.

Their most memorable one was the time when they roomed together at the 2024 Under-20 World Cup in Colombia.

“It's like past lives,” Hutton said. “You don't know why you love that person so much. You just do.”

The 2024 U20 World Cup was filled with drama. The young U.S. team left many games late, scoring winners well after 90 minutes. They finished the tournament with the program's second bronze medal in 20 years (the last coming in 2004 against Thailand).

During the tournament, Hutton took a ball to the head during practice the day before their quarterfinal match against Germany and had to enter concussion protocol, missing the following two games.

Sentnor, who captained the team in her second U20 World Cup, noticed Hutton struggling. Hutton was squinting, typing the wrong words in the text. Sentnor quietly took the reins and took care of her friend.

“She leaned on me with the concussion, but she was my person that I could come back to the room and talk about everything throughout that tournament,” Sentnor recalls. “The responsibility (of being a captain) comes with drama and other things you have to deal with outside of soccer. Claire was my sounding board, which is so incredible because she was one of the youngest players on the team.”

Sentnor has accumulated 12 senior U.S. appearances and scored four goals and two assists. Hutton scored her first international goal for the USWNT on July 2, 2025, against Canada in a friendly match. The goal was a header from a corner kick in the 36th minute that gave the U.S. a 2-0 lead in a game they ultimately won 3-0. It was a pinch-me moment for her.

Still, neither player is under the guise that they are a guarantee for Emma Hayes' rosters for the next two years. The U.S. coach is giving every player a chance and runs training drills that are stripped-down and specific. In a recent camp, Hayes made center-backs repeat a single inside-foot touch around a cone until it was automatic; forwards rehearsed a micro-touch that sets up the next action, Hutton explained.

“You can't just work hard for the month leading up to (the World Cup), it's the day in and day out right now that hopefully can get us selected for that World Cup team,” Sentnor says. “Every camp is a stepping stone, and the chance to represent our country on the biggest stage would be a dream come true.”

For the next three matches against Portugal and New Zealand, Hayes decided to reintegrate seasoned Europe-based players like captain Lindsey Heaps, midfielder Lily Yohannes, defender Emily Fox, forward Catarina Macario, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, and forward Alyssa Thompson. But she also did not disguise her delight at what Sentnor brings to the team.

“She provides another option for us on the left-hand side that can tuck in as an extra 10,” she told reporters on Wednesday. “She may have added a little bit more flexibility than some other players in that situation.”

With the nonstop pressure to perform at the top level, Sentnor and Hutton manage to keep their nerves at bay with cooking.

When they are not training, they cook in shifts and share ingredients.

“If I run out of eggs, I've got Claire's eggs,” Sentnor jokes. They're both planners, both tidy and both food people. Hutton is trying to convert Sentnor to spice.

“We started at mild. We'll work to medium,” she said, revealing their shared love for a particular buffalo chicken recipe at the moment. In their free time, they keep a running list of Kansas City restaurants. Post-dinner sweet treats are non-negotiable. Hutton's old superstition, ice cream the day before a match, died after one good game without it. “I guess the new superstition is no ice cream,” she says, unconvinced. But sweet treats will never not have a place in their kitchens.

When they are not cooking together or training, they are working towards their childhood dreams. “One of the reasons we're so close as friends and are able to be such incredible teammates is because we truly want each other to succeed,” Sentnor said. “We want the people around us to succeed.”

Hutton, a native of New York state, got to see the USWNT squad live, in Hartford, Connecticut, when she was a little girl playing soccer for the local Alleycats Soccer Club.

“It was just a friendly, not even a World Cup match, but it was my first ever live soccer game,” Hutton said. “Seeing what these women represent, with all these fans here screaming and being involved in that, getting the signatures after, I feel like it was just that moment for me,” she said.

On Oct. 26, she will take the field in that very same stadium. This time, as the one being celebrated. It's a full-circle moment, ten years in the making.

“We were not around for the 99ers,” Sentnor said with a laugh. Her first jersey was the red and white striped Alex Morgan jersey. She wore the full kit, of course, with shorts and socks, everywhere she went.

“I looked up to those girls and thought they were just untouchable. Like the coolest people ever existed,” she added. The U.S. will honor Morgan ahead of the match on Thursday in Philadelphia. “Now, meeting them and playing with them, I'm like, ‘Wait a second, this is kind of nuts!' I have a picture with you from when I was, like, 12. So it really is crazy.”

For just 19 and 22, they are proud to wear the crest, and they're equally determined to carry forward the work that Morgan's generation once carried. Morgan helped lead the USWNT's historic fight for equal pay and played a key role in the NWSL's collective bargaining negotiations.

Now that they have equal pay secured with a strong CBA in place, Hutton and Sentnor's focus is on making “great” the baseline across the league. The job is not done until every NWSL team can offer the same opportunities as their owners at Kansas City offer, like their own stadium and state-of-the-art training facilities.

“It isn't OK just for one or maybe six clubs doing it; it needs to be done across the whole league,” Hutton says.

“It can be very easy to get caught up in the individual game and the accolades and everything, but the way that Claire and I think about it is that we want everyone to feel a part of it,” Sentnor added. “We want everyone you know to be able to play at the highest level of their game. And it's important to celebrate each other's successes so that we can continue to drive the sport.”

Argentina and Morocco battle in the 2025 FIFA Under-20 World Cup final on Sunday at the Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos in Chile. 

Argentina are the record winners of the U-20 World Cup, securing six titles previously, but La Albiceleste's young guns haven't tasted glory since their triumph all the way back in 2007. There have been seven different champions since then, but the South Americans will be desperate to bring the title back to Argentina once again. 

They have blitzed their opposition en route to the showpiece event, winning all six of their matches during the group stage and knockout rounds. They have scored 15 and conceded just two at the tournament to date and Diego Placente's side will enter the final brimming with confidence. 

Morocco certainly have the capacity to cause an upset having won all but one of their matches in the competition, although they have endured a rougher route to the final. They have conceded in each of their last five games and required penalties to beat France in the semifinal. Still, Mohamed Ouahbi's men will fancy their chances of springing a surprise. 

Here's Sports Illustrated's guide to the clash.

A post shared by Selección Argentina in English (@afaseleccionen)

Argentina are guaranteed to be without Álvaro Montoro and Valente Pierani, the former missing with a broken collarbone and the latter sustaining a knee injury against Mexico in the quarterfinal. 

La Albiceleste have a host of players already representing top European sides in their ranks, including Bournemouth's Julio Soler, Porto's Tomás Pérez and Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni. 

However, it's Bayer Leverkusen's Alejo Sarco who's most likely to decide Sunday's final, with four goals under his belt already at the tournament. 

Argentina predicted lineup vs. Morocco (5-4-1): Barbi; Gorosito, Ramírez, Pérez, Villalba, Soler; Subiabre, Acuña, Delgado, Prestianni; Sarco. 

A post shared by Équipe du Maroc (@equipedumaroc)

The majority of Morocco's U-20 squad play in Europe, including their top scorer in the competition Yassir Zabiri. The Famalicão striker has scored three times to date, although only once in the knockout stage. 

Dunkerque's Gessime Yassine could be Morocco's biggest threat in the final, with the winger having managed two goals and three assists across six competition appearances. 

Watford winger Othmane Maamma has also had a great tournament, producing a goal and three assists to date. 

Morocco predicted lineup vs. Argentina (4-2-3-1): Benchaouch; Majni, Baouf, Bakhty, Zahouani; Byar, Khalifi; Maamma, Essadak, Yassine; Zabiri. 

Argentina are clear favorites for the final given their superior squad and prior results in the competition, with the stellar defensive record of Placente's side perhaps their greatest asset heading into the final. These fixtures are usually tight affairs and La Albiceleste will likely be able to edge a cagey clash. 

Morocco's array of attacking outlets could cause Argentina's rearguard issues, but they look unlikely to secure a first U-20 World Cup title—even if they have already managed their best ever finish in the competition. 

Prediction: Argentina 2–1 Morocco

As city leaders spruce up different areas around Midtown and downtown, some business owners say it's driving away customers because of the traffic. Many improvements are getting ready to host the FIFA World Cup.

ATLANTA - As Atlanta prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, city leaders are working to spruce up Midtown and downtown with new construction projects — but some business owners say the work is driving customers away.

What they're saying:

Ayman Kamel, owner of popular restaurants 5Church Midtown, 5Church Buckhead, and Alta Toro, said while he loves his work, the growing traffic problems are taking a toll on business.

"I wake up, and I love coming in here to do what I do best," Kamel said. "This is what I love, and this is what I know how to do for a living."

But lately, he said, traffic has become "an absolute nightmare."

"To come out of your house and have the hope to get to work on time — you have to factor an extra 15 minutes to an hour," Kamel said.

He blames ongoing highway construction and multiple street closures throughout Midtown for cutting into restaurant revenue.

"People are calling to either cancel reservations or to say we are going to be late because traffic is bad," Kamel said.

Cancellations and delays, he added, create a domino effect that hurts sales and the customer experience.

"Nobody is enjoying the experience, and that's going to impact the business in the long run," he said.

Kamel recently took to Instagram to urge city leaders to take action before local restaurants are forced to make difficult financial decisions.

"It's extremely frustrating and concerning because the landlord is not going to say, ‘Don't worry about it, the traffic is bad,'" Kamel said. "There are expenses and people relying on our guests to come. This is my neighborhood, and I want this to be the best neighborhood in the world."

The other side:

The Midtown Alliance responded to FOX 5 with a statement addressing the construction, saying the projects are designed to improve safety.

"The projects Midtown Alliance coordinates with the Atlanta Department of Transportation focus on improving safety," the statement read. "The improvements on Juniper Street — expected to be substantially complete by the end of the year — address safety gaps on a one-mile corridor that experienced 569 crashes involving motorists, pedestrians and cyclists over the five years prior to construction."

As the 2025 ATP Tour season nears a thrilling conclusion, the race to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals is reaching fever pitch. There are valuable points on offer this week at ATP 500 events in Vienna and Basel.

Jannik Sinner is the top seed at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, joined by Alexander Zverev, while Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton lead the charge at the Swiss Indoors Basel. ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each tournament.

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN VIENNA:
Top Seed Sinner: After being forced to retire in the third round of his Shanghai title defence, Sinner returns to Vienna eager to reset. The 2023 champion, who opens against Daniel Altmaier, owns a 12-4 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Turin Tussle: Alex de Minaur and Lorenzo Musetti will both look to strengthen their push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals. De Minaur is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, while Musetti — chasing his debut at the season finale — sits just 60 points behind in eighth.

Medvedev's Momentum: Fresh off a title run in Almaty and consecutive semi-finals in Beijing and Shanghai, Daniil Medvedev continues his late-season surge. Though 12th in the Live Race, the former World No. 1 still has the chance to qualify for his seventh straight appearance at the year-end championships. Andrey Rublev, 14th, and Karen Khachanov, 18th, also hunt crucial points in Vienna.

Rising Star Budkov Kjaer: Former Wimbledon boys' champion Nicolai Budkov Kjaer has captured four ATP Challenger Tour titles this season and is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, aiming to debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 19-year-old faces Tomas Martin Etcheverry in his opener.

Arevalo/Pavic Headline Doubles: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic are the top seeds in the double's draw. They are chasing their first title since triumphing in Rome in May.



FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BASEL:
Fritz, Shelton Lead Charge: Americans Fritz and Shelton will aim to consolidate their push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals as the top two seeds in Vienna. They are fifth and sixth, respectively, in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Fritz faces a popcorn opening match against surprise Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot.

Can Ruud Make Ground? With his title run in Stockholm, Casper Ruud maintained his position at 11th in the Live Race, but has also made ground on those in the qualification spots. Ruud finished runner-up at the season finale in 2022, and is aiming to qualify for the fourth time in his career. He faces lucky loser Quentin Halys in the first round.

#NextGenATP Mensik & Fonseca: Jakub Mensik and Joao Fonseca, two of the brightest young prospects on the ATP Tour, both return to action after opening-round losses in Shanghai and Brussels, respectively. Fonseca faces defending champion Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in his Basel debut.

Cousins Vacherot, Rinderknech Return: After their fairytale run in Shanghai, where World No. 204 Vacherot defeated Arthur Rinderknech in the final to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion, the duo returns to court. Vacherot has since rocketed inside the Top 40.

Bolelli & Vavassori's Turin Quest: Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori are the second seeds in the double's draw. The Italians are seventh in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings and aiming to return to the Nitto ATP Finals. They will face competition from top seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos.

"I was not super happy with the way I played in some moments of the match, but to win feels amazing, and it means in the most important points of the match I managed to play good. The last game was actually incredible."I'm happy to win the title—it continues my funny story of 21 different titles in 21 different cities, so I'm happy about it."And that brings us right to today's Stat of the Day: Medvedev has now won 21 career titles in 21 different cities around the world.

Over the next two weeks, Medvedev will play two more indoor events—the ATP 500 in Vienna and the Masters 1000 in Paris—and if he goes on to win either of them his pattern will be broken, as he's triumphed at both tournaments before (Paris in 2020 and Vienna in 2022).But if he qualifies for the ATP Finals in Turin, he could keep it going—he's won the ATP Finals before, in 2020, but that's when it was held at the O2 in London, so Turin, Italy would be a new city on his list.And he's not out of reach of Turin, either. His victory in Almaty will bump him up from No. 15 to No. 12 in the ATP Race to Turin, and with Jack Draper (No. 10) out for the season, he's effectively the third player out of the Top 8, after Felix Auger-Aliassime and Casper Ruud.

Leylah Fernandez earned her fifth WTA title on Sunday in Osaka, defeating 18-year-old Tereza Valentova 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. It was Valentova's first-ever WTA final. Meanwhile, Taylor Townsend and Kristina Mladenovic collected the double trophy on Saturday, defeating Stom Hunter and Desirae Krawczyk for their first title together.

Leylah Fernandez won the first eight points and the first seven games of the match en route to capturing her first Kinoshita Group Japan Open title Sunday in Osaka.

The No. 4 seed defeated 18-year-old qualifier Tereza Valentova, who was making her WTA final debut, 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. The victory marked Fernandez's fifth career title and second of 2025.

Her run in Osaka, which included five consecutive wins, was just the second time since her Washington, D.C., triumph in July that she won back-to-back matches.

With the win, Fernandez climbs five spots to No. 22 in the PIF WTA Live Rankings and reclaims the Canadian No. 1 ranking from Victoria Mboko.

“First of all, congratulations Tereza,” Fernandez said during the trophy presentation. “You played amazing, and it's been a wonderful week for you, your coach and your family. I'm sure I'm going to see you in many more finals like this one.”

She then turned her attention to those closest to her.

“Finally, I want to thank my team and my dad, who's also my coach, and my hitting partner,” she said. “Thank you so much for suffering with me this past week, past month and past year. I also want to thank my family and loved ones back home. Without you, I wouldn't be here. Without everyone's sacrifices and support, I wouldn't be on this stage, so thank you so much for all the love and motivation you've given me.”

Fernandez opened the match with confidence befitting the more experienced player, needing less than 30 minutes to race through the first set and bagel the young Czech.

Valentova appeared emotional during the changeover after falling behind 5-0, perhaps feeling the pressure of the biggest moment of her career thus far. To her credit, she regrouped and played more freely in the second set, breaking Fernandez three times and finally consolidating in the final game to force a decider.

In the third set, Fernandez's past experience proved pivotal to the present. Leading 2-1, she pounced on Valentova's second serve on break point, unleashing a crosscourt backhand followed by a down-the-line backhand winner to break for 3-1.

Valentova responded with one more break to close the gap to 4-3 and earned several additional break points across the third set, but Fernandez held firm the rest of the way and ultimately sealed the win.

She celebrated with a bow to the crowd.

“I also want to thank the fans,” Fernandez said. “For coming this week, for supporting us -- not only myself but every player in this tournament. Without you, we wouldn't be here, so thank you so much for supporting us, motivating us and bringing the good energy.”

All five of Fernandez's career titles have come on hard courts.

For Valentova, the loss may be bittersweet. After a rough opening set, she clawed her way back into the match and made a strong impression in her first WTA final.

Respect 🤝@leylahfernandez is full of praise for teenage runner-up Tereza Valentova in her champions' speech 👏#JapanOpen pic.twitter.com/NmqWr1CMhz

Coming through qualifying, she earned six wins on the week, including three over top 50 opponents. That included a straight-sets victory over No. 3 seed and world No. 21 Elise Mertens in the second round. She also had a dominant first-round win over Alexandra Eala, dropping just three games. 

She also came from a set down in her second-round qualifying win over Greet Minnen and in her quarterfinal and semifinal victories over Olga Danilovic and Jaqueline Cristian, nearly repeating the feat in the final against Fernandez.

When the newest rankings drop Monday, Valentova will reach a career-best No. 58, up 20 spots from where she began the week.

In Saturday's doubles final, No. 2 seeds Taylor Townsend and Kristina Mladenovic defeated Storm Hunter and Desirae Krawczyk 6-4, 2-6, [10-5] to claim their first title together in Osaka.

For Townsend, a two-time Grand Slam champion and current world No. 2, it marks her 11th career WTA doubles title and fourth of the season. With the win, she has now collected one WTA 250, WTA 500, WTA 1000 and Grand Slam title this season, while snapping a two-match losing streak in finals.

It's the first title of the year for Mladenovic, bringing her career total to 29. The former doubles world No.1 owns nine Grand Slam titles across doubles and mixed doubles.

Gearing up to end her season at the season-ending WTA Finals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in two weeks, Aryna Sabalenka let her hair down this weekend for "a date with someone special."But move over, beau Georgios Frangulis, because there's nothing that competes with a night out with your best friend. The world No. 1 reunited with "soulmate" Paula Badosa for a dinner date in Dubai on Friday night, with the two thrilled to come together for the first time since Badosa called time on her 2025 season.The Spaniard was again snake-bitten by injury this year, playing just one tournament since Wimbledon due to recurring back problems. She also retired from her second-round match at the China Open against Karolina Muchova with a hip injury before officially ending her season a few days later.But Badosa was all smiles in a night on the town with Sabalenka, which has become somewhat of a tradition for the two when they're both in Dubai.

In January, Sabalenka defeated Badosa in the semifinals of the Australian Open, after which the Badosa joked she was expecting "something expensive" as an apology.

Nonetheless, Badosa vowed to "come back stronger" in 2026 in the Instagram post announcing the end of her season."There are times when I ask myself how I manage to keep going through the toughest moments. And the truth is, it's in those exact moments that I discover the deepest strength inside me," Badosa said. "Every setback hurts, but it also reminds me how badly I want to fight, how much I want to come back stronger."No matter how many obstacles come my way, I promise you this: I will keep fighting, I will keep pushing, and I will keep finding my way back."

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Max Verstappen will start the United States Grand Prix from pole position after dominating the session.

Max Verstappen secured pole position for the United States Grand Prix, backing up his lights-to-flag victory in the Sprint, despite a timing error from Red Bull denying him a second timed effort in Q3.

The four-time World Champion set a 1m 32.510s with his first effort in Q3 to position himself at the front of the field for the second time this weekend, seeing off Lando Norris by 0.291s. Championship leader Oscar Piastri will start from sixth, after struggling throughout the session.

Q1 provided a frantic start to the action, with Isack Hadjar crashing at Turn 6 and causing the red flags to fly. Bookending the drama in the opening phase, both Lance Stroll and Alex Albon saw their times deleted for exceeding track limits, relegating them to the rear of the grid.

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

George Russell will line up in P4 for the United States Grand Prix, with Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli also reaching the top 10 in P7.

George Russell was left feeling that there could have been “more potential” in his performance during Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, with the Mercedes driver admitting that just missing out on the front row in P4 was “frustrating”.

Off the back of his victory last time out in Singapore, Russell enjoyed a positive outing in Saturday's Sprint by taking P2, having avoided the melee that unfolded on Lap 1 at the first corner.

The Briton could not quite repeat that outcome in Qualifying, though, meaning that he will line up behind Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc starts alongside him on the second row.

Asked to sum up his emotions at missing out on a spot at the very front, Russell responded: “Frustrating. The truth is [when] I crossed the line, I was pretty happy with my lap.

“Of course there could have been more potential in it, but that's the case for everybody and especially on a circuit like this. I'll take it, tomorrow's a new day. Need to get around Turn 1 – as we saw today, anything's possible.”

Having started from P5 in the Sprint, Russell was then pushed on whether his climb up to a final result of P2 gave him confidence that he could possibly convert his fourth place on Sunday's grid into a much higher position.

“Well, the Sprint ended up only being about 10 laps long and tomorrow we've got 50-odd laps, and we didn't see McLaren, so I'm not going to say I've got uber amounts of confidence going into tomorrow, but I don't think we're in a bad place,” the 27-year-old explained.

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, Kimi Antonelli progressed through to Q3, having missed out on the final segment during Friday's Sprint Qualifying.

The Italian ultimately claimed seventh place and, when quizzed later on what may have prevented him from going even further, answered: “Lap 1, I had on the main straight… We need to see what happened with the DRS but it didn't open, so I did the whole straight without DRS and lost a couple of tenths.

“The last lap, the front tyre didn't really work and I struggled a lot with the understeer. It's a shame because I was hoping for better, but we look forward to tomorrow.

“We didn't change so much [between the Sprint and Qualifying], to be honest. Just trying to keep a consistent car and looking on to tomorrow as well, because the wind is going to rotate quite a lot so it's going to affect a lot the balance. We tried to make the best car for Quali, but as well looking to tomorrow.”

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Yuki Tsunoda was irked by perceived blocking from Liam Lawson in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, leading him to accuse the Racing Bulls driver of causing such instances "on purpose".

Yuki Tsunoda has hit out at Liam Lawson for “always doing something on purpose” after complaining of being blocked by the Racing Bulls driver in Qualifying for the United States Grand Prix.

Tsunoda and Lawson have been involved in a number of skirmishes this season, after Red Bull switched the pair after two weekends, promoting the former to partner Max Verstappen ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix weekend while the latter dropped back down to the junior squad alongside Isack Hadjar.

Their previous flashpoints included an earlier incident this weekend in Sprint Qualifying, when the two battled through the first corners in a failed bid to set a last-gasp time.

Added tension exists with speculation that the two are battling for a single seat on the 2026 grid, with rumours that Isack Hadjar will join Red Bull and Formula 2 driver Arvid Lindblad could make the step up to F1 with Racing Bulls.

“With Lawson, it's just the usual story,” said Tsunoda when asked about the potential on-track blocking incident involving the New Zealander.

“He's always doing something on purpose, and it's b*******, so it's him. I don't care about him, to be honest."

Tsunoda, who will start the United States Grand Prix in 13th – one place behind Lawson – was further irked by blocking from one of the Alpine drivers, although he brushed this off as “maybe just miscommunication from their side”.

He added: “I think, without that, I would have been in Q3. So far, I just can't have normal Qualifying. It's really frustrating but it is what it is.”

On the other side of the fence, Lawson was left bemused by his rival's comments when asked.

“I've absolutely no idea what he's talking about,” he said. “I think traffic is always a little bit tough around here, to be honest. But this weekend it has been something that we've all been dealing with. We got hit real bad yesterday in sector one.

“I can't possibly think where I could have been to be in front of him, but it's just one of those things.”

Racing Bulls have shown strong pace across the weekend so far, but a heavy crash for Hadjar in Q1 and Lawson's Q2 exit leaves plenty of work to be done on Sunday if the team is to add to its points haul.

Of his final effort, Lawson added: “We had a very fast car, we just got hit by a massive gust of wind at the start of the lap and then, from there, you're trying to make up lap time.

“It sucks. The car has been very, very quick. Unfortunately, it's just one of those things. We're all dealing with it, but we get hit at different points and unfortunately, it's cost us quite a lot of lap time.”

GHOST CAR: See how Verstappen beat Norris to pole in Texas

ONBOARD: Verstappen's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the United States Grand Prix

Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton delivered a strong Qualifying performance for Ferrari, with both drivers set to start the United States Grand Prix from the top five positions.

Charles Leclerc was surprised by Ferrari's pace in Qualifying at the United States Grand Prix, as he and team mate Lewis Hamilton secured third and fifth places for Sunday's race.

Ferrari had struggled for pace in Austin prior to Qualifying, with Leclerc and Hamilton enduring disappointing Sprint Qualifying sessions on Friday, finishing P10 and P8 respectively. The pair then went on to gain ground in Saturday's Sprint largely by avoiding the chaos of Turn 1 as the McLaren duo of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri crashed out after being caught up in a multi-car incident.

However, the situation turned around for Grand Prix Qualifying as the Scuderia were a constant threat at the top of the time sheets, leaving Leclerc scratching his head after sealing third on the grid.

“It was quite a big surprise, especially considering the weekend that has been very difficult for us since the beginning,” he said.

“We tried to put everything together in Qualifying, we managed to do so, but I think there are still things that we need to understand from this car, because there is a bit too much of a swing in performance across the same weekend without fundamentally changing the car, so we will look into it.”

Taking confidence from Ferrari often showing stronger pace in Grands Prix compared to Qualifying, Leclerc conceded that he will need to make progress early if he is to maximise the potential of the SF-25.

“I think everything will be down to the start and having free air,” he said. “If we are behind other cars after Turn 1, it is going to be tough. If we are in front of everybody, it is going to be easier, so flat out into Turn 1 tomorrow.”

Leclerc's team mate Hamilton is the most successful driver at the Circuit of The Americas with five wins – the last of which came in 2017.

After battling through a difficult first year with Ferrari, the seven-time World Champion is yet to stand on a Grand Prix podium in his new colours, something which he hopes to change on Sunday.

“It's the closest I've been in God knows how long,” said Hamilton. “It's taken me forever. It's not for the lack of trying, but I'm going to give it absolutely everything to try and get there tomorrow.”

Ferrari is engaged in a finely poised battle with Mercedes and Red Bull for the Teams' Championship. With Max Verstappen on pole and both George Russell and Kimi Antonelli qualifying inside the top seven, Sunday is likely to provide another tense chapter in this fight.

	As Sabrina Carpenter pulled double duty on this weekend's Saturday Night Live, the show's censor couldn't quite keep up.


	While performing her track ‘Nobody's Son' from her seventh album Man's Best Friend, the 2x Grammy winner dropped two F-bombs that made it onto NBC‘s East Coast broadcast, as well as Peacock‘s simulcast.


	“He sure f*cked me up,” sang Carpenter twice in her karate-themed performance at Studio 8H. It's unclear if NBC will face a fine or other consequences from the FCC. Deadline has reached out to both for comment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	According to a source close to the show, the episode was fixed for the West Coast and future airings. The word has since been scrubbed from the performance on Peacock and YouTube.

	











	But for many watching live, the moment did not go unnoticed. “Sabrina saying f*ck TWICE on live national television is the most Sabrina Carpenter thing ever she dgaf im crying,” wrote one fan on X.


	“Never leave Sabrina Carpenter unsupervised she's gonna drop the f bomb on national television,” another posted.


	“Sabrina Carpenter said f*ck on SNL justice for Jenny Slate,” someone else wrote.


SNL previously faced similar controversy last season when Ego Nwodim‘s ‘Weekend Update' call-and-response bit elicited some expletives form the live studio audience. But the show avoided an FCC probe as the West Coast delay was censored, and the East Coast broadcast aired after the 6am-10pm window during which obscene content is prohibited on broadcast TV and radio.


	Marking her third appearance on the NBC sketch comedy show, Carpenter served as celebrity guest host and musical guest on this weekend's Saturday Night Live, also performing her song ‘Manchild'.

Sabrina Carpenter mocked the controversy over her Man's Best Friend album cover and fired back at her “horndog pop star” reputation during her Saturday Night Live monologue.


	“Last time I was here, for the 50th anniversary, I got to sing with Paul Simon, and since then my new album Man's Best Friend came out,” Carpenter said. “Some people got a little freaked out by the cover. I'm not sure why. It's just this.”


	Carpenter then showed the controversial cover, “Me on all fours with an unseen person pulling my hair. But what people don't realize it's just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it's clearly a picture of me at the 50th anniversary special of Bowen [Yang] helping me up by the hair.” Carpenter continued to zoom out on the unaltered photo: “After Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line, saying something like ‘Daddy needs his mini-quiche.”

	“Since I'm here, I want to clear up some misconceptions people have about me,” Carpenter added. “Everyone thinks of me as this horndog pop star, but there's really so much more to me. I'm not just horny… I'm also turned on. And I'm sexually charged. And I love to read. My favorite book is the encyclopedia, it's so big, and it's hard, and okay seriously, sorry.”

Experts will look for commentary on how a strong content slate will affect the current fourth quarter and how gaming and podcasting may impact 2026, as AI and other worries have put pressure on the stock.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Sure, there was some recent chatter about whether Netflix would consider a competing for Warner Bros. Discovery, which is being pursued by David Ellison's Paramount. But during its October 21 earnings results, the streamer is likely to keep the spotlight on Kpop Demon Hunters, the Sony animated film that has become the service's most successful movie ever and which Wall Street is touting as boosting engagement and likely subscribers in the recently closed third quarter.


	With Netflix stepping up to the third-quarter earnings plate after the market close on Tuesday, Kpop characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey are expected to be MVPs. But investors will also already focus on how a strong content slate will play out in the current final quarter of 2025. That may explain why the stock has trended lower over the past week.

	But the stocks have been underperforming for a while amid questions about how AI could impact the streamer. “Shares have lagged the Nasdaq … since end of June, with concerns over engagement growth and the competitive threat from AI-generated content weighing on sentiment,” Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote on Friday. “We remain bullish, expecting strong second-half 2025 financial results, including potential advertising upside and engagement growth.” He reiterated his “overweight” rating with a $1,500 stock price target.

Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino similarly said: “Amid concerns of AI's possible impact on streaming economics and after very sharp third-quarter [stock] underperformance, we are buyers of Netflix.” He stuck to his “outperform” rating and $1,390 stock price target on the company.


	“Since May, the story has encountered Google's Veo 3, Meta's Vibes, Midjourney's AI video generator, and OpenAI's Sora 2,” the analyst wrote in his report entitled “Hey ChatGPT, Should I Buy NFLX?,” which is Netflix's stock ticker symbol. “While limited to short-form video now, AI's dramatic strides in video fuel concerns that AI video creation will degrade the value of streaming leadership.”


	His conclusion: “Netflix's widening growth strategies, superior scale, and rich cash flow position it to extend its lead in long-form video streaming, which continues to take wallet share from pay-TV.”


	Investors and experts will also listen out for management commentary on the progress of its advertising tier business and newer initiatives, such as this week's news that Spotify video podcasts will come to Netflix in the U.S. in early 2026, followed by other markets. Initial Spotify Studios and The Ringer titles set to hit Netflix include The Bill Simmons Podcast, The Zach Lowe Show, The McShay Show, The Rewatchables, and Conspiracy Theories.


Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon, who has an “outperform” rating and $1,390 stock price target on the streamer, is bullish heading into the latest results. “Netflix engagement rebounded in the third quarter, driven almost entirely by KPop Demon Hunters,” he wrote in his earnings preview. “Netflix's global engagement rose modestly quarter-over-quarter, reversing the second-quarter dip that came with a weaker content slate last quarter.”

	











	The expert highlighted that KPop Demon Hunters added “roughly 500 million viewing hours, with another about 400 million expected in the fourth quarter.” His conclusion: “There are always big hits that meaningfully move the engagement needle, though one of this magnitude is atypical for Netflix, or any player.”


	Yoon expects all that to add up to around 7 million Netflix subscribers net adds for the third quarter. “Growth was strong in international regions, primarily in Latin America,” he wrote. “Non-English content continues to be the driving force behind growth, and younger audience segments lead the growth this quarter.”


Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich seemed to reference the KPop Demon Hunters success in her Netflix earnings preview, entitled “Hunting down hits.” She has a “buy” rating and $1,490 price objective on the stock.


	“We anticipate that Netflix's third-quarter results will be at least in line with guidance on key metrics including revenue, operating income and earnings per share,” she noted. “Netflix continued to execute on its high-profile live event's strategy, with Canelo-Crawford bringing in an estimated total of 41.4 million viewers, making it the most-viewed men's championship boxing match of the century. In August, KPopDemon Hunters became the most watched Netflix film of all time (325 million views), indicating the company's continued ability to scale massive hits out of relatively unknown IP.”

	











	Remember the recent engagement gains? Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris used those for a pun in a recent report, entitling it “Congratulations on Your Engagement.” “Investor conversations remain focused on Netflix viewership engagement trends and implications for longer-term revenue growth and margin expansion,” he wrote. “We expect member engagement to accelerate into year-end, benefiting from a fourth-quarter slate highlighted by the final season of Stranger Things, Jake Paul vs. Tank Davis, and the NFL on Christmas Day.”


	His bullish stance meant he stuck to his “buy” rating and $1,450 stock price target.


UBS analyst John Hodulik also maintained his “buy” rating on Netflix shares with a $1,495 price target, highlighting a strong content slate.


	“We expect member growth (management cited strong end to the second quarter), higher pricing and increased ad revenues to support 17 percent revenue and 25 percent operating income growth in the third quarter, in-line with guidance, versus 16 percent/45 percent last quarter,” he wrote. “We believe the return of marquee shows (Squid Game June 27th; Wednesday Aug. 6th) and new hits (KPop Demon Hunters, Untamed) provided a tailwind to engagement/monetization.”


	And he expects this trend to continue in the current fourth quarter, “with Monster, The Witcher, Stranger Things and NFL content all on the slate.”


BMO Equity Research analyst Brian Pitz is also bullish. In a report entitled “Keeping Eyeballs Locked on Screen With Content Slate, Podcasting, and Gaming,” he maintained his “outperform” rating with a $1,425 stock price target.

	











	“We continue to be bullish on the name given record-breaking KPop Demon Hunters viewership data, an attractive content slate in the second half of 2025, and a strong slate lineup in 2026,” he wrote. “We expect incremental growth in 2026, driven by a strong content lineup, the Spotify podcasting deal, push further into gaming, and AVOD ramp-up.”


Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos, who has a “hold” rating without a price target, argued in his preview report that, for most on Wall Street and beyond, “the real question and focus will be on fourth-quarter guidance” on Tuesday. He forecasts a gain of 5.8 million subscribers, “which would put Netflix comfortably in the north of 320 million global paying subs.”


	As is quite often the case with the streamer, things could turn out better than projected. “If, as we suspect, there was in the second quarter, there was upside to that number, that would be the likeliest driver of revenue outperformance,” Kurnos highlighted.


	If his forecasts prove accurate, “AVOD would become an estimated one-third of all global paid users in the third quarter – an intriguing milestone,” Kurnos concluded.


	Now, how about that chatter about a possible WBD bid? Kurnos remains cautious on Netflix's stock because of its high price and bid uncertainty. “We are going to opt to maintain the hold rating for now, with shares trading at almost 33 times 2026 estimated adjusted operating income, and, although a seemingly low probability, the lurking specter of Netflix taking a swing on the M&A front, creating some longer-tailed doubt in investor minds,” he wrote.

	











	Of course, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters recently responded to a question about a possible WBD play that media deals “don't have an amazing track record.”


	And Yoon wrote: “We have considered the scenario, but not as a likely outcome, largely because it is unclear what strategic value Netflix would realize.”

Kylie Jenner not only made a decade-long music rumor a reality recently, but she also popped up at an event deemed “Kylie Jenner's 10 Years of Kylie Cosmetics Celebration with Friends & Family” on October 17 in West Hollywood. Reminding fans of her beloved King Kylie era of ever-changing hair colors, Kylie debuted pink hair that matched the latex dress that she wore for the night.

Kylie opted for long locks that had just enough of a wave to turn the style into an old Hollywood-esque ‘do. Of course, the light bubblegum pink shade completely hailed back to the reality TV star's days of teal, dark blue and even green hair.

As for her dress, the form-fitting gown followed her curves while the full-length piece reached down to her feet. It was partially held up with thin straps and had extra folds of latex on either side of her bossom.

She also opted for large (like, massive) rings on her fingers but went without a necklace. Her high-heeled shoes were also a suitable shade of pink that went perfectly with her ensemble.

For her makeup, Kylie slayed pink lips that were slightly darker than her hair and eyeshadow that matched. She also had a slight blush on her cheeks and kept her dark brows.

A post shared by @fileskyliejenner

When Kylie stepped out with pink hair and wearing a latex dress in the same color, fans were floored by the look. That's why they flooded social media to show their appreciation and admiration.

One person took to the comments of an Instagram post featuring Kylie, saying, “Da most beautiful pink lady in the world 🌎 🫠🍒”

“Stunning. All I can think of is the song Barbie Girl,” another person wrote.

A third fan said, “Kylie has got to be most beautiful woman there is.”

“WOOOOW SHE LOOKS SO GOOD,” came from another social media user.

Someone else wrote, “Omg she is back in her wigs era”

When it comes to Kylie's style — including her hair color — she's certainly willing to change things up on a whim. That's something that she proudly embraces.

“I think that I'm kind of a chameleon with my style; I love to play,” she told Harper's Bazaar in May. “I've been like that since I was 16. I changed my hair color like once a week and cut my hair off and then put a wig on or put extensions in; and I've always switched up my style. It's just a part of who I am…”

Kim Kardashian turned heads by covering her face at the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles on October 18, 2025. The event was held to honor several celebrities, including Penélope Cruz with the Icon Award, Bruce Springsteen with the Legacy Award, and Bowen Yang with the Vantage Award, per Vogue. 

Wearing Maison Margiela couture, Kardashian's jaw-dropping look was a “last-minute” decision, she told Variety, admitting her makeup artist probably wouldn't be happy with her for covering her face. 

Because it was difficult to see through her face cover, Kardashian required help getting to the spot where she and other celebrities posed for photographers. Her head was fully enveloped in nude fabric, which was tucked inside a stunning, three-tier diamond necklace.

Telling Variety her look was by designer Glenn Martens for Maison Margiela, she said, “You know, I love Margiela. I flew in my favorite makeup artist Mario from New York, and this is kind of a last-minute thing, so I'm sure he's not so happy with it.”

That's right — Kardashian had her makeup and hair fully done before covering it all with the fabric mask. But the billionaire entrepreneur thought the nude look gave a subtle nod to her own shapewear line, SKIMS.  

“It does look very SKIMS-y,” Kardashian told Variety. “That's why I was drawn to it when the Margiela couture show came out. I saw this look and I was like, ‘That is so SKIMS to me.'”

Kardashian did tell Variety she planned to remove her face cover once inside for the gala, so she could hobnob with fellow stars, including her own sisters, Kendall Jenner, who showed up for the gala in a black sleeveless gown. 

Among the other celebrities who rocked the blue carpet at the Academy Museum Gala were actresses Eva Longoria, dressed in a shimmering Elie Saab gown, and Lupita Nyong'o, who wore Chanel, according to Vogue. 

Viola Davis, stunning in royal blue Gucci, told Variety she's feeling good at 60, declaring, “There's freedom in turning 60. I'm like, ‘Wow! I made it this point! I've earned it, I've earned my opinions, I've earned my peace, I've earned my soul. So I'm gonna take up space.”

Charlie XCX stepped out in all-black Saint Laurent, per Just Jared, and Kaia Gerber wore a custom white lace gown and cape by Givenchy, the outlet reported. 

The star-studded affair also included guests such as Jon Hamm, Jennifer Hudson, Selena Gomez with her new husband Benny Blanco, Ed Sheeran, and Olivia Rodriuo. No word yet if any of them saw Kim Kardashian's face make an appearance at the bash.

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on Donald Trump‘s commutation of Republican former congressman and fraudster George Santos‘ seven-plus year prison sentence, his decision to give Argentina a $20 billion financial aid package, and the president's recent Time magazine cover.


	“Yesterday, President Trump finally released what everyone has been asking him to release: George Santos,” co-anchor Colin Jost joked, alluding to files related to Trump's former pal and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 


	Santos had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft—”which I think is when you push someone in a closet and change clothes with them,” Jost went on. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Jost circled back to Santos, who repeatedly lied about his background and work history, later in the segment. 


	“In the clinching game of the NLCS, Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani pitched six scoreless innings, struck out ten batters and hit three home runs,” Jost said, “a feat previously only accomplished by George Santos.”

	











	Jost also addressed the Argentine bailout, which the Trump administration is reportedly working to double to $40 billion.


	“Argentine president Javier Milei…met with President Trump at the White House this week, where Trump announced that he's sending $40 billion to Argentina, because if history is any guide, a lot of Trump officials will end up fleeing to Argentina,” Jost joked, alluding to the post-World War II Nazi exodus to the country.

	











	Co-anchor Michael Che weighed in on Trump's appearance on the cover of Time magazine, which he wasn't pleased with and which was mocked by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among others.


	“President Trump criticized Time magazine for using a bad picture of him on the cover, saying ‘They disappeared my hair.' And I've got to agree: that thing do look waxed,” Che joked, zooming in on the 79-year-old's neck.


	Che also made a jab at his colleague while referencing the racist and antisemitic group chat between Young Republicans leaders that was exposed this week.

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump joined a Gen Z boys' podcast about snacks in which he simultaneously dissected both Airheads and his chances of getting into heaven.


	On “Snack Homiez,” Trump (James Austin Johnson) told the podcast hosts—one of whom was played by Sabrina Carpenter—that “it's been a long time coming with regard to snacks and friendship and from the standpoint of podcasts.”


	When asked by Braylor (Chloe Fineman) what he thinks about vegetables, Trump admitted he has “never been one for the veggies.” 


	“Ding-dongs, I like a ding-dong,” he explained. “We love Little Debbie. She does tremendous work. It's awful what happened to her. I like the Christmas tree cake. You know, it used to be seasonal. But I very smartly made a call, now we get it year 'round.”


	“Dang! That's so fire, sir!” Braylor replied.

	“It is,” Trump agreed. “It's very fire.”


	When Tayson (Carpenter) brought up Airheads, Trump naturally rambled about world affairs and kept exaggerating his questionable list of wars “solved.”

	











	“Airheads—very interesting taste. Look at China, look at Korea. You know, I've solved like seven wars at this point, right? And no one gives me credit. It's like 100 wars I've solved, right?” he said.


	“Something like 200 wars, right?” he went on. “You know Zelensky, he asked for Tomahawks that could reach Moscow, and I used to not like the guy, but he's tough, he loves his country. He loves his country.” 

	











	Trump then offered a non-sensible explanation for commuting fraudster George Santos' prison sentence.


	“You know who I like is George Santos. He's weird, he's a liar. I think he's great. We don't know anything about him. He's one of our favorite people. I don't know him at all but one of our favorite people,” Trump said, before referencing Saturday's No Kings protests nationwide against him. “People are marching because they're happy he's free. It's a ‘Yes, king' March. They say ‘Yes, king.' Maybe if I think about it, blue Airhead.”


	Trump then asked the podcast hosts about whether they though he would be getting into heaven—apparently a frequent concern of his of late.


	“Am I going to heaven, Chet? Do I fit the criteria in terms of Christian and with regard to St. Peter and pearly gates?” the 79-year-old asked.


	The kids weren't sure.


	“Um, I don't know, sir,” Braylor replied.

The "Manchild" singer doubled up as the host and musical guest for the third episode of season 51. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Sabrina Carpenter‘s Saturday Night Live hosting debut kicked off with a fun callback to none other than the viral Domingo skit — with a modern pop twist.


	The “Manchild” singer returned to the late night show on Saturday, where she doubled up as the night's host and musical guest. The cold open kicked off with another homecoming of Chloe Fineman‘s Kelsey character and her group of best friends, including Carpenter.




	True to the original skit, Kelsey's girl squad recounted their Nashville night out in front of her husband Matt (Andrew Dismukes) in full song form, set to the tune of some of the most popular modern tracks. They recalled their festivities by singing along to the backtrack of Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” and Lady Gaga's “Abracadabra,” before Marcello Hernández‘s beloved Domingo character made his grand entrance (and return) to profess his love to Fineman's Kelsey, set to Alex Warren's track “Ordinary.”

	The original Domingo skit instantly went viral, originally featuring Carpenter's “Espresso” as Kelsey's bridesmaids confessed that she had cheated on her husband-to-be with Domingo. The Grammy winner wasn't actually featured in the original bit, though fellow pop star Ariana Grande was. (Carpenter did star in the SNL 50 Domingo sequel, though.)

	Later in Carpenter's opening monologue, she lightly addressed the controversy surrounding the cover art for her latest album, Man's Best Friend. Pointing back to her last appearance on the show during SNL 50, she noted that “since then, my new album Man's Best Friend came out, which I'm so excited about. But some people got a little freaked out by the cover.”

	











	“I'm not sure why. It was just this: me on all fours with an unseen figure pulling my hair. But what people don't realize is, that's just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it's clearly a picture from the 50th anniversary special of Bowen helping me up by the hair,” she said, as the shot of the album cover zoomed out, continuing, “After Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line.”


	The “Bed Chem” singer used the rest of her monologue to “clear up some misconceptions people have about me,” joking that “everyone thinks of me as this horndog pop star, but there's really so much more to me.”


	“I'm not just horny, I'm also turned on, and I'm sexually charged. And I love to read. My favorite book is the encyclopedia. It's so big and it's hard…” she said, before continuing, “There is a real person underneath all the sparkles and the wigs and the corsets, and another thing you might not know about me is that I love to interact with the audience during my show, so I'd like to do that right now.”


	She went on to touch base with a few audience members before returning to the stage, where she continued another one of her concert traditions: “The last fun thing I like to do at my concerts is arrest someone for being hot. So, who here can I arrest tonight?”


	Kenan Thompson then hit the stage, where he joked that he was arresting the singer “for falsely impersonating an officer 200 times at your concerts. And you're arresting innocent hot people.”

	Saturday night marked Carpenter's first SNL hosting gig, while it was the second time she served as the night's musical guest. She, too, notably performed a rendition of Simon & Garfunkel's “Homeward Bound” alongside Paul Simon at the 50th anniversary special. 


	Ahead of the show, Bowen Yang took to his Instagram Stories to note that he was missing the taping. The Wicked star skipped episode three to attend the 2025 Academy Museum Gala, where he was honored with the Vantage Award.


	The “Espresso” singer served as the third overall host of season 51, following in the footsteps of Bad Bunny and Amy Poehler. Earlier this week, the next wave of SNL guests were announced. Miles Teller will host on Nov. 1, while Nikki Glaser and Glen Powell are set to make their hosting debuts on the Nov. 8 and Nov. 15 shows, respectively. 


	Last Saturday's show was full of star-studded cameos, as former cast member Poehler brought back fellow SNL alumni Tina Fey and Seth Meyers throughout the episode. Fey also made a cameo to impersonate Kristi Noem in the cold open, while Poehler portrayed Pam Bondi.

	In her second time as a Saturday Night Live musical guest and as a first-time host, Grammy winner Sabrina Carpenter wasted no time in delving into controversy in her signature cheeky style.


	The late-night sketch show — which began late tonight due to college football — eschewed its typical political satire for a Domingo reunion during its Cold Open, featuring a reprisal by Marcello Hernandez and Carpenter. Taking to the stage fresh off of the intro, Carpenter addressed the internet furor over the cover art for her most recently released album, Man's Best Friend.

	“Some people got a little freaked out by the cover,” she said, alluding to fan concerns it was unfeminist. “I'm not sure why? It was just this: me on all fours, with an unseen figure pulling my hair. But what people don't realize is that's just how they cropped it. If you zoom out, it's clearly a picture from the 50th anniversary special of Bowen [Yang] helping me up by the hair — after Martin Short shoved me out of the buffet line, saying something like, ‘Daddy need his mini quiche.'” (As reported earlier, Bowen Yang is absent this episode.)

	The “Espresso” singer continued, wanting to “clear up some misconceptions” about her public persona. “Everyone thinks of me as this horned-up pop star, but there's really so much more to me,” she quipped. “I'm not just horny. I'm also turned-on, and I'm sexually charged, and I love to read. My favorite book is the encyclopedia. It's so big, and it's hard.”


	Carpenter, who is the first person to be pulling double-duty this season, also pulled from her concert repertoire to interact with the audience. As she moved to “arrest” someone for being hot — a mainstay bit from her tour — veteran Kenan Thompson popped up to jail her in turn for impersonating a cop hundreds of times.

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures hosted a star-studded gathering on Saturday for its fifth annual Academy Museum Gala.

A-List attendees included Selena Gomez, Quinta Brunson, Ryan Coogler, Michelle Monaghan, June Squibb, Rita Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Rebecca Hall and breakouts like Sorry, Baby‘s Eva Victor and Sentimental Value star Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.

A key fundraiser for the museum's exhibitions, education initiatives and public programming, the gala will honor the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Penélope Cruz, Walter Salles and Bowen Yang.

Bruce Springsteen is set to perform at this year's gala, where he will be honored with the inaugural Legacy Award, recognizing “an artist whose body of work has inspired generations of storytellers and deeply influenced our culture.”

Meanwhile, Cruz is the recipient of the Icon Award, Salles the Luminary Award and Yang the Vantage Award.

“The Academy Museum Gala is a special evening dedicated to bringing together individuals to champion the celebration, advancement, and preservation of cinema,” said Academy Museum director and president Amy Homma. “As we gather for a fifth year, we are honored to recognize Penélope Cruz, Walter Salles, Bruce Springsteen, and Bowen Yang — storytellers whose influence has been proven to resonate in film and beyond. We are so thankful to founding supporters of the museum, including our partner Rolex, for their long-standing commitment to cinema, and our co-chairs for hosting this important event.”

The 2025 gala is being co-chaired by Jon M. Chu, Common, Viola Davis and Julius Tennon, Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey, Jennifer Hudson and Academy Museum trustee Alejandro Ramírez Magaña.

WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators turned out in Washington, D.C. and cities across the nation on Saturday, to protest what they characterize as the increasingly authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.


	“We're here representing normal people — regular, peaceful Americans — who are against what this administration is doing, who are against the occupation of our cities and the disappearing of our neighbors off the streets,” says Jermaine Collins, a 34-year-old veteran of the war in Afghanistan, speaking to Rolling Stone beside a city dump truck, set up to block road access beside the National Gallery of Art.


	A rally more than a march, the “No Kings” protest centered on a stage set up on Pennsylvania Avenue with the U.S. Capitol in the background. The event comes as the Trump administration becomes increasingly eager to directly confront its political opponents using the varied levers of state power — including by using anti-terror tools originally designed to fight foreign extremists against domestic targets, and by deploying the National Guard to major cities under federal authority.

	











	In Washington, squads of roving guardsmen in MultiCam uniforms and body armor carrying M17 pistols and M4 rifles have become a commonplace sight, but on Saturday the law enforcement presence was relatively light and relaxed. A contingent of Metropolitan Police Department bicycle cops — in reserve as a rapid reaction force, their typical role should a protest turn violent — lounged in the shade of the art gallery's East Wing, mostly napping as protesters gathered nearby beneath a hot autumn sun. There was no sign of the National Guard near the protest site — indeed, there seems to have been a decision to minimize their presence in the areas surrounding Capitol Hill over the weekend.

	











	Nevertheless, the deployment of soldiers to American cities was toward the top of the list of concerns for many who attended the protest.


	“It's horrifying,” says one 68-year-old resident of D.C. holding a “Freedom of the Press” sign. He had gathered with a handful of friends in the shade of a tree in Union Square to listen to the speeches being broadcast from the nearby stage. “We have friends who are in it [the D.C. National Guard]. It's a waste of time and resources.”

	The retiree and his three friends, all of whom asked not to be identified for fear of potential retribution by the American government, spoke to this reporter at length about what they see as a breakdown of politics-as-usual in the U.S. Describing themselves as political moderates, they say they are not optimistic that the Trump administration's “vindictive lawlessness” — as one described it — could be easily defeated, especially in the current emotionally charged and divisive partisan political environment.


	And yet, they are holding out hope that resistance to the administration will manifest in votes against Republicans at the ballot box during next year's midterm elections, despite what one called a “pathetic” performance by the Democratic Party.


	The reason Trump was reelected is that “underlying the flamboyant rhetoric, there are real issues that need to be addressed,” the 68-year-old says. Democrats need to face that reality, he adds, but it's also vital to convince voters to reject the MAGA movement and its excesses. “I have to hope that events like today will help make inroads with the independents who were voting ‘Trump' in the last election.”


	Others see protests like “No Kings” as the beginning of a broader movement of national resistance.


“I'll keep it real simple. This administration is taking the U.S. down a road to authoritarianism,” says Ethan Wilson, a 42-year-old veteran of the war in Iraq, who — along with Collins — was representing a progressive veterans non-profit called “Common Defense.”

	“The courts are important. Elections are important. But that's not probably going to be sufficient to save us,” Wilson believes. “What we need is a major non-violent civil resistance movement in the U.S. that's capable of building levers of power that can be used against the administration and its supporters — especially the top tier of elites in American society that either actively support the administration or that are going along with it.”

	











	The goal of this, Wilson says, is to pressure elites and institutions to remove their support from what he calls “the emerging regime.”


	“Again: Non-violently,” he adds.


	Indeed, there were no signs of violence witnessed by Rolling Stone at Washington's “No Kings” protest. This reporter watched a lone man in a “Make America Great Again” hat and Donald Trump shirt walk through the crowds of protesters unmolested, staring defiantly as the people around him largely ignored his passing.


	That wasn't surprising to Collins, the Afghan vet. “There's a bunch of regular folks who are out here who're protesting. It's not what you've been seeing on Fox News and all that. Like, look around. There's not a bunch of — they framed us as ‘terrorists,'” he says. “So that's kind of crazy. Naturally, that's crazy.”


	The event in D.C. was one of more than 2,700 similar protests across the country, organizers say. The administration and its allies have flip-flopped between downplaying and ignoring the protests, to describing them as major threats to national security.


	On Wednesday, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he wanted to introduce legislation allowing the Department of Justice to pursue prosecutions of the funders and organizers of “No Kings” under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act.


	“Follow the money. Cut off the money,” Cruz told Fox News. “You look at this ‘No Kings' rally — there's considerable evidence that George Soros and his network is behind funding these rallies, which may well turn into riots.”


	“This is the authoritarian playbook,” says Brandon Wolf, the national press secretary for the LGBTQ rights non-profit Human Rights Campaign, one of the organizers of the “No Kings” rally. “They rely not just on division and chaos, but intimidation – because they're the minority in this country. Not only is Donald Trump wildly unpopular, but the vast majority of people in this country don't support dictatorships. They don't support tyranny.”


	“We don't have a country if we don't have the First Amendment, and people absolutely should exercise their freedom to peaceably assemble and petition their government,” Wolf says. “No matter what bluster comes out of the White House or their enablers, that is a fundamentally American freedom.”


	Nevertheless, Cruz's threats are part of a larger pattern in which the Trump administration has shown a willingness to go after protesters. In September, the president signed an executive order that labeled the leaderless anti-fascist collective movement known as Antifa a “Domestic Terrorist Organization.”

	











	On Thursday, federal prosecutors secured a grand jury indictment against members of a supposed “Antifa Cell” on charges of providing “material support to terrorism,” related to an incident at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Alvarado, Texas on July 4. In that incident, a group of individuals dressed in black raided the ICE facility, shooting fireworks and vandalizing property, according to the U.S. government, in an attack that amounted to an “ambush” and “attempted murder of federal officers.”


	It is believed to be the first time that terrorism charges have been applied to alleged followers of the anti-fascist movement. Protests against ICE officers and facilities and supposed rampant crime have formed the basis for a number of unprecedented enforcement actions taken by the Trump administration — including the deployment of the military to Los Angeles, the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and a planned deployment of federalized National Guard members to Chicago.


	A temporary restraining order blocking that deployment was upheld by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, which in its ruling specifically noted that “Political opposition is not rebellion,” arguing that the evidence did not support the president federalizing troops over the objections of local authorities.


	“A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protesters advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows,” the court wrote, adding, “Nor does a protest become a rebellion merely because of sporadic and isolated incidents of unlawful activity or even violence committed by rogue participants in the protest.”


	Back at the protest in D.C. on Saturday, certainly there was little indication of open rebellion afoot. But there was plenty of carefully considered outrage.


	“I am an immigrant. I wasn't born in this country. So that means I have the love for this country that immigrants have. It's a different type of love, in a way, because you realize what your life could have been like, had you not had this opportunity,” says Nancy, a 57-year-old attorney from Maryland who — like many of the people with whom Rolling Stone spoke — asked not to be identified using her full name. “I've been here all my life. My dad was American, my mom was from South America. I think this country's really important, and I think it's worth fighting for.”

	











	“I'm an attorney and I believe in the rule of law,” she adds. “The rule of law is what differentiates a free people. And so I'm really, really concerned about the abrogation of the rule of law — and how easily it's happening. How almost without thought, we're getting numb to whatever breaches are occurring.”


	For the most part, the large-scale protest had the atmosphere of a block party, filled with lively supporters of myriad causes in evidence. Regardless of someone's motivations or politics, organizers say, the most important thing anyone can do to defend the rights that they believe to be under threat is simply show up.

	“Regardless of the lengths to which this administration is willing to go to quell dissent in this country, it is still our obligation to show up and defend our most fundamental freedoms,” says Wolf. “You can't tell what this administration is going to do from one day to the next. They've shown a willingness to back down when they face immense public pressure before. Oftentimes, it's bluster and there's not a whole lot of bite behind the bark. And sometimes there is.”


	“But I will just say that, throughout American history and across the world, courageous people have stood up in the face of harrowing circumstances and defended freedom,” Wolf adds, “and they've been on the right side of history when it was written.”

Recently elected Writers Guild of America West President Michele Mulroney delivered a rousing speech at the No Kings protest in Los Angeles, decrying President Donald Trump and his administration's recent actions curtailing Hollywood writers' freedom of expression, specifically via the targeting of late-night shows.


	“I'm here today representing our union, the Writers Guild of America West, and its 11,000 film, television, and news writers,” Mulroney began. “As writers, our currency is words and stories. The freedom to express ourselves is a fundamental American right and the very core of our democracy. And it's under attack by this administration. They are using every tool in their arsenal to silence voices of dissent.”

	She continued, “These past few months we have seen direct attacks on Writers Guild members who use their platforms to criticize or question this administration. In July, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was abruptly canceled after Colbert made comments about Paramount's settlement with Trump. Then, Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended in September over a monologue that was lightly critical of Trump's followers. Shortly after Kimmel's suspension, the President of the United States openly called for the cancellation of two more Writers Guild members: Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon.”

	“These late-night shows not only provide hundreds of good union jobs, and much-needed laughs in these troubled times; they entertain and inform audiences all over the country,” Mulroney added. “They do far more than just tell jokes, they tell truth. And it's clear that some people can't handle the truth.”


	In continuing, Mulroney singled out how the issue doesn't just pertain to Tinseltown: “This isn't just about Hollywood. This is about our fundamental right as human beings to disagree with those in power. To debate, to reason, to interrogate ideas. This is one of the foundations of a civil society.”


	Mulroney also highlighted “the existence of a free, independent media where facts can be reported without repercussions” as one of the key tenets of a democratic populace. “But we currently find ourselves in an era of consolidated media where an increasingly small number of gatekeepers control what we get to watch on television. We've all heard the FCC claim that ‘the public interest is best served by permitting free expression of views,' yet FCC Chairman Brendan Carr does not hesitate to support attacks on those who challenge the Administration's narrative.”

	











	She continued, “Make no mistake: Mega corporations pushed for a pro-business administration that would allow them to consolidate their control over media at the cost of free speech. Instead of diversity of expression, we have the administration using media behemoths to impose a single, uncontested narrative and perpetrate acts of blatant political censorship.”


	In concluding her speech, Mulroney stated that the WGA will “not stand by and let these attacks go unaddressed.”


	“The Writers Guild stands here today, with all of you, to say loudly and proudly that we will speak our minds, write our truths, tell our stories, and fight like hell for free speech and an independent media. When our voices are strong and clear, when our words are powerful, we cannot be silenced. We've learned time and again that when we fight? We win!” she said, leading a chant of “When we fight! We win!”


	In preparation for No Kings today, the WGA West Instagram account posted photos of members coming together to make signs.


	Millions have taken to the streets across the nation in support of the second round of No Kings protests. Prominent Hollywood celebrities, like Glenn Close, Spike Lee and Jean Smart, have voiced their resounding support for the countrywide day of dissent.


	In addition to Mulroney, well-known figures across politics and media took to stages in various cities to address constituents who had turned up to demonstrate. In Washington, D.C., Bernie Sanders, Bill Nye and journalist Mehdi Hasan issued warnings against the country's creep into fascism.

That the issue. The messaging is not effective. The organizers need creative writers to draft the message. No Kings falls flat and I'm with them. Nothing will change because Dems lost power.

Prison Break may not have been the most realistic prison drama around, but it was always the most entertaining. The Fox series debuted in 2005 and followed Michael Scofield's (Wentworth Miller) attempts to break his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) out of prison, where he was slated to be executed for the wrongful conviction of killing the Vice President's brother. The series screamed government conspiracy and delivered on that front, but it also solved a decades-old mystery.

Part of Michael's master plan was to get himself thrown in prison so he could find a way out with Lincoln in tow. He was able to do this because he was part of the architectural firm that designed the prison — not to mention a genius — but there were many other components to his plan. One of the biggest was his plan once they escaped, and how they would survive outside those walls. In addition to seducing the prison doctor, Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), Michael cultivates a theory that one of his fellow convicts was behind one of the most mysterious hijackings of all time.

This, of course, was the mythic figure, D.B. Cooper. In 1971, an anonymous hijacker took over a plane flying from Portland to Seattle. He demanded $200,000 in cash with the intent of making it to Mexico. On the way, Cooper parachuted out of the plane and was never heard of again. In later years, portions of the ransom money were found, but the mystery still remained unsolved. At Fox River Prison, Michael not only tries to free his brother but also solves a case that had stumped the FBI for decades. Michael forms a theory that the kindly lifer, Charles Westmoreland (Muse Watson), was the true identity of D.B. Cooper. For most of the season, Westmoreland denies the charge but comes in clutch in the final act.

Based on its concept alone, Prison Break asked fans to suspend their disbelief. The main characters frequently encountered government assassins and mafia leaders. Amid all that, finding D.B. Cooper wasn't too much of a stretch and eventually became a big emotional crux at the end of Season 1. Michael could make all the plans he wanted, but his escape was contingent on Westmoreland's involvement. He was counting on the D.B. Cooper money still being buried out there somewhere, and he and his brother could use it to start over. The only issue was Westmoreland reluctance to join the escape.

Westmoreland had been convicted of an unrelated crime and was serving a life sentence. His only wish was that he could make peace with his estranged daughter, Anna, before he died. But circumstances being what they were in prison, the tides eventually turned. After learning that his daughter was dying of cancer, he agreed to escape with the rest of the convicts. In a tragic turn of events, Westmoreland finally confessed to his identity on the night of the escape when he was fatally stabbed. The real D.B. Cooper would never see his daughter again, no matter how much he tried to make amends. Michael also had to say goodbye to another father figure, but in his last moments, Westmoreland confessed to where he had left the stolen money. This was Michael and Lincoln's ticket to freedom, but it came at a great cost.

The passing of Westmoreland was one of the more emotional losses of the first season, as he was one of the few of the escapees who hadn't forced his way in. He had been a mentor of sorts to Michael and ultimately deemed him worthy of the money and the answer to one of the greatest American mysteries. When Prison Break was good, it was legendary, and fans can watch these classic moments by streaming the 20th anniversary collection on Hulu.

A private contractor has allegedly taken responsibility for last year's drone and "UFO" sightings that caused a stir across New Jersey, according to an insider.

During a top-tier army conference, an individual reportedly unveiled a piloted aerial vehicle that left attendees in awe due to its unique design and unconventional flight patterns over NJ.

"You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us," a worker from the undisclosed contractor is said to have told a small group after the presentation, as per a source speaking to the New York Post.

The company was purportedly airborne over the Garden State in November 2024 to "test out their capabilities," the contractor's representative informed the source - asserting they weren't required to disclose their operations to the public due to a confidential government agreement.

Last year saw hundreds of enigmatic "orbs" appearing in the skies over several weeks, predominantly over New Jersey but also in numerous other states.

Despite authorities' attempts to reassure the public that these objects pose no national security threat, the inability to identify them has fuelled wild conspiracy theories. Some speculate they're searching for "nuclear warheads", while others suggest they might be the property of hostile foreign nations, reports the Express US.

The sightings of drones have ignited online conspiracy theories linking them to 'Project Blue Beam. ' This wild theory suggests that NASA intends to establish a new world order via a fabricated religion led by the Anti-Christ.

To make this plausible, proponents argue that a technological simulation of the 'Second Coming' would be staged.

Republican politicians have also speculated that the drones could have been launched "by violent dictatorships, perhaps maybe Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea."

However, the FBI, White House and Pentagon have all stressed that none of the activity poses a credible threat.

Yet, the Post now reports that at least part of the mystery has been unravelled. All conference attendees received approval from Fort Rucker leadership, which set strict participation guidelines, including prohibiting any drone or aircraft containing Chinese-manufactured components, the source revealed.

"It would definitely have to be cleared," they clarified, adding, "Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that."

The wave of alleged drone sightings in New Jersey began on November 13, 2024, above the army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued state wide into early December.

President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration disclosed in January that many reports of mysterious drones were actually hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private citizens.

It's official—TRAPPIST-1e, 40 light-years from Earth, could have conditions for liquid water and extraterrestrial life

Information continues to emerge about new discoveries from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. In two separate articles published Monday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, astronomers focused on the TRAPPIST-1 system, composed of seven rocky planets orbiting a single star. The object being studied is an Earth-sized planet 40 light-years away that could harbor oceans or icy surfaces.

According to a study that analyzed observations from the James Webb Space Telescope for more than a year, a rocky, Earth-sized planet in our Milky Way galaxy could have an atmosphere around it. This means the possibility that liquid water could also exist is high. And as we know, if there's water, there's life, which would be great news for the scientific community. Recent studies presenting initial results from observations by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope suggest that the planet, known as TRAPPIST-1e, could have a nitrogen-rich atmosphere similar to Earth's.

The note we make about the atmosphere is very important. Keeping water in a liquid state, which is the minimum way to create life, requires the atmosphere, that layer that protects it from evaporation. This makes the search for exoplanet atmospheres one of the most fascinating and important activities in the field of astronomy. “TRAPPIST-1e has long been considered one of the best habitable-zone planets to search for an atmosphere,” said Dr. Ryan MacDonald, Professor of Extrasolar Planets in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews.

Therefore, to continue their studies, astronomers used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to observe four “transits” of TRAPPIST-1e, or moments when the planet passed in front of its star. The telescope, powerful as it is, doesn't directly detect the atmosphere (if there is one) around TRAPPIST-1e, but instead measured how the exoplanet absorbed light to determine its surroundings.

The goal now for researchers is to obtain more JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1e to enable a deeper search of the atmosphere. With each additional transit, the atmospheric content becomes clearer. “In the next few years, we'll go from four JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1e to nearly 20. We finally have the telescope and tools to search for habitable conditions in other star systems, making today one of the most exciting times in astronomy,” MacDonald said.

Finding an atmosphere isn't so simple for astronomers. Researchers must carefully account for starspots, as they are created by local magnetic fields on the surfaces of stars. The team spent more than a year carefully correcting the data to remove star contamination—the visual noise around TRAPPIST-1e.

How can they do this? Scientists use colors. Like a prism, light can be separated into different color bands in a rainbow-like spectrum. In this way, the way colors are blocked, or how they filter out certain colors, can be signals of specific atoms or gas molecules. “If we see no variation in color, then the planet is probably just a bare rock,” MacDonald said.

As for current discoveries and data, NASA has stated that Titan (one of the moons orbiting Saturn) likely harbors a vast subsurface ocean, which could make it habitable, but the moon's methane-rich environment would mean that any life existing there would be very different from that on Earth. This is an example of how far-reaching research can go. In other words, what we know about TRAPPIST-1e is still very limited; we'll have to wait to learn more about the details of this discovery.

A private company at a high-powered Army conference demonstrated a unique aircraft at the event — and allegedly took responsibility for setting off last year's drone and “UFO” pandemonium in New Jersey, a source told The Post.

At the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August, a private contractor conducted a live demonstration of a manned aerial craft that wowed the crowd with its unconventional appearance and unorthodox flight-movements, an attendee told The Post.

“You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” an employee of the unnamed contractor claimed to a small group after the demonstration, according to the source who was invited to the summit.

The company was in the air over the Garden State in November 2024 to “test out their capabilities,” the contractor's employee claimed to the source — adding they were not required to disclose their activity to the public because of a private government contract.

In video provided to The Post, the roughly 20-foot across four-winged flier zooms through the skies just above the tree-line, drawing the attention of dozens of soldiers on the ground.

“I thought it was the military testing something out on the other side of the base,” the source, a military veteran and drone expert, said of their first impression of the flying object on Aug. 12 at Fort Rucker.

“It feels like it's a UFO because it defies what you're expecting to see,” they said, adding there was an “uncanny valley feeling” when watching it quietly motor through the sky.

“When it turned you almost completely lose sight of it,” the source said, of the roughly 30-minute demonstration in the controlled airspace of Fort Rucker.

“Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.”

All conference attendees were approved by brass at Fort Rucker, which enacted strict rules for participation, including the exclusion of any drone or craft containing any Chinese-made parts, the source revealed.

“It would definitely have to be cleared,” they said, adding, “Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that.”

Fort Rucker, which is the headquarters for the Army's Aviation Branch, could not be reached for comment.

The rash of supposed drone sightings in New Jersey began on Nov. 13, 2024 over Army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued across the state through early December.

President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration announced in January that many of the reports of mystery drones were hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private individuals.

The Army declined comment, citing the shutdown of the federal government.
