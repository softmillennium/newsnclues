                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at The University of Western Australia's node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) have made a remarkable discovery: a massive structure stretching about 185,000 light-years between two galaxies, NGC 4532 and DDO 137, located some 53 million light-years from Earth. Lead researcher Professor Lister Staveley-Smith from ICRAR UWA explained that the finding provides an important new insight into how galaxies influence each other. Co-author Professor Kenji Bekki of ICRAR UWA said the team identified the enormous gas structures through high-resolution observations of neutral hydrogen, a key ingredient in star formation. "Neutral hydrogen plays a crucial role in the formation of stars, making this finding fundamental to understanding how galaxies interact and evolve, particularly in dense environments," Professor Bekki said. Professor Staveley-Smith said the system had strong similarities with our own Milky Way and Magellanic System, providing a unique opportunity to study such interactions in detail. "Understanding these gas bridges and their dynamics provides critical insights into how galaxies evolve over time, how galactic gas is redistributed, and the varying conditions under which galaxies may or may not form stars," he said. "This contributes to our broader understanding of the most massive structures in the Universe and their life cycles, which helps us grasp more about their vast complexities and history of star formation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at the Francis Crick Institute and Vividion Therapeutics have discovered chemical compounds that can precisely prevent the cancer-driving gene RAS from connecting with a key pathway responsible for tumor growth. The potential treatment is now moving into its first human clinical trial. When mutated, RAS becomes permanently active, continually sending signals that push cells to keep growing and multiplying. Completely shutting down RAS or the enzymes it controls has proven difficult, because these same pathways are essential for normal cell function. One of the enzymes linked to RAS, called PI3K, also helps regulate blood sugar through insulin. In their study, published on October 9 in Science, the team combined chemical screening with biological testing to identify compounds that stop RAS and PI3K from interacting, while leaving normal cell activity intact. Researchers at Vividion Therapeutics pinpointed a set of small molecules that permanently attach to the surface of PI3K near the spot where RAS would normally bind. Using an assay created by the Crick researchers, they confirmed that these compounds successfully blocked the RAS-PI3K interaction but still allowed PI3K to perform its other roles, including those related to insulin signaling. Tumor growth was again halted, even though the effect did not rely on RAS. The drug has now entered the first clinical trial in humans to test for safety and side effects in people with both RAS and HER2 mutations. "Our collaborative effort has overcome this challenge by targeting the PI3K and RAS interaction specifically, leaving PI3K free to bind with its other targets. "This discovery is a great example of how new discovery approaches can open up completely novel ways to tackle cancer," said Matt Patricelli, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Vividion. "By designing molecules that stop RAS and PI3K from connecting, while still allowing healthy cell processes to continue, we've found a way to selectively block a key cancer growth signal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large-scale investigation has found that people who regularly consume both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and low- or no-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs) face a significantly greater likelihood of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).1 During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 1,178 participants developed MASLD and 108 died from liver-related causes. Although SSBs were not significantly connected to liver-related mortality, LNSSB consumption was. Lead researcher Lihe Liu explained, "SSBs have long been under scrutiny, while their 'diet' alternatives are often seen as the healthier choice. Both, however, are widely consumed and their effects on liver health have not been well understood." These findings challenge the common perception that these drinks are harmless and highlight the need to reconsider their role in diet and liver health, especially as MASLD emerges as a global health concern." The authors emphasized that these findings support limiting both SSBs and LNSSBs as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy, targeting not only liver disease but also cardio-renal-metabolic health. Liu added, "The safest approach is to limit both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How did the universe come into existence, and what early processes shaped everything that followed? A new study published in Physical Review Research takes aim at this fundamental question. Scientists from Spain and Italy have introduced a model that reimagines what happened moments after the universe was born. According to that theory, the universe expanded at an extraordinary rate within a tiny fraction of a second after it came into existence. It suggests that gravitational waves -- predicted by general relativity -- may be the true driving force behind the universe's formation, giving rise to galaxies, stars, planets, and ultimately life on Earth. "For decades, we have tried to understand the early moments of the Universe using models based on elements we have never observed," said Dr. Raúl Jiménez, who studies experimental sciences & mathematics at ICREA in Spain and is a co-author on the study. "What makes this proposal exciting is its simplicity and verifiability. We are not adding speculative elements but rather demonstrating that gravity and quantum mechanics may be sufficient to explain how the structure of the cosmos came into being." These waves can originate from powerful cosmic events such as supernovae, merging black holes, and colliding neutron stars. Because they are incredibly faint, detecting them requires highly sensitive instruments. It was not until September 2015 that scientists at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with facilities in Washington and Louisiana, achieved the first confirmed detection. We are a way for the universe to know itself." But like the simplicity this study presents, perhaps this study is simply a way for us to know the universe itself a little bit better.
