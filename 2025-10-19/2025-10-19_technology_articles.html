                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bluesky is a social media platform loved by liberals, leftists, progressives, woke people, or whatever you want to call dislikers of Donald Trump. When a bunch of Donald Trump-associated accounts started using Bluesky ahead of this weekend in order to provoke a food fight, some were outraged or trolled back, but Bluesky's robust blocking feature and cultural norms around ignoring right-wing trolls and harassers made their presence mostly a non-issue. On Friday afternoon, the Trump 2.0 White House account, @whitehouse-47.bsky.social, announced its momentous arrival by posting a vaguely triumphalist montage of clips that referenced a lot of inside jokes for Republicans that probably don't even register for outsiders, like one about Joe Biden's autopen. We thought you might've missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you. Can't wait to spend more quality time together! We thought you might've missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you. Can't wait to spend more quality time together! According to the Bluesky block tracking site Clearsky, @whitehouse-47.bsky.social is already the second most blocked account on Bluesky, just below Vice President J.D. The White House's bid for attention was accompanied by similar introductory posts from the departments of State, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Commerce, the so-called “Department of War,” and many other cabinet departments and executive branch offices. Their posts and videos mostly just greet the users of Bluesky and hint at future dialogue in the same sarcastic tone at the initial White House post. Most have spent the weekend posting platitudes, and receiving double-digit repost counts as users avoid taking the bait. If the White House communications people who likely orchestrated all this were hoping to be able to generate epic lib meltdown content, it's doubtful the mostly muted reaction was worth their effort. That's because blocking on Bluesky is public, conspicuous, and designed to be total. Further clashes, friction, and cognitive dissonance will drop off abruptly. The blocker and blockee will basically vanish from one another's universes. Bluesky blocking culture also includes the use of block lists, one-stop-shopping for blocking all accounts in some category or group with a single tap. There is even, somewhat more controversially, at least one block list of all users who interacted with the White House account rather then simply blocking it. Bluesky critics like Mark Cuban call Bluesky an echo chamber, and it's hard to argue that they're entirely wrong. But all the Trump White House set out to do this weekend in that echo chamber was make a screeching noise, and since users are equipped with very effective earplugs, it wasn't even all that annoying.

Battlefield 6 has had an explosive launch, marking a return to critical acclaim and record-breaking player counts. Everyone wants to get in on the military shooter action, and it seems even your job can't stand in the way of that mission. That's right, the apparatus designed to keep your processor's thermals in check can now double as a quickly deployable secondary display. Many high-end AIOs these days come with built-in screens that have secondary display functionality baked in — such is the case with MSI's CoreLiquid P13 (Tom's Hardware review link), which is what “Tim” used in the demonstration. It's got a circular aspect ratio, so you do lose some screen real estate, but nothing bothersome enough to stop some creative XP farming. “I mean, maybe not the best setup, but a little XP farming? Why not, you could do that,” claims Tim while laser-focused on the AIO. He was meant to be testing a new OLED, which you can even see on his desk in the video, but when he's caught red-handed gunning down enemies in Battlefield, he responds cleverly: “Yeah, I am doing monitor tests here.” He's not wrong; it may not be OLED, and it certainly wouldn't be the first choice for competitive gaming, but as they say — it's never about the car, it's about the driver. Or in this case, I guess, how it's being driven. It's always great to see the hobby birth such creative concepts that, while not exactly practical, are always novel to look at and push the DIY nature of this rabbit hole forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is taking its social media attacks on Democratic opponents to an unlikely platform, with the White House and numerous other government agencies joining Bluesky on Friday. In its first post, the new White House account uploaded a highlight reel of Trump footage and memes, along with the message, “What's up, Bluesky? “We heard this is a great place to have an open and honest dialogue, so we're here to talk about how the Democrat shutdown is undermining our country on the world stage,” wrote the Department of State. (Legal experts have suggested that similar statements from government agencies likely violate the Hatch Act.) And Bluesky users delivered, with many responses to the initial White House post bringing up Trump's relationship with infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. At the same time, many popular Bluesky accounts urged their followers to simply “block and move on,” with comedian Paul F Tomkins declaring that it's “Weirdly fun to block the White House.” The only account that's been blocked by more Bluesky users belongs to Vice President JD Vance, who joined back in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But I think the way the US is set up (districting, gerrymandering, redlined, electoral college, etc) makes it far too easy for fringe beliefs to take over and dictate policy. So having states simply being more independent puts up far more barriers to all of us just losing our freedom.I live in IL. My kids public school only gets about 15% of its funding from the federal govt. We could just finally stop having our stupid flat income tax and make up the shortfall. It might set back the universal preschool system, perhaps (which would be a tragedy but better than complete destruction).Meanwhile, schools might not even exist in many other states if federal funding disappeared.

Meanwhile, schools might not even exist in many other states if federal funding disappeared. That said, as a fly on the wall, my obvious observation from people at large is a direct correlation between how much power they believe  states should have and whether or not they belong to the party in power. The neverending struggle of course is what does one consider a human right. Let's say we get rid of Medicare, Medicaid, social security, and research funding at the federal level. What happens next?The West Coast and North East form compacts, companies, or nonprofits that provide healthcare, retirement and funding for their schools. The West Coast and North East form compacts, companies, or nonprofits that provide healthcare, retirement and funding for their schools. Look: our universities really do need reform, and the perceptive observer should be able to see that independent of political opinions. The current administration may be an imperfect vehicle for reform, but I don't see anyone else trying.In particular, universities need to return to pursuing truth. I recall that they spent a decade demanding statements of ideological affiliation as a precondition of hiring, that they pollute the epistemic commons by suppressing inconvenient facts, and that they rationale injustice against individuals by gesturing at universal, cosmic justice that they claim they alone have the power to discern.I see no reason to send public money to seminaries that have murdered universities, donned their skins, and demand respect as institutes of knowledge.

What the universities are doing now is not conducive to scientific knowledge either. In fact, they produce a lot of anti-knowledge. For decades most of the genome was believed to be garbage. It was through academic research that this knowledge has been rebutted and replaced not by politics or regulation. Regardless of the hilarity of that phrase being associated with universities over the attention driven news and internet that is both: 1. For decades most of the genome was believed to be garbage. It was through academic research that this knowledge has been rebutted and replaced not by politics or regulation. What the Feds are doing here is just a hop skip and a jump from forcing universities to hire young Earth creationists alongside archaeologists, climate change deniers alongside climate scientists, etc.Universities and the research they do must inform politics, but the reverse risks destroying the research enterprise all together. It sadly does not mean that universities are laser-focused on seeking truth, and are free from ideological biases, often very obvious. Regarding truth, one of the leading theories in humanities is that of Michel Foucault, which states that there cannot be any objective truth, and what is considered true is determined by power structures.I'm glad to see though that the four universities are making a stand, and value independence above whatever "federal benefits" the administration may offer. It's sad that these are only 4 out of 9. I'm glad to see though that the four universities are making a stand, and value independence above whatever "federal benefits" the administration may offer. It's sad that these are only 4 out of 9. Do you have specific policies to address this? If not then this is a natural part of the unfocused nature of knowledge work, and the natural weakness of human organizations.University research and knowledge work in general is backtracking search, not gradient descent in a friendly loss landscape. But surely it also can't be the case that colleges demand what are basically declarations of political allegiance in the form of DEI statements, institutional trust is nosediving and ideological capture is to blame in large part. I hope this push from the administration fails, but I also hope something changes because otherwise the result is going to be worse than if universities actually submitted to these demands. Because while I agree that>The pursuit of truth is difficult and has its pitfalls but it naturally leads to the dominance of certain viewpointsI'm certain that demanding essays from which you could perfectly predict voting patterns is not the mark of viewpoints that prioritize the pursuit of truth. >The pursuit of truth is difficult and has its pitfalls but it naturally leads to the dominance of certain viewpointsI'm certain that demanding essays from which you could perfectly predict voting patterns is not the mark of viewpoints that prioritize the pursuit of truth. I'm certain that demanding essays from which you could perfectly predict voting patterns is not the mark of viewpoints that prioritize the pursuit of truth. Regardless governments must let the natural academic process handle these institutional issues. Is straining to carry the rest of this sentence. I responded to an assertion that a policy by certain limited universities was attempted and deemed unfit by the natural process was still active. This is how institutions grow and evolve.> echo chambersPublish your papers, rebut the research.

I have a hard time taking comments like this seriously as it reads like you have a persecution complex while your guy just got elected and he controls all three branches of government. Surely if conservatives actually cared about solving this existential problem, they'd gather input from everyone and write legislation for it? But i still think its possible for academics to get into echo chambers. They are human just like the rest of us. Especially in fields not easily subject to direct experimental verification. I think its important not to put researchers on a pedestal as if they are above folly. (After all, the saying "science advanced one funeral at a time" didn't come from nowhere) This is known in the scientific, philosophical, and research communities. It is a reality that is only solved by the slow inexorable application of the scientific process and exchange of ideas, not by outside political influence.We should never put researchers on pedestals, but the process of science is the most prized accomplishment of humanity. We should never put researchers on pedestals, but the process of science is the most prized accomplishment of humanity. Restorative justice has failed everywhere it's been tried . That this viewpoint is universal in academia isn't the organic victory of a good idea, but ideological groupthink that becomes a menace to society when it escapes the quad.And it's not only that equitable justice is the dominant viewpoint: it's that no competing viewpoint are allowed. This is not an environment conducive to knowledge formation.No university department that pushes "equitable justice" as summa bonum should receive public money. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion."

Can you point to a university whose explicit policy is restorative justice? You're probably taking issue with an individual department which naturally has a certain research and academic history.Are you prepared to cite the works prepared and researched by individuals at a university or lab which counter the research on restorative justice?If not then either it doesn't exist and we're operating on anecdata or it does exist and the research system is proceeding exactly as intended.

Also, showing their hypocrisy as they complain about people doing to them what they've been doing for decades now. I first realized this decades ago when I ran into someone socially who started on about how evil the red cross was. There are thousands of oddball grievances like this. They should have noted this in the article we are discussing since it does change the story, as you said. You bet your behind Greg Abbott (Texas Governor) is doing everything he can to kiss the ring, gut his local university, push UT to joining. But no one could take UT seriously ever again, it'd be a laughingstock joke to accept state control like this. 1.Equality in admissions- with certain exceptions, universities have to publish and commit to objective criteria for accepting new students.2.Marketplace of ideas and civil discourse - a bit vague, but basically calling for non violent exchanges of opinions and ideas, specifically not discriminating against conservatives, who frankly are a significant minority at universities.3.Nondiscrimination in faculty and administrative hiring4.Institutional neutrality - frankly i'm not sure what that's supposed to mean5.Student learning -Signatories must make certain “grade integrity” commitments, including neither “inflat[ing]” nor “deflat[ing]” grades for any “non-academic reason.”6.Student equality -Signatories must treat students “as individuals and not on the basis of their immutable characteristics, with due exceptions for sex-based privacy, safety, and fairness”7.Financial responsibility - a raft of ideas aimed at protecting students8.

This is the original compact https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/1...1 The Compact explicitly makes federal funding conditional on compliance, meaning that universities must either align with federal definitions of “excellence” and “neutrality” or lose access to research grants, contracts, student loans, and tax exemptions. In practice, this could establish a centralized federal control mechanism over university policies effectively nationalizing large portions of higher education decision-making without direct legislation.Sections 2 and 4 (“Marketplace of Ideas” and “Institutional Neutrality”) appear to promote pluralism, but they impose mandatory structural changes to ensure “no single ideology dominant”. This could require ideological balancing in faculty hiring, curricula, and departmental governance. The threat of Department of Justice enforcement transforms “neutrality” into a federally monitored ideological litmus test, likely constraining academic freedom more than protecting it.Section 6 defines “male,” “female,” “woman,” and “man” strictly by biological function and requires single-sex spaces to be maintained on that basis. This departs from current federal civil rights interpretations under Title IX and would effectively prohibit recognition of gender identity in campus policy rolling back existing protections for transgender and nonbinary students.By forbidding universities from commenting institutionally on “societal and political events” unless directly related to operations, the Compact silences institutional voices on issues like racial justice, climate change, or foreign policy—even if faculty consensus supports public engagement. The “marketplace of ideas” clause simultaneously allows punishment of university employees or centers deemed “dominant” in ideology, directly threatening critical studies programs (e.g., gender studies, ethnic studies).Section 8 introduces anti-money-laundering and KYC requirements typically reserved for banks, applied here to universities. It also mandates information sharing with DHS and the State Department and caps foreign student enrollment at 15%, with a 5% per-country limit. Combined with civics instruction requirements for foreigners, this moves higher education toward national security oversight and ideological vetting creating a form of state-managed educational nationalism.The enforcement section deputizes the Department of Justice to investigate compliance and allows it to reclaim all federal funds and even PRIVATE contributions during a violation year. This mechanism represents an extraordinary form of financial coercion that could bankrupt noncompliant universities, effectively forcing universal submission or privatization. 1 The Compact explicitly makes federal funding conditional on compliance, meaning that universities must either align with federal definitions of “excellence” and “neutrality” or lose access to research grants, contracts, student loans, and tax exemptions.

The only unnecessary part is explicitly calling out conservative opinions, some of which will have no place in some university subjects, e.g. a geology student insisting the Earth is 6000 years old. We certainly don't issue degrees based only on what expertise they identify as. We don't allow them in office based on whether they identify as President or Principal. We should likewise not use their feelings or unsubstantiated beliefs to determine if they're a man or a woman when biology has the answer almost every time. It's obscenely disingenuous to now pretend that DEI was about class and economic status. Basically, this is the government having a direct hand in dictating what the schools that receive government funding can say and do, full stop.Further, this is a potential violation of the current administrations desire to eradicate DEI as this compact literally promotes DEI. This requires policies that all university employees, in their capacity as university representatives, will abstain from actions or speech relating to societal and political events except in cases in which external events have a direct impact upon the university.So, no one employed by the university can speak about societal or political events unless it has a direct impact on the university. Imagine not being able to talk about modern events in the classroom? Because it's whoever is in charge at the time, which means you need to be able to defend the merits of this when it doesn't necessarily fit your wants or needs.

The entire no kings protest is exactly about that - executive overreach overriding will of the people and causing irresponsible harm. Nobody elected the executive to boss over people. "No kings" are demanding that the means to setting rules be distributed among reps - when the rulemaking is distributed, you'll find that the rules demanded will change - because most people don't want these exact rules as they stand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar says people need to wake up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar said that the U.S. should end its dependence on China, and that the first thing it should do is to recognize its dependence is a problem. According to his opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. and China are already engaged in an economic war with each other, and other people should wake up to this reality. However, Sankar says that many business leaders still refuse to see this, and still wholeheartedly believe in the Chinese message of its "peaceful rise." The opinion piece points out that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently expressed his opinion that the label 'China hawk' is not a badge of honor Americans should wear, it is really 'a badge of shame.' Huang also said it "doesn't have to be all us or them. Or we can wake up to the reality that we're already in an economic war in which every purchase and investment will help determine which system survives." While Sankar does not directly call out Huang as a “useful idiot,” the implication is certainly there, given his reference to the Nvidia CEO's comments. Instead, Huang wants his chips to be readily available in China, so that American technology can become the backbone of global AI technology. We should note, though, that China used to be Nvidia's biggest export market, where it once had 95% market share — it has since dropped to zero because of export controls and the ongoing trade war between the two global rivals. Sankar's take on this is that China is just using foreign companies to support its goals until it can develop a credible home-grown challenger. He does not lay the blame on China alone, though. American companies have been an undeniable part of China's growth, with juggernauts like Apple, Tesla, Intel, General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Coca-Cola, among others, investing heavily in the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. What Happened: The ranking member of a key House subcommittee demanded answers this week from the Environmental Protection Agency about why it has yet to make public a report documenting the health risks posed by a forever chemical found in the water of millions of Americans. In a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday, Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, cited a ProPublica story from last week that quoted government scientists saying the report had been ready for publishing in April but had yet to be released. Pingree — the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies — asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for “clear answers” about why the report had not been made public, who directed its delay and when Zeldin would commit to releasing it. IRIS, which was created during Ronald Reagan's presidency, analyzes the health harm chemicals can cause. “The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program,” she wrote, asking whether scientists had been removed or reassigned from the program and, if so, why. Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA's decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote. “Our state is really hoping for help from the federal government. And when you see the federal government turn their back on you and decide to withhold the data … that's really discouraging,” she told ProPublica. Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people. The report in question found that the chemical interferes with human development by causing lower birth weights and, based on animal evidence, likely causes damage to the liver and to male reproductive systems, including reductions in testosterone levels, sperm production and the size of reproductive organs. Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment. ProPublica's reporting found that IRIS has been drastically reduced under the Trump administration. The program, which calculates values that can be used to set limits for pollutants in drinking water and cleanup levels for toxic sites, has been a frequent target of industry. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has set the direction for President Donald Trump's second administration, called for IRIS to be eliminated. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress introduced legislation called the “No IRIS Act.” Of 55 EPA scientists Publica identified as having worked on recent IRIS assessments, only eight remain in the office, according to a source familiar with the program. Why It Matters: The report calculated the amount of PFNA that people can be exposed to without being harmed — a critical measurement that can be used to set limits for cleaning up PFNA in contaminated areas called Superfund sites and for removing the chemical from drinking water. This calculation will prove critical to communities around the country as they battle polluters over who will pay to remove PFNA and other forever chemicals from the environment. Response: Last week, an EPA spokesperson told ProPublica that the report on PFNA would be published when it was finalized but did not answer questions about what still needed to be done or when that would likely happen. The agency's press office did not respond to questions about Pingree's letter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're sensitive to tech disasters, you might want to look away now: A recent Reddit thread tells the story of an unfortunate user who found 30 years of photos and work locked away and inaccessible in Microsoft OneDrive. It's still not clear why the account was locked or why Microsoft has so far ignored the user's appeals to restore access, but it's a warning to the rest of us—and a reminder to put a few basic protections and precautions in place. It used to be a truth universally acknowledged that data wasn't properly backed up until it was backed up twice, in two separate locations. You can copy your important files to an external hard drive, but if it's in the same room as your laptop, then theft, fire, or flood can wipe out both copies at the same time. Today, having two backups of everything—so three copies in total—might seem excessive, as cloud storage services so rarely go down. Apps will often push you to delete local copies of your files. What's more, apps will often push you to keep all your original files in the cloud, and then be selective about what gets saved locally—you might see Google Photos offer to clear up space on your phone in this way, for example. If everything's safely stored in the cloud, do you really need local copies too? Problems with cloud storage might be rare, but as our example above shows, cloud accounts can be locked, hacked, or hit by bugs, which means you need to store local copies of your files on as many devices as you can. There's always the chance as well that you'll inadvertently delete a swathe of cloud files without realizing it, which will again leave you relying on the files on your devices. Dropbox can store files exclusively in the cloud, until you need them. Even better, set up some kind of local storage backup to a hard drive or network drive in addition to whatever cloud storage protection you've put in place. Here's one example: In Dropbox, from the Preferences screen you can head to the Sync tab to manage how files are handled. The Online-only option will free up a lot of local hard drive space, but using the Available offline option means you can get at your files if you're locked out of your Dropbox account or you lose your internet connection. This is less directly related to the opening scenario mentioned above, because Microsoft has apparently locked the cloud account in question without any warning—there's not a whole lot you can do about that in advance, but you can take other steps to minimize the risk of losing access in other ways. Ideally, you want to be using a password manager to manage all of your digital accounts, and you should also turn on two-step authentication wherever it's offered (it's available with most apps and services now). You might need to rely on them if you can't get into your accounts and get at your files in the normal way. Google will tell you where your account is logged in.

Specifically, the onboard trio of Nuvo-5000LP series fan-less PCs, for example, are almost unrecognizable in a “Large Electronic and Metal Mass.” Above we can just about see some remnants of the red metal plating and cooling fins from the fanless Nuvo PC chassis. This used to be three Nuvo-5000LP series fan-less PCs that acted as the submersible's mission computer. While some fabric or carpet seems to be visible in this lump, we are assured that “no human remains were externally visible anywhere on the mass.” Due to the extremely compressed, tangled nature of these two large remnants, the investigators decided to use computed tomography (CT) scans as a first step. They reasoned that “If the compressed memory components could be imaged in the CT scan, then a pathway could be established that provided a route for using destructive tools that could reach and extract the memory components.” So, they looked for ‘survivable space' in the scans, where an SSD PCB could potentially survive intact. Unfortunately, the third-party lab's 320 kilovolts (kV) CT scanner couldn't penetrate deep enough to find any ‘survivable void' spaces, and no memory devices could be identified. The investigators ruled out using more powerful CT scanners as they thought the extra power could actually “damage data stored on any surviving NVM chips.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. It is explained that both PCBs saw deformations across three axes, and three BGA NVM chips were missing from each of the PCBs. Moreover, the remaining flash memory chips showed signs of cracks and distortion. Finally, no data was forthcoming from similar investigations into the smaller electronics mass.

The brand has become a go-to for smart lighting that actually creates atmosphere without looking tacky or overdone: Their table lamps deliver that same quality vibe in a smaller package, and right now, the Govee RGBIC Smart Table Lamp 2 has dropped to an all-time low of just $63 on Amazon, down from $79. One of the biggest improvements here is Matter compatibility which surprisingly makes a big impact if you've had issues with smart home systems in the past. Rather than being tied to one ecosystem, this lamp plays nice with Alexa, Google Home, and even Apple HomeKit via Matter. Plug it in and you're set on all your platforms. The RGBIC technology is where this lamp shines: Unlike lower-end RGB lamps that only display a single color at a time, the RGBIC system displays multiple colors simultaneously in various locations on the lamp. You get 500 lumens of light which is far brighter than previous Govee table lamps and plenty for reading or working. Govee had 64 preloaded scene modes including holiday settings like Valentine's Day and eight music sync modes that pulse in beat to your rhythm. It's with the DIY mode, though, that things get thrilling. Rather than feeling around for your phone or switch in the dark, you simply tap the lamp once to be able to see. You do need to set up the Bedtime Switch under the app first, and it only turns on the lamp (and not off), but it's such a convenience when you're waking up at 3 AM and you need some light but don't want to burn yourself. Timer and scheduling functionality provide functional applications in addition to the flashy light effects: Schedule the lamp to come on gradually in the morning as a wake-up light, or have it turn off automatically once you're asleep. All of these things make the lamp less of an appliance that you need to struggle with and more something that is integrated into your daily life. For $63, this lamp receives an awful lot of functionality in the deal. If you've ever wondered about smart lights but didn't feel like dropping money on pricey Philips Hue systems, this Govee lamp is the excellent gateway that doesn't sacrifice much in the feature arena.</p>

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. When I last reviewed a mechanical keyboard from Das Keyboard—the 5QS Mark II—I was not favorable. I felt the storied keyboard company was stuck in the past, focusing on features that didn't create any real improvements in usability and failing to innovate on its core typing experience, which was nearly identical to keyboards from almost two decades ago. Its latest release, the DeltaForce 65, seems to be a direct response to these kinds of criticisms—Das Keyboard has seemingly abandoned the gimmicks of its past designs, instead focusing on building a modern keyboard from the ground up. While this $200 keyboard stands out from its other offerings, it hardly manages to sit at the same level of its contemporaries. There aren't any cut corners in this keyboard's physical design and assembly, but strange software and layout choices make the entire user experience feel disjointed. The typing experience with this keyboard is … alright. These are a proven design that feels smooth and has been used for years without issue, but they won't blow you away, especially if you're somewhat familiar with modern mechanical switches. They feel a bit wobbly, and when combined with the flex-cut printed circuit board (PCB), they produce a fairly thin and plasticky sound when typing, which is only partially mitigated by the keyboard's sound-dampening foam. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The gasket mount system is simple, and there's nothing wrong with that. There is some flex, and it has a relaxed, comfortable typing feel, but it doesn't compete with the “bouncy” typing of a board like the Mchose GX87. It's fairly muted, without the distinct high-pitched “clacky” sound, or deep “thocky” sound, of a more acoustically-tuned keyboard. The DeltaForce sits in a middle ground that's neutral and tame, without much extraneous noise or depth. This is an easy fix to make (you don't even have to open up the keyboard), and the stabilizers themselves—plate-mounted, screw-in stabilizers—are a relatively premium option that should stay rattle-free after being properly lubricated and tuned. The case is made of a relatively lightweight aluminum. This doesn't have the same heft as some premium metal cases, but still feels more solid than most plastic cases. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. These seem to mimic the side sculpts of some limited-run custom keyboards, and they have a functional purpose, making it easier to lift the keyboard. I really like that these designs are not only ornamental but actually have a functional purpose during regular use. I'm not a big fan of the camouflage design. The shapes don't always line up across keycaps, and it overall seems tacky. However, the print quality is top-notch, with no fuzziness or discoloration, consistent even along the keycaps' sides. This combines with the relatively light Gateron Red switches to make a keyboard that's effective for gaming while still being comfortable to type on. It doesn't compare to high-end gaming keyboards with Hall effect switches and 8,000-Hz polling rates, which are going to be faster and more customizable, but for casual gaming, it's more than enough. The compact size of the keyboard is ideal for gaming, saving a significant amount of space compared to a full-size keyboard. This allows for more mouse space and lets your hands sit closer together for more rapid movement between the mouse and keyboard. The knob in the top right is easy to reach and has a satisfying notchiness to it. The DeltaForce65 uses an open source system known as QMK for its programmability, and VIA is an in-browser interface based on QMK that allows for seamless, rapid customization of the keyboard's layout. The system is incredibly powerful and intuitive to use, and a common capability of many modern mechanical keyboards. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, the DeltaForce65 is not officially supported by QMK/VIA, meaning users will have to download the .JSON firmware file from Das Keyboard and manually upload it into VIA to customize the keyboard's layout, as opposed to being completely plug-and-play like many Keychron keyboards. Instead of simply entering a URL and being able to customize your keyboard, you will also need to download the .JSON file and insert it into the website. Any of the keys can be remapped to produce any input, and the RGB lighting can be tweaked with countless presets built into VIA. There's a lot of potential for setting up macros, scripts, and other complex key combinations—when it works. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. From what I can tell, it seems the designers of this keyboard's layout wanted to make it so pressing Shift + Esc would type a tilde (~). However, they seemingly did this by conditionally mapping the shift key to both Shift and Function (FN), with the keyboard recognizing the key as Shift when typing a letter or number, and Function when pressing a modifier key. Along with making it easy to type a tilde, it makes the Backspace key mostly useless when holding down either Shift button: When using the keyboard in some browsers, like Firefox, it registers Shift + Backspace as the Delete key. I can't find a way to fix this issue: Any key mapped as Left or Right Shift in QMK will do this. Beyond this, some of the other key combinations listed by Das Keyboard don't work either. Win + Esc is supposed to type a backtick, with no success, and Fn + Backspace, which is supposed to register as a Delete key, doesn't work either. After asking Das Keyboard about this issue, I was told these were problems with the unit I received, so the company sent another keyboard. After some testing, these issues were still present in the second unit. The DeltaForce 65 represents a modernization of Das Keyboard's design philosophy. They prevent the keyboard from being used as intended, and significantly limit its functionality. It's a frustrating issue, and I can't foresee an easy solution when neither reflashing the keyboard's firmware nor editing the layout has any effect. More than anything else, it's disappointing to see a good keyboard ruined by a few decisions that didn't pan out. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17. This isn't a limited-time offer gimmick meant only to pull in a few customers before reverting back to stealth mode: T-Mobile's got the infrastructure and faith backing such aggressive promotions because they run the fastest network in America, according to Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence data. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device. T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.</p>

In theory, this is a novel practice — encrypting your storage without manual interception, but it can easily lead to unwanted problems. That's what happened to an unfortunate user on Reddit, who was locked out of their data that vanished into the binary mazes of encryption, seemingly forever. Feeling that their PC was lagging and not working to its fullest potential, u/Toast_Soup (let's call them Soup) decided to reset their PC and install a fresh copy of Windows. It's important to note at this point that Soup had six drives in its system; one of which is the boot drive, of course, and two massive data backups, each worth three terabytes, on the D: and E: disks. See, Soup wasn't aware of the automatic encryption Microsoft enforces these days, so the thought to check first never even crossed their mind. Windows kept asking for a key that Soup never noted down (or even knew existed, for that matter), and without it, the drives are encrypted forever. There's no way to retrieve any data through recovery software — which Soup tried many of — because they can't break the BitLocker encryption. Lost and feeling hopeless, Soup performed another fresh reinstall, but to no avail, as the BitLocker screen appeared again, requesting a new key for the boot drive. Thankfully, Soup was aware of the game by now and knew to jot down that one, so they got inside Windows, but the two earlier drives were still locked. While nothing quite beats getting permanently (we hope not) locked out of your own data, a couple of years ago, we found out that BitLocker is surprisingly resource-intensive as well. In our testing, it slowed down random read/write speeds of the affected SSDs by up to 45% because it forces your CPU to encrypt and decrypt every single thing. This can genuinely slow down performance and make your PC feel sluggish, which is likely what Soup was experiencing in the first place. It's important to note that the software version of BitLocker that runs on your CPU differs from the hardware version (called "OPAL"). Some comments from the Reddit thread suggest that even with a local account on Windows 11 Home, changes as small as tweaking the boot order can trigger BitLocker — if it isn't already enabled when you first set up your OS. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. BitLocker doesn't behave like this on Windows 10, or if you upgraded directly from that to 11. But, at this point, for Soup, there's nothing else that can be done beyond wiping those drives and starting over. We suggest staying vigilant in matters like these, where unwieldy corporations take away your autonomy to exercise what they feel is right.
