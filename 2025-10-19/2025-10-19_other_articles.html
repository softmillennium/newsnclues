                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prison Break may not have been the most realistic prison drama around, but it was always the most entertaining. The Fox series debuted in 2005 and followed Michael Scofield's (Wentworth Miller) attempts to break his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) out of prison, where he was slated to be executed for the wrongful conviction of killing the Vice President's brother. The series screamed government conspiracy and delivered on that front, but it also solved a decades-old mystery. Part of Michael's master plan was to get himself thrown in prison so he could find a way out with Lincoln in tow. He was able to do this because he was part of the architectural firm that designed the prison — not to mention a genius — but there were many other components to his plan. One of the biggest was his plan once they escaped, and how they would survive outside those walls. In addition to seducing the prison doctor, Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), Michael cultivates a theory that one of his fellow convicts was behind one of the most mysterious hijackings of all time. In 1971, an anonymous hijacker took over a plane flying from Portland to Seattle. He demanded $200,000 in cash with the intent of making it to Mexico. At Fox River Prison, Michael not only tries to free his brother but also solves a case that had stumped the FBI for decades. Based on its concept alone, Prison Break asked fans to suspend their disbelief. The main characters frequently encountered government assassins and mafia leaders. Cooper wasn't too much of a stretch and eventually became a big emotional crux at the end of Season 1. Michael could make all the plans he wanted, but his escape was contingent on Westmoreland's involvement. Cooper money still being buried out there somewhere, and he and his brother could use it to start over. Westmoreland had been convicted of an unrelated crime and was serving a life sentence. His only wish was that he could make peace with his estranged daughter, Anna, before he died. But circumstances being what they were in prison, the tides eventually turned. After learning that his daughter was dying of cancer, he agreed to escape with the rest of the convicts. In a tragic turn of events, Westmoreland finally confessed to his identity on the night of the escape when he was fatally stabbed. Cooper would never see his daughter again, no matter how much he tried to make amends. This was Michael and Lincoln's ticket to freedom, but it came at a great cost. He had been a mentor of sorts to Michael and ultimately deemed him worthy of the money and the answer to one of the greatest American mysteries. When Prison Break was good, it was legendary, and fans can watch these classic moments by streaming the 20th anniversary collection on Hulu.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A private contractor has allegedly taken responsibility for last year's drone and "UFO" sightings that caused a stir across New Jersey, according to an insider. During a top-tier army conference, an individual reportedly unveiled a piloted aerial vehicle that left attendees in awe due to its unique design and unconventional flight patterns over NJ. "You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us," a worker from the undisclosed contractor is said to have told a small group after the presentation, as per a source speaking to the New York Post. Last year saw hundreds of enigmatic "orbs" appearing in the skies over several weeks, predominantly over New Jersey but also in numerous other states. Despite authorities' attempts to reassure the public that these objects pose no national security threat, the inability to identify them has fuelled wild conspiracy theories. Some speculate they're searching for "nuclear warheads", while others suggest they might be the property of hostile foreign nations, reports the Express US. The sightings of drones have ignited online conspiracy theories linking them to 'Project Blue Beam. ' This wild theory suggests that NASA intends to establish a new world order via a fabricated religion led by the Anti-Christ. To make this plausible, proponents argue that a technological simulation of the 'Second Coming' would be staged. All conference attendees received approval from Fort Rucker leadership, which set strict participation guidelines, including prohibiting any drone or aircraft containing Chinese-manufactured components, the source revealed. "It would definitely have to be cleared," they clarified, adding, "Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that." The wave of alleged drone sightings in New Jersey began on November 13, 2024, above the army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued state wide into early December. President Trump's Federal Aviation Administration disclosed in January that many reports of mysterious drones were actually hobbyists, recreational pilots, and private citizens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's official—TRAPPIST-1e, 40 light-years from Earth, could have conditions for liquid water and extraterrestrial life Information continues to emerge about new discoveries from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. In two separate articles published Monday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, astronomers focused on the TRAPPIST-1 system, composed of seven rocky planets orbiting a single star. The object being studied is an Earth-sized planet 40 light-years away that could harbor oceans or icy surfaces. This means the possibility that liquid water could also exist is high. Recent studies presenting initial results from observations by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope suggest that the planet, known as TRAPPIST-1e, could have a nitrogen-rich atmosphere similar to Earth's. Keeping water in a liquid state, which is the minimum way to create life, requires the atmosphere, that layer that protects it from evaporation. Therefore, to continue their studies, astronomers used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to observe four “transits” of TRAPPIST-1e, or moments when the planet passed in front of its star. “In the next few years, we'll go from four JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1e to nearly 20. We finally have the telescope and tools to search for habitable conditions in other star systems, making today one of the most exciting times in astronomy,” MacDonald said. Finding an atmosphere isn't so simple for astronomers. Researchers must carefully account for starspots, as they are created by local magnetic fields on the surfaces of stars. In this way, the way colors are blocked, or how they filter out certain colors, can be signals of specific atoms or gas molecules. “If we see no variation in color, then the planet is probably just a bare rock,” MacDonald said. As for current discoveries and data, NASA has stated that Titan (one of the moons orbiting Saturn) likely harbors a vast subsurface ocean, which could make it habitable, but the moon's methane-rich environment would mean that any life existing there would be very different from that on Earth. This is an example of how far-reaching research can go. In other words, what we know about TRAPPIST-1e is still very limited; we'll have to wait to learn more about the details of this discovery.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A private company at a high-powered Army conference demonstrated a unique aircraft at the event — and allegedly took responsibility for setting off last year's drone and “UFO” pandemonium in New Jersey, a source told The Post. At the Army's UAS and Launched Effects Summit at Fort Rucker in August, a private contractor conducted a live demonstration of a manned aerial craft that wowed the crowd with its unconventional appearance and unorthodox flight-movements, an attendee told The Post. “You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? “When it turned you almost completely lose sight of it,” the source said, of the roughly 30-minute demonstration in the controlled airspace of Fort Rucker. “Which is why I think people were seeing this up in the sky and why there were reports of people seeing it and saying it disappeared.” All conference attendees were approved by brass at Fort Rucker, which enacted strict rules for participation, including the exclusion of any drone or craft containing any Chinese-made parts, the source revealed. “It would definitely have to be cleared,” they said, adding, “Somebody was 100% in charge of coordinating that.” Fort Rucker, which is the headquarters for the Army's Aviation Branch, could not be reached for comment. The rash of supposed drone sightings in New Jersey began on Nov. 13, 2024 over Army base Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County and continued across the state through early December.
