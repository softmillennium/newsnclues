                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are valuable points on offer this week at ATP 500 events in Vienna and Basel. The 2023 champion, who opens against Daniel Altmaier, owns a 12-4 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Turin Tussle: Alex de Minaur and Lorenzo Musetti will both look to strengthen their push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals. De Minaur is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, while Musetti — chasing his debut at the season finale — sits just 60 points behind in eighth. Medvedev's Momentum: Fresh off a title run in Almaty and consecutive semi-finals in Beijing and Shanghai, Daniil Medvedev continues his late-season surge. Andrey Rublev, 14th, and Karen Khachanov, 18th, also hunt crucial points in Vienna. Rising Star Budkov Kjaer: Former Wimbledon boys' champion Nicolai Budkov Kjaer has captured four ATP Challenger Tour titles this season and is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, aiming to debut at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 19-year-old faces Tomas Martin Etcheverry in his opener. Arevalo/Pavic Headline Doubles: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic are the top seeds in the double's draw. Fritz, Shelton Lead Charge: Americans Fritz and Shelton will aim to consolidate their push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals as the top two seeds in Vienna. They are fifth and sixth, respectively, in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Fritz faces a popcorn opening match against surprise Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot. With his title run in Stockholm, Casper Ruud maintained his position at 11th in the Live Race, but has also made ground on those in the qualification spots. Ruud finished runner-up at the season finale in 2022, and is aiming to qualify for the fourth time in his career. He faces lucky loser Quentin Halys in the first round. #NextGenATP Mensik & Fonseca: Jakub Mensik and Joao Fonseca, two of the brightest young prospects on the ATP Tour, both return to action after opening-round losses in Shanghai and Brussels, respectively. Fonseca faces defending champion Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in his Basel debut. Cousins Vacherot, Rinderknech Return: After their fairytale run in Shanghai, where World No. Vacherot has since rocketed inside the Top 40. Bolelli & Vavassori's Turin Quest: Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori are the second seeds in the double's draw. They will face competition from top seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leylah Fernandez earned her fifth WTA title on Sunday in Osaka, defeating 18-year-old Tereza Valentova 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. Meanwhile, Taylor Townsend and Kristina Mladenovic collected the double trophy on Saturday, defeating Stom Hunter and Desirae Krawczyk for their first title together. Leylah Fernandez won the first eight points and the first seven games of the match en route to capturing her first Kinoshita Group Japan Open title Sunday in Osaka. 4 seed defeated 18-year-old qualifier Tereza Valentova, who was making her WTA final debut, 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes. The victory marked Fernandez's fifth career title and second of 2025. Her run in Osaka, which included five consecutive wins, was just the second time since her Washington, D.C., triumph in July that she won back-to-back matches. With the win, Fernandez climbs five spots to No. “First of all, congratulations Tereza,” Fernandez said during the trophy presentation. I also want to thank my family and loved ones back home. Without everyone's sacrifices and support, I wouldn't be on this stage, so thank you so much for all the love and motivation you've given me.” To her credit, she regrouped and played more freely in the second set, breaking Fernandez three times and finally consolidating in the final game to force a decider. Leading 2-1, she pounced on Valentova's second serve on break point, unleashing a crosscourt backhand followed by a down-the-line backhand winner to break for 3-1. 🏆 Fifth career title🇨🇦 First Canadian to win Osaka@leylahfernandez 👏#JapanOpen pic.twitter.com/QfEyHyeC8x She celebrated with a bow to the crowd. “I also want to thank the fans,” Fernandez said. Without you, we wouldn't be here, so thank you so much for supporting us, motivating us and bringing the good energy.” All five of Fernandez's career titles have come on hard courts. After a rough opening set, she clawed her way back into the match and made a strong impression in her first WTA final. Respect 🤝@leylahfernandez is full of praise for teenage runner-up Tereza Valentova in her champions' speech 👏#JapanOpen pic.twitter.com/NmqWr1CMhz Coming through qualifying, she earned six wins on the week, including three over top 50 opponents. She also had a dominant first-round win over Alexandra Eala, dropping just three games. She also came from a set down in her second-round qualifying win over Greet Minnen and in her quarterfinal and semifinal victories over Olga Danilovic and Jaqueline Cristian, nearly repeating the feat in the final against Fernandez. When the newest rankings drop Monday, Valentova will reach a career-best No. 58, up 20 spots from where she began the week. 2 seeds Taylor Townsend and Kristina Mladenovic defeated Storm Hunter and Desirae Krawczyk 6-4, 2-6, [10-5] to claim their first title together in Osaka. For Townsend, a two-time Grand Slam champion and current world No. 2, it marks her 11th career WTA doubles title and fourth of the season. Leylah Fernandez earned her fifth WTA title on Sunday in Osaka, defeating 18-year-old Tereza Valentova 6-0, 5-7, 6-3 in 2 hours and 11 minutes.
