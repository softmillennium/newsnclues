            The reactions to the Trump administration's decision to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine couldn't be more illustrative of the conflict: welcomed by the Kremlin, branded “inhumane” by Kyiv.
    


            The Pentagon said on Wednesday that it was pausing some aid because it needs to review whether the assistance that is provided to Ukraine is aligned with US President Donald Trump's “America First” agenda.
    


            But the move could have deadly consequences for Ukraine as the halt on shipments includes missiles for Patriots, the US-made air defense systems that are currently protecting millions of Ukrainian civilians from Russia's increasingly massive daily aerial attacks.

Russia launches record attack at Ukraine after latest Trump-Putin phone call



            Kyiv endured the biggest ever attack overnight into Friday, with 13 dreadful hours of explosions and buzzing overhead as Russia launched a record 539 drones towards the Ukrainian capital and 11 cruise and ballistic missiles, according to the country's air force.
    


            As the smoke began to clear over the city, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the military for shooting down or jamming the majority of the Russian drones and missiles.
    


            “It is critically important that our partners continue to support us in defending against ballistic missiles. Patriots and the missiles for them are true protectors of life,” he said – a remark clearly aimed at trying to persuade Trump to reconsider the pause.
    


            Zelensky got a chance to make the case directly to Trump when the two spoke by phone on Friday. A readout of the call from Zelensky's office said the two leaders “agreed that we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies.”
    


            “We are ready for direct projects with the United States and believe this is critically important for security, especially when it comes to drones and related technologies,” the readout said.
    


            No other air defense system can match the Patriots in its effectiveness – but their power comes at a huge cost, their production is limited and the demand for them is growing rapidly around the world, especially in areas deemed by the Trump administration to be more strategically important – such as the Middle East or, southwest Asia and South Korea.
    


            The announcement by the US sent shockwaves through Ukraine, with presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak saying it would be “very strange” and “inhumane” to stop supplying missiles that are used to protect civilians.
    


            But despite the panicked reaction, the move was not entirely unexpected. Trump has threatened to withdraw Ukraine's support in a bid to force Kyiv to the negotiating table, and he has previously briefly paused shipments of aid.
    


            While the US was for a long time Ukraine's biggest supporter, singlehandedly covering about 40% of Ukraine's military needs, it has not announced any new aid to Ukraine since early January, when Trump returned to power.

            Meanwhile, European countries have stepped up their support of Ukraine.
    


            According to the German Kiel Institute, which monitors aid to Ukraine, Europe has now surpassed the US as the biggest donor – having supported Ukraine to the tune of 72 billion euro ($85 billion) in total military aid since the start of the full-scale invasion to the end of April, compared to 65 billion euro ($76.6 billion) from the US.
    


            But the numbers don't tell the whole story.
    


            “Ukraine has a lot of different needs, and some of them can be filled by other suppliers, but some can only be filled by the United States,” Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told CNN.
    


            “For ballistic missiles in particular, only the US can provide this. A cut off in those leaves a huge gap in Ukraine and air defenses. And given the kind of daily and horrible Russian attacks, that's very consequential.”
    


            Russia has ramped up its airborne attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks.
    


            Ballistic missiles pose the deadliest threat and, according to Ukrainian officials, Russia fired as many as 80 of these in June alone.
    


            While Ukraine managed to shoot some of them down, likely with the Patriot system, the ones that slipped through caused unimaginable suffering. One ballistic missile strike killed 21 people in Dnipro last week. The week before that, 21 people were killed when a ballistic missile hit an apartment building in Kyiv.
    


            Deadly attacks like this will become more frequent if Ukraine loses access to the Patriots, which are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems available.
    


            They are capable of bringing down cruise and hypersonic missiles, short-range ballistic missiles and aircraft. According to analysts, the Ukrainian military has been using them in an extremely effective way, shooting down missiles that Moscow claimed were impossible to intercept, such as the Kinzhal ballistic missiles.

            At an estimated cost of about $1.1 billion for each system, the Patriots are by far the most expensive piece of equipment sent by allies to Ukraine. According to the CSIS, missile rounds for the Patriot come in at roughly $4 million each – an incredibly high price tag.
    


            But even if Ukraine had the cash to purchase these systems, which it doesn't, it would find it difficult to source them.
    


            “The production pace of Patriot missiles is low. Not because the US doesn't want to produce more, but because it's very sophisticated – you can't produce thousands a year, you can produce hundreds and you have allies all over the world who need them,” Pavel Luzin, a senior fellow at the Centre for European Policy Analysis, said Thursday during a discussion at the NEST Center, a think tank.
    


            Lockheed Martin, which manufactures the Patriot missiles for the US Army, has been ramping up production to record levels – but even so, it is only able to make just over 500 per year, with a plan to increase production to 650 a year by 2027.
    


            A major $5.5 billion deal between US and German companies to begin manufacturing the Patriot missiles outside of the US for the first time was approved last year following a NATO order of up to 1,000 rounds – but the first deliveries are not expected until several years from now.
    


            Germany, which has donated several of its Patriot systems to Ukraine in the past, is looking into the option of purchasing some missiles for Ukraine from the US, the spokesperson for the German government said in a news conference on Friday.
    


            Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a UK-based defense think tank, said that while global stockpiles of Patriot missiles are not “critically low,” there are some grounds for concern about shortages.
    


            “The requirement for Patriots, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, is growing significantly,” he said.
    


            He said that given that some of the missiles initially meant for Ukraine were diverted to other allies, including Israel, it was likely that the US wanted to – or even had contractual obligations to – deliver interceptors to countries who are, in some cases, located within range of Iranian missiles.
    


            Still, Kaushal said the US itself is highly unlikely to face any kind of urgent shortage of missiles.
    


            “While the US has sent a considerable number of Patriot interceptors to Ukraine it has replenished stocks through buy-back schemes from Japan and more recent shipments were diverted from export customers rather than the US' own inventory,” he said in a note emailed to CNN.
    


            Zelensky said previously that Ukraine would need some 25 Patriot batteries to defend its airspace effectively. It has roughly half a dozen at the moment, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.
    


            What is known, though, is that the Ukrainians are very worried about running out of the munitions – especially because the latest US pause doesn't concern future aid but impacts deliveries that have been approved and funded and were on their way to Ukraine, where the military was counting on receiving them in the very near future.

            “One thing is not having future sales approved; another is stopping what is already in the pipeline. And so that's a very negative shift that is harmful for the future defense of Ukraine and the effect is going to be pretty quick. The Russian attacks are happening daily, and Ukraine relies on these systems to counter them,” Byman said.
    


            The pause in shipments is likely to give yet another boost to Russia.
    


            “It's part of (the Russians') strategy. They believe that without the US support, Ukraine is more likely to collapse or at least make concessions… so it certainly increases the incentives for Russia to keep military pressure on Ukraine,” Byman said.
    


            The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said that previous delays in deliveries of aid to Ukraine have invariably accelerated Russian gains on the battlefield.
    


            When the US dragged its feet on military aid in late 2023 and early 2024, Russia pushed forward in Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine.  When the US paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine in March, Russian forces advanced in Kursk.
    


            “The suspension of US aid to Ukraine will reinforce Russian President Vladimir Putin's theory of victory that posits that Russia can win the war of attrition by making slow, creeping advances and outlasting Western support for Ukraine,” the ISW said.
    


            The pause in shipments will likely reinforce Putin's belief that time is on Russia's side – and that if he can delay negotiations for long enough, his troops will eventually outlast Western assistance to Ukraine.
    


            For Ukrainians, who have sacrificed so much trying to defend their country against a bigger, stronger aggressor, the absence of US military aid is not just yet another setback – it's potentially a disaster.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  For our latest coverage of the flooding in Texas, follow our live updates here.



            Water rescues and evacuations are underway in central Texas Friday morning after months' worth of torrential rain fell in the span of just hours, sending river levels surging and triggering deadly flash flooding.
    


            “Conditions are life-threatening! DO NOT go out onto the roads,” the National Weather Service in San Angelo urged Friday morning. “Expect roads washed out and rapid rises on rivers and creeks.”
    


            Flooding turned deadly Friday morning in Kerr County — about 75 miles west of Austin.
    


            “This is a catastrophic flooding event in Kerr County,” the sheriff's office said on social media. “We can confirm fatalities, but will not release further information until next of kin are notified… The entire county is an extremely active scene. Residents are encouraged to shelter in place and not attempt travel.”
    


            In Kerrville – the seat of Kerr County – Mayor Joe Herring Jr. issued a disaster declaration for the city Friday morning due to the dangerous flooding.
    


            Widespread rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches — with some reports of over 10 inches — have fallen from San Angelo to Kerrville since late Thursday evening, prompting multiple flash flood emergencies as the Fourth of July holiday weekend began.
    


Flash flood emergencies are the most severe form of flood warning, and the NWS has issued at least five of them since 4 a.m. CT in parts of Tom Green, Kerr and Kendall counties. San Angelo, home to nearly 100,000 people, is in Tom Green County.
    


            It's yet another example of overwhelming rainfall becoming more frequent in a warming world, as rising global temperatures push weather toward the extremes. Texas has already seen multiple dangerous flooding events this year, and the United States overall saw a record number of flash flood emergencies last year. 



            Police and fire crews in Kerrville are assisting in ongoing high-water rescues, a city official told CNN Friday morning.
    


            Two parks in Kerrville are closed due to flooding, the city confirmed on social media. Evacuations were underway after floodwater reached cabins visitors rent in Kerrville-Schreiner Park around sunrise Friday.
    


            In San Angelo, the police department issued an alert Friday morning warning people to “stay in your residence and avoid traveling” and to “shelter in place in the downtown area.”
    


            More than an entire summer's worth of rain fell in some spots in just a few hours, quickly overwhelmed dry soils and created significant flash flooding. Central Texas is currently home to some of the worst drought in the United States and bone-dry soils flood very quickly.
    


            Water level measurements along parts of the Guadalupe River near the Kerr County community of Hunt “indicate a large and deadly flood wave is moving down the Guadalupe River,” the NWS warned. The river rose 22 feet in just three hours and was at its second-highest level on record early Friday morning. A few hours later, the river gauge that measured that rise was damaged and out of operation as a result of the flooding, according to the National Weather Service in Austin.
    


            San Angelo typically records about an inch of rain during July, but reports around the city from overnight rain range from around 2 inches to upwards of 10.
    


            Hunt, near Kerrville, received about 6.5 inches of rain in just three hours early Friday morning, which is considered a 1-in-100-year rainfall event for the area — meaning it has about a 1% chance of happening in any given year.
    


            Hourly rainfall rates have intensified in nearly 90% of large US cities since 1970, a recent study found. It's just one of the myriad of dangerous weather events happening more frequently in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.
    


            Heavy rain will continue to fall Friday morning as slow-moving storms stall over the same hard-hit areas. Storms could linger into the afternoon in some places before finally easing up. Any additional rain will likely further worsen ongoing flooding issues and could prompt new areas of dangerous flooding.

Large parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital Prague, were hit by a significant power outage on Friday. Officials attributed the incident to a technical failure rather than a cyberattack.

The blackout began around noon local time, causing the entire Prague metro system to shut down temporarily. The city's transport authority reported that services on the A and C lines had resumed within 15 minutes, while the B line was operational again after around 30 minutes.

Tram services on the right bank of the Vltava River were also halted, while those on the left bank continued to operate. Additionally, some train services near Prague and in other regions experienced disruptions.

Prime Minister Petr Fiala acknowledged the outage in a post on social media platform X, stating it had affected other parts of the country and that authorities were addressing the issue. The national power grid operator, CEPS, reported problems in the northern and eastern regions of the Czech Republic.

Interior Minister Vit Rakusan reportedly confirmed that there were no indications of a cyber or terrorist attack, suggesting a technical fault as the likely cause.

CEPS reported that eight substations were affected by the outage, with five having resumed operations by the time of its statement. The company is continuing to investigate the cause of the blackout.

The outage also led to reports of individuals trapped in elevators in parts of Prague and central Bohemia. Emergency services responded to multiple calls for assistance.

Vaclav Havel Airport Prague, the city's international airport, was not affected by the outage.

The Czech blackout follows a larger power failure that plunged Spain and Portugal into darkness for several hours earlier this year. That outage was blamed on a “voltage surge,” although initial concerns pointed to a possible cyberattack.

Friday's disruption also came on the heels of a European heat wave, which had increased demand for cooling systems. However, temperatures in Prague had eased to around 25C (77F) on Friday, down from 34C the day before.

The BBC has announced that it will no longer broadcast or livestream performances deemed ‘high risk'. The British public broadcaster faced backlash after airing a set by punk-rap duo Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury Festival, during which the group chanted against the Israeli military.

The group's lead vocalist encouraged the crowd to chant “Death, death to the IDF” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine must be, will be, inshallah, it will be free” during the performance last weekend. Videos circulating on social media show the crowd echoing the chants, with some waving Palestinian flags.

“We deeply regret that such offensive and deplorable behaviour appeared on the BBC and want to apologise to our viewers, listeners, and in particular the Jewish community,” the broadcaster said in a statement released on Thursday.

The BBC noted that the band was classified as ‘high risk' ahead of the festival, along with six other acts, but was still permitted to perform with “appropriate mitigations.” The company admitted to “errors” in the compliance processes and confirmed that Bob Vylan's set has been permanently removed from BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds.

The outlet pledged to provide on-site editorial policy support at major music festivals and events moving forward. It also announced plans to issue clearer guidance on the criteria for withdrawing a livestream.

Avon and Somerset Police have launched a criminal investigation into potential public order offenses, saying they “will closely consider all appropriate legislation, including relating to hate crimes.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the BBC for airing the performance; media regulator Ofcom said the broadcaster has questions to answer.

The Israeli Embassy in London said it was “deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric expressed on stage,” describing it as “advocacy of ethnic cleansing.”

Earlier this week, the US authorities revoked the visas of Bob Vylan members following the controversial performance, citing national security concerns. The duo, who were scheduled to begin a 20-date US tour later this year, have since been dropped by their agency, United Talent.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrations and a rise in anti-Semitic incidents have been reported in many countries since the start of Israel's military operation in Gaza, where more than 56,000 Palestinians have been killed since 2023. The conflict was triggered by the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks, which left around 1,200 Israelis dead, with over 200 taken hostage.

Germany wants to agree a “secret deal” with the US to buy two Patriot air defense systems in order to hand them over to Ukraine, Bild has reported, citing government sources.

Several US media outlets claimed earlier this week that Washington had paused deliveries of various critical munitions to Kiev, including Patriot and Hellfire missiles, GMLRS rockets, and thousands of 155mm artillery shells. The White House later confirmed that supplies of some weapons have been halted, saying the “decision was made to put America's interests first.”

The freeze in deliveries is “causing alarm” in Berlin, Bild reported on Thursday.

According to the newspaper, the government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz fears that the policy shift could also result in Washington rejecting a request to sell Germany two Patriot systems and interceptors.

According to Bild's sources, Berlin quietly approached US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on the matter two weeks ago after being asked to do so by Ukraine, which previously failed to acquire the systems on its own. The German authorities are now waiting for a response from Hegseth, they added.

Bild described the lack of air defenses as an “urgent problem” for Ukraine, and that it currently has only four Patriot systems left in service and insufficient missiles for them. If Kiev runs out of interceptors, Russian airstrikes are likely to become even more “dangerous,” it added.

On Friday, German government spokesman Stefan Kornelius acknowledged that “intensive discussions” are taking place between Berlin and Washington regarding the possibility of providing air defense systems and munitions for them to Ukraine. However, he noted that there are “different ways” to address Kiev's needs in the area.

Politico reported on Wednesday that the Kiev authorities were “blindsided” by the halt in American military aid supplies, and have asked Washington “to let Europe purchase US weapons for Ukraine.” Several European countries are reviewing potential purchases on behalf of Ukraine, according to the outlet.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested that the US paused deliveries of key munitions to Ukraine because they “simply cannot produce missiles in the necessary quantities,” noting that many supplies were likely redirected to Israel amid its conflict with Iran last month.

“The fewer the missiles that arrive in Ukraine from abroad, the closer the end of the [Russian] special military operation [will be],” Peskov stated.

BEIJING, July 4. /TASS/. The Chinese government welcomes Russia's official recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday.

""First of all, China welcomes the latest stage of development in relations between Russia and Afghanistan,"" she said at a news briefing in response to a question from a Western journalist on Beijing's reaction to Moscow's official recognition of the Afghan Taliban government.

Mao recalled that China maintains good-neighborly relations with the Afghan side. She noted that the Chinese government ""has always believed that Afghanistan should not be isolated from the international community.""

""China speaks for boosting contacts between the international community and the interim Afghan Government,"" the diplomat continued.

Mao Ning also called on Afghanistan to ""actively respond to the concerns of the international community,"" pointing out the importance of providing joint support to Afghanistan in the country's reconstruction and development.

She confirmed that Beijing backs Afghanistan's fight against terrorism and its contribution to maintaining peace, stability and prosperity in the region.

""No matter what changes have taken place inside Afghanistan or beyond its borders, relations between China and Afghanistan have held,"" Mao stated. ""After the formation of the interim Government of Afghanistan, the foreign policy missions of both countries located on each other's territory continued to operate normally and that played a positive role in the development of bilateral interstate relations.""

""China will continue to pursue a friendly policy towards the entire Afghan people, support exchanges and cooperation with Afghanistan in all spheres and maintain development in new areas,"" she added.

On July 3, the Russian Foreign Ministry reported that Moscow had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Later that day, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko accepted credentials from Gul Hassan, Afghanistan's new ambassador to Russia. The ambassador arrived in Moscow on July 1.

On April 17, the Russian Supreme Court granted a plea from the prosecutor general to suspend the ban on the Taliban's activities in the country. The Russian Foreign Ministry announced the removal of the Taliban's status as a terrorist group, paving the way for building a comprehensive partnership with Kabul in the interests of the Russian and Afghan peoples.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned bill's expansion of immigration enforcement and cuts to social benefits

Democrats have erupted in a storm of outrage over the passage of Donald Trump's budget bill, delivering scathing critiques that offered signs of the attack lines the party could wield against Republicans in next year's midterm elections.

Party leaders released a wave of statements after the sweeping tax and spending bill's passage on Thursday, revealing a fury that could peel paint off a brick outhouse.

“Today, Donald Trump and the Republican party sent a message to America: if you are not a billionaire, we don't give a damn about you,” said Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee chair.

“While the GOP continues to cash their billionaire donors' checks, their constituents will starve, lose critical medical care, lose their jobs – and yes, some will die as a result of this bill. Democrats are mobilizing and will fight back to make sure everybody knows exactly who is responsible for one of the worst bills in our nation's history.”

The bill's narrow passage in the House on Thursday, with no Democratic support and only two no votes from Republicans – which came from Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania – is “not normal”, wrote congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the contradictions in the bill that Democrats can be expected to campaign on over the next two years, pitting its spending on immigration enforcement against the loss of social benefits for working-class Americans. She noted that Republicans voted for permanent tax breaks for billionaires while allowing a tax break on tips for people earning less than $25,000 a year to sunset in three years.

She also noted that cuts to Medicaid expansion will remove tipped employees from eligibility for the health insurance program and remove subsidies for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The bill will also reduce Snap food assistance benefits.

“I don't think anyone is prepared for what they just did with Ice,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Bluesky. “This is not a simple budget increase. It is an explosion – making Ice bigger than the FBI, US Bureau of Prisons, [the] DEA and others combined. It is setting up to make what's happening now look like child's play. And people are disappearing.”

Many critics referred to choice remarks made by Republicans in the run-up to the bill's passage that displayed an indifference to their voters' concerns.

Senator Mitch McConnell was reported by Punchbowl News to have said to other Republicans in a closed-door meeting last week: “I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid. But they'll get over it.”

And Republican senator Joni Ernst, of Iowa, speaking at a combative town hall in Parkersburg in late May, responded to someone in the audience shouting that people will die without coverage by saying, “People are not … well, we all are going to die” – a response that drew groans.

Cuts to Medicaid feature prominently in Democratic reaction to the bill.

Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib described the bill as “disgusting” and “an act of violence against our communities”.

She said: “Republicans should be ashamed for saying ‘just get over it' because ‘we're all going to die.' They are responsible for the 50,000 people who will die unnecessarily every year because of this deadly budget.”

“There is no sugarcoating this. This is a dark day for our country,” wrote Senator Raphael Warnock.

“Republicans in Washington have decided to sell out working people. As a result, millions will lose their healthcare and many millions more will see their premiums go up. Rural hospitals and nursing homes across Georgia will be forced to close. Children will be forced to go hungry so that we can give billionaires another tax cut.”

But budget hawks on the left and the right have taken issue with the effects this budget will have on the already considerable national debt.

“In a massive fiscal capitulation, Congress has passed the single most expensive, dishonest and reckless budget reconciliation bill ever – and it comes amidst an already alarming fiscal situation,” wrote Maya MacGuineas, the president of the oversight organization Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in reaction to the House's passage of the bill.

“Never before has a piece of legislation been jammed through with such disregard for our fiscal outlook, the budget process, and the impact it will have on the wellbeing of the country and future generations.”

“House Republicans just voted – again – to jack up costs, gut health care and reward the elite with tax breaks,” wrote the House Majority Pac, a Democratic fund.

“They had a chance to change course, but instead they doubled down on this deeply unpopular, toxic agenda. They'll have no one to blame but themselves when voters send them packing and deliver Democrats the House majority in 2026.”

“Republicans didn't pass this bill for the people,” wrote Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat. “They passed it to please Trump, protect the powerful and push cruelty disguised as policy.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A weakened Hamas plus Israel's war with Iran have given Netanyahu a boost, raising hopes of a pause in fighting

After nearly 21 months of bloody war, it now appears a question of when rather than if a new ceasefire brings a pause to the fighting that has devastated Gaza, destabilised the region and horrified onlookers across the world.

On Friday, Donald Trump said he expected Hamas to agree within 24 hours to a deal that Israel has already accepted. Analysts predict a formal announcement after Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, arrives in Washington on Monday on his third visit to the White House since Trump began his current term.

If a new ceasefire does come into effect, it will be the third during the war, in which about 57,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died.

The first lasted just 10 days in November 2023. The second was forced on a reluctant Netanyahu by Trump in February this year and ended in March when Israel reneged on a promise to move to a second scheduled phase that could have led to a definitive end to hostilities.

The terms of the new deal include the staggered release of hostages held by Hamas; freedom for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli jails; desperately needed aid for Gaza; and the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from some parts of the strip seized in recent months.

Once again, the ceasefire will last for 60 days, during which time talks about what happens next will be held. Trump and regional powers are offering guarantees to reassure Hamas that Israel will not simply return to an all-out offensive and that meaningful discussions about a permanent end to the war will actually take place.

One factor that has brought a new ceasefire closer is the brief conflict last month between Israel and Iran, which ended in a US-brokered ceasefire. That capped a series of military and political developments that had seriously weakened Tehran and the various militant groups it had supported around the region, which include Hamas.

More important is the boost that gave Netanyahu. Though polls record only a slight increase in support for his Likud party and in his personal popularity, many Israelis nonetheless rejoiced in what was seen as a crushing victory over a much-feared foe.

If Netanyahu brings the war in Gaza to what voters see as a successful, or at least acceptable, close, Netanyahu can stand in elections – probably next year – claiming to be the man who made Israel safer than it has ever been, even if few have forgotten the security and strategic failures that led to the Hamas attack of October 2023 in which militants took 251 hostages and killed 1,200, mostly civilians.

By the end of this month, Israel's parliament will have risen for a three-month recess and courts will also not sit, giving Netanyahu respite from the threat of a no-confidence vote or dissolution motion as well as from continuing cross-examination in his trial for corruption. This undermines the threats to collapse the government made throughout the conflict in Gaza by far-right coalition allies bitterly opposed to a deal with Hamas.

Successive opinion surveys show that an agreement that brings back hostages would be very popular with Israelis, so this, too, would help Netanyahu in elections. Israeli casualties in Gaza – 20 soldiers died in June – are also causing concern. A poll published by Maariv, an Israeli newspaper, on Friday showed a further boost for the prime minister as hopes of a ceasefire rose.

As for Hamas, analysts and sources close to its leaders say the militant Islamist organisation is divided, much weakened by the Israeli onslaught in Gaza and aware that it has few allies who can or will offer any practical support. The main aim of its leaders now is to retain some presence in Gaza, even a residual one. This alone would constitute some form of victory, and partly explains the determination with which Hamas seek a permanent end to the fighting.

Whether it will get one is still not clear. Israeli media have been briefed by “sources close to Netanyahu” that if Hamas cannot be disarmed in Gaza and its leaders exiled from the devastated territory through negotiations then Israel will resume military operations, and that Washington would support its decision to return to war. Many “close to Netanyahu” also continue to support mass “voluntary” emigration from Gaza, or the relocation of much of its population to an area in the south, or both.

Recent days have been noisy with voices: American, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, Qatari and many others. Barely heard have been the voices of the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel's offensive continues. On Friday, local officials and medics said Israeli airstrikes killed 15 Palestinians in the territory and another 20 people died in shootings while waiting at food points.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

France's selection of eight uncapped players among a team of unknowns for the first Test against New Zealand today highlights again a failure in rugby union to develop an integrated international calendar.

France coach Fabien Galthie has taken an understrength squad to New Zealand for the three-Test series, leaving at home many of his leading players who have been involved in the latter rounds of the Top 14 club competition.

While New Zealand Rugby and All Blacks head coach Scott Robertson have been diplomatic about the makeup of the France squad, the decision to send a weakened group to New Zealand has been more widely interpreted as arrogant and disrespectful.

Despite years of work toward an integrated global calendar, World Rugby has continued to prioritize northern hemisphere club competitions ahead of the July Test window.

Galthie has insisted he has no other choice than to pick players who are rested. Yet when southern hemisphere teams tour Britain and Europe in November, they routinely take full-strength teams and players who have been in training for up to 10 months.

“We don't have a choice other than picking players who have finished their seasons,” Galthie said. “It's an opportunity for us to work with the best players available. The constraints of the Six Nations, the November Tests, the Top 14 and the European Cup leave us with no other choice for the summer tour.”

Galthie said criticism of the decision to bring a team of obscure club players to New Zealand is misplaced.

“You have to be informative and try to explain the obligations which are linked to our season schedule,” he said. “I understand very well that, on the international circuit, people don't understand why the team that went undefeated in November and won the [Six Nations] tournament isn't there.”

The French club season has long been a bugbear that World Rugby has not addressed. The All Blacks will gain little or nothing from playing a team of players so little known that routine analysis of their play has been difficult.

This season is expected to be a major challenge for Robertson, who lost four Tests in his first season in charge and is under pressure to produce better results. It is unlikely the coming series will reveal much about how the All Blacks coach has grown since last year, unless France prove surprisingly competitive.

Robertson has said that he lacked self-confidence in his first year in charge, resulting in a conservative approach to selection and tactics. His choice of four new caps for today's game and his pledge to play a more attacking game points to a more confident approach.

“We want to play fast,” Robertson said. “We think the game is in a great place for us — quick scrums, quick lineouts, quick taps. Our skill set trends to us playing fast and creating so that's what we'll push all week.”

Robertson said France would be “quite free ... there is not too much weight on their shoulders and respect so they can be dangerous.”

Playing at home, the Kings pulled ahead with Jeremy Lin's (林書豪) clutch three-pointers, securing their victory over the Aquas in the TPBL final.
The Kings came out strong in the first quarter, dominating to build a 35-18 lead. By halftime, they had stretched their advantage to 61-38.
In the third quarter, the Aquas narrowed the deficit to 12 points, but Lin stepped up, sinking several tough three- pointers to extend the lead.

Chou entered the Super 300 tournament as the top seed and breezed past Victor Lai of Canada 21-19, 21-8 in 37 minutes, advancing to the semi-finals for the second straight tournament.

Having claimed the last two Ballon d'Or awards, Barcelona midfielder Bonmati is the game's biggest star at present, so her absence in the final days before the start of Euro 2025 is a major setback. 
The 27-year-old came down with a fever in training last week, and was subsequently hospitalized and diagnosed with viral meningitis.

Following US President Donald Trump's airstrikes on Iran's three major nuclear facilities — Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan — on June 22, analysts have been questioning what the decision, seemingly signaling a more active US military role in shaping the Middle East security landscape, means for the global strategy of the US.

The Trump administration had declared that the Indo-Pacific region and Taiwan would be its “priority theater.”

However, the strikes should not be seen in isolation. As Johns Hopkins University Henry A. Kissinger distinguished professor of global affairs Hal Brands wrote for Bloomberg, Israel's war against Iran was about three overlapping conflicts: a war for the future of the Middle East, a war for nuclear non-proliferation and a war that squeezes the axis of aggressors — China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and its proxies — by pressuring its weakest link.

Trump's bombing of Iran — something Israeli leaders had long requested from former US presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump in his first term and Joe Biden, but were denied — has not only shown that Trump is willing to act decisively in theaters he believes to be of primary interest to his administration, but also demonstrated the centrality of unpredictability to his foreign policy strategy. By giving Iran a two-week deadline to negotiate, only to order strikes just days later, the administration showed that it views ambiguity and unpredictability as a key tool to enhance US leverage over allies and adversaries.

This approach has deeply unnerved China.

Trump's departure from the predictable patterns of previous US presidents, under whom Beijing believed it could secure incremental gains with minimal consequences, might force Beijing to reassess its assumptions. In the Indo-Pacific region, Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) cannot be sure of Trump's threshold for escalation, or confident in how the US might respond if China raises tensions around Taiwan.

“The Trump administration sees the previous US strategy — which aimed to build and maintain a global order led by the United States — as a misguided effort that has sapped US power,” academics Jennifer Lind and Daryl Press wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine. “Instead of trying to create global order, the Trump administration now appears to be pursuing a more focused strategy: prioritization.”

Trump's decisiveness in the Middle East, coupled with his willingness to scale back US commitments in regions deemed secondary — such as Europe — while urging allies to take greater responsibility for their own defense in their region, reflects a strategy of prioritization. If implemented with strategic discipline and translated into sustained, tangible policy, this approach would improve global security and bolster the collective defense of democratic nations, benefiting Taiwan and its partners by keeping authoritarian expansionism in check.

However, even with the US' strategy of prioritization, Taiwan must not rest on its laurels, and should demonstrate that it takes its defense seriously and fully grasps the severity of the threat posed by China.

Taiwan this year plans to raise defense spending to about 3 percent of GDP through a special budget, up from the initially earmarked 2.45 percent. While this would mark the highest defense allocation in Taiwan's history, with NATO nations such as Poland already spending nearly 5 percent of GDP, it might still fall short of meeting the expectations of the Trump administration's “peace through strength” doctrine.

The global trend among democracies is shifting toward significantly higher defense spending and it is important for President William Lai's (賴清德) administration not to appear to be getting left behind.



                                                                                Labubu, an elf-like plush toy with pointy ears and nine serrated teeth, has become a global sensation, worn by celebrities including Rihanna and Dua Lipa. These dolls are sold out in stores from Singapore to London; a human-sized version recently fetched a whopping US$150,000 at an auction in Beijing. With all the social media buzz, it is worth asking if we are witnessing the rise of a new-age collectible, or whether Labubu is a mere fad destined to fade. 
Investors certainly want to know. Pop Mart International Group Ltd, the Chinese manufacturer behind this trendy toy, has rallied 178 percent                                    



                                                                                My youngest son attends a university in Taipei. Throughout the past two years, whenever I have brought him his luggage or picked him up for the end of a semester or the start of a break, I have stayed at a hotel near his campus. In doing so, I have noticed a strange phenomenon: The hotel's TV contained an unusual number of Chinese channels, filled with accents that would make a person feel as if they are in China. It is quite exhausting.
A few days ago, while staying in the hotel, I found that of the 50 available TV channels,                                    



                                                                                There is no such thing as a “silicon shield.”
This trope has gained traction in the world of Taiwanese news, likely with the best intentions. Anything that breaks the China-controlled narrative that Taiwan is doomed to be conquered is welcome, but after observing its rise in recent months, I now believe that the “silicon shield” is a myth — one that is ultimately working against Taiwan.
The basic silicon shield idea is that the world, particularly the US, would rush to defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion because they do not want Beijing to seize the nation's vital and unique chip industry.
However,                                    



                                                                                Cosmetics have long been one of the “golden pillars” of revenue for department stores in Taiwan. With rows of beauty counters and a full lineup of brands, they once served as a powerful draw for customers. However, since last year, the halo surrounding the sector has begun to fade. It is not an isolated issue affecting one retailer — it is a widespread phenomenon across department stores in Taiwan.
Department store executives admit that business is tough, but they also stress that the root cause is not a drop in Taiwan's spending power or a surge in outbound travel. Instead, a                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

By Takenori Inoki / Special to The Yomiuri Shimbun

11:00 JST, July 4, 2025

The Roman Catholic Church has chosen an American-born cardinal as its new pope, and he has taken the name Leo XIV.

Many of the world's news outlets enthusiastically covered the conclave that elected the leader of the world's 1.4 billion-strong Catholics, as well as the challenges facing the church today.

In what direction will the new pope take church reform? The power of religion is once more being tested by the chaotic reality of politics, and by political leaders in the United States, China and Russia, among other heads of government, who act arbitrarily.

In January, Donald Trump began his second term as U.S. president. So, the world's attention is now focused on two American leaders, President Trump and Pope Leo.

Of course, they lead in different domains. But both politics and religion are deployed to tame the chaos that lurks in the human heart.

Trump has made clear from his policies that the United States is looking to step back from its role in shaping and maintaining the world order. He has already staked out a thoroughly protectionist stance, begun the process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change and frozen U.S. funding for the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization, among other international agencies. He has also shown indifference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Trump thinks the United States has not benefited enough from international agreements, international organizations and military alliances to compensate it for how much it has spent on infrastructure for maintaining the global order, in other words public goods. But in this mental calculus that sees unilateralism as reasonable, there is no understanding of how an international order with no hegemon will collapse, triggering major turmoil.

American economic historian Charles Kindleberger argued that a global leadership vacuum was to blame for instability in currencies, a turbulent world economy and the rise of protectionism in the 1930s.

After World War I, there was a dire need for the United States, which was experiencing a remarkable economic rise, to explicitly take over as the global economic hegemon from the United Kingdom, which had lost its momentum. However, the United States was focused on its own interests and would not assume the responsibilities of a hegemon. This was the main reason the Great Depression lasted so long, according to Kindleberger.

For its part, the United Kingdom was no longer willing or able to carry on as the provider of “international public goods.” It could no longer fulfill the responsibilities of a hegemon, such as coordinating macroeconomic policies among countries and supporting free markets and a stable currency system — the foundation of global economic infrastructure.

On the other hand, despite its economic predominance, the United States never seriously tried to stabilize the public goods that are global trade and currency exchange.

What do we see when we apply Kindleberger's perspective to U.S.-China tensions today and Washington's latest shift toward “America First”? We see a world facing a harsh reality, one of worsening trade wars and growing competition for resources, with no country assuming the mantle of hegemon to create order.

Once order begins to break down, things easily return to the chaos and barbarism of the primitive world. We have been reminded of this fact by Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the Palestine-Israel conflict and the missile strikes exchanged by Iran and Israel.

What message will the new pontiff send amid such circumstances? One thing is clear: The new pope has a very strong interest in social issues.

This can be inferred from how he worked assiduously to eradicate poverty and political corruption in Peru in the 1980s, and from his choice of the papal name Leo.

Pope Leo XIII (1810-1903) is remembered for having issued in 1891 the groundbreaking encyclical “Rerum Novarum,” which declared that the Catholic Church would seriously address social issues. The encyclical touched on the rights of workers and the limits of private property ownership from the perspective of human dignity at a time when economic competition was becoming increasingly fierce due to rapid industrialization.

Pope Leo XIV has said he wants to address, with the help of experts, issues relating to the spread of robots and artificial intelligence, both brought about by the new industrial revolution of the 21st century. The new pontiff is viewed as paying tribute to Pope Leo XIII, as a leader determined to continue on the earlier pontiff's path.

Science and technology have changed our lives greatly over the past half century. Have they brought happiness, or are they a source of unhappiness? There can be no simple answer since it depends on how the technologies are used. That said, history shows that cultures that are superior in science and technology inject themselves into those that lag behind and, with overwhelming force, bring assimilation.

For example, in the 12th century, Europe experienced an influx of Islamic culture, which carried a wealth of knowledge on the empirical sciences, such as medicine, astronomy and chemistry, and a variety of social problems emerged in Europe. Similarly today, the overwhelming push toward assimilation caused by science and technology, which chiefly originate in the United States, raises the question of whether AI will surpass humans.

Surely, many people would like to know how the Catholic Church — which from its perspective based on faith has been observing these matters that force a reexamination of humanity — views the latest issues.

Trump's policy toward Harvard and other leading U.S. universities is also causing major upheaval. Pope Leo XIII took a clear stance on the freedom of education and research in universities. He supported the so-called Oxford Movement that advocated separation of church and state, and deeply valued English theologian John Henry Newman and his idea of liberal education in universities.

Whether one supports or criticizes the political power of the time, being able to reason freely while maintaining a distance from power is essential to society.

Pope Leo XIII recognized that universities have value beyond simply nurturing human resources for the sake of national strength and economic power.

Clearly, there is an irreconcilable divergence between the goals of Trump and Pope Leo XIV.

Western societies have a long history of conflict over religion's interference in politics. The separation of church and state, a principle that is now mainstream, is very clear: Political power is to be separate from religious power, and neither is to intrude upon the other. However, Japan and the West have not been on the same page about what this principle is meant to deter.

In modern Japan, there is a fear that politics will be dominated by one religious group. But in the West, which has a long history of movements aimed at securing freedom, people have focused on how to prevent a weakening of religion due to entanglement in politics. This is because they want religion to retain its power to bring order to people's minds when they are heading toward chaos and barbarism.

What direction will the new pope point us in amid our tumultuous politics and rapidly changing society? I believe that it is important not to simply wait for messages from others but to reexamine our thoughts and lives.

Japan Day at the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo was held on Thursday, one of many National Day during which each participating country promotes their culture and traditions to the rest of the world. Japan's was marked with a ceremony held at the Expo Hall Shining Hat, part of the Expo site.

Japan, as the host country for this year's Expo, demonstrated its charm to the rest of the world with a show that combined traditional art and music with modern dance. Crown Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko were in attendance, as were Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and approximately 1,100 other visitors.

Crown Prince Akishino, who serves as honorary president of the Expo, said, “Japanese content connects people across borders. I hope that these wonderful experiences will be passed on to the next generation.”

After he spoke, Japanese arts and the four seasons were introduced through videos accompanied by a performance of gagaku, traditional Japanese court music. While images of manga were projected on the walls and screens in the hall, a modern dance routine was performed to express how Japanese manga is spreading throughout the world. A live performance by singer Misia was also held.

After the ceremony, the Expo's official character Myaku-Myaku paraded through the venue, along with widely beloved Kumamoto Prefecture mascot Kumamon, as well as Hikonyan, the mascot for Hikone, Shiga Prefecture.

Editor's note: This story was updated with a statement made by Ukraine's General Staff.

Drones struck multiple targets in Russia overnight on July 4, including a high-value defense facility in the southern Rostov region, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation center at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Kovalenko said a drone hit the Azov Optical and Mechanical Plant in the town of Azov, Rostov Oblast. The facility reportedly manufactures critical components for the Russian military, including sights, rangefinders, thermal imaging systems, and fire control equipment for tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, ships, and aircraft.

""Despite the difficult night, there is also good news. There were attacks on facilities in Russia, particularly in Moscow and Rostov regions,"" Kovalenko wrote. ""This is where the 'eyes' for Russian armored vehicles are assembled."" 

Overnight on July 4, Russia launched a massive drone and missile assault on multiple Ukrainian cities, with Kyiv as the primary target. At least 23 people were injured in the capital amid widespread destruction and high levels of air pollution.

Ukraine's General Staff later confirmed that its drone units, operating in coordination with other elements of the Defense Forces, also struck the Scientific Research Institute of Applied Chemistry (FNTs NIIPKh) in Sergiyev Posad, Moscow Oblast.

The military said the facility is involved in the production of thermobaric warheads for Shahed-type drones and plays a critical role in Russia's airstrike capabilities.

""We confirmed that our munitions hit the target,"" the General Staff said. ""A fire and heavy smoke were detected in the area of the facility."" The full extent of the damage is still being assessed.

Russian officials also confirmed drone strikes across several regions.

Yuriy Slyusar, acting governor of Rostov Oblast, said a number of towns in the region were struck by drones. In the city of Azov, the attack reportedly damaged several cars and shattered windows in residential buildings. Debris from one drone allegedly fell onto a local stadium.

In the village of Dolotinka, a drone strike reportedly caused the collapse of a section of a residential apartment building, killing an elderly woman. Authorities said 20 residents were evacuated from the damaged structure.

In Sergiyev Posad in Moscow Oblast, four explosions were reported around 5 a.m. near the Zvezdochka neighborhood, accompanied by the sound of drone engines, according to local residents. Oksana Yerokhanova, head of the district, said a power substation was damaged in the incident.

Two people were injured in Sergiyev Posad, according to Governor Andrei Vorobyov. 

Russia's Defense Ministry later claimed that air defense systems had intercepted or destroyed 48 Ukrainian drones overnight. According to the ministry, 26 were downed over Rostov Oblast, 12 over Kursk Oblast, six over Belgorod Oblast, three over Oryol Oblast, and one over Lipetsk Oblast.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

Three Democratic Senators have launched an investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump's refusal to impose new sanctions against Russia, the legislators announced in a joint statement on July 3. 

Since taking office in January, Trump has passed no new sanctions against Moscow. In some cases, he has even eased restrictions, even as Russia intensifies its full-scale war against Ukraine. 

Senate Democrats Jeanne Shaheen, Elizabeth Warren, and Chris Coons called on the administration to impose new penalties on the Kremlin and said they planned to investigate Trump's ""five-month pause"" on sanctions. 

""Americans should be asking why a president who says he wants to end a major war is instead letting the aggressor run rampant,"" the senators said in a joint statement issued July 3.

The statement followed an analysis by the New York Times (NYT), published July 2, which found that Washington's slowed momentum on sanctions created more opportunities for shell companies to funnel sanctioned goods into Russia. 

Former U.S. President Joe Biden imposed an average of 170 new sanctions per month on entities tied to Moscow between 2022-2024, according to the NYT. Overall, the Biden administration slapped 6,200 penalties on individuals, businesses, ships, and aircraft connected to Russia. 

Without new sanctions to maintain pressure on Moscow, the effects of the Biden sanctions regime have begun to erode, the NYT reported. An analysis of trade records and other data. showed that over 130 companies in China and Hong Kong are advertising sales of sanctioned computer chips to Russia. Despite this illegal activity, none of the companies have been sanctioned.

""On top of halting key assistance to Ukraine, President Trump has blocked regular updates to our sanctions and export controls for five months and counting—enabling a growing wave of evaders in China and around the world to continue supplying Russia's war machine,"" Senators Shaheen, Warren, and Coons said in their statement. 

The senators called on Trump to ""actively enforce the existing sanctions against Russia"" and urged the administration to partner with EU and G7 nations to mount pressure on Moscow. 

""Instead of taking clearly available steps to pressure the aggressors, President Trump is doing nothing and we will be investigating this missed opportunity to push for an end to this war,"" they said. 

Along with letting U.S. sanctions on the Kremlin go stagnant, the Trump administration has removed sanctions on Karina Rotenberg, the wife of a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and notably exempted Russia from its sweeping ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. 

reportedly obstructed bipartisan congressional efforts to target the Russian economy.  Trump has asked Republican senators to weaken a proposed sanctions bill and has urged delays in a vote on the legislation.

The bipartisan sanctions bill, introduced by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Senate Democrat Richard Blumenthal, seeks to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and raw materials.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin following a phone call on July 3, during which the two leaders discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine. 

Trump told reporters he ""didn't make any progress"" and accused Putin of showing no willingness to stop the fighting.

Trump also said that he is planning to talk to President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 4. 

""I'm speaking to President Zelensky tomorrow in the early morning, and I'm very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin,"" Trump told journalists. ""Because I don't think he's there. And I'm very disappointed.  I don't think he's looking to stop this fighting.""

Later on July 4, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia ""is paying close attention to all of Trump's statements,"" but added Moscow will continue its full-scale war in Ukraine because ""it is not yet possible to achieve goals through diplomatic means.""

The hour-long conversation between Trump and Putin marked the sixth time the two leaders have spoken since Trump took office in January. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, Putin reiterated that ""Russia will continue to pursue its goals,"" refusing to back down from what the Kremlin calls the ""root causes” of the conflict.

The White House did not issue a readout of the call. Trump provided few additional details, only saying the discussion covered ""a lot of things"" and confirming no progress had been made on securing a ceasefire.

The call came just hours before one of the largest Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine in recent months. According to Zelensky, air raid sirens began sounding across Ukraine almost simultaneously with media reports about the Trump-Putin call.

""Russia is once again demonstrating that it is not going to end the war and terror,"" Zelensky said. ""The first air raids in our cities and regions began yesterday, almost simultaneously with the start of media discussions of President Trump's phone call with Putin.""

Overnight on July 4, Russian forces launched more than 550 aerial weapons, including over 330 Iranian-type Shahed drones and multiple types of missiles, across Ukraine, with Kyiv as the main target. At least 23 people were injured in the capital, where fires broke out in multiple districts and air pollution reached dangerous levels.

Zelensky renewed calls for increased military assistance from Ukraine's partners, especially the delivery of U.S.-made Patriot missile systems.

""Patriots and their missiles are real defenders of life,"" he said. 

Despite Ukraine's urgent appeals, the U.S. Defense Department has paused shipments of Patriot systems and other key munitions, citing the need to replenish domestic stockpiles. Ukrainian officials have warned that such delays threaten to embolden Russia and intensify attacks on civilians.

Daily roundup of research and analysis from The Globe and Mail's market strategist Scott Barlow

Scotiabank strategist Jean-Michel Gauthier thinks “The world will be buying Canada”,

“The World Will Be Buying Canada – FTSE Reform Boosting Canada Accepted … OUR TAKE: Positive. FTSE announced last Friday that Canada will now be separate from the U.S. when it calculates market cap cut-off points. However, liquidity concerns will see September additions to the All Cap Canada made in three tranches (35 per cent in Sep, 30 per cent in Dec 2025, and 35 per cent in Mar 2026). As a result, initial international inflows in Canada will be lower at $1.7-billion in September vs. our earlier estimate of $2.6-billion, but with a residual tailwind of $622-million in Dec 2025 and $708-million in Mar 2026”

BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic continues to favour stocks over real estate,

“We're now in a well-established bear market for Toronto condos, but an ongoing bull market for TSX stocks. The playing field isn't as massively tilted as it was two years ago, but this trade likely hasn't run its course yet. In a mid-2023 piece, we argued that stocks carried higher yield (better valuations), tax advantages, better liquidity, lower payment risk (dividends vs. rent), better payout growth and lower transaction costs. At the same time, we noted that cash flow dynamics, building supply and a likely downturn in rents were going to weigh on investment real estate. Clearly those trends are still playing out. While cash flow dynamics in real estate are ‘less bad' now with mortgage rates and prices both down, they're still not compelling enough to draw investment in from other asset classes like equities and GoCs— real estate requires a risk premium (though many forgot that). Meantime, Canadian equity valuations are still relatively favourable, and earnings/dividends should continue to expand if we indeed settle on a trade deal, and economic growth is allowed to perk back up later this year and through 2026”

CIBC analyst Stephanie Price sees value in domestic telecom stocks,

“The Canadian telecom sector is trading below U.S. peers, near trough levels. This report compares the Canadian telecom environment to the U.S. and Europe. We conclude that while the traditional premium to U.S. peers is not warranted in the current environment, we believe that Canadian telecoms should be trading roughly in line with U.S. peers. With the pricing environment stabilizing, we see valuation upside at current levels, although we expect it will take several years for the Canadian telecom customer base to completely reprice. Our top picks include Rogers, Quebecor and TELUS”

A Flair Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft at Vancouver International Airport on April 17, 2024. The counterclaim for damages by the four Irish leasing companies is made in their statement of defence of an earlier lawsuit launched by Flair.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Leasing companies that seized four Flair Airlines planes for missed rent payments in 2023 have filed a lawsuit against the carrier for US$30.9-million.

Flair sued the lessors shortly after the repossession of the Boeing 737 aircraft for $50-million, alleging breach of contact. 

The counterclaim for damages by the four Irish leasing companies is made in their statement of defence of that suit, filed recently in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. 

In the statement, which contains unproven allegations, the lessors allege they incurred millions of dollars in costs when they repossessed, repaired and leased again or sold the aircraft. 

Flair was late in monthly payments and owed as much as $3.5-million when the planes were seized, the companies allege. 

Flair's lawsuit against them is “an attempt to recover self-inflicted losses arising from its own defaults under four aircraft leases that it entered into with the lessors.”

“For months, Flair failed to make rent and other payments when due under the leases. It ignored repeated default notices,” reads the counterclaim, filed by Columbia Lights Aviation, Corvus Lights Aviation, Mam Aircraft Leasing and Airborne Capital. 

Flair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Agents for the leasing companies boarded and took control of the planes early on March 11, 2023, at airports in Toronto, Waterloo and Edmonton. 

Flair's chief executive officer at the time, Stephen Jones, called the moves “draconian” and said the Edmonton-based airline owed about US$1-million on the leases. He said Flair was late on its lease payments after a “tough” winter.

Flair sued the companies, claiming the seizures were “unlawful.”

In the lessors' counterclaim and statement of defence, however, the companies say the lease agreements gave them the rights to repossess the planes in the case of default. The lessors allege Flair's missed payments fluctuated between $1.8-million and $3.5-milion between September, 2022, and March, 2023. 

“For months, the lessors made repeated demands of Flair to pay outstanding amounts under the leases,” the suit alleges.

The lessors denied Flair's claims they induced the airline to breach the leasing agreements and conspired to transfer the planes to others at higher payment levels. 

In their claim for damages, the leasing companies are seeking repayment of lost rental income, maintenance and repair costs, marketing expenses and taxes. 

More to come.

Brussels and Berlin have launched a new initiative aimed at bypassing the long-standing paralysis of the World Trade Organization (WTO) caused by the United States. But how viable is such a solution? 

A proposal, introduced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has sparked considerable attention.

Speaking at the end of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on June 27, they floated the idea of the EU taking the lead in forming an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the world trade body that has been in place since 1995.

Merz said the idea was in its early stages but could include mechanisms to resolve disputes, as the WTO was meant to do.

""You all know that the WTO doesn't work anymore,"" he said, adding that a ""new kind of trade organization"" could gradually replace ""what we no longer have with the WTO.""

The German chancellor was referring to the near-total breakdown of the WTO's dispute resolution mechanism.

It was former US President Barack Obama who first blocked appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body — its top court for trade disputes — during his later years in office.

That blockade has continued under every US administration since, regardless of party affiliation, as successive governments have opposed WTO rulings that they argue undermine US national interests.

As a result, trade disputes can no longer be conclusively resolved once a party appeals. Currently, unresolved cases include disputes between the EU and Indonesia over nickel ore exports, rulings on subsidies for aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, and anti-dumping cases against China.

The EU's von der Leyen emphasized plans for a particularly close partnership with like-minded trade nations in Asia, referencing potential cooperation with the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

This trade alliance currently includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The United Kingdom has also joined, becoming the first European country in the bloc.

But can Europe realistically create a new WTO without US involvement? And how effective would an alliance with like-minded global partners be, especially in the Asia-Pacific?

Jürgen Matthes, an international trade policy expert at the Cologne, Germany-based German Economic Institute (IW), expressed support for the initiative in an interview with DW.

""A formal EU application to join the CPTPP would be a strategically important move in several respects,"" Matthes said. ""It would send a clear signal to the US that its protectionism is isolating it, while the rest of the world continues to liberalize trade.""

Matthes also said this would create a ""remarkably large trans-regional trade agreement,"" involving major economies, ""with the EU as the largest bloc.""

""It would cover nearly all continents. And maybe some African countries could be brought on board as well,"" he added.

Such a club, however, would initially exclude China, which Matthes argued is not known for playing by fair competition rules.

""The goal is to form a strategic trade alliance that addresses today's pressing issues in global trade — not only US protectionism, but also the massive market distortions caused by China's subsidies, which current WTO rules don't effectively address,"" said Matthes.

For the EU, the priority would be to enshrine strict competition rules within the new framework, particularly regarding state-owned enterprises and industrial subsidies. ""Anyone who meets those standards can join,"" he added.

That would require China to make major reforms, such as reducing market distortions and subsidies, or finally agreeing to a comprehensive overhaul of WTO rules.

Free trade advocates have already created a workaround to the WTO's stalled appeals process called the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA). Formed within the WTO itself, MPIA provides an alternative dispute resolution system that functions without US participation.

According to the European Commission, 57 countries, representing 57.6% of global trade, have joined the MPIA, including the UK and all EU member states.

Still, business groups such as the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services (BGA), which represents Germany's export sector, are wary of undermining the WTO.

Speaking to news agency Reuters, BGA President Dirk Jandura acknowledged the strategic benefits of forming a new framework among functioning democracies via CPTPP, but warned of the risks. ""We must not allow global trade to splinter into competing blocs with different rules,"" he said. ""This new organization must only be a transitional solution, clearly aimed at reforming — not replacing — the WTO.""

Brussels has also been careful to clarify that the goal is not to render the WTO obsolete. EU Commission President von der Leyen described the ""structured cooperation"" with CPTPP members as a potential starting point for reshaping the WTO.

Even the WTO's former chief economist, Ralph Ossa, who recently returned to the University of Zurich, openly acknowledged the need for change. ""Does the WTO need reform? Absolutely,"" he told DW.

Germany's economy ministry echoed that view, with a spokesperson for Minister Katharina Reiche confirming that the German government, together with the European Commission, is actively pushing for WTO reforms.

These include new rules to curb industrial subsidies to ensure fair competition, digital trade initiatives, and investment facilitation. The EU is already in talks with countries that support open and rules-based trade — including CPTPP members.

The EU's dual message to both the US and China appears to be part of a deliberate communication strategy that has evolved since US President Donald Trump's tariff war.

Matthes envisions a new alliance under the banner of ""Open Markets with Fair Trade."" In such a setup, ""the US is out when it comes to open markets, and China is out when it comes to fair trade — unless things change under a new US administration or a reformed China emerges.""

He sees multiple advantages to this strategy. ""We'd achieve more trade liberalization and gain access to new markets. We'd isolate the US more and show Trump that protectionism is ultimately a dead end."" At the same time, Europe could send a clear message to China that it will no longer tolerate market distortions, he added.

Airlines have had to cancel hundreds of flights as airport staff went on strike, leaving tens of thousands of passengers in the lurch as the summer travel season gets under way.

Strike action by French air traffic controllers on Thursday has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights, leaving tens of thousands of passengers in the lurch at the start of the summer season — one of the busiest times of the year for travel.

France's civil aviation authority DGAC said airlines needed to revise their schedules, including at Paris' Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport — one of Europe's busiest travel hubs.

A little after 10 am (0800 UTC/GMT) on Thursday, AFP news agency reported that flights were experiencing significant delays, including an average of 1.5 hours for arrivals and 1 hour for departures in Nice, France's third-largest airport.

Europe's largest airline Ryanair said that it had been forced to cancel 170 flights over Thursday and Friday, impacting over 30,000 passengers.

""Once again European families are held to ransom by French Air Traffic Controllers going on strike,"" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said.

""It makes no sense and is abundantly unfair on EU passengers and families going on holidays,"" O'Leary said. 

Another popular budget airline, Easyjet, said it would be cancelling 274 flights over the same period.

The Airlines for Europe association, which includes Ryanair, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and EasyJet, described the action as ""intolerable"".

Air traffic controllers' union, UNSA-ICNA, said members were taking action over understaffing, outdated equipment and a toxic management culture.

""The DGAC is failing to modernise the tools that are essential to air traffic controllers, even though it continues to promise that all necessary resources are being made available,"" UNSA-ICNA said in a statement.

 France's transport minister Philippe Tabarot said the unions' demands are unacceptable.

US President Donald Trump earned a significant political victory when US Congress passed his ""Big Beautiful Bill."" But Trump's signature tax and spending policy isn't popular, even within his own party.

After pressuring fellow members of his Republican party for months, Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" has passed both houses of US Congress and is now on the president's desk to be signed into law.

The bill represents a critical legislative milestone and a political victory for the US president. Much of his second term has so far been marked by executive orders, which are presidential instructions with the force of laws but don't need the approval of Congress. But having this major spending and tax bill passed by Congress will finance a huge chunk of his presidential campaign promises. 

""I think, politically, this is a winner for Donald Trump, he can point to some sort of legislative success for his agenda,"" said Steven Webster, a political scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington.

Trump had demanded the House pass the bill for him to sign by July 4, suggesting his desire for an Independence Day-themed victory lap.

""Some people dislike the bill because of the cuts to part of the American health care and safety net system,"" said Peter Loge, a political analyst at George Washington University in Washington, DC.

""Some people don't like the legislation because it adds a tremendous amount to the US debt. It's incredibly expensive.""

The big bill is a big attempt to check off Trump's long list of campaign promises.

It includes a mix of individual and business tax cuts, massive cash injections to immigration controls, increased military spending and a ramping up of fossil fuel incentives.

There are also changes to health and social program eligibility and a winding down of some of the climate transition initiatives introduced by former President Joe Biden.

The winners, unsurprisingly, are policy realms that have been the foundation of Trump's ""America First"" mantra.

A total of $178 billion (about €150 billion) in spending will go to programs intended to restrict immigration, including resuming the construction of Trump's Mexico border wall, as well as to staff and resource border police, immigration prosecutions, detention and criminal investigations.

Around $153 billion will be spent on defense: shipbuilding, missile defense, nuclear weapons and supporting military assistance of the border.

And after promising to ""drill, baby, drill"" during his campaign and in his victory speech — a call for fossil fuel extraction to be ramped up — the bill would simultaneously incentivize gas exploration and exports, while ending concessions and incentives for electric vehicles, clean energy and emissions reduction programs.

There are also tax cuts of about $4.5 trillion (€3.8 trillion) for individuals and businesses, which include Trump's pledges to stop taxing tips and overtime. 

""Nothing in this bill should be surprising,"" Loge said, ""It promises to spend a lot of money capturing immigration concerns in the US... it would spend a huge amount of money strengthening our immigration system and finding and deporting people who are here without proper authorization. That's by-and-large popular among many people.""

In both houses, Republican leaders have been forced to balance the demands of holdouts — those unhappy with the measures contained within the bill.

Debt is a major concern for fiscal conservatives. Nonpartisan analysts project about $3.4 trillion (€2.3 trillion) will be added to the US national debt over the next decade because of the bill. The debt limit has been raised by $5 trillion.

The debt disquiet inside the Capitol has been echoed outside, most notably from one-time Trump ally Elon Musk. 

Prior to the Senate passing the bill, the world's richest person and the top donor to Trump's presidential campaign threatened to run candidates against Republicans who supported the measures during upcoming primary contests, and went as far to suggest he'd start his own ""America Party"" in opposition.

""I think the party is likely to struggle to explain how adding three-and-a-half trillion dollars to the national debt is in line with their stated goal of getting the nation's fiscal house in order,"" said Webster.

The bill is also unpopular with the public.

According to a Quinnipiac University poll from late June, 55% of US voters oppose the bill and 29% support it (the rest didn't offer an opinion). About two-thirds of Republican voters are in favor. Analysts DW spoke with said that when the content of the bill tends to be explained to voters, including Republicans, support declines.

Changes to health and social programs likely play a major role. 

New eligibility rules, particularly for the Medicaid scheme which extends health care coverage to low-income people, and the SNAP food aid program, could see millions of people lose health insurance coverage by 2034, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office. In all, more than $1 trillion have been cut from health measures. 

""It's about 17 million that would lose coverage,"" said Elisabeth Wright Burak, a senior fellow at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, a nonpartisan research center.

""Even if there are some sort of tax or other benefits, if you're losing your health insurance coverage, or you're losing your nutrition assistance, that's a hit to your [personal] bottom line."" 

That could also hit important parts of Trump's MAGA base, including working Americans who have flipped their support to him during the last decade.

While many of the health program changes have been made because of what Trump has called large-scale ""fraud and abuse"" within the US public health infrastructure, many experts have argued that the claimed attempt to cut fat from health care initiatives is hacking into muscle. 

""There's not a lot of fat in Medicaid,"" said Wright Burak. ""Certainly there are things that could be improved, but most of that money is already going to health care services.""

As the country tumbles towards fascism, some members of the U.S. military have struggled with a choice: defy illegal orders, or participate in the dismantling of American democracy.

In June, over the objections of local leaders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, President Donald Trump called up the National Guard and the U.S. Marines to quell protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids. That month, calls to the GI Rights Hotline spiked. The hotline provides information on military discharges and related issues; all calls are confidential. The hotline, which is jointly administered by a large consortium of nonprofit organizations, connects callers with both paid resource counselors and experienced volunteers.

The consortium includes groups like Quaker House and The Center on Conscience & War, which assists service members with applications for conscientious objector status, and has seen a similar uptick in requests for help. So far this year, the center has helped 30 service members submit applications — more than they typically submit in an entire year. A high percentage of these applications are usually successfully accepted, according to the center.

Steve Woolford, a counselor with the hotline, told Truthout in an email that his office, which is just one of the multiple sites that staff the hotline, received over 300 calls in June, a 94 percent increase in calls from the previous June.

“Overall callers have shared serious concerns that the president is moving the country away from a representative democracy altogether,” Woolford told Truthout in an email. “These callers believe that the military will determine what the United States becomes by deciding which side to follow. For them, having service members refuse to turn their backs on the constitution is the safeguard against martial law and dictatorship.”

U.S. Air Force airman Juan Bettancourt said his colleagues in the armed forces have expressed similar concerns. Bettancourt is expressing his own views and not speaking on behalf of the military or the Department of Defense.

“They are absolutely petrified of being put in a position in which they are the vehicle to advance further authoritarianism, and the proto-fascism that we're seeing,” Bettancourt told Truthout. “There is absolutely that fear that they're going to be the pawns in this chess game that brings about the further expansion of authoritarianism.”

Bettancourt said some service members fear the military will become Trump's domestic police force, potentially in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. He says this is a particularly fraught prospect for Latino personnel, who could be deployed to carry out Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. Thousands of immigrants enlist in the military each year. In fiscal year 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services naturalized more than 16,000 service members — a 34 percent increase from the previous year. Of those naturalized between fiscal years 2020 and 2024, the top five countries of origin were the Philippines, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, and Ghana.

“They feel they're betraying themselves,” said Bettancourt, himself an immigrant from Colombia.

Bettancourt is on his way out of the military. He applied to be a conscientious objector last year, spurred by the U.S. backing of Israel's genocide in Gaza. After a prolonged bureaucratic delay, he says his commander agreed to administratively separate him.

“I can't believe whoever fell for the lie that the military is apolitical, but with Trump, it feels dangerously political, like we're being used as pawns. We're the saber that he's rattling.”

Richard Morgan, the executive director of the Center on Conscience & War, said after Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles, several callers asked if they could wear face coverings if they were deployed to Los Angeles. He said they didn't fear protesters knowing their identity — they feared their children would.

“They just didn't want to be recognized,” he told Truthout, explaining that many expressed “the idea that ‘I don't want anyone in my community thinking I'm betraying them.'”

“They were worried that their children would see them and recognize them for what they were doing,” he added.

Concerns about being implicated in Trump's attempts to use the military as a police force extend to family members of active duty personnel as well, according to Sarah Streyder, whose spouse is in the military. Streyder is the executive director of Secure Families Initiative, a nonpartisan group of military families that advocates for diplomatic solutions to global conflicts.

Many families believe that Trump is transforming the military into a “scary domestic policing force,” she said.

“Those lines are being blurred between law enforcement, immigration enforcement on one side and the military on the other,” Streyder told Truthout. “We fear that that's going to erode our relationships with civilian neighbors. That's the kind of fear we are hearing across the board, whether you are in California or Massachusetts or Alaska or Florida. I'm stationed overseas, and I have that fear.”

In addition to immigration raids, some service members have also opposed Trump's changes to internal policies, such as his ban on transgender people serving in the military and the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

An airman who recently separated from the Air Force told Truthout that cutting DEI programs made her feel like “they hated me as a person, as a woman and as a woman of color.”

“I went and talked to a chaplain about how the rollbacks in DEI were scaring me,” she said. “He goes, ‘Oh, well, did you know that DEI actually harms minorities like you?'”

The airman's spouse is still in the military and asked that Truthout not publish her name to protect her spouse from retaliation.

She says by the time she left the Air Force, a few months into Trump's second term, “it was very, very bad vibes.”

“Trump is bringing such a toxicity to the military,” she said. “The military is political, there's no getting around that. I can't believe whoever fell for the lie that the military is apolitical, but with Trump, it feels dangerously political, like we're being used as pawns. We're the saber that he's rattling.”

Members of the military have options, albeit limited, to avoid actions that conflict with their conscience. Service members have the right to refuse an illegal order. But in reality, those who dissent can experience loss of benefits and pay, reduction in rank, and imprisonment.

James M. Branum, an attorney with the National Lawyers Guild Military Law Task Force, says a service member may be able to head off any potential issues by using their unit's open-door policy, whereby a service member can meet with their commander. Army regulations direct commanders to publish an open-door policy although the specific procedures are determined by the commander. The regulations state that an open-door policy “allows members of the command to present facts, concerns, and problems of a personal or professional nature or other issues that the Soldier has been unable to resolve.”

Branum suggests they express their concerns preemptively, before orders come down.

“What I'm encouraging is, have a conversation,” he said. “Say, ‘I don't want to be disrespectful. I don't want to hurt morale of this organization, but I have serious concerns about this deployment. I've heard we may be going in, and so if you have any latitude on who goes on this deployment, please don't send me.'”

However, if service members reach the point where they must refuse orders they believe are illegal, the terrain is “a little bit complicated,” Branum said. If a service member refuses an order they can be court martialed, where a military judge rules on the legality of the order — a largely subjective determination.

In the early 2000s, several American soldiers refused to fight in Iraq because they believed it was an immoral and illegal war. Camilo Mejia Castillo, a U.S. National Guardsman, served one tour of duty in Iraq and refused to return. He was convicted of desertion and sentenced to a year in prison, a reduction in rank, and given a bad conduct discharge, which can result in loss of veterans benefits. In another case, Abdullah Webster refused to deploy to Iraq and was convicted of failing to obey commands from his superior and missing his brigade's movements. Shortly before he was due to retire, he was sentenced to 14 months in prison. He also lost his pension and received a bad conduct discharge.

Branum says the Trump administration — which planned to cut over 80,000 jobs with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs — has put active duty personnel in a “terrible position.” Branum said the current crisis may lead some members of the military to reevaluate the institution as a whole.

“When the military starts pushing the boundaries, pushing people to do things that are really outside the scope of what it has historically done in the past, that often leads service members to start asking broader questions,” he told Truthout. “Not just about the immediate deployment or the immediate issue in front of them, but about the nature of military service itself.”

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits put in place by the Inflation Reduction Act.

The U.S. House of Representatives voted 218-214 on Thursday to pass President Donald Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, greenlighting deep cuts to America's social safety net and the decimation of the country's only federal climate strategy. Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, while all but two House Republicans supported it.

“This bill will leave America a far crueler and weaker place,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of the nonprofit Public Citizen, in a statement. It “races the United States and the world toward climate catastrophe, ending support for renewable energy that is absolutely vital to avert worst-case climate scenarios.”

The so-called Big Beautiful Bill has now been approved by both chambers of Congress; all it needs now is Trump's signature before it can become law. Trump is expected to sign it during an evening ceremony on July 4, Independence Day, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

One of Republicans' biggest victories in the bill is the extension of deep tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term, which are estimated to cost the country more than $4 trillion over 10 years. The legislation also directs roughly $325 billion to the military and to border security, while cutting nearly $1 trillion in funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that covers medical costs for lower-income people.

To pay for the tax breaks, the bill sunsets clean energy tax credits that were put in place by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, making wind and solar projects ineligible unless they start construction before July 2026 or are placed in service by 2027. It also imposes an expedited phaseout of consumer tax credits for new and used electric vehicles — by September 30 this year instead of by 2032. Green groups described the legislation as “historically ruinous” and “a self-inflicted tragedy for our country.”

The IRA's tax credits and additional incentives for green energy from the bipartisan infrastructure act, also passed under former president Joe Biden, were projected to reduce the United States' greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2030. Combined with additional action from states, cities, and private companies, they could have put the U.S. on track to meet the country's emissions reduction target under the United Nations Paris Agreement.

Once Trump signs the megabill, however, the U.S. will have no federal plan to address the climate crisis.

“Every lawmaker who voted for this cynical measure chose tax cuts for the wealthiest over Americans' health, pocketbooks, public lands, and waters — and a safe climate. They should be ashamed,” said Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement.

Agriculture experts have also objected to Trump's policy bill, which removes the requirement that unobligated climate-targeted funds from the IRA be funneled toward climate-specific projects — in part so they can be directed toward programs under the current farm bill, an omnibus bill for food and agriculture that the federal government renews every five to six years. The Trump megabill seeks to increase subsidies to commodity farms by about $50 billion.

The final version of the bill doesn't include a proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands; this was dropped following outcry from the public and some conservation-minded GOP lawmakers. It also lacks stringent limits on the use of Chinese components in renewable energy projects that were proposed in an earlier version of the bill. Some Republican lawmakers in both the House and Senate voted for the legislation in exchange for carveouts in their states, like reduced work requirements for food stamps and less severe health care cuts.

In the Thursday House vote, only two Republicans broke with their party to vote against Trump's megabill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who opposes measures that would increase the federal deficit, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who had hesitated to support cuts to Medicaid.

All Democrats voted against the bill. Immediately preceding the House vote, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York railed against the policy in a record-breaking 8-hour-and-45-minute House floor speech invoking scripture: “Our job is to stand up for the poor, the sick, and the afflicted,” he said. 

Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus have promised to hold Republicans accountable. More than three dozen of its members have said they'll hold “Accountability Summer” events lambasting Republican lawmakers who supported the bill. “As Democrats, we must make sure they never live that down,” the group's chair, Greg Casar, a Democrat of Texas, said in a statement.

Similarly, Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat for Hawaiʻi, told The New York Times that his party should use the megabill's spending cuts as a cudgel against Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections: “Our job is to point out, when kids get less to eat, when rural hospitals shutter, when the price of electricity goes up, that this is because of what your Republican elected official did,” he said.

Hunger in Gaza isn't accidental — it's managed. It's enforced. And now, aid is being militarized.

The last time I tried to get food aid in Gaza, I nearly died.

It was early morning in Rafah, and I hadn't eaten properly in days. I woke before the sun rose, stomach aching, body weak, and met up with my friend Abu Naji. We planned to walk five kilometers to a zone near al-Alam — “the Flag,” as people call it — where humanitarian aid was rumored to be distributed. Word on the street said it would open at 10:00 am, and we were desperate enough to believe it.

We passed destroyed buildings, endless lines of makeshift tents, and the slow shuffle of others just like us — starving, exhausted, and hoping for a few cans of food. We arrived around mid-morning. There were no signs. No aid workers. No water. No shelter. Only thousands of people crowding together under the eye of Israeli surveillance drones, waiting in silence. The zone wasn't marked, but people knew where to go — because they'd seen others try it. And seen some of them die trying.

Just before noon, Israeli soldiers fired gunshots into the sky. That was the signal: Move forward. The crowd surged as one. There were no organized lines, no distribution points — just scattered supplies thrown from trucks or dropped by parachute. People climbed over each other to grab whatever they could before it was gone. I wished I were stronger. Not a writer. Not a program coordinator. I wished I had the muscles to fight my way through, to claim a small box of pasta or a can of tuna. But my body has been malnourished for months. None of us in Gaza have eaten properly in nearly two years. I watched people push forward. I saw a man I knew step a few meters outside an invisible boundary — one no one had explained, one that didn't exist on any map — and get shot in the chest. He collapsed onto the sand and didn't move.

The soldiers never shouted warnings. There were no fences. Only live fire enforcing invisible borders. And hunger enforcing risk.

I turned around and walked away. I didn't get any food. But I survived. That was my first and last time attempting to reach humanitarian aid in Rafah.

The truth is, what's being called a “humanitarian operation” in Gaza is something else entirely. It's not simply broken. It's being used as a weapon. Hunger here isn't accidental — it's managed. It's enforced. And now, it's being militarized.

The so-called aid zone we walked to that day wasn't managed by any recognized relief organization. There were no UN workers or Red Crescent staff. Instead, the operation was linked to an entity calling itself the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). According to lawyers and watchdog groups in Switzerland, GHF has no medical or aid personnel on the ground. Instead, it has partnered with a U.S.-linked private security firm named Safe Reach Solutions. This company isn't made up of aid workers — it's made up of contractors. Former U.S. military, intelligence officers, and data analysts, many earning up to $1,000 a day. Some are deployed in the very zones where civilians like me go to collect aid. Their real job isn't just “security.” According to investigations by TRIAL International and the Alliance of Lawyers for Palestine, the GHF contractors are tasked with collecting visual and behavioral intelligence on Palestinians. They use quadcopters and surveillance drones to track people's movements, scan their faces, and monitor their behavior — building profiles in hopes of identifying “targets.” In the process, people are dying.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed trying to reach aid, while thousands more have been injured and several others remain missing.

These are not accidents. This is not poor planning. This is a system that weaponizes food and fear at the same time. One that invites you to risk your life for a bag of flour — then kills you when you step the wrong way. This is a system where every hungry child becomes a potential data point. Where every grandmother in a food line is scanned from the sky. Where every facial expression could place you on a kill list.

What's worse is that these operations are invisible to much of the world. Foreign journalists haven't been allowed into Gaza for nearly 20 months. Israel has killed more than 200 Palestinian journalists, and rejected thousands of visa requests from international media. What Gaza has is just overlapping shell organizations with unclear responsibilities and zero accountability. GHF, despite presenting itself as a Swiss humanitarian group, is also registered in the United States. Several Swiss lawyers have filed legal complaints demanding investigations into the group's nonprofit status and its ties to militarized operations. Meanwhile, other actors — like Nathan Mook, former CEO of World Central Kitchen — have appeared in parallel efforts tied to projects like the U.S. floating pier and entities like the Maritime Humanitarian Aid Foundation, which also operate without clear oversight.

In a recent interview on CNN Türk, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state described the situation in Gaza as one where “the people are hostages.” That wasn't a slip. That was a policy. When food becomes bait, civilians become bargaining chips. And as journalist Rasha Nabil replied during that same interview, “This is injustice. The world has become a jungle.”

Israel continues to justify its military assault as a mission to retrieve hostages. But for most of us in Gaza, that justification feels like a cruel illusion. The war has gone on for over a year and eight months. Hospitals have been flattened. Neighborhoods erased. Our water systems bombed. Some Palestinians, desperate for any end to the violence, have called for the release of Israeli captives —unconditionally — hoping it might take away Israel's last excuse for its brutal campaign. But that desperation only reveals the divide between civilians and the political factions that claim to speak for them. For Hamas, the hostages are a bargaining chip. But for Israel, the people of Gaza are the same.

I do not support Hamas. I do not support any group that plays with lives. But I also do not support a system where international aid is a tracking device. Where relief is distributed by men with guns and drones. Where death and data are delivered in the same package.

Aid must never be a weapon. It must never be bait. It must never be a tool to punish an occupied people. Humanitarian relief must return to the hands of real humanitarian organizations — neutral, transparent, and protected by international law. Private military contractors have no place in our hunger. Governments that fund or support them — including the United States and Switzerland — must investigate the systems they've helped build and the lives they've helped destroy.

We are not numbers. We are not “risks.” We are not enemy targets because we are hungry. We are people — grieving, broken, surviving — and the world is watching as we are starved, shot at, and turned into data.

And sometimes, it watches in silence.

JAMES JEFFREY served as a Foreign Service Officer in seven U.S. administrations, including, during the first Trump administration, as Special Representative for Syria Engagement and Special Envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.

 James Jeffrey

Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has gone for gold in the Middle East. He launched a dramatic military operation against Iran's nuclear program, building on the broader dismantling of the country's regional power. He then brokered a cease-fire between Israel and Iran and indicated a willingness to talk with the Iranian government. These outcomes have provided hope that if the United States can focus on the essential—the continued containment and further weakening of Iran—and avoid overcommitment to myriad other regional policy objectives, the Middle East might finally have the stability and normalcy it has long lacked.

But the region has seen similar optimism: after the Yom Kippur War in 1974, the defeat of Iran and then Iraq from 1988 to 1991, and after the takedown of the Taliban in 2001. In each case, the Middle East had reached a critical point of danger, prompting successful American intervention, followed by diplomatic campaigns to lock in these moments of stability. The Camp David accords, for instance, normalized relations between Egypt and Israel, and Israel and Jordan later signed a peace treaty of their own.

Yet after brief periods of peace, the region has always devolved back into chaos. First came the Iranian revolution and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The Oslo accords, which set up a peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians, ultimately collapsed after 2000. The American invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks, like the Soviet one before it, stretched on for years, and it ultimately ended with the Taliban back in power. The invasion of Iraq heralded two decades of conflict, including indirect fighting with Iran and direct combat against the al-Qaeda offshoot the Islamic State, or ISIS.

This history represents decades-long American policy failures. For years, the United States has managed to secure the Middle East from hostile dominance, but containment policy there differed dramatically from that in Asia and Europe. Asian and European states eventually established stable domestic institutions and regional cooperation systems, leaving the United States to focus on organizing collective security against China and Russia. In the Middle East, however, the United States has had to intervene repeatedly in internal and regional conflicts that undercut stability and containment—even after the Soviet Union passed from the scene.

This time, though, the situation may well be different. Thanks to a year and a half of war, Iran and its proxies are very weak. New leaders are reshaping the region's power dynamics in Tehran's absence. The Trump administration thus has a chance to do what its predecessors could not and truly stabilize the region.

Since the collapse of ISIS, Iran has been the Middle East's primary generator of regional instability. Its proxy groups have unleashed attacks on Israel, U.S. forces, Arab Gulf states, and commercial ships in the Red Sea. But after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, Tehran's tools have largely evaporated. Hamas and Hezbollah were significantly degraded by Israel's offensives. Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria collapsed, and Iran's nuclear, offensive missile, and air defense systems have been demolished by Israel and the United States. Iran can still count on its influence in Iraq and on the Houthis, and it has at least the remnants of its nuclear program. But it cannot erase the reality that these setbacks are its fault, first by allowing its proxies to attack Israel and then by joining in the fight directly, in 2024. As a result, the path toward regional stability is now much smoother.

Tehran's decline has coincided with the rise of new power brokers in the Middle East. Israel, Turkey, and the Gulf states have become major international players, integrating themselves into the global economy and making internal reforms that both advance and reflect their more cosmopolitan populations and economies. Other than Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the region's leaders have not abandoned formal and informal relations with Israel over the huge civilian losses in Gaza. Arab leaders have demonstrated this new self-confidence by largely embracing the new Syrian government, choosing to look past President Ahmed al-Shara's terrorist history and coordinating with Erdogan to push an initially reticent Trump administration to embrace Damascus's leader.

For its part, the United States has been playing a far more effective regional role under Presidents Biden and Trump since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. It has neither pivoted away from the region nor dived into every social, political, and security problem. In a speech during his tour of the Middle East in May, Trump declared that the region has the ability to develop prosperity and peace on its own, with only some American support. Trump is handling military threats, if possible, via negotiations. When diplomacy is not possible, he is relying on massive, rapid military force to achieve limited, definable goals that Americans can understand—such as protecting freedom of navigation and stopping the development of an Iranian nuclear bomb. He has, in short, updated the 1980s Powell Doctrine, which held that military force should be a last resort but should be used decisively when necessary, with clear goals supporting national interests and popular support. Trump has benefited from having Steve Witkoff and Tom Barrack as envoys, a knowledgeable team that enjoys his trust. And he does not have to contend as much with Moscow, a perennial troublemaker that has been unable to support its partners in Iran and Syria. 

If this propitious moment holds, the path to lasting stability is to further contain the Iranian threat, with Washington working by, with, and through its partners. Although difficult, this outcome is not impossible. In the 1990s, following its defeat in the Iraq War, Iran was all but supine in the region. The Trump administration thus should pay attention to why Iran broke out after 2000, exacerbating mayhem through the Levant and beyond and building huge nuclear and ballistic missile programs in the face of American, Arab, and Israeli opposition.

There are two complementary explanations for what went wrong. The first is that this loose coalition focused on other, ultimately less destabilizing issues, including counterterrorism, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Arab Spring, and Israeli-Palestinian relations. The second is that regional actors disputed the nature of Iran's threat and so they attempted remedies that were both diverse and ineffective.

To handle Tehran, Washington considered both regime change and rapprochement. But ultimately reluctant to address the full dangers Iran posed head on, the United States and others turned to negotiations. They hoped that by treating Iran as normal state, they could both solve specific problems and nudge it toward a broader rapprochement with the region. The assumption here was that when met with enough understanding, dialogue, and concessions, Iran would shed its distrust and insecurity, cease its nuclear and missile projects, and stop inciting its proxy network. This group saw military responses as futile, as Iran was assumed to have escalation dominance. Consequently, Washington and an international coalition struck a nuclear deal with the country in 2015. But the agreement was only temporary, did nothing to constrain Iran's broader destabilizing behavior, and gave the regime new sources of revenue. As a result, the first Trump administration withdrew in 2018.

Developments in the Middle East since October 7 have demonstrated that Iran will not behave like a normal state, no matter what analysts may wish. Negotiations alone can slow the country down, yet they will not tame it. But decisive military action can cripple Iran's capabilities and temper its taste for conflict, as Iraq's offensives and the U.S. confrontation with Iran in the Gulf in 1988, the killing of the Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani by the United States in 2020, and, so far, the Israeli and U.S. military operations all have.

In light of this, Washington should prioritize eliminating Iran's nuclear weapons program and defeating its proxy forces. Victory could lead to comprehensive diplomatic openings or even a different Iran. But renewed dialogue or regime change should not be goals unto themselves. Instead, the United States must focus on making sure Iran retains no nuclear program that it could use to develop weapons.

To achieve this aim, Washington should apply economic and, if necessary, military pressure until Iran comes clean on its weaponization programs and abandons all or almost all uranium enrichment for perpetuity. This is the most clear-cut and important mission and one that the United States now completely owns with its decision to use force against Iran. Israel has its own existential interest here, but by necessity it must coordinate with Washington. Critics of military action are correct that the nuclear dispute with Iran will end only with negotiations. But negotiations are not an end in themselves, only a means to prevent any possibility of nuclear weaponization. And in the absence of immense pressure, it will not be achieved.

Washington must also better calibrate its policies to block Iran's proxies from returning to Gaza and Syria and to reduce Tehran's influence in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. Proxy pushback is hard, and these countries all have other issues—energy, terrorism, humanitarian relief—that vie for Washington's attention. But to truly stamp out Iran's regional influence, the United States must subordinate these concerns and focus on combating Iran's partners. Regional states, whose security has been repeatedly threatened by instability in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, should play a leading role. Yet Washington must be willing to counter Tehran's tactic of attacking via its proxies by retaliating not against them but against Iran.

Outside Iran, the United States should heed Trump's words and allow regional states to exercise their own agency, as it largely does in Asia and Europe. But there are exceptions—issues that affect overall security and in which Americans can clearly help. One is the Israeli-Palestinian impasse, which although not the core source of regional dysfunction, is significant. Until better managed, beginning with a Gaza settlement, it will be a drain on American and Israeli regional goals, including Arab-Israeli integration. The budding rivalry between the two most powerful regional states, Israel and Turkey, also bears attention. They do not have underlying security conflicts. Instead, their rivalry is partly a function of their two leaders' mutual animosity and partly the inevitable result of realpolitik. Trump, who works well with both leaders, has an interest in calming their relations.

The Middle East requires U.S. engagement in other ways, as well, including ensuring the export of hydrocarbons, maintaining global transport routes, and managing terrorism threats and refugee flows. But the United States now has a chance, in concert with the region's leaders, to more permanently stabilize the region and dramatically reduce its nonstop diplomatic crisis management and half century of nearly continuous combat operations. It should seize the moment.

Within the space of two weeks in June, the Ukrainian and Israeli armed forces executed two of the most audacious operations in recent military history. On June 1, using hundreds of short-range one-way attack drones smuggled deep into Russian territory, Ukraine was able to significantly damage or destroy at least 11 Russian strategic bombers as part of its Operation Spider's Web. Then, starting on June 13, in Operation Rising Lion, Israel used one-way attack drones that had been smuggled into Iran piece by piece to destroy Iranian air defenses, helping Israel gain full control of Iranian airspace. In each case, drones that cost no more than a few thousand dollars each were able to wipe out tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of advanced weapons systems that cannot be easily replaced.

These two stunning tactical successes herald a broader shift in the conduct of warfare. Both Ukraine and Israel also continue to rely on traditional, expensive weapons systems, and Israel's success in Iran in particular required the extensive use of crewed fighter jets. But for modern militaries, uncrewed weapons systems—increasingly enabled by artificial intelligence—are becoming critical for success on the battlefield. This should be no surprise: according to Ukrainian officials, one-way attack drones are now responsible for 70 percent of the frontline casualties in the war between Russia and Ukraine. In 2024, Eric Schmidt, the chair of the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence and Google's former CEO, argued that the rise of cheap drones has rendered older technologies such as tanks “useless” and advised the United States to “give them away” and buy drones instead. In posts on X in 2024, Elon Musk suggested that “idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35” and said that “future wars are all about drones.”

Despite this growing consensus, the U.S. Department of Defense still devotes most of its funding to expensive legacy weapons systems. Operation Midnight Hammer—the June 22 U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites involving more than 125 U.S. aircraft, including seven B-2 bombers—showed that high-cost, crewed weapons systems still have an important role on the battlefield. But as modern warfare evolves, so must the world's most powerful military. The Pentagon spends tens of billions of dollars annually sustaining and upgrading aircraft carriers, F-35s, and tanks. But it invested just $500 million in low-cost drones through the first round of its signature Replicator Initiative in 2023. Although the Replicator Initiative represents a good start, U.S. investment in the low-cost drones necessary to fight a high-intensity, modern war is still at least an order of magnitude too small.

Making the shift to a high-low mix of forces—larger numbers of inexpensive assets paired with lower numbers of expensive platforms and weapons—will not be easy. After decades of focusing nearly exclusively on building a military made up of small numbers of advanced systems, the United States must recoup lost time and invest in and develop the capacity to deploy large numbers of cheap but accurate uncrewed systems, or what could be called “precise mass” capabilities. It must also integrate this new generation of capabilities with its existing legacy systems so it can operate more effectively in creative ways. If the Pentagon does not adjust to the new realities of warfare, it will lose the ability to deter adversaries' aggression before it occurs—and perhaps the ability to win wars.

The Ukrainian and Israeli operations show that precise mass attacks can be devastatingly effective, even against sophisticated adversaries. In Operation Spider's Web, Ukraine made use of several emerging technologies. One was an open-source autopilot system that enables its drones to operate autonomously when the signal between human pilot and drone is jammed or weak. Another was an AI-enabled targeting system trained to identify Russian bombers based on three-dimensional scans of Russian and Soviet aircraft housed in Ukrainian aviation museum collections. Spider's Web's success—and Ukraine's ability to smuggle more than a hundred drones over 2,000 miles into Russian territory in preparation for the operation—reinforces a pattern evident from the outset of the conflict: expensive military platforms are more susceptible than ever to attacks by precise mass weapons, especially when they are parked out in the open in airfields or seaports.

Israel's Operation Rising Lion demonstrates the vulnerability of other expensive systems, such as air defense, to cheap, precise mass capabilities, no matter how deep into a country's territory they are. Well before the mid-June attack began, Israeli agents had smuggled drone parts into Iran, then reassembled them so that they could strike Iranian air defense systems quickly and without detection.

By using cheap uncrewed weapons systems to carry out their attacks, Ukraine and Israel also imposed asymmetric costs on their adversaries. Although the full scope of Russia's losses from Operation Spider's Web is not yet clear, Ukraine claims to have destroyed over 40 aircraft. The 11 Russian bombers that commercial satellite imagery has verified were destroyed or severely damaged were alone hundreds of times more valuable than the drones used in the attack. If Russia lost even one of each kind of the advanced aircraft Ukraine supposedly destroyed, it would have incurred serious costs: a single Russian airborne early warning and control system aircraft has an estimated price tag of $330 million, and Russia's long-range bombers cost up to $270 million. By contrast, Ukraine's quadcopters cost between $600 and $1,000 each, meaning that the total capabilities used in Spider's Web likely cost Ukraine no more than $117,000, a fraction of the cost of a single Kh-101 missile carried by one of the destroyed Russian bombers, and less than the $200,000 per-unit Javelin antitank missiles the United States has provided to Ukraine.



Although they took place in vastly different contexts, Spider's Web and Rising Lion underscore an emerging dynamic in modern warfare: militaries that rely too heavily on expensive legacy systems may struggle in longer wars of attrition, and if wealthy countries do not adapt, they will be able to afford to lose only so many of these systems before the costs become financially or politically unsustainable.

Precise mass weapons are not just cheaper than their legacy counterparts, affording even underresourced militaries the ability to compete with stronger foes. They can also be produced much faster. Ukraine is now producing millions of drones each year, whereas it will take many years for Russia to rebuild its degraded bomber fleet. Such a gap in replacement times could help level the playing field or even determine the outcome of a protracted conflict between a state that overinvests in expensive, difficult-to-replace legacy weapons systems and one that can rapidly scale production of precise mass systems.

Ukraine and Israel are not the only countries that are exploiting these advantages. Their adversaries are, too. Moscow retaliated against Spider's Web with some of the largest drone attacks of the war, nearly overwhelming Kyiv's already overstretched air defenses. Iran responded to Israel's initial attacks by launching its own waves of relatively cheap drones and missiles against Israeli targets. Although Israeli air defenses intercepted most of these attacks, the Iranian response was effective enough to prompt concerns from Israeli and U.S. officials that the Israel Defense Forces could run out of interceptors. The counterattack also forced Israel to use its fighter jets to further target Iranian launch sites over the course of a 12-day war that cost Israel hundreds of millions of dollars a day.

Even as low-cost drones become increasingly important on the battlefield, legacy capabilities, such as stealthy submarines and fighter and bomber aircraft, remain useful, especially in combination with cheap systems. For example, Israel's June 13 strikes on Iranian air defenses with one-way attack drones allowed advanced Israeli and (subsequently U.S.) aircraft and pilots to enter Iranian airspace to bomb the country's most sensitive nuclear sites and other strategic targets virtually unimpeded. Notably, Iran did not fire a single surface-to-air missile at any U.S. aircraft, and the Israeli government claims that none of its crewed aircraft were shot down.

Israel's early use of uncrewed weapons systems to weaken Iran's air defense reduced the monetary and human risks in the event that the initial attack failed and the drones were shot down. Then, once the skies were cleared, Israel used its crewed aircraft to strike targets such as the Natanz nuclear facility with an accuracy and payload beyond drones' capability. Russia has similarly combined cheap systems such as Shahed-136 drones with advanced missiles to exhaust or destroy air defenses and then strike high-value targets.

Stealthy legacy weapons systems are expensive and take a long time to produce. But they can be extremely effective. To successfully degrade the deeply buried Fordow and Natanz enrichment facilities, the United States not only had to use 14 30,000-pound massive ordnance penetrator bombs that only it possesses; it also had to dispatch seven $2 billion stealth B-2 bombers, the only aircraft in the world equipped to carry and deliver such bombs. For all their advantages, one-way attack drones simply cannot carry over 400,000 pounds of firepower.

Investing exclusively in precise mass systems would limit the targets a military is capable of destroying. In fact, Iran's military exemplifies the pitfalls of such an overreliance on low-cost weapons systems. Tehran has one of the most extensive drone programs in the world, but because it lacks a modern air force, it couldn't successfully strike well-protected Israeli military and civilian targets and force Israel to rethink its war plans.

The Allies' victory on D-Day in 1944 required the integration of air, naval, and artillery fire to soften Nazi defenses and clear the way for ground forces to seize and hold territory in Normandy. That victory required mastering the cutting edge of combined arms warfare at the time. Today, operating with a mix of low-cost and high-end systems is the new combined arms warfare.

Taken together, Spider's Web, Rising Lion, and Midnight Hammer suggest that well-resourced militaries need to invest in both types of capabilities to strengthen their deterrence. As China rapidly modernizes its military in every domain, including precise mass, the United States has invested too little in “low end” systems that can be easily acquired at scale and updated as needed. The Replicator Initiative's initial $500 million expenditure amounted to just 0.05 percent of the U.S. defense budget in fiscal year 2024.

The United States could comfortably spend ten times as much on precise mass capabilities—including on one-way attack drones and surveillance platforms—than it does by reprogramming money invested elsewhere in the Pentagon's vast budget. The Pentagon could also easily draw on the vision of uncrewed and crewed aircraft flying alongside one another and acquire large numbers of inexpensive, uncrewed, autonomous surface naval craft to add firepower and surveillance capabilities at sea. But even in this new era of precise mass, the Pentagon should continue investing in stealthy bombers and submarines that are hard to locate and destroy.

Historically, countries that fail to adapt effectively to changes in the character of war are less capable of deterring their adversaries and more likely to lose future wars. Japanese airpower destroyed supposedly impregnable British battle cruisers in the Pacific at the outset of World War II. In the Hundred Years' War, England used the longbow to end the era of the mounted knight by defeating France at the Battle of Crécy. If the United States continues to underinvest in precise mass to complement its legacy investments, it may not face such a dramatic fate. But its deterrence may deteriorate at the hands of adversaries who believe they can bleed U.S. resolve. At the same time, however, Washington should not lose sight of the high-end, stealthy platforms and weapons that are cornerstones of U.S. military power and simply chase the newest, shiniest technologies in the hopes that they represent a magic bullet. Preparing for the future of warfare has never meant abandoning the past. But it does require a nimbleness the United States has not yet shown.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How ICE raids turned parts of Los Angeles into ghost towns","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/04/us/los-angeles-ghost-towns","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            Santee Alley is known for its bargains and its crowds. Shoppers flock to the heart of Los Angeles' Fashion District to see what's on sale and get the latest styles from wholesalers and entrepreneurs, whose colorful goods spread out from the squat, industrial-looking stores. Music assails the senses, as do aromas from food vendors cooking up snacks for the visitors.
    


            Or that's what it used to be like. A visit late last month found a very different Santee Alley. Metal shutters were rolled down and padlocked shut, even on a mild Southern California day. Instead of people jostling around each other in the hubbub, the street was all but empty. Even the mannequins showing off clothes to buy were absent.
    


            Santee Alley is one of the places where immigration enforcement action by the Trump administration is having a visible and costly impact — turning parts of the US's second biggest city into ghost towns.
    


            “This is something that's unprecedented,” said Anthony Rodriguez, the president and CEO of the LA Fashion District Business Improvement District. “I personally think that the impact of this is more significant than that of the pandemic when we were in the lockdown phases.”
    


            The Fashion District, south of Downtown LA, had some of the first workplace immigration operations by federal agents early in June. CNN affiliate KTLA reported dozens of people were taken away from a clothing store. The raids, the protests that followed, the deployment of the National Guard and now a lawsuit by the Trump administration against Los Angeles for its sanctuary policy have all sent chills through this city of immigrants, documented and undocumented.
    


            “The sense of fear is overwhelming,” Rodriguez said. “This is largely an immigrant business community here, for the business owners, the consumers and the employees.”
    


            Visitors are down 45%, Rodriguez said, meaning 10,000 or 12,000 fewer shoppers a day and massive losses in revenue for what he said was one of the economic drivers of Los Angeles.
    


            Christopher Perez said his fashion store — where he said he and all his workers are citizens or in the country legally — has seen a 50% drop in sales, even though they are open.
    


            “A lot of people are scared to come out,” he said.
    


            Even a whisper of a potential operation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the neighborhood can have an impact, Rodriguez said.
    


            “Even when there isn't actual activity … someone thinks they hear something and that alone will shut down the entire area,” he said.
    


            From June 1 through June 10 this year, ICE apprehended 722 people in the Los Angeles area, according to government figures obtained and shared by the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers. More than half of the cases — 417 — were classified as immigration violations. Some 221 people — or about 30% of the 722 apprehended — were convicted criminals.
    


            That compares with 103 apprehensions in the same period in 2024, when more than two-thirds of the people rounded up were convicted criminals, the statistics show.
    


            Santee Alley and the Fashion District are heavily Latino, as is Olvera Street a few miles away, one of the oldest streets in the city and considered its birthplace. It commemorates the founding of the community named “El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula” by settlers in 1781. As the town grew, first as part of Spain, then Mexico and finally the United States, its name shrank to Los Angeles.
    


            Here too, the word on the street seems to be “fear.”
    


            “Everyone's afraid,” said Vilma Medina, who sells jewelry from her kiosk. “People who we know are citizens, they're still afraid of being picked up even though they're … carrying around their documents.”
    


            It's putting a damper on what should be a good time of year for business, she added.
    


            “We've all been waiting for this time because it's summer break, so you get the families coming in,” she said. But instead of the expected boom, there are no crowds and little trade. Medina said her sales have plummeted 80% since early June.
    


            “There'll be days I've sold $10 the whole day. That's how bad it's gotten,” she said. “And that's even with most of the kiosks not even opening, so you would think that would increase my sales.”
    


            She said she was tapping into her savings, hoping to keep going as she had through Covid and then the wildfires that devastated parts of her city earlier this year.
    


            For one 63-year-old man, keeping going means firing up his taco truck on the streets even if he has no papers to show ICE agents if they come to him.
    


            Urbano, who did not want to give his full name, told CNN he immigrated from Mexico 43 years ago and has lived undocumented in Los Angeles ever since.
    


            “We have to go out to work because if not, who's going to pay our rent? To pay our bills?” he asked. “Who's going to pay our taxes? Like I'm paying taxes. Can you imagine?”
    


            His story is far from unique, and the contributions of undocumented workers is acknowledged and applauded by state leaders. Lt. Gov Eleni Kounalakis highlighted the findings of a recent report from the Bay Area Council Economic Institute stating that California's undocumented immigrants contribute more than $23 billion in local, state and federal taxes.
    


            And if all 2.3 million undocumented people in California were deported, the report said the state's gross domestic product would decline by $278 billion.
    


            “That's 9% of our GDP. That GDP value is larger than the entire state of Nevada, than the entire state of Oregon. These are not small outputs,” said Abby Raisz, the group's research director. “These workers are really contributing to an entire economic engine that when one part of it crumbles, when we remove these workers who comprise 8% of the labor force, it has ripple effects that go way beyond just that one worker getting deported.”
    


            Rodriguez said his Fashion District organization is trying to get assistance for vendors in financial trouble, but he acknowledged some might not survive the slump.
    


            Even so, he insisted Santee Alley would endure.
    


            “This is a resilient area. We're going to bounce back from this,” he said against a backdrop of shuttered storefronts. “It'll be challenging, it'll be difficult — but we're absolutely going to persevere.”

            The soccer world is in mourning following the death of Liverpool and Portugal star Diogo Jota in a car crash in Spain early on Thursday morning. He was 28.
    


            His brother, André Silva – who was also a professional footballer – also died in the accident at the age of 25.
    


            Jota married his long-term partner, Rute Cardoso, with whom he has three children, less than two weeks before the crash.

            The incident occurred around 12:30 a.m. local time on the A-52 road in Zamora, northwestern Spain, and was caused by a “burst tire while overtaking,” the country's Guardia Civil said on Thursday. The vehicle that Jota and his brother were in left the road and subsequently caught fire, officials said. It is not known which brother was driving the car, which Spanish media reported was a Lamborghini.
    


            The authorities identified the remains based on documents recovered at the scene of the accident, as well as the car's license plate, CNN Portugal reported. Further forensic testing at a morgue in Zamora confirmed the brothers' identities, according to CNN Portugal.
    


            For investigation, the remains were moved to the nearby town of Puebla de Sanabria, a source close to the sub-delegate of the Spanish government in Zamora told CNN. The players' family was present in Puebla de Sanabria on Thursday afternoon to finalize the administrative requirements which allow the remains to be released and returned to Portugal, CNN Portugal reported.
    


            A source from the Government Sub-delegation in Zamora told PA that the crash is being investigated as “a possible speeding incident.”
    


            A wake for Jota and André Silva's family began on Friday morning at a church in the brothers' hometown of Gondomar, near Porto, the church told CNN. It added that the doors at the Igreja Martiz de Gondomar will open to the public on Friday afternoon.
    


            A funeral is set to take place on Saturday at 10 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET), the church said.
    


            Jota played an important role in the Liverpool team which lifted the Premier League trophy just over two months ago, equaling the English record of 20 top-flight titles. He featured in 26 of the club's 38 league games, scoring six goals and providing four assists. In total, he scored 65 goals across five years on Merseyside, also winning one FA Cup and two EFL Cups.
    


            Jota was part of the Portugal national team which won the Nations League in June this year, having also won the competition in 2019.
    


            André Silva played for Futebol Clube de Penafiel in the Liga Portugal 2, the country's second division. In total, he scored 12 goals and contributed 10 assists in 105 matches at full and youth level throughout his career.
    


            Tributes from the soccer world came flooding in throughout Thursday. Portuguese great Cristiano Ronaldo wrote that his compatriot's death “does not make sense,” while former Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, who signed Jota for the club in 2020, offered “prayers, thoughts and power” to Jota and André Silva's family.
    


            Current Liverpool manager Arne Slot also paid his respects, writing: “When the time is right, we will celebrate Diogo Jota, we will remember his goals and we will sing his song. For the time being, we will remember him as a unique human being and mourn his loss. He will never be forgotten.”
    


            Tributes also came in from beyond soccer, from the likes of NBA star LeBron James and the United Kingdom's Prince William, who said he was “deeply saddened.”

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.

Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.

“Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it'll be difficult to keep the doors open,” said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.

If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.

“That's a long way for an emergency,” Sherman said. “Some won't make it.”

States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid — a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans — would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.

More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.




Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, “it's going to be an emergency.” 

Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday — estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years — would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball's current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that's even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.

“An emergency means I'm 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that's a problem,” Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.

“You've got, I'm sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,” he said. “That's a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that's probably already stretched thin.”

Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.

President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs — cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.

But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.

Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.

“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,” Cochran-McClain said. “Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer — especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding — is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.”

A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky. 

The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion — nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels. 

Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat widely seen as a potential candidate for president in 2028, said the bill would close 35 hospitals in his state and pull health care coverage for 200,000 residents.

“Half of Kentucky's kids are covered under Medicaid. They lose their coverage and you are scrambling over that next prescription,” Beshear said during an appearance on MSNBC. “This is going to impact the life of every single American negatively. It is going to hammer our economy.”

House Republicans have propelled President Donald Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill to final congressional passage.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans muscled President Donald Trump's tax and spending cut bill through the House on Thursday, the final step necessary to get the bill to his desk by the GOP's self-imposed deadline of July 4th. 

At nearly 900 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. 

Democrats united against the legislation, but were powerless to stop it as long as Republicans stayed united. The Senate passed the bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote. The House passed an earlier iteration of the bill in May with just one vote to spare. It passed the final version 218-214.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill and when some of its provisions go into effect. 

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill, solidifying the tax cuts approved in Trump's first term.

It temporarily would add new tax deductions on tip, overtime and auto loans. There's also a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year, a nod to his pledge to end taxes on Social Security benefits. 

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.




A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. 

There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research. Proponents say this will boost economic growth.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, and the bill would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and food aid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for people below the poverty line. 

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program's work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. 

More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts. 

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

Republicans are looking to have states pick up some of the cost for SNAP benefits. Currently, the federal government funds all benefit costs. Under the bill, states beginning in 2028 will be required to contribute a set percentage of those costs if their payment error rate exceeds 6%. Payment errors include both underpayments and overpayments.

But the Senate bill temporarily delays the start date of that cost-sharing for states with the highest SNAP error rates. Alaska has the highest error rate in the nation at nearly 25%, according to Department of Agriculture data. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had fought for the exception. She was a decisive vote in getting the bill through the Senate.

Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering health care costs. 

Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America's wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”

A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.

Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The bill creates a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump's long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments and a new tax on remittances, or transfers of money that people in the U.S. send abroad. The tax is equal to 1% of the transfer.

A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated.

One provision bars for one year Medicaid payments to family planning providers that provide abortions, namely Planned Parenthood. 

Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for the exploration of Mars, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

The Senate overwhelmingly revolted against a proposal meant to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence. Republican governors across the country asked for the moratorium to be removed and the Senate voted to do so with a resounding 99-1 vote.

A provision was thrown in at the final hours that will provide $10 billion annually to rural hospitals for five years, or $50 billion in total. The Senate bill had originally provided $25 billion for the program, but that number was upped to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that reduced Medicaid provider taxes would hurt rural hospitals.

The amended bill also stripped out a new tax on wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.

Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost half a trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.

Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country's fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that regard. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans were employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans propelled President Donald Trump's big multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill to final passage Thursday in Congress, overcoming multiple setbacks to approve his signature second-term policy package before a Fourth of July deadline.

The tight roll call, 218-214, came at a potentially high political cost, with two Republicans joining all Democrats opposed. GOP leaders worked overnight and the president himself leaned on a handful of skeptics to drop their opposition. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York delayed voting for more than eight hours by seizing control of the floor with a record-breaking speech against the bill.

Trump celebrated his political victory in Iowa, where he attended the kickoff for a year of events marking the country's upcoming 250th anniversary. 

“I want to thank Republican congressmen and women, because what they did is incredible,” he said. The president complained that Democrats voted against the bill because “they hate Trump — but I hate them too.”

Trump said he plans to sign the legislation on Friday at the White House.

The outcome delivers a milestone for the president and for his party. It was a long-shot effort to compile a lengthy list of GOP priorities into what they called his “one big beautiful bill,” at nearly 900 pages. With Democrats unified in opposition, the bill will become a defining measure of Trump's return to the White House, aided by Republican control of Congress.




“You get tired of winning yet?” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., invoking Trump as he called the vote. 

“With one big beautiful bill we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before,” he said. 

Republicans celebrated with a rendition of the Village People's “Y.M.C.A.,” a song the president often plays at his rallies, during a ceremony afterward.

At its core, the package's priority is $4.5 trillion in tax breaks enacted in 2017 during Trump's first term that would expire if Congress failed to act, along with new ones. This includes allowing workers to deduct tips and overtime pay, and a $6,000 deduction for most older adults earning less than $75,000 a year. 

There's also a hefty investment, some $350 billion, in national security and Trump's deportation agenda and to help develop the “Golden Dome” defensive system over the U.S.

To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cutbacks to the Medicaid health care and food stamps, largely by imposing new work requirements, including for some parents and older people, and a major rollback of green energy tax credits. 

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.

“This was a generational opportunity to deliver the most comprehensive and consequential set of conservative reforms in modern history, and that's exactly what we're doing,” said Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, the House Budget Committee chairman.

Democrats unified against the bill as a tax giveaway to the rich paid for on the backs of the working class and most vulnerable in society, what they called “trickle down cruelty.” 

Jeffries began the speech at 4:53 a.m. EDT and finished at 1:37 p.m. EDT, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, a record, as he argued against what he called Trump's “big ugly bill.”

“We're better than this,” said Jeffries, who used a leader's prerogative for unlimited debate, and read letter after letter from Americans writing about their reliance of the health care programs.

“I never thought that I'd be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene,” Jeffries said. “It's a crime scene, going after the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.”

And as Democrats, he said, “We want no part of it.”

Tensions ran high. As fellow Democrats chanted Jeffries' name, a top Republican, Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, called his speech “a bunch of hogwash.”

Hauling the package through the Congress has been difficult from the start. Republicans have struggled mightily with the bill nearly every step of the way, quarreling in the House and Senate, and often succeeding only by the narrowest of margins: just one vote. 

The Senate passed the package days earlier with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie vote. The slim majority in the House left Republicans little room for defections. 

“It wasn't beautiful enough for me to vote for it,” said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. Also voting no was Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who said he was concerned about cuts to Medicaid.

Once Johnson gaveled the tally, Republicans cheered “USA!” and flashed Trump-style thumbs-up to the cameras.

Despite their discomfort with various aspects of the sprawling package, in some ways it became too big to fail — in part because Republicans found it difficult to buck Trump.

As Wednesday's stalled floor action dragged overnight, Trump railed against the delays. 

“What are the Republicans waiting for???” the president said in a midnight-hour post.

Johnson relied heavily on White House Cabinet secretaries, lawyers and others to satisfy skeptical GOP holdouts. Moderate Republicans worried about the severity of cuts while conservatives pressed for steeper reductions. Lawmakers said they were being told the administration could provide executive actions, projects or other provisions in their districts back home.

The alternative was clear. Republicans who staked out opposition to the bill, including Massie of Kentucky and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, were being warned by Trump's well-funded political operation. Tillis soon after announced he would not seek reelection. 

In many ways, the package is a repudiation of the agendas of the last two Democratic presidents, a chiseling away at the Medicaid expansion from Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, and a pullback of Joe Biden's climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act. 

Democrats have described the bill in dire terms, warning that cuts to Medicaid, which some 80 million Americans rely on, would result in lives lost. Food stamps that help feed more than 40 million people would “rip food from the mouths of hungry children, hungry veterans and hungry seniors,” Jeffries said.

Republicans say the tax breaks will prevent a tax hike on households and grow the economy. They maintain they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse. 

The Tax Policy Center, which provides nonpartisan analysis of tax and budget policy, projected the bill would result next year in a $150 tax break for the lowest quintile of Americans, a $1,750 tax cut for the middle quintile and a $10,950 tax cut for the top quintile. That's compared with what they would face if the 2017 tax cuts expired.

Rumours swirled after Reeves appeared to be in tears in the House of Commons, the day after an embarrassing reversal for the government over its plans to cut welfare spending. Many viewers observed that Reeves looked exhausted and upset as she sat behind Starmer during the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session. The Treasury said Reeves was dealing with a “personal matter.” It would not elaborate.

LONDON (AP) — The weekly session in which the British prime minister is questioned by lawmakers in Parliament can be an ordeal for the government leader. For Cabinet members, it's usually simply a matter of backing their boss.

But on Wednesday the spotlight ended up on Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves during the Prime Minister's Questions session because it became evident that she was crying as she sat beside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 

It's not known what triggered the tears, later said to have been personal. They came as Starmer sought to fend off attacks that his year-old government was losing its authority and that he was about to fire Reeves to regain the initiative.

Traders got spooked, with the interest rate charged on the U.K.'s 10-year benchmark bond in the markets up sharply, and the pound down. The moves were a sign investors had lost confidence in U.K. financial assets.

Reeves had become associated with fiscal discipline, in particular a rule of covering day-to-day government spending with tax revenue, said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank. 

“The markets are concerned that if the Chancellor goes, such fiscal discipline would follow her out of the door,” he added.




With Starmer insisting Thursday that Reeves would remain in post, the markets calmed down.

Prime Minister's Questions, or PMQs, can come as close to a gladiatorial contest as is possible in a modern legislative chamber. Very little deference is given to the man or woman holding the highest office in the land. 

The prime minister is considered the first among equals. Like all other members of Parliament, the prime minister represents one of 650 constituencies. And nowhere is that shared connection more noticeable than at noon every Wednesday in the House of Commons.

Starmer stands for half an hour every week to be quizzed by friends and foes. He may get soft balls, but there's always a potential zinger around the corner. 

The leader of the biggest opposition party, currently the Conservative Party's Kemi Badenoch, has the best chance to knock the prime minister off course. With six questions, she can lay traps and go for the jugular. 

Typically it's more theater than substance, and the weekly shouting match is consistently the most-watched parliamentary event, viewed around the world, including on C-Span in the United States.

This week's session appeared to have more at stake than usual following a chaotic run-up to a welfare reform bill. With scores of Labour lawmakers opposed, Starmer was forced to scrap key planks of the bill — at a cost, politically and economically.

For a prime minister, with one of the biggest majorities in history, it was a sign of weakness. 

Many Labour MPs blame Reeves, for her rigid adherence to her budget rules. 

As usual, Starmer was flanked to his left by Reeves, who didn't look her usual self, clearly bloated around the eyes. 

Badenoch showed little mercy, describing Reeves as “absolutely miserable” and a “human shield” for Starmer. She asked Starmer whether he could repeat a pledge that Reeves would stay in her post until the general election, which has to take place by the middle of 2029. 

While praising Reeves' handling of the economy, Starmer didn't give that assurance, and it was around this point that Reeves wiped away a tear.

“How awful for the Chancellor that he couldn't confirm that she would stay in place,” Badenoch responded.

Starmer's Downing Street operation faced questions over Reeves' teary appearance. Could it have been hay fever? Had Starmer told Reeves she would be fired for the government's recent woes, which has seen Labour's approval ratings slide? 

Starmer's press spokesman said it was a “personal matter,” insisted Reeves was “going nowhere” and had the prime minister's “full backing.” 

Later, Starmer told the BBC that Reeves would be Chancellor for a “very long time” and that it was “absolutely wrong” to suggest her distress was related to the welfare U-turn.

Images of Reeves' agitated state were emblazoned across newspapers and remained a key item on the news agenda. 

Starmer repeated on Thursday that Reeves would remain Chancellor “for years to come” and sought to explain why he hadn't comforted Reeves during PMQs.

“In PMQs, it is bang, bang, bang,” he said at an event where he and Reeves hugged. “That's what it was yesterday and therefore I was probably the last to appreciate anything going on in the chamber.”

Reeves appeared more like her usual self.

NRCC Chairman Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., discusses Republicans' midterm strategy as Democrats' favorability hits an all-time low.

FIRST ON FOX — The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday launched a new campaign accusing President Donald Trump of ""killing the American dream""through price hikes, market volatility and the GOP-backed megabill passed by Congress. 

Party officials plan to lean heavily on the message in the months ahead as they work to broaden their appeal and regain momentum ahead of the 2026 midterms.

The DNC's messaging campaign, previewed exclusively to Fox News Digital, seeks to tie Trump directly to recent price hikes on consumer goods, such as groceries and baby food, as well as cost of living increases and insurance costs, which they argue will soar under the so-called ""big beautiful bill.""

""America should be the land of opportunity but under Donald Trump, the American dream is dying,"" they said Friday in an email previewed by Fox News.

The campaign will feature new memos and ads under the broader mantle of the ""Trump killing the American dream"" campaign, which is slated to run through December.

The initiative is part of the DNC's broader upheaval of its messaging in the wake of the 2024 elections, which saw longtime Democrat voting blocs, including some minority voters and young people, shift towards Trump and the Republican Party. 

This includes Hispanic voters, whose support for Trump nearly broke even with former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, according to exit poll data, as well as larger shares of registered Independent voters and young voters. 

The new messaging strategy unveiled Friday focuses largely on what Democrats argue is the daylight between Trump's campaign trail promises, contrasting his pledge to return America to a ""golden age,"" with the situation for many working-class Americans.

TRUMP'S ULTIMATUM TO FEDERAL WORKERS: RETURN TO OFFICE 'OR BE TERMINATED'

It highlights expected cuts to Medicaid, food assistance programs and other community-based housing affordability programs that stand to be reduced, if not altogether eliminated, by the Republican spending bill.

""After ramming Trump's [budget bill] through Congress, one thing is abundantly clear: Republicans own this mess, and it's an albatross around their necks heading into the midterms,"" DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital. 

""This is the least popular legislation in modern history, and the more voters learn about it the more they hate it. That's a clear directive for Democrats — we're going to make sure every single voter knows who is responsible for taking away their healthcare, food, hospitals, and nursing homes."" 

That message is expected to be a central Democratic theme through 2026. Party officials say they're now better positioned to make their case to voters — and that the American people, in return, are more willing to listen to them.

The launch comes on the heels of the party's ""Organizing Summer"" campaign, aimed at boosting Democratic operations in battleground states. The DNC has ramped up state-level funding, voter registration and volunteer recruitment — drawing more than 15,000 volunteers to date.

Officials say they will continue to hammer their message hard in the run-up to 2026, including in 35 Republican-held congressional seats the Democratic Party's House campaign arm has identified as ""districts in play"" in the 2026 election cycle, or areas where they could find a path to winning back the House majority.

Friday's launch is not the first time the DNC has tried to tie Trump to economic pain — but past efforts have had limited success. It remains unclear whether this latest push will resonate with Independents and Republicans, who delivered sweeping victories for Trump and the GOP in 2024, especially as the economy shows signs of resilience. Just Thursday, the Labor Department reported the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June — blowing past expectations — while unemployment ticked down to 4.1%.

However, DNC officials insist the economic situation has changed as a result of tariff threats, volatility and unpopular legislation they see as a new opportunity to break through to voters who may have been less receptive in previous elections. 

They point to a Congressional Budget Office analysis which estimates the spending bill backed by Trump will increase federal deficits by roughly $2.4 trillion over 10 years and have a knock-down impact on working-class Americans, who could see a spike in insurance costs, housing prices, and cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and education programs, including Pell grants. They also cite projections that the bill could eliminate 1.2 million jobs by 2029.

""Let's be clear: The Trump administration has taken aim at the very things that make America the greatest country in the world,"" party officials said. 

""Americans are overwhelmingly rejecting his agenda, rife with buyers' remorse. Democrats are standing with the American people, organizing everywhere, and fighting back — in Congress, in the courts, and on the ground in states across the country.""

Ben Shelton was serving for the match at the Wimbledon Championships on Thursday, but he had to wait until the next day to do so.

That's because his second-round bout against Rinky Hijikata was suspended due to darkness.

Shelton was leading, 6-2, 7-5, 5-4, when the match was called, and he clearly was not happy - play was suspended at 9:29 p.m. local time, and both players had made arguments to suspend play earlier in the match.

Shelton approached the umpire and had to be held back by another official to calm him down.

Well, Shelton and Hijikata returned to the court early Friday morning to finish the match - and it took one minute to do so, as Shelton advanced to the third round.

""It was difficult. At that point, we kind of knew that we were playing in conditions that weren't ideal for tennis. For me, it was like, ‘what's one more game at that point?' Shelton said after the match. ""I understand the tournament's gotta make whatever decisions they make, and the players gotta live with that. For me, I live with it. I came out today, and I did what I do.

""I hadn't gotten broken the whole match. I haven't gotten broken since my first set in my first round, and I felt confident coming out here having one service game to finish it.""

Shelton said he was unsure of his plans for the day, debating whether he should practice, considering Friday was originally scheduled to be an off day for the 10th-ranked player in the world.

""It's different. I warmed up for 30 minutes, then spent one minute on the court. A lot more time was spent in the preparation than the actual match,"" he said.

'The Hannah Cox Show' host Hannah Cox joins 'Fox & Friends First' to break down how the 'big, beautiful bill' impacts Americans and discusses the state of the economy.

President Donald Trump says that his sweeping domestic policy bill that squeaked through both houses of Congress this week along near-party-line votes is ""very popular"" with Americans.

Asked about a slew of national polls conducted last month which indicated that most Americans were far from thrilled with the massive spending and tax cut bill, the president told reporters early Friday morning, ""I think it's very popular. It does many things, but one of them is the biggest tax cuts in our country's history. And that alone makes it very popular.""

The president spoke as he returned home from a July 4th-eve event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds where he headlined a kickoff celebration of next year's 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ON WAY TO WHITE HOUSE AFTER NARROWLY PASSING FINAL HURDLE IN CONGRESS

""There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago,"" Trump told the large crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, as he referred to the move by House Republicans in a 218-214 vote hours earlier to lift the so-called ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" to final congressional passage.

Earlier in the week, Vice President JD Vance broke a tie in the Senate to pass the measure 51-50.

WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Trump noted that ""not one Democrat voted"" for the bill in either chamber of Congress, adding that ""they hate Trump. But I hate them too.""

The president had repeatedly insisted to the Republicans who control Congress that the bill reach his desk by July 4th, and Trump got his way. He's expected to sign the measure at the White House at 5pm ET.

The bill is stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. 

It includes extending his signature 2017 tax cuts and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay. 

By making his first-term tax rates permanent - they were set to expire later this year - the bill will cut taxes by nearly $4.4 trillion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 

HOW MUCH THE ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL CUT YOUR TAXES

The measure also provides billions for border security and codifies the president's controversial immigration crackdown.

As Democrats criticize the bill, they're highlighting the GOP's restructuring of Medicaid — the nearly 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans. Additionally, Senate Republicans increased cuts to Medicaid over what the House initially passed in late May.

The changes to Medicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage.

Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Commnitte, called the measure ""one of the worst bills in our nation's history."" 

""Today, Donald Trump and the Republican party sent a message to America: if you are not a billionaire, we don't give a damn about you,"" Martin argued.

Overall, the $3.4 trillion legislative package is projected to surge the national debt by $4 trillion over the next decade.

By a 21-point margin, voters questioned in the most recent Fox News national poll opposed the bill (38% favored vs. 59% opposed).

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING 

The bill was also underwater in other national surveys conducted last month by the Washington Post (minus 19 points), Pew Research (minus 20 points) and Quinnipiac University (minus 26 points).

About half of respondents questioned in the Fox News poll said the bill would hurt their family (49%), while one quarter thought it would help (23%), and another quarter didn't think it would make a difference (26%).

Sixty percent felt they had a good understanding of what is in the measure, formally known as the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, and while those voters were more likely to favor the legislation than those who are unfamiliar with it, more still think it will hurt rather than help their family (45% vs. 34%).

The latest surveys all indicated a wide partisan divide over the measure.

According to the Fox News poll, which was conducted June 13-16, nearly three-quarters of Republicans (73%) favored the bill, while nearly nine in ten Democrats (89%) and nearly three-quarters of independents (73%) opposed the measure.

But Republicans are shining a spotlight on a poll conducted by a GOP-aligned public policy group that indicates strong support for the bill due to the tax cut provisions.

A release earlier this week from the group, One Nation, argued that ""polling shows that the public supports the Republican plan to cut taxes for families, eliminate taxes on Social Security, overtime, and tips, and reign in waste and abuse in the federal budget.""

Competitive eater Patrick 'Deep Dish' Bertoletti joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his preparation for this year's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and defending his title against 16-time winner Joey Chestnut.

The 2025 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest will feature the legendary competitive eater Joey Chestnut back on the Coney Island boardwalk after missing the 2024 competition.

As a result, many believe he will reclaim his belt. 

Chestnut's partnership with Impossible Foods caused an issue last year, and it ended up keeping him out of the competition. This year, though, Chestnut announced that he and the organizers had found common ground on sponsorships.

""I'm thrilled to be returning to the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest. This event means the world to me. It's a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life,"" Chestnut wrote on X.

""While I have and continue to partner with a variety of companies, including some in the plant-based space, those relationships were never a conflict with my love for hot dogs. To be clear: Nathan's is the only hot dog company I've ever worked with.

""I respect that there were differences in interpretation, but I'm grateful we've been able to find common ground. I'm excited to be back on the Coney Island stage, doing what I live to do, and celebrating the Fourth of July with hot dogs in my hands! Stay hungry!""

Chestnut is hungry to be a champion again, and sportsbooks don't have anyone remotely close to beating him. 

Last year's winner, Patrick Bertoletti, who ate 58 hot dogs in 10 minutes, has big odds to defeat Chestnut and the rest of the field. 

If he does win, Chestnut would extend his record for the famous contest to 17 yellow belts.

Although he didn't participate in last year's competition, Chestnut did go up against another legendary competitive eater, Takeru Kobayashi, in a Netflix special event called ""Unfinished Beef."" He ate 83 hot dogs, which marked the most eaten in the history of competitive eating without being dunked in water. 

On the women's side, Miki Sudo, who has won three times in a row now, is expected to get her 11th pink belt in Coney Island for her career. Her biggest competition will be Domenica Dee and Michelle Lesco, the latter of whom snapped Sudo's win streak in 2021. 

For those unaware of Nathan's rules, the time limit is just 10 minutes in both the men's and women's contests.

The contestant who not only consumes, but also keeps down, the most hot dogs and buns within the 10-minute limit is determined the winner. 

In the rare event a tie occurs, the contest will go to an untimed ""eat-off,"" where the first contestant to put down a specific number of hot dogs, with the buns, wins.

The last time there was an eat-off was 2008, where Chestnut won by eating five hot dogs and buns in 50 seconds. 

The women's contest will occur first at 10:45 a.m. ET before the men take the stage at noon on July 4.

Mark Murphy, travel expert at Murphy Travels, shares advice for getting the most out of travel plans during the Fourth of July weekend.

This is a story about America. Our country.

I went to the opening day of a soccer game in my hometown of San Diego.

It was the first game in the history of our club—the San Diego Football Club—and there was a lot of hype.

MILITARY PARADE DRAWS PATRIOTIC AMERICANS FROM NEAR AND FAR: 'NO BETTER TIME TO COME TO DC'

It was a completely sold-out game.

It was being reported by the local news and all over social media.

It was a big deal. The people of San Diego were excited for our new professional soccer team.

They had a lot of ceremonial-type activities before the game. Local politicians were there, there was a ribbon cutting, various dedications, and all the pomp and circumstance of a momentous occasion.

When the players took the field, the crowd was fully engaged.

Finally—just prior to the game—it was time for our great American tradition before a sporting event: the singing of our national anthem.

Now, this is a song that often brings tears to my eyes as I remember the hundreds of thousands of men and women throughout our history who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our nation. And some of those countless heroes were my friends, my brothers that I lost—men who died defending our flag and our ideals.

So, as I thought about those heroes, I wondered who was going to have the solemn and sacred duty of performing The Star Spangled Banner.

I thought maybe they selected a local celebrity for the task, as there are plenty of talented musicians in San Diego who could do this powerful song justice.

Or perhaps they would have some distinguished school band or a proud church choir belt out the moving song that explains our tumultuous start as republic, captures the spirit of our flag and our people, and recognizes the sacrifice of our military servicemembers.

Then I had the hopeful idea that it might be the Navy or Marine Corps band.

The Navy and The Marine Corps are deeply rooted in San Diego and millions of Sailors and Marines have deployed from San Diego's shores to face our nation's enemies.

I knew it would be fitting to see our flag honored by active-duty troops in uniform.

Finally, the announcer invited the crowd to stand for the singing of the national anthem and I rose to my feet with 35,000 other people. Then, to my surprise, the announcer explained that the national anthem would be performed by us—the crowd. It would be a sing-a-long.

A sing-a-long?

I was shocked and disappointed and somewhat beside myself. What were they thinking?

Here we were, opening day, a historic moment—and we were going to do a sing-a-long?

Now, I'm no Pavarotti or Elvis Presley or Robert Plant, but I know how to sing. I sang in bands since I was a kid and I know that singing is not easy—in fact—singing is very difficult. It is challenging to stay in tune and tough to get the right timing and to hit the right notes.

And to think that 35,000 people were going to be able to pull this off? I knew that people would sing too loud or too quiet. They would sing too high or too low. Some people wouldn't even sing at all—and many that would sing are completely tone-deaf.

So I didn't think there was a chance this crowd would be able to hit the right rhythm and the right pitch and achieve the proper level of clarity.

And I was right—at least for a moment.

As the giant jumbotron began to scroll the lyrics and people began to sing, it was just what I expected: some voices were too high, some too low, some too quiet, some too loud. Some were off pitch and some completely off tempo.

But quickly, after a few bars, the voices started to blend together.

The low voices were balanced by the high ones. The quiet voices were bolstered by the loud ones. Out-of-tune notes were leveled out by people singing perfectly on pitch.

And, as I sang myself, I also heard it.

I heard this mass of people, people from every background, people of every size, shape, color, and creed, people with a wide variety of contrasting and conflicting voices.

As I heard them sing—the sum of their voices—harmonized and it sounded better than I had ever imagined it could.

That group of 35,000 individuals singing together was as good as I had ever heard that song.

Now: it was not perfect—but those imperfections gave it soul. They made the song human.

Every individual, doing their share, gave our national anthem a unique but unified identity.

An identity that—though not perfect—was absolutely amazing.

Just like this great country.

We have the voices of many people—some quiet, some loud.

Some rich, some poor.

Some left, some right, some center.

Some angry, some happy.

Some working hard and some hardly working.

Some concerned—some care-free.

We are all different.

Some people like country, some heavy metal, and some soul…

Some like hip hop, some hardcore punk, and some rock and roll.

We are all individuals…

All free to sing our tune the way we want.

But together—even with all those differences—we are more alike than not.

We are determined. We are tough. We are individualistic and optimistic. We will not be controlled and we will fight and die if necessary for our destiny—for our freedom.

You see: We are all American. This is our country.

And we are not perfect—and neither is America.

We hit some bad notes. Our pitch is sometimes too high, and sometimes too low. Our timing is not always perfect and our rhythm is sometimes off.

But—together—bonded only by the freedom our forefathers fought for, we sing an amazing song.

And America is absolutely amazing too.

God bless all you Americans.

Sing loud and sing proud:

This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Have a Happy Fourth of July.

And God bless America.

Logan and Jake Paul discuss why they continue to be in front of the cameras leading up to the debut of their reality show.

Jake Paul took a second win over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. this week.

Paul earned an official WBA cruiserweight ranking after defeating the boxing legend's son over the weekend in a unanimous decision - on Wednesday. Just four days after the bout, Chavez Jr. was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Paul, as usual, talked plenty of trash ahead of the fight, and after the news of the arrest circulated, Paul dropped the mic one final time on Chavez Jr.

After the news went around, Paul took to X to post an American flag emoji.

Paul's business partner, Valuable Promotions co-founder Nakisa Bidarian, said in an interview with Fox News Digital shortly after Chavez Jr.'s arrest that the team knew ""zero"" about Chavez Jr.'s situation prior to his arrest.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the arrest on Thursday, noting Chavez Jr. was being processed for ""expedited removal from the United States.""

Chavez Jr. was arrested in Los Angeles in January 2024 and later convicted of possession of an assault weapon, and manufacturing or importing a short-barreled rifle, according to the statement. He had a prior U.S. criminal conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2012.

He also has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for his alleged involvement with the Sinaloa Cartel — trafficking firearms, ammunition and explosives, according to DHS officials.

JAKE PAUL NOW ELIGIBLE FOR CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT AS HE OFFICIALLY ENTERS WBA CRUISERWEIGHT RANKINGS

While Chavez Jr. entered the U.S. legally in August 2023 on a B2 tourist visa, it expired in February 2024. 

In April 2024, he filed an application for Lawful Permanent Resident status. 

However, his application was based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen who is connected to the Sinaloa cartel through a prior relationship with the now-deceased son of the infamous cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to the statement.

In December 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services made a referral to ICE that Chavez Jr. was considered ""an egregious public safety threat."" 

DHS said Chavez Jr. reentered the country in January through the San Ysidro port of entry. However, after ""multiple fraudulent statements on his application to become a Lawful Permanent Resident,"" he was deemed to be in the country illegally and removable on June 27.

Chavez is a former WBC middleweight champion and the son of the boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez, who held five different world titles in four different weight classes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Congress tries to ban insider trading by its members","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/premium/3456228/congress-insider-trading-attempt-ban-members/","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 10:10:00 GMT","

Media stories erupted recently about Rep. Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) financial dealings.

“Stock market watchdog claims Nancy Pelosi raked in $4.7M in a single day of trading,” reads one headline about the 38-year House member from San Francisco, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011 and 2019 to 2023.

“Nancy Pelosi outperforms major hedge funds with jaw-dropping gains in 2024, leaves Wall Street pros in the dust,” another report exclaimed.

This was not the first such press scrutiny. The California Democrat's high-performing portfolio has long been the subject of critical media stories. Last year, for example, financial disclosures revealed the California Democrat had sold at least $500,000 in Visa stock a few months before the Justice Department announced an antitrust investigation of the firm. Three years ago, tech entrepreneur Chris Josephs built the Pelosi Stock Tracker, which displays her assets and their impressive performance.

As in the past, a spokesperson told the press that Pelosi “does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.” The assets are in an account held by her husband, Paul Pelosi, who is a very experienced investor and financier.

To be sure, the former speaker is not the only public official whose financial dealings have raised eyebrows. Nor are Democrats the only ones who are suspected of wheeling and dealing on Capitol Hill.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) sold Apple stock shortly before President Donald Trump announced tariffs that drove down the share prices. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) purchased a bevy of technology stocks shortly before Trump paused some tariffs — she told the press there was no problem as her investments are managed by an outside adviser.

These are among many people in Congress who often see gains in their stock portfolio that outpace the growth of the Standard & Poor 500.

Charges of legislative graft are as old as the republic itself. Thomas Jefferson and his co-partisans accused Alexander Hamilton and his supporters of colluding with stock-jobbers to line their pockets. In the 1870s, legislators were gifted artificially low-priced railroad stock options to encourage them to vote for legislation favorable to the building of a transcontinental rail system.

Nobody would know about the stock transactions of Pelosi, Greene, and Tuberville if it were not for the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, enacted in 2012. It declared that legislators and top executive branch officials were covered by existing laws forbidding insider trading, or the purchasing or selling of an asset based upon nonpublic knowledge. The STOCK Act also required the timely disclosure of legislators' stock purchases and sales.

The frequent media stories about legislators' well-timed stock trades over the past several years have fomented a slew of bills to toughen up the STOCK Act and other rules forbidding the co-mingling of officials' powers and personal wealth.

For example, Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) reintroduced the Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust in Congress Act, which would force legislators to put their investments in blind trusts and have no visibility into any trades. Across the Capitol, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities Act, which would forbid legislators and their spouses from holding, purchasing, or selling individual stocks. They could continue to invest in mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and U.S. Treasury bonds. Supporters for these bills range from self-professed socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to the very conservative Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) and the House Freedom Caucus.

Groups outside Congress are also clamoring for additional curbs. Richard Eidlin, the policy director of Business for America, a group that educates and advocates on a variety of civic matters, told the Washington Examiner, “This type of financial activity by members of Congress … making financial decisions while also acting as regulators and policymakers presents tremendous conflicts of interest.” When public officials profit on inside information gleaned from their positions, Eidlin added, “it depreciates the public's trust in the political system” and “challenges the notion of free and fair markets.” BFA is one of nearly a dozen groups that recently signed a letter asking Congress to tighten the laws on stock trading.

Whether legislators will have the chance to vote for any of these bills is unclear. Neither chamber so far has agreed to vote on any particular bill. Similar legislation introduced in the two previous Congresses died from inaction.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), perhaps seeing limited support within his caucus, has not taken a position. “We'll see how this conversation evolves,” he said. “I mean, we get some members up here on both sides, out both sides of the Capitol, as you know, who would like more strict limitations on that. But there are some pretty good, I would say, protections in place already.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), for his part, says he supports a ban on stock trading.

“I'm in favor of that because I don't think we should have any appearance of impropriety here,” Johnson told reporters on May 14.

SUPREME COURT MAKES TRUMP WAIT ON KEY DECISIONS

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has also voiced support, and President Donald Trump has said he would sign such a bill. “Absolutely,” he told the press.

“I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be OK with it,” Trump said in late April. “If they send that to me, I would do it.”

That's a nice business you've got there.

Theoretically, it's illegal for the president to accept or solicit bribes. The plain language of the statute is perfectly clear: It is a crime for a public official to seek or receive “anything of value” in return for “being influenced in the performance of any official act.” The prohibition applies whether the public official seeks or receives the bribe personally or on behalf of “any other person or entity.”

As I said: theoretically. On Tuesday, the media-and-entertainment conglomerate Paramount announced a $16 million payment to President Donald Trump's future presidential library. The payment settled a lawsuit that Trump had filed against the Paramount-owned broadcaster CBS because he was unhappy with the way the network had edited an election-season interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump's lawsuit was about as meritless as a lawsuit can be, for reasons I'll explain shortly. If CBS were a freestanding news organization, it would have fought the case and won. But like the Disney-owned network ABC, which also paid off Trump for an almost equally frivolous lawsuit, CBS belongs to a parent corporation with regulatory business before Trump-appointed agencies. Paramount is pursuing an $8 billion merger that requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission. In November 2024, then-incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr warned that merger approval would depend on satisfying Trump's claims against CBS. Carr told the Fox News interviewer Dana Perino, “I'm pretty confident that that news-distortion complaint over the 60 Minutes transcript is something that is likely to arise in the context of the FCC review of that transaction.”

“News-distortion complaint?” What's that? Nearly a century ago, in 1927, Congress empowered a new Federal Radio Commission to police the accuracy of news broadcasts. In the preceding decades, the airwaves had become a chaos of transmissions interfering with one another. The right to use any particular frequency was a valuable concession from the federal government, the owner on the public's behalf of the nation's airwaves. Congress felt that it could impose conditions in return for such concessions. One condition was a duty to meet public-interest standards in broadcast content, which included giving equal time to opposing political candidates in an election. In 1934, the Federal Radio Commission evolved into the Federal Communications Commission. As television technology spread, so did the FCC's ambition to police the new medium, resulting in 1949 with its power to compel the fairness doctrine on “all discussion of issues of importance to the public.”

The fact that opinions can differ about what counts as “accuracy” and what counts as “distortion” rapidly became obvious. Government efforts to police the boundary between fair reporting and unfair scurrility create conflicts with First Amendment rights. For print media, the courts have been very clear: Editing, even arguably unfair editing, is protected free speech, subject only to the laws of defamation. In the 1960s and '70s, the FCC groped its way toward a similar rule for broadcast media. Interestingly, some of the crucial milestones involved CBS News.

In the early days of color television, CBS News pioneered the use of aggressive editing to tell powerful stories in dramatic ways. In 1971, for example, CBS broadcast a documentary, The Selling of the Pentagon, that accused the Department of Defense of manipulating public opinion. To amplify the argument, the producers cut and reassembled questions and answers. Some of the affected individuals filed complaints against CBS, and the matter was taken up by members of Congress. Yet the FCC declined to get involved in the case on free-speech grounds.

Read: Trump targets Google after Meta and X payouts

Before the end of the first Nixon administration, the FCC had generated a series of precedents that more or less nullified the agency's Calvin Coolidge–era status as a monitor of broadcast accuracy and a potential censor. The whole issue soon became moot, because the FCC had no jurisdiction over cable television or the internet. As Americans drew more of their information from sources outside the FCC's domain, the very idea of content regulation by the agency came to seem absurd to all parties, including the FCC itself. Who would think of invoking a doctrine that originated in 1927 to police speech in the 21st century?

Then came Trump and the loyalty-above-law appointees of his second term. Evident from the Trump legal filing against CBS is that not even the president's own lawyers took his complaint seriously. Three whopping clues give away the game about the filing's farcicality.

The first is where the lawsuit was brought: the Amarillo division of the U.S. district court for the northern district of Texas. CBS is not domiciled in Amarillo. Neither is Trump or Harris or any person significantly connected with the 60 Minutes segment. What is located in Amarillo is America's premier pick for right-wing forum-shopping, a practice criticized not only by liberal counterparties but also, at least implicitly, by The Wall Street Journal and National Review. Amarillo is the court where a partisan-conservative plaintiff goes with a case that would be summarily thrown out elsewhere.

The next clue is the language of the filing, which reads like direct dictation from the president:

As President Trump stated, and as made crystal clear in the video he referenced and attached, “A giant Fake News Scam by 60 Minutes & CBS. Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better. A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal. TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE. Election interference. She is a Moron, and the Fake News Media wants to hide that fact. AN UNPRECEDENTED SCANDAL!!! The Dems got them to do this and should be forced to concede the election? WOW!” See President Donald J. Trump, TRUTH SOCIAL (Oct. 10, 2024).

And so on, through 65 paragraphs of irrelevant name-calling and Trump-quoting obsequiousness.

The final clue lies in the carelessness of the complaint's quoted sources, two of which actually argue against the Trump claim. A cited law-review article concluded that “the reinvented news distortion doctrine would undermine the very democratic norms marshaled in its defense.” Similarly, an FCC decision referenced found against taking action (in another case involving CBS)—explicitly on free-speech grounds: “In this democracy, no government agency can authenticate the news, or should try to do so.”

One has to wonder whether Trump's lawyers even read the texts they cited. The complaint's flimsy legal basis—including Trump's claim of standing under a Texas consumer-protection law—indicates its pure-nuisance quality. And yet, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a case that it could almost certainly have won for a fraction of the price.

U.S. law forbids both accepting a bribe and soliciting a bribe, yet they're not exactly the same offense. There is an important difference between a police officer who takes money to let a criminal escape and a police officer who uses the threat of arrest to extort money from an innocent citizen. Paramount did not come up with the idea to pay Trump $16 million; Trump decided to squeeze Paramount for the money. What's going on here is extortion—and it does not get any less extortionate for being laundered through Trump's hypothetical future library. A systematic pattern has emerged: shakedowns of law firms, business corporations, and media companies for the enrichment of Trump, his family, and his political allies. Every time targets yield, they create an incentive for Trump to repeat the shakedown on another victim.

This time, it was Paramount's turn. Who will be the next target of an administration that governs by mafia methods?","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The U.S. Is Switching Sides","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/putin-trump-russia-ukraine/683414/","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Donald Trump is giving Vladimir Putin every incentive to keep killing Ukrainians.

Updated at 7:20 a.m. ET on July 4, 2025

The American president wrote, “Vladimir, STOP!” on his Truth Social account in April, but the Russian president did not halt his offensive in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian president called for an unconditional cease-fire in May, but the Russians did not agree to stop attacking Ukrainian civilians from the air. Donald Trump repeatedly promised, during his campaign, that he would end the war “in one day,” but the war is not over. He spoke to Vladimir Putin yesterday, and Putin responded with more drones and missiles than ever before. This morning, parts of Kyiv are burning.

The invasion of Ukraine does not merely continue. It accelerates. Almost every night, the Russians destroy more of Ukraine from the air: apartment buildings, factories, infrastructure, and people. On the ground, Ukraine's top commander has said that the Russians are preparing a new summer offensive, with 695,000 troops spread across the front line.

Russian soldiers also continue to be wounded or killed at extraordinary rates, with between 35,000 and 45,000 casualties every month, while billions of dollars' worth of Russian equipment are destroyed every week by Ukrainian drones. The Russian economy suffers from high inflation and is heading for a recession. But Putin is not looking for a cease-fire, and he does not want to negotiate. Why? Because he believes that he can win. Thanks to the actions of the U.S. government, he still thinks that he can conquer all of Ukraine.

Putin sees what everyone else sees: Slowly, the U.S. is switching sides. True, Trump occasionally berates Putin, or makes sympathetic noises toward Ukrainians, as he did last week when he seemed to express interest in a Ukrainian journalist who said that her husband was in the military. Trump also appeared to enjoy being flattered at the NATO summit, where European leaders made a decision, hailed as historic, to further raise defense spending. But thanks to quieter decisions by members of his own administration, people whom he has appointed, the American realignment with Russia and against Ukraine and Europe is gathering pace—not merely in rhetoric but in reality.

Read: Putin isn't actually enjoying this

Just this week, in the middle of the worst aerial-bombing campaign since the war began, the Trump administration confirmed that a large shipment of weapons, which had already been funded by the Biden administration, will not be sent to Ukraine. The weapons, some of which are already in Poland, include artillery shells, missiles, rockets, and, most important, interceptors for Patriot air-defense systems, the ammunition that Ukrainians need to protect civilians from missile attacks. Trump had suggested that he would supply Ukraine with more Patriot ammunition, which is an American product. “We're going to see if we can make some available,” he said after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. But what he says and what his administration actually does are very different.

Pentagon spokespeople have explained that this abrupt change was made because American stockpiles are insufficient, an excuse disputed both by former Biden-administration officials and by independent policy analysts. But whether true or false, this reasoning doesn't matter to the Russians, who have already interpreted this change as a clear signal that American support for Ukraine is ending: “The fewer the number of weapons that are delivered to Ukraine, the closer the end of the special military operation,” the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. To be clear, by “the end of the special military operation,” he means the defeat of Ukraine.

At the same time, and with much less publicity, the U.S. is essentially lifting sanctions on Russia. No such formal announcement has been made. But the maintenance of sanctions requires constant shifts and adjustments, as Russian companies and other entities change suppliers and tactics in order to acquire sanctioned products. During the Biden administration, I spoke several times with officials who followed these changes closely, and who repeatedly issued new sanctions in order to counter them. As The New York Times has reported, the Trump administration has stopped following these shifts and stopped imposing new sanctions altogether. This, the Times writes, allows “new dummy companies to funnel funds and critical components to Russia, including computer chips and military equipment.”

In addition to taking Russia's side in the kinetic war and the economic war, the U.S. is realigning its position in the narrative war, too. During the Biden administration, the State Department's Global Engagement Center regularly identified Russian disinformation operations around the world—exposing misleading websites or campaigns secretly run or directed by Russian operatives in Latin America and Africa, as well as in Europe. Trump appointees have not only dissolved the center; they also baselessly and bizarrely accused it of somehow harming American conservatives, even of having “actively silenced and censored the voices of Americans,” although the GEC had no operations inside the U.S.

At the same time, cuts to USAID and other programs have abruptly reduced funding for some independent media and Russian-opposition media. The planned cuts to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, if not stopped by the courts, will destroy one of the few outside sources of information that reaches Russians with real news about the war. Should all of these changes become permanent, the U.S. will no longer have any tools available to communicate with the Russian public or counter Russian propaganda, either inside Russia or around the world.

Listen: Trump's betrayal of Ukraine

Inside the United States, Russian propaganda is most loudly and effectively promoted by appointees of the U.S. president. Steve Witkoff, the real-estate developer who became Trump's main negotiator with Russia despite having no knowledge of Russian history or politics, regularly echoes false Russian talking points and propaganda. He has repeated Putin's view, which he may have heard from the Russian president himself, that “Ukraine is just a false country, that they just patched together in this sort of mosaic, these regions.” Witkoff has also seemed to agree with Putin that Ukrainian territories that voted for independence from Moscow in 1991 are somehow “Russian.”

By accepting disputed claims as fact, Witkoff is also helping Putin continue his war. In order to keep Russians onboard, to create divisions among Ukraine's allies, and maybe even to build doubts inside Ukraine itself, Putin needs to portray the Ukrainian cause as hopeless and to describe the Ukrainian “demands” as unreasonable. He has to hide the most basic facts about this war: that he began it, that he has killed hundreds of thousands of people in pursuit of it, and that his goal, again, is to destroy or decapitate all of Ukraine. Witkoff helps make these falsehoods easier to sustain, in Russia, in the U.S., and in Europe.

Add all of these things together, and they are something more than just a pattern. They are a set of incentives that help persuade Putin to keep fighting. Sanctions are disappearing, weapons are diminishing, counterpropaganda is harder to hear. All of that will encourage Putin to go further—not just to try to defeat Ukraine but to divide Europe, mortally damage NATO, and reduce the power and influence of the United States around the world.

Europe, Canada, and most of the rest of the democratic world will continue to back Ukraine. As I have written before, Ukrainians will continue to innovate, to build new kinds of automated weapons, new drones, new software. They will continue to fight, because the alternative is the end of their civilization, their language, and, for many of them, their lives.

The Ukrainians could still win. A different set of American policies could help them win faster. The U.S. could still expand sanctions on Russia, provide ammunition, and help the Ukrainians win the narrative war. The administration could stop the fighting, the missile attacks, and the lethal drone swarms; it could stop the pointless deaths that Trump has repeatedly said he opposes. By choosing to back Russia, the U.S. will ensure that the war continues. Only by backing Ukraine is there hope for peace.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Find the right comfort series to unwind with.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

A hard day is helped along by a few creature comforts: a good meal, a few friends, the right show to unwind with. So we asked The Atlantic's writers and editors: What's your go-to feel-good TV series?

Bones (streaming on Hulu and Peacock)

A proper feel-good TV show must be bingeable and must require little mental exertion. It ideally walks a fine line between earnestness and cringe, with a slight bias toward cringe. Almost by definition, these are shows that Serious People who read Serious Books and watch Serious Television admit only under duress to watching, with hemming-and-hawing caveats and a dose of performative embarrassment. For me, that show is Bones, an investigative drama centered on a team led by an Army-veteran FBI agent and a socially challenged forensic anthropologist from a Smithsonian-style institute. The series ran from 2005 to 2017, and although it is certainly a product of its time—it is cask-strength copaganda and a bit too credulous about the Iraq War—it also has plenty to say to our own era of federal-research cuts. Beneath all the gore and disinterred remains, Bones is an uplifting love letter to public service, animated by the twin beliefs that justice is achieved through the pursuit of scientific knowledge and humanistic wisdom, and, equally important, that the federal government should provide (and pay) for both.

Hannibal (streaming on Prime Video)

It's got to be NBC's Hannibal! Fundamentally, Hannibal is a show about people commuting to work in and around the D.C. area in the most ridiculous ways possible, who also, somehow, find time to cook dinner from scratch. Hannibal's premise is that FBI special agent Will Graham travels to Baltimore weekly from Wolf Trap, Virginia, to get therapy from “the late, great Hannibal Lecter.” (That's roughly one hour and 15 minutes each way! Will has seven dogs. Those dogs must have bladders of steel.)

Eventually, Will realizes that Hannibal is not sourcing his meat ethically, but that revelation takes one whole season, which is fair because so many other things that happen on this show are equally suspicious. Nobody owns a TV, but Hannibal owns a harpsichord and a theremin and has time to compose on both. There is a character named Bedelia Du Maurier. Bedelia Du Maurier! She is played by Gillian Anderson, another point in the show's favor. At one point, Will even cooks a special homemade dinner for his dogs, like those people from the TV commercials. Hannibal is a show about what I imagine I would be able to do if commuting took no time at all and I did not spend my entire life staring at my phone. Also, there is cannibalism. I would not do the cannibalism.

Season 3 of The Office (streaming on Peacock)

Calling The Office a feel-good show is strange considering how the first season or two could be so uncomfortable to watch. Michael, the incompetent boss, was often cruel and offensive; Pam was in a miserable relationship with her long-term boyfriend; Jim futilely (sometimes pathetically!) pined for her. Season 3, though, is when the show starts to feel good, in part because it eases off some of its cringiest elements: Jim moves away and gets a new girlfriend, which makes him seem not so pathetic. Pam summons the courage to make big changes to her life. Michael is still Michael, but we start to see glimmers of his sweetness and humanity. I've watched this season so many times that I know many of the episodes by heart, and the image of Pam's face at the end of the final episode is imprinted on my mind's eye; she may be the happiest person ever to sit in a conference room.

— Eleanor Barkhorn, senior editor

Parks and Recreation (streaming on Peacock)

I recently found myself on a flight with no Wi-Fi and only a handful of viewing options. Passing up the opportunity to rewatch Wayne's World or Chicago, I opted for the three available episodes of Parks and Recreation, and my family has been bingeing it ever since. Parks shares much DNA with its mockumentary forebearer, The Office, but diverges in ways that make it ideal for multigenerational viewing.

In the 10 years since its finale, the show has proved to be both evergreen and endearingly of its time. Parks Department Deputy Director Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) is a goofy and lovable good-government workaholic, a pre-rejoinder to the DOGE caricature of the lazy bureaucrat. The series brims with catchphrases (“Treat yo self!”) but derives its humor from its characters. And what characters! The cast weaves together stars reinventing themselves (Rob Lowe as a hyper-optimized cheer robot, Poehler as a Hillary-wannabe girlboss) and actors on their way to stardom (including pre-swole Chris Pratt and goth-baby Aubrey Plaza). And, of course, Li'l Sebastian, RIP.

— Boris Kachka, senior editor

Portlandia (streaming on Sling TV and Philo)

If we're talking screen time, Sex and the City is my most-watched show. But when I think about which series has produced the most bellyaching laughs and quotable one-liners, it has to be Portlandia. If you aren't already privy to the art that is this show, you're in for a treat. Carrie Brownstein and Fred Armisen star in outlandish sketches set in Portland, and the result is something both deeply satisfying and weird that ran for eight seasons. Watching Portlandia is like sitting in on a master class in comedic timing. My personal favorite sketch? A recurring one where Armisen and Brownstein own a feminist bookstore called Women & Women First. It's just great television, and the best part is that there's essentially no storyline to follow. So pick an episode, any episode, and thank me later.

Cuts to NASA mean that the U.S. likely won't build the next great space observatory.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In April, scientists announced that they had used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to find a potential signature of alien life in the glow of a distant planet. Other scientists were quick to challenge the details of the claim and offered more mundane explanations; most likely, these data do not reveal a new and distant biology. But the affair was still a watershed moment. It demonstrated that humans have finally built tools powerful enough to see across interstellar space and detect evidence of biospheres on distant worlds—in other words, tools truly capable of discovering alien life.

Given the telescope technologies we astronomers have now and the ones we'll build soon, within a few decades, humans might finally gather some hard data that can answer its most profound, existential question: Is there life beyond Earth? What's arguably even more remarkable is that unless something changes very soon, the humans making that epochal discovery might not be NASA and the American space scientists who power it.

The U.S. space agency is facing a funding and personnel crisis that the Planetary Society has called “an extinction-level event.” The Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget—a version of which passed Congress and now awaits the president's signature—slashes NASA's funding by almost a quarter. That means, adjusted for inflation, NASA would get the same level of funding it had in 1961, before John F. Kennedy called for the United States to put a man on the moon.

The modern version of NASA has far more on its plate: maintaining the International Space Station, hunting for Earth-killing asteroids, and using its Earth-observing satellites to help farmers monitor soil conditions. The president's budget also calls for an aggressive push to land humans on both the moon and Mars. It's hard to see how the agency can safely and accurately fulfill its current responsibilities—let alone develop advanced (and expensive) scientific equipment that would advance the search for alien life—with such reduced funding. (“President Trump's FY26 NASA Budget commits to strengthening America's leadership in space exploration while exercising fiscal responsibility,” a NASA spokesperson wrote in an email to The Atlantic. “We remain fully committed to our long-term goals and continue to make progress toward the next frontier in space exploration, even as funding priorities are adjusted.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment.)

Almost all of NASA's divisions face dramatic cuts, but the proposed nearly 50 percent slash to its Science Mission Directorate poses the greatest threat to hopes of future grand discoveries, including finding life on other worlds. SMD's engineers and scientists built the rovers that helped scientists show that Mars, now a freezing desert, was once warm and covered in rushing water. The researchers it funds developed probes that revealed vast subsurface oceans on some of Jupiter's moons. SMD is also where you'll find the folks who built the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and a flotilla of other instruments. These extraordinary machines have provided views of colliding galaxies 300 million light-years away, captured the death throes of stars like the Sun, and recorded portraits of interstellar clouds that birth new generations of stars and planets.

In 2023, the scientists and engineers of the SMD were tasked with building the all-important Habitable Worlds Observatory, designed specifically to find alien life on planets light-years away. Slated to launch sometime in the 2040s, the HWO is planned to be about the same size as the JWST, with a similar orbit beyond the moon. Unlike the JWST, the HWO's sophisticated detectors must be able to tease out the light of an exoplanet against the billions-of-times-brighter glare of its host star, a signal as faint as the dim glow of a firefly flitting around a powerful field light at the San Francisco Giants' Oracle Park, but detected from all the way across the country in New York City.

But now, many astronomers fear, NASA might never get the chance to build HWO—or carry out a slew of other missions that maintain the U.S.'s strong advantage in space science, as well as keep it ahead in the hunt for alien life. Under Donald Trump's plan, NASA would be forced to abandon 19 “active” missions. These include Juno—which is revolutionizing astronomers' understanding of Jupiter and could help them understand similarly monstrous worlds in other solar systems with other Earth-like planets—and New Horizons, a mission that took nearly 10 years to reach Pluto and is now flying into uncharted space at the edge of the solar system.

The budget also decimates the future of space-science exploration. Scientists have been desperate to get back to Venus, for example, after a chemical compound associated with life was potentially detected high in its atmosphere in 2020; the two missions that would get us there are axed out of the administration's budget. The plan for the Nancy Roman Telescope, which would test key technologies necessary for the HWO, is so withered that many astronomers worry the telescope might never leave Earth.

Worst, the development for the HWO takes an 80 percent cut in the president's proposed budget, going from $17 million in 2024 to just $3 million in 2026, before rebounding in 2028. The HWO represents one the most ambitious projects ever attempted, and the technological innovation needed to build it, or probes that might land on Jupiter's ocean moons, get measured across decades. In order for such missions to succeed, investments have to remain steady and focused—the opposite of what the Trump administration has proposed.

Amid all the difficulties the country faces, the losses in space science might seem trivial. But American science, including space science, has paid enormous dividends in keeping the nation strong, prosperous, and worthy of the world's respect. If the original budget passes, one in every three of NASA's highly skilled workers will lose their job. The agency, in turn, will lose decades of hard-core technical experience: Not many people know how to blast a robot science rover from Earth, have it cross hundreds of millions of miles of deep space, and then land it—intact—on the surface of another planet. As the cuts take hold, plenty of NASA scientists might be forced to take jobs in other countries or early retirements they didn't want, or simply be let go. And the agency will be set back decades more into the future by choking off funding to young researchers at every level.

Just as the U.S. is stumbling and falling back in its efforts to find alien life, astronomers around the world are preparing for the steep climb. The European Space Agency has a list of missions aimed at studying exoplanets. China has announced a 2028 launch date for Earth 2.0, a space telescope designed to find Earth-size exoplanets in the habitable zones of their stars. If it succeeds, that mission would put China on a path to building its own version of the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

In my work as an astrophysicist, studying the possibilities of life on exoplanets, I travel around the world representing American science. In those travels, I consistently find people in other countries wearing two icons of American culture: the Yankee cap and the NASA logo. That a kid in Florence or a middle-aged guy in Bangkok would wear a NASA T-shirt is testimony to the power of its legacy. NASA—with its can-do spirit and its willingness to dream like no other organization in the history of the world—is America. If protected and nurtured, it would almost certainly lead the charge to answer that most existential question of life beyond Earth. But if this administration's shortsighted budget passes, it might be some other nation that discovers we are not alone in the universe.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What if function, not form, dictated what was in fashion?

This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors' weekly guide to the best in books. Sign up for it here.

When a woman's clothes constrict her movement, squeezing her into unforgiving shapes, or her exercise regime is a punishing ordeal meant to winnow her down to the smallest possible size, the result is all too often an alienation from her body. This week, we published two book reviews that offer a different way to think about the physical self—one that replaces an obsession over surface appeal with an emphasis on functionality.

First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic's books section:

My colleague Julie Beck's essay on Casey Johnston's new ode to weight lifting argues for seeing your body as a working object, rather than an enemy to be subdued; so does Julia Turner's article about Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson's new biography of the fashion designer Claire McCardell. This philosophy might seem, to some, like wishful thinking: Narrow standards of beauty, whether they dictate body size or one's fashion sense, remain powerful in many settings. But Johnston's memoir of her journey toward strength training describes how, as she built muscle, she also began rejecting a deeply ingrained internal voice warning her against gaining a single pound. Beck, who describes trading in punishing turns on the elliptical for lifting, writes that the decision transformed her relationship to her body. As she notes, lifting “builds up instead of whittling away; it favors function over aesthetics”; strength training has changed the way she walks, erased nagging pains, and allowed her to lift her carry-on into the overhead bin on airplanes with ease.

Fashion, too, has tended to prioritize appearances over practicality—skin-baring cuts when long sleeves might be more appropriate for the weather, high heels that are impossible to walk in—to the detriment of women's well-being. In her essay on Dickinson's Claire McCardell, Turner writes that the designer “hated being uncomfortable,” and worked to design clothes that people could actually live in. (She is credited with adding pockets to women's clothes and moving hard-to-reach zippers to the sides of dresses.) As Turner argues, McCardell “saw women as doers, and designed accordingly.” Perhaps, Turner suggests, we should think of fashion less as an art and more as a kind of industrial design: practical and user-friendly, rather than beautiful to look at. Aesthetics aren't irrelevant—style and sartorial creativity can be freeing and self-expressive—but these books refreshingly propose that we value our bodies for what they can do, not how they appear.

The Feminine Pursuit of Swoleness

By Julie Beck

Casey Johnston's new book, A Physical Education, considers how weight lifting can help you unlearn diet culture.

Be Ready When the Luck Happens, by Ina Garten

A lounge chair beside a pool in Florida, where I was vacationing with my family last winter, was the perfect place to devour Garten's celebration of luxury, good food, and togetherness. This memoir is a record of a life spent prioritizing adventure over prudence, indulgence over temperance. Garten buys a store in a town she's never visited, purchases a beautiful house she can barely afford, and wishes her husband well as he takes a job in Hong Kong while she stays behind. Her brio pays off, of course: That food shop was a success, and she went on to write more than a dozen cookbooks, become a Food Network star, and make pavlova with Taylor Swift. The book is escapist in the way that good, breezy reads often are. It was also, for me, inspiring: Be Ready When the Luck Happens gave me a bit of permission to imagine what I would do if I were the sort of person who embraces possibility the way Garten does. As I basked in the pleasant winter sunshine, I found myself thinking, What if we move to Florida, or to Southern California, or some other place where it's warm in January? I haven't followed through—vacation fantasies have a way of fading as soon as you get back to reality. But I was invigorated by imagining that I might. — Eleanor Barkhorn

The Bad Bunny Video That Captures the Cost of Gentrification

By Valerie Trapp

One of the effects of gentrification, Bad Bunny proposes, is silence. Throughout the DTMF album, Bad Bunny laments how many Puerto Ricans have been forced to leave the island amid financial struggles and environmental disasters such as Hurricane Maria; this is most notable on “Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,” in which he notes that “no one here wanted to leave, and those who left dream of returning.” (As of 2018, more Puerto Ricans live outside Puerto Rico than on the island; the same is true of Native Hawaiians and Palestinians in their respective lands.) The DTMF short film makes their absence palpable. “Did you hear that? That music!” the old man says to Concho, when a red sedan drives by their front porch playing reggaeton (Bad Bunny's “Eoo”). The old man is moved. “You barely see that anymore,” he says of the car moseying past. “I miss hearing the young people hanging out, the motorcycles—the sound of the neighborhood.” Señor and Concho, it seems, live in a community that has turned its volume down, now that most of its Puerto Rican inhabitants have left.

﻿The strongest defense can be summed up in just two words.

Americans aren't used to having to defend democracy. It's just been a given for so long. After all, it's the country's 249th birthday. But now, with experts warning that US democracy may break down in the next three years, many people feel worried about it — and passionate about protecting it.

But how do you defend something when you don't quite remember the justifications for it? 

Many intellectuals on both the left and right have spent the past decade attacking America's liberal democracy — a political system that holds meaningfully free, fair, multiparty elections, and gives citizens plenty of civil liberties and equality before the law. 

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

On the left, thinkers have criticized liberalism's economic vision for its emphasis on individual freedom, which they argued feeds exploitation and inequality. On the right, thinkers have taken issue with liberalism's focus on secularism and individual rights, which they said wrecks traditional values and social cohesion. The common thread is the belief that liberalism's core premise — the government's main job is to defend the freedom of the individual to choose their path in life — is wrong.

These arguments gained mainstream success for a time, as Vox's Zack Beauchamp has documented. That's in part because, well, liberalism does have its problems. At a time of rising inequality and rampant social disconnection, it shouldn't be surprising when some people complain that liberalism is so busy protecting the freedom of the individual that it neglects to tackle collective problems.

But awareness of these problems shouldn't mean that we give up on liberal democracy. In fact, there are very compelling reasons to want to uphold this political system. Because Americans have gotten used to taking it for granted, many have forgotten how to make the intellectual case for it. 

It's time to remember. 

When you think of liberalism, you might think of philosophers like John Locke, John Stuart Mill, or John Rawls. But, believe it or not, some people not named John also had very important ideas. 

Prime examples include the Oxford philosopher Isaiah Berlin and Harvard political theorist Judith Shklar, who are strangely underappreciated given their contributions to liberal thought in the Cold War period. Associated thinkers like Bernard Williams and Charles Taylor are also worth noting. 

Let's focus on Berlin, though, since he was one of the clearest and greatest defenders of liberal democracy. Born to a Jewish family in the Russian Empire, he experienced the political extremes of the 20th century — the Russian Revolution, the rise of Soviet communism, the Holocaust — and came away with a horror for totalitarian thinking. In all these cases, he argued, the underlying culprit was “monism”: the idea that we can arrive at the true answers to humanity's central problems and harmoniously combine them into one utopian, perfect society. 

For example, in Stalin's communism, monism took the form of believing that the key is to establish a classless society — even if millions of people had to be killed to achieve that vision. 

If it were possible to have a perfect society, any method of bringing it about would seem justified. Berlin writes:

For if one really believes that such a solution is possible, then surely no cost would be too high to obtain it: to make mankind just and happy and creative and harmonious forever — what could be too high a price to pay for that? To make such an omelette, there is surely no limit to the number of eggs that should be broken — that was the faith of Lenin, of Trotsky, of Mao.

But this utopian idea is a dangerous illusion. The problem with it, Berlin argued, is that human beings have lots of different values, and they're not all compatible with each other. In fact, they're inherently diverse and often in tension with each other. 

Take, for example, justice and mercy. Both of these are equally legitimate values. But rigorous justice won't always be compatible with mercy; the former would push a court to throw the book at someone for breaking a law, even if no one was harmed and it was a first offense, while the latter would urge for a more forgiving approach. 

Or take liberty and equality. Both beautiful values — “but total liberty for wolves is death to the lambs,” Berlin writes, “total liberty of the powerful, the gifted, is not compatible with the rights to a decent existence of the weak and the less gifted.” The state has to curtail the liberty of those who want to dominate if it cares about making room for equality or social welfare, for feeding the hungry and providing houses for the unhoused. 

Some ethical theories, like utilitarianism, try to dissolve these sorts of conflicts by suggesting that all the different values can be ranked on a single scale; in any given situation, one will produce more units of happiness or pleasure than the other. But Berlin argues that the values are actually incommensurable: attending a Buddhist meditation retreat and eating a slice of chocolate cake might both give you some sort of happiness, but you can't rank them on a single scale. They are extremely different types of happiness. What's more, some values can actually make us less happy — think of courage, say, and intellectual honesty or truth-seeking — but are valuable nonetheless. You can't boil all values down to one “supervalue” and measure everything in terms of it.

If human values are incommensurable and sometimes flat-out incompatible, that means no single political arrangement can satisfy all legitimate human values simultaneously. To put it more simply: We can't have everything. We'll always face trade-offs between different goods, and because we're forced to choose between them, there will always be some loss of value — some good thing left unchosen. 

Berlin says it's precisely because this is the human condition that we rightly place such a high premium on freedom. If no one can justifiably tell us that their way is the one right way to live — because, according to Berlin's value pluralism, there can be more than one right answer — then no government can claim to have uncontestable knowledge about the good and foist its vision on us. We should all have a share in making those decisions on the collective level — as we do in a liberal democracy. And on the individual level, we should each have the freedom to choose how we balance between values, how we live our own lives. When others come up with different answers, we should respect their competing perspectives.

“I do not say, ‘I like my coffee with milk and you like it without; I am in favor of kindness and you prefer concentration camps,'” Berlin memorably writes. Although he argues that there's a plurality of values, that doesn't mean any and every possible value is a legitimate human value. Legitimate values are things that humans have genuine reason to care about as ends in themselves, and that others can see the point in, even if they put less weight on a given value or dispute how it's being enacted in the world. 

Security, for example, is something we all have reason to care about, even though we differ on the lengths the government should go to in order to ensure security. By contrast, if someone said that cruelty is a core value, they'd be laughed out of the room. We can imagine a person valuing cruelty in specific contexts as a means to a greater end, but no human being (except maybe a sociopath) would argue that they value it as an end in itself. As Berlin writes:

The number of human values, of values that I can pursue while maintaining my human semblance, my human character, is finite — let us say 74, or perhaps 122, or 26, but finite, whatever it may be. And the difference it makes is that if a man pursues one of these values, I, who do not, am able to understand why he pursues it or what it would be like, in his circumstances, for me to be induced to pursue it. Hence the possibility of human understanding.

Contemporary psychologists like Jonathan Haidt have made a similar case. His research suggests that different people prioritize different moral values. Liberals are those who are especially attuned to the values of care and fairness. Conservatives are those who are also sensitive to the values of loyalty, authority, and sanctity. It's not like some of these values are “bad” and some are “good.” They're just different. And even a liberal who strongly disagrees with how a conservative is applying the value of sanctity (for example, as a way to argue that a fetus represents a life and that life is sacred, so abortion should be banned) can appreciate that sanctity is, itself, a fine value. 

Berlin anticipated this line of thinking. Although he acknowledges that some disagreements are so severe that people will feel compelled to go to war — he would go to war against Nazi Germany, for example — by and large, “respect between systems of values which are not necessarily hostile to each other is possible,” he writes.

Berlin's analysis offers a highly effective vaccine against totalitarian thinking. That's a huge point in its favor — and defenders of liberal democracy would do well to resurface it. 

But there's more to a good society than just warding off totalitarianism — than, to put it in Berlin's own terms, guaranteeing “negative freedoms” (freedom from things like oppression). We also care about “positive freedoms” (freedom to enjoy all the good things in life). In recent years, critics have alleged that Berlin and other Cold War liberals neglected that part of the equation.

It's fair to point out that American liberalism has done a poor job of ensuring things like equality and social connection. But Berlin's account of value pluralism never pretended to be laying out a timeless prescription for how to balance between different priorities. Just the opposite. He specified that priorities are never absolute. We exist on a seesaw, and as our society's concrete circumstances change — say, as capitalism goes into hyperdrive and billionaires amass more and more power — we'll need to repeatedly adjust our stance so we can maintain a decent balance between all the elements of a good life. 

And on the global scale, Berlin fully expects that different cultures will keep disagreeing with each other about how much weight to put on the different legitimate human values. He urges us to view each culture as infinitely precious in its uniqueness, and to see that there may be “as many types of perfection as there are types of culture.” He offers us a positive vision that's about respecting, and maybe even delighting in, difference. 

Nowadays, a new generation of philosophers, including American thinkers influenced by Berlin like Ruth Chang and Elizabeth Anderson, is busy trying to work out the particulars of how to do that in modern society, tackling issues from ongoing racial segregation to rapid technological change. 

But this can't just be the work of philosophers. If America is going to remain a liberal democracy, everyday Americans need to remember the value of value pluralism.

Disney tried to a build a theme park that tackled slavery. It didn't go well.

How we tell the story of the United States — and who's included in it and how — has been an ongoing battle in the country for decades. It's one currently being waged by the Trump administration, such as when it scrubbed references to Jackie Robinson and Harriet Tubman from government webpages in the name of clamping down on “DEI.” 

And in the 1990s, Disney had a particularly zany idea of how to tell the story of America — one that set off a culture war as the company sought to create an amusement park focused on US history, warts and all. 

Disney's America, the doomed amusement park, would have contained the story of immigration told through the Muppets' musical-comedy stylings. It would have had sections dedicated to the Industrial Revolution, Native America, and the Civil War. It would, as Disney executives put it at the time, “make you a Civil War soldier. We want to make you feel what it was like to be a slave.”

The ensuing battle over Disney's America would be one of Disney's biggest failures — and a precursor to battles we're still fighting today.

To learn more about what Disney tried to do, what ended up happening, and what it all means, Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram spoke with historian Jacqui Shine.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Where does this story begin?

It begins with Michael Eisner, who came to Disney as its CEO and chairman in 1984. Eisner is ambitious, aggressive. Over the next 10 years, in what Disney buffs called the Disney Renaissance, the company has this enormous critical and commercial success with a run of animated movies. The juggernaut of this is The Little Mermaid, followed by Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King and Aladdin. 

Maybe high on that supply, Eisner announces this plan for what he calls the Disney decade, which is this broad expansion of the company's parks and resorts. The most high-profile project here was Euro Disney Resort, which is now Disneyland Paris. And there's high expectations for the Disney decade and for the success of the Parks program. 

This doesn't go quite the way that they hope it will. Euro Disney doesn't do well at opening. It loses nearly a billion dollars in its first year. So the failure of Euro Disney leads the company to want to pivot to more US expansion on smaller park projects. 

In 1991, the head of the parks division brings Eisner and Disney's president Frank Wells to Colonial Williamsburg. This inspires this plan for a history-themed Disney Park, Disney's America. 

They want to put it in Virginia because they imagine that it can become part of the DC-area tourist economy, and that a Disney theme park that is about American history will fit really well into this context. This is not a project that was supposed to involve Mickey Mouse or any of the Disney icons. Disney was starting work on Pocahontas.

Eisner says that he was reading a lot about John Smith and Pocahontas and that internally, the company was interested in democracy as a sort of, as a thematic subject.

So Eisner and Disney have an idea of what they don't want to do, and perhaps more importantly, what they do want to do with this park. To build it, obviously you're going to need some land. I imagine Disney just didn't already have a huge parcel of property in northern Virginia-ish. Do they buy some?

They do. Between 1991 and 1993, Disney secretly begins buying up parcels of land in the area through shell companies. The guy who was in charge of buying apparently used a fake persona; this was very undercover, this is all happening secretly. It is also less than five miles from a National Park Service Civil War Battlefield: Manassas. This is a place where about 3,700 men died and where there were about 25,000 total casualties.

They're doing this secretly. At what point does Manassas find out that Mickey Mouse is buying up their land?

Almost everybody finds out in November 1993 when Disney announces the project.

I think initially people receive this warmly, because Disney's promising a significant amount of economic development for the region and Disney is promising a complex experience of American history there. The guy who heads the Disney's America project, Bob Weis, says in the press release they envisioned Disney's America as a place to debate and discuss the future of our nation and to learn more about the past by living it. 

And they are quick to say that this is a project that is not going to whitewash American history. Eisner is interviewed in the Washington Post the next day. He says that the park will present painful, disturbing, agonizing history. We're going to be sensitive, but we will not be showing the absolute propaganda of the country. We will show the Civil War with all this racial conflict.

This was a very serious, very powerful, very successful entertainment executive saying, “We're gonna make a kiddy theme park that will take our most brutal history seriously.”

Yes. And I think, like you, a lot of people had trouble with that contradiction. The day after this press release is issued, Disney holds a press conference in Haymarket. At this presser, Bob Weis, who is the senior vice president of imagineering, which is Disney's creative division, says, “This will be entertaining in the sense that it would leave you something you could mull over. We want to make you a Civil War soldier. We want to make you feel what it was like to be a slave or what it was like to escape through the underground railroad.”

This moment, I think, comes to define this conflict in the public eye. 

It's such a nutty thing to hear a serious person say. Your kids could come to our theme park, home of Mickey Mouse, and find out what it's like to be a slave. I imagine at this point, people are just like, “I'm sorry, I'm gonna need some more specifics.”

Yes. They put out a brochure, which is where a lot of the information that we have about what this would've been like comes from. 

“Any kind of debate about public history is always going to be about trying to stake some sort of political or ideological claim about the meaning of American history.”

You enter at Crossroads USA, and there you board an 1840s train that takes you first to President Square, which they say celebrates the birth of democracy. It's about the Revolutionary War.

You follow that to Native America. They say, “guests may visit an Indian village representing such eastern tribes as the Powhatans, or join in a harrowing Lewis and Clark raft expedition through pounding rapids and churning whirlpools.” We're going to be educating people about Manifest Destiny here.

We move from Native America to the Civil War fort, where they say you're going to experience the reality of a soldier's daily life. After the Civil War fort, you go to a section on American immigration. And they're going to build a replica Ellis Island building. Some sources indicate they would've done a show called The Muppets Take America. 

The next section is a factory town called Enterprise that centers on a high-speed adventure ride called the Industrial Revolution. That involves a narrow escape from its fiery vat of molten steel.

Then you go to Victory Field, where guests may parachute from a plane or operate tanks and weapons in combat.

You then hit the last two areas, State Fair and Family Farm, to learn how to make homemade ice cream or milk a cow and even participate in a nearby country wedding, barn dance, and buffet. 

This sounds like one doozy of a brochure. Does it work? Does it convince everyone?

Yes and no.

Does that slow down Michael Eisner? Is he ready to give up?

No. And that is where the fight begins. People hook in, in particular, to this idea that Disney's going to include some element about American chattel slavery. And he is aggressive about saying, No, we weren't going to do that. Why would you think that?

He is really persuaded that Disney's big swing can work, that this idea has value and merit, and that the people who are standing against it are misguided.

At this point, is this fight relegated to Virginia, or is it getting bigger? This is obviously an international company with a huge cultural footprint.

It's getting bigger. One of the things that contributes to this is that the Washington Post does a lot of coverage of this, which makes it go national. And it starts this debate in editorial pages about whether or not Disney can responsibly represent American history and whether or not the Disneyfication of American history is advisable.

And what happens when national papers, opinion columns start weighing in on this debate? 

A few things happen. In early 1994, a strong coalition of opponents develops, including people who are concerned about preserving the environment there.

But then the historians get involved. The big guns come out when this group called Protect Historic America launches. This is a group of big-name, high-powered academic historians. This group of major figures stepped forward to say they're concerned about education around the Civil War and about the park's location near Manassas. In very short order, dozens and dozens of historians volunteer their time to write editorials, to comment to the media. They're really fired up about this.

I read that this fight also somehow made it to the United States Congress. Why is this even Congress's business?

This is one of the interesting things that comes out of Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee hearings. The entree into this is that this involves public lands of national importance. Five hundred people come to the Senate hearing, and Eisner's really combative. He says about the people who are opposed to this, “I sat through many history classes where I read some of their stuff and I didn't learn anything. It was pretty boring.”

At this point you've got historians speaking out about this. You've got op-ed columns being written, it sounds like all over the country. You've got a hearing on Capitol Hill. Are people out in the streets protesting this somewhere?

They are. Eisner is on the Hill trying to make nice with DC politicians and invites them to a special screening of The Lion King. But when they leave the theater, there are about a hundred protestors outside. Bigger than this though, in September 1994, 3,000 people march on the National Mall to protest Disney's America.

Nationally, public support for the park has dropped to like 25 percent. At the end of September 1994, the company announces that Disney is withdrawing from the Virginia site. It's clear that people don't want it to be sited where it is, and they're giving up. It's over for Disney's America. It is curtains for Disney's America.

How do you think what happened in the '90s connects to the kinds of fights we're having about our history right now?

Any kind of debate about public history is always going to be about trying to stake some sort of political or ideological claim about the meaning of American history. Right now we see this very direct, very aggressive effort to insist on a positivist narrative about American history. 

One of the things that I think people found puzzling about the early days of the Trump administration was that the National Endowment for the Humanities cut an enormous amount of active grants. And they issued new guidelines seeking projects, they say, that instill “an understanding of the founding principles and ideals that make America an exceptional country.” I think partly this is the administration's backlash to efforts in the last decade to bring a more nuanced and complex understanding to structural oppression in US history.

We fantasize about American history in all kinds of ways, in all kinds of places. I don't know that Disney in seeking to do that was necessarily doing anything out of step with how we represent the American story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","PwC's chief AI officer: AI is moving quickly. Here's how leaders can avoid getting left behind.","https://www.businessinsider.com/pwc-ai-chief-leaders-avoid-getting-left-behind-2025-7","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 08:06:00 GMT","

Many corporate leaders are embracing artificial intelligence in theory but falling short when it comes to execution, according to Dan Priest, who was named PricewaterhouseCoopers' first chief AI officer a year ago.

With generative AI radically reshaping how everything from accounting and human resources to sales and marketing gets done, CEOs' leadership skills are being put to the test. How they go about their AI strategy today, warned Priest, will likely mean the difference between achieving greater cost savings and faster growth in the next few years versus falling behind the curve.

""It is a disruptive journey that needs to be managed,"" he told Business Insider.

Consider, for example, a PwC survey of approximately 4,700 CEOs last year found that four out of 10 expect their business models to no longer be viable in the next decade if AI continues to develop at its current rate. Priest said this suggests companies will need to come up with new — and likely AI-powered ways — of generating revenue, which can be difficult.

Given how fast generative AI has been evolving, Priest stressed the importance of CEOs investing in AI tools and strategic planning around them now, if they haven't already, to set their businesses up for success. But he conceded that the task is challenging.

For one, leaders need to find ways to distinguish their companies from others using AI if they want to stand out from competitors, said Priest. Most use cases today are merely setting a new standard for table stakes.

""If AI is ubiquitous and everybody's got it, it can't be your differentiator alone,"" he said.

Leaders also need to figure out which job functions will be aided by AI and to what extent, and which ones will become obsolete, said Priest. Further, they should determine where new skills are needed, invest in helping employees develop them, and assess where talent may need to shift to other areas of the business.

""If you believe that people are an important part of your success in the future, you should invest in their reskilling,"" he said.

Workers aren't all using AI tools in the same way, added Priest.

""Early-career-stage team members are more likely to turn over the thinking too much to AI,"" he said. ""Late-stage-career team members are probably too reticent to use it consistently.""

One tip Priest has for anyone using AI to write memos or other text is to only rely on the technology for a second draft. People should produce a first and last version on their own, he said.

""You want the thinking to be yours. That's why the first draft is so important,"" Priest said. ""You want the benefit of the edit and you want the final draft to be in your voice.""

This is also an example of why he believes humans should be at the center of companies' AI-related initiatives.

""The shiny new object is AI, but I don't know a single AI agent that is changing a business,"" he said. ""It's the humans combined with those AI agents that change the business.""

Chip Wars:

President Donald Trump's administration plans to restrict shipments of AI chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. to Malaysia and Thailand, part of an effort to crack down on suspected semiconductor smuggling into China.

A draft rule from the Commerce Department seeks to prevent China — to which the US has effectively banned sales of Nvidia's advanced AI processors — from obtaining those components through intermediaries in the two Southeast Asian nations, according to people familiar with the matter. The rule is not yet finalized and could still change, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.

That's a 4.3 percentage point lower than the same period last year and part of a longer-term decline that began during President Donald Trump's first term in office. China's share of imports was recently as high as 14.8% in September 2024, prior to Trump returning to office and implementing steep new tariffs on imports from the country.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who bombarded President Donald Trump's signature spending bill for weeks, on Friday made his first comments since the legislation passed.

Musk backed a post on X by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who said the bill's budget ""explodes the deficit"" and continues a pattern of ""short-term politicking over long-term sustainability.""

CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.

The House of Representatives narrowly passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on Thursday, sending it to Trump to sign into law.

Paul and Musk have been vocal opponents of Trump's tax and spending bill, and repeatedly called out the potential for the spending package to increase the national debt.

On Monday, Musk called it the ""DEBT SLAVERY bill.""

The independent Congressional Budget Office has said the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion of U.S. debt over the next decade. The White House has labeled the agency as ""partisan"" and continuously refuted the CBO's estimates.

The bill includes trillions of dollars in tax cuts, increased spending for immigration enforcement and large cuts to funding for Medicaid and other programs.

It also cuts tax credits and support for solar and wind energy and electric vehicles, a particularly sore spot for Musk, who has several companies that benefit from the programs.

""I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump wrote in a social media post in early June as the pair traded insults and threats.

Shares of Tesla plummeted as the feud intensified, with the company losing $152 billion in market cap on June 5 and putting the company below $1 trillion in value. The stock has largely rebounded since, but is still below where it was trading before the ruckus with Trump.

All eyes are on talks between the U.S. and the European Union, which have yet to strike a trade deal with just days to go before Washington's tariffs come into full effect.

Should the trading partners fail to reach an agreement by July 9 — when a 90-day reprieve on U.S. President Donald Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs ends — EU goods imported to the U.S. could be hit by duties of up to 50%. Retaliatory measures from the EU targeting a wide range of U.S. goods, which have also been temporarily put on hold, could then follow shortly afterward.

The U.S.-EU trade relationship is one of the most important in the world, accounting for around 30% of global goods trading according to the European Council. Medicinal and pharma products, road vehicles and petroleum products are some of the top traded goods.

In 2024, trade between the two transatlantic partners was valued at around 1.68 trillion euros ($1.98 trillion) when taking into account both goods and services, the European Council said.

The EU recorded a surplus of 198 billion euros, when it comes to goods, but logged a deficit of around 148 billion euro in the trading of services — meaning the bloc overall had a trade surplus of around 50 billion euros in 2024.

Trump has repeatedly taken issue with the trade relationship between Washington and Brussels, suggesting it is unfair and accusing the EU of taking advantage of the U.S.

U.S.-EU negotiations have appeared to be difficult and slow to gain ground. Sources told CNBC earlier this week that a bare-bones political deal that is light on details may be the EU's best hope.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen seemed to echo the view on Thursday.

""What we are aiming at is an agreement in principle,"" she said, adding that a detailed agreement was ""impossible"" to reach during the 90-day reprieve.

Von der Leyen also reiterated that, if no agreement is reached, ""all the instruments are on the table.""

European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic meanwhile said in a social media post on Friday said that he had had a ""productive"" week in Washington D.C. meeting various U.S. officials.

""The work continues. Our goal remains unchanged: a good and ambitious transatlantic trade deal,"" he said.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent seemed more hesitant about the odds of a trade agreement being struck before the deadline.

""We'll see what we can do with the European Union,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Thursday.

Experts speaking to CNBC appeared skeptical about the short-term likelihood of a fully-fledged deal.

Anthony Gardner, former U.S. Ambassador to the EU, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday that he was ""not surprised"" von der Leyen had excluded the possibility of an all-inclusive deal.

""The detailed agreement is what it says: detailed. It can run into many pages, [because] full trade agreements are thousands of pages, but what we could see is heads of terms like the one that the U.S. signed with the U.K.,"" he said.

""So that's possible, but I don't think the actual content will be similar,"" Gardner added.

Carsten Nickel, managing director at Teneo, went a step further by saying a broad agreement was the ""best outcome"" the EU could achieve.

The initial deal should aim to win time for further talks and include the EU's acceptance of a 10% baseline tariff from the U.S., he told CNBC by phone, explaining that this could then allow for further conversations about items such as sectoral exemptions.

Uncertainty will nevertheless remain, even if such an arrangement is brokered, Nickel suggested.

""We'll be in a world where, whatever agreement has been struck by then will remain the subject of intense bargaining and will remain at risk of the U.S. changing its mind, losing patience, looking in other directions and so on,"" Nickel said.

He does not see the bloc imposing retaliatory measures unless Trump slaps full tariffs next week.

""And even then, I think the EU will tread carefully,"" Nickel concluded.

CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter offers a view into the business of space exploration and privatization, delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up to receive future editions.

And one of the big windfall winners of U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending megabill could end up being… unexpectedly, the U.S. Space Force.

There's a lot that the administration's put on the line for the tax and spending package, reputationally and politically, to secure Trump's legacy. And that's before factoring in the vast amount of overtime senators have been putting in throughout a 'vote-a-rama' marathon that Republicans want to bring to the finish line by Independence Day. After a final heated debate on Thursday — including a record-breaking almost-nine-hour speech from Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries — the package cleared the House of Representatives on Thursday, setting the stage for Trump to later ink the bill into law.

If the reconciliation package is enshrined according to earlier versions, it and budgetary measures could be set to deliver the U.S. Space Force a 30% year-on-year increase in funding to just under a whopping $40 billion in 2026. That's no small amount of change, even relative to the broader $1 trillion defense strategy that the administration's officials are trying to push through.

And it adds up. Some $25 billion was slated for Trump's mammoth multi-layered missile defense system, Golden Dome. Crunching some numbers, that's a seventh of the total $175 billion cost the White House administration has billed for the project — whose overall expense and viability lawmakers and analysts have repeatedly questioned — in a short stretch. It is, nevertheless, worth remembering other estimates put the final bill closer to $540 billion.  

These funds will make an ""initial investment"" in Golden Dome focused on procuring interceptors like the existing Patriots, developing new space-based interceptor options, and putting a down payment on advanced sensors and command and control systems, according to a U.S. Department of Defense briefing on June 26.

The money will go toward ""vital space-based capabilities"" alongside ""space control and resilient combat credible architectures,"" all part of a broader bid to achieve Washington's ""space superiority,"" a senior defense official said last week. That's ultimately a familiar playbook for the White House, which was for years locked in an exhaustive space race with the Soviet Union before clinching victory through the first manned Moon landing — the only difference is the pivot from space exploration to defense among the stars. The U.S. Space Force's chief, General Chance Saltzman, warned of the ""mind-boggling"" pace at which Washington's frenemy China was putting military capabilities in space, all the way back in October.

Whatever its faults, for defense and space companies, Golden Dome's been providing a rare beacon of investment hope amid budget cuts at space-geared government contractor NASA. Moreover, there's the boon in the project's extensive execution and long funding scope — and that's before getting into the possibility that sunken-cost concerns might coerce future administrations to see Golden Dome through, even if it doesn't wrap up by the end of Trump's second term.

And it's not just space by way of defense. Trump's made no secret of his ambitions – previously joyously shared with then ally, now critic Elon Musk — to put people on Mars, and the bill also provides for exploring the red planet. That relationship remains on the rocks. When I began writing on Tuesday, heated words were still flying — not the least of which from Musk, who this week doubled down on previous criticism of the megabill to liken it to a ""DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history"" before calling for a new political party that ""actually cares about the people."" The tech billionaire was widely seen as a close ally of Musk until their public feud last month that inevitably brought into question the fate of SpaceX's existing and future government contracts.

As ever, it's not over until it's over — let's see where things land for space.

Beijing may have warned against ""blind box"" toys, but analysts are betting that Pop Mart International — the company behind Labubu dolls — will remain one of China's hottest consumer brands this year.

In an editorial on June 20, China's state media People's Daily called for tighter regulations around selling blind-boxed toys and trading cards to children under the age of eight, such as verifying buyers' age upon payment and requiring parental approval in online transactions.

Without naming Beijing-headquartered Pop Mart, the paper slammed businesses for enticing young children to spend heavily on ""blind cards"" and ""mystery boxes"" — a model central to Pop Mart's appeal. The company often sells its dolls in a blind box to buyers who don't know what character is inside until they open it.

Sequentially, Pop Mart's share price plunged 12.1% for the week ending June 20, marking its steepest fall since late 2023, denting a massive rally that sent its shares over 600% higher over the last 12 months.

Its stock has regained some ground since then, hovering near the all-time high levels hit in mid-June.

The state media commentary on blind-box toys is reminiscent of Beijing's regulations on video games in recent years, which were aimed at curbing gaming addiction and unsupervised in-game purchases by minors.

That led to restrictions on how long minors can play video games, as part of a sector-wide crackdown that wiped out billions of dollars in value from China's gaming giants.

""The magnitude of Chinese policymakers' impact [on businesses] is way higher than that in other countries,"" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, senior advisor for the China Center at The Conference Board, a think tank.

That said, analysts view the fears of regulatory headwinds as overblown as Gen Zers and millennials, rather than young children, are Pop Mart's main consumer demographic.

Pop Mart will largely be insulated from intensifying regulatory scrutiny as it targets younger adults with adequate purchasing power, Montufar-Helu said.

Local peers that focus on minors, however, will likely be ""heavily impacted,"" said Jeff Zhang, equity analyst at Morningstar.

There's another factor that could cushion the regulatory impact on Pop Mart. It's increasingly driven by overseas sales, especially in Southeast Asia, Zhang said. And the share of its China revenue will fall to about 30% in the next 10 years, he projected. Pop Mart's overseas sales in 2024 have already surpassed the company's overall sales in 2021.

Pop Mart derived about 61% of its revenue from mainland China in 2024, according to its annual report, drawing the rest mainly from Southeast Asia and East Asia, as well as Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

Its sales in North America grew more than 550% last year from a year earlier, and the company has 90 physical stores and vending machine spots across the United States.

HSBC Bank expects Pop Mart's overseas revenue in 2025 to more than double to 14 billion yuan ($1.95 billion) from 2024 on strong sales momentum from ""Labubu 3.0,"" released in April. This figure would account for more than half of its entire projected revenue this year, up from 39% in 2024. 

That just builds on the meteoric growth that the company enjoyed last year, when revenue more than doubled to 13.04 billion yuan, while profits nearly tripled.

The rapidly growing popularity of the ugly-cute toys contrasts with otherwise sluggish consumption in the country, as many become increasingly frugal in the face of an economic slowdown.

Younger Chinese consumers want to build toy collections for the sense of ""affordable exclusivity"" it gives them, said Montufar-Helu, as it can be satisfying to be ""one of the lucky ones to get the special edition"" at a reasonable price.

Pop Mart sells blind-boxed toys with prices ranging from about 59 yuan to 5,999 yuan. Collectors often spend hundreds or thousands of yuan, and rare models can fetch six-figure sums at second hand auctions.

""The very point about blind boxes is the unknown, the uncertainty. There is some inherent curiosity about what someone's gonna get. That brings about a certain degree of excitement when people are buying blind boxes,"" said Chris Wong, senior clinical psychologist at Singapore-based Resilienz Clinic. 

""When that uncertainty is resolved,"" he said, referring to when the blind box is opened, ""[that] usually comes with certain pleasant emotions, like fun, surprise and delight. That also plays a part in why people just keep on doing that.""

Seeing others share their own experiences of blind boxes on social media also amplifies such a response from the brain, as it fulfils the human need for social connection, the psychologist said.

But although the Labubu frenzy shows no sign of slowing, Pop Mart still faces other challenges that may dent its momentum, analysts said.

""While Pop Mart's major IPs, such as Labubu have received some global popularity over the past two years ... there is no guarantee that what is popular now will stay relevant over the next five to ten years,"" Zhang said.

Other risks include uncertainty around the company's ability to meet shifting demand and scalping, which could drive genuine consumers out of the market, HSBC analysts said.

Pop Mart issued a rare apology last month after a surge in orders caused delivery delays, with consumers complaining online about not having receiving orders weeks after placing them.

Counterfeit toys may also dampen Pop Mart's reputation at home and abroad, analysts said, despite the government's efforts in stepping up scrutiny at export checkpoints.

Customs at the Ningbo port, one of the country's busiest ports, seized over a million counterfeit Labubu dolls in the first six months of this year, over intellectual property violations and smuggling concerns.

To keep its brand fresh, Pop Mart has taken a page from Disney's playbook, doubling down on expanding its IP portfolio, launching pop-up stores, a film studio and a theme park.

Pop Mart's founder Wang Ning once hinted at his aspiration to turn the company into ""China's Disney.""

But those initiatives don't come cheap.

""Animation production requires a strong storytelling team that can consistently deliver compelling narratives,"" said Echo Gong, an independent Shanghai-based retail consumption consultant. She added that managing a theme park also demands an entirely different skillset and far greater investment than simply selling toys.

Formal degrees aren't cutting it anymore for some industries. Instead, many companies are prioritizing skills and experience-based hiring, Sarah Skelton, co-founder and managing director of staffing and recruiting firm Flourish, told CNBC Make It.

The class of 2025 is stepping into a challenging and competitive job market. The unemployment rate for recent graduates reached 5.8% in March, up from 4.6% a year earlier, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Meanwhile, the share of new graduates who are ""underemployed"" or working jobs that don't require their degrees, rose to 41.2% in March, up from 40.6% a year earlier. Employers are becoming more cautious amid global uncertainty fueled by on-again, off-again tariff policies, hiring freezes, and the proliferation of artificial intelligence.

In this environment where it's difficult to get your foot in the door, one mistake that some recent graduates make is assuming that their degree will automatically get them a job.

""I feel like sometimes there's a certain perception that: 'I've been to uni, I've got this degree, I'm going to come in at this level,'"" said Skelton, who said she's placed more than 1,000 graduates into jobs throughout her career.

""Whereas somebody else that maybe left school, has been [employed], is work ready and can demonstrate skills and is a bit more hungry for it — some businesses are preferring that,"" she said.

She added that it depends on the industry, of course. While degrees may be less of a consideration when hiring business or sales roles, it'll be more significant for other industries like medicine.

New graduates entering the job market commonly face a ""Catch-22"" situation where ""you need experience to get experience.""

To overcome these challenges, Skelton suggested getting creative by doing the following:

""I think you have to look at the bigger picture, and you've got to get a bit more creative with the applications to stand out,"" said Skelton. ""Basically, be proactive and show you are keen."" Businesses want to know that candidates want to work for them, not just that they are ""desperate to get a job.""

She said that reaching out directly to hiring managers on LinkedIn can show hunger and agency, which can help a candidate stand out. Offering unpaid work could also be a way to get your foot in the door.

""[You can] run up to a business proactively and say: 'Can I come in and do some unpaid [work]? I know it's not glamorous. I know it may feel like ... a bit demeaning, but fundamentally, you've got to set yourself apart from the others,"" she said.

As someone who has placed many salespeople into roles, Skelton suggested using this ""closing technique"" as a parting statement at the end of an interview:

""Look, I'm really enthusiastic about this opportunity. I'd really love the chance to work with you ... Before we conclude, could I just ask: 'What have been your thoughts on me in the interview? Is there anything you could see that I could improve, or [do you have] any reservations?'"" 

Saying this at the end of the interview gives the candidate a chance to address any of the interviewer's potential reservations.

""[In] sales, it's known as a closing technique,"" said Skelton.

Following the interview, candidates should always remember to follow up with an email thanking the interviewee for their time, she said.

While formal degrees are still relevant, candidates shouldn't rely on them to land a job. Many businesses are prioritizing the experience, skills and characteristics of job seekers such as drive, coachability, work ethic, grit, potential and more, said Skelton.

Following the suspension of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra Tuesday by the country's Constitutional Court, analysts are seeing a troubled future for the Southeast Asian nation.

Paetongtarn had been suspended by the court after it accepted a petition from 36 senators that accused her of dishonesty and breaching ethical standards.

It followed a leaked phone call between Paetongtarn and former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, in which she criticized a Thai military commander overseeing a border dispute with Cambodia while appearing to appease the Cambodian strongman, according to critics.

The suspended prime minister now has 15 days to respond to the allegations. Thailand's current acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, is its sixth in just two years.

""I think there is no way she returns to being PM again as this is now a concerted effort by the military and its allies to finally finish off the Shinawatras, including, more importantly, Thaksin,"" Joshua Kurlantzick, Senior Fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council of Foreign Relations told CNBC.

Kurlantzick was referring to Thaksin Shinawatra, the father of Paetongtarn and Thailand's prime minister from 2001 to 2006. Yingluck Shinawatra, the younger sister of Thaksin, was Thailand's first female Prime Minister from 2011 to 2014.

The fallout from the leaked call saw the Bhumjaithai Party, the second-largest party in her governing coalition, withdraw from the alliance, leaving Shinawatra with only a razor-thin margin in Thailand's lower house.

While it is plausible that Shinawatra's Pheu Thai party could hold on to power for now, Kurlantzick said that the government ""would be very shaky"" and could collapse ""in a month or two."" He added that Pheu Thai is ""super unpopular now.""

Sreeparna Banerjee, associate research fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, told CNBC that even if Shinawatra is restored as PM, ""her authority and coalition will remain fragile.""

The political instability could affect Thailand's efforts to revive its economy, which is currently facing weak tourism numbers and looming tariffs from the Trump administration.

Banerjee said that without a stable head of government, ""Thailand's ability to respond decisively to external economic pressures, such as potential U.S. tariffs, will be limited.""

Under President Donald Trump's so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs announced in April, Thailand faces a 36% levy if no deal is reached with the U.S. by July 9, when Trump's 90-day suspension on the ""reciprocal tariffs"" ends.

She also added that while the country will continue with policies from Paetongtarn's government focusing on stimulus measures and boosting export competitiveness, an absence of strong leadership at the top could hinder their implementation and complicate trade negotiations.

""Investor confidence may weaken, and bureaucratic inertia could delay critical responses, at a time when Thailand urgently needs clear direction and coordination to revive its sluggish economy.""

The World Bank on Thursday sharply downgraded Thailand's full-year growth forecast for 2025 to 1.8%, down from 2.9%, and also cut its 2026 projection to 1.7% from 2.7%.

Thailand's economy grew 3.1% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, and 2.5% for the full year of 2024. Such pessimism is also seen in Thailand's markets, with the country's SET index plunging by around 20% for the year to date.

Paul Gambles, co-founder of investment advisory group MBMG Group told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" that tariffs may not be Thailand's largest problems. Instead, he said that the issues in the domestic economy are prevailing.

""A lot of long-term structural issues are coming to the fore for Thailand at the wrong time, the worst possible time.""

While Thailand's household debt is at five-year lows, the debt level as a ratio of GDP is higher than its Southeast Asian peers, raising concerns about consumption and economic growth.

Its key tourism sector is also under pressure, with total tourist arrivals down 12% year over year in the first six months of 2025, government data showed. Tourist arrivals from China, which was Thailand's largest tourist market, plunged 34% year over year in the same period.

Local media reported that the country is likely to miss its target of 39 million tourists in 2025, citing the Association of Thai Travel Agents.

Thailand's political stasis will continue for a while, CFR's Kurlantzick said.

In 2023, the Move Forward party, led by the charismatic Pita Limjaroenrat, stunned Thailand's military elite and royalists with an electoral victory.

However, the party failed to form a government due to opposition in the military-appointed senate over its campaign to amend Thailand's lese-majeste law. It was dissolved by the constitutional court a year later, leading to the formation of the People's Party, which is now the main opposition force.

""Maybe eventually... some kind of other coalition the military likes emerges in parliament. Maybe a new election [will happen] and the military tries to prevent the opposition from gaining a majority,"" Kurlantzick said.MBMG's Gambles said, ""Domestic political turmoil in Thailand is hardly news. It's more likely just the standard operating procedure, to be honest.""

""We might get a change of Prime Minister. We may get major changes in Parliament, in the cabinet. But I think it will still be the same old, same old, business as usual.""

Apologies in advance to the good folks at ADP, who I'm sure are doing good work processing private payrolls. But we might want to keep in mind the above warning when assessing the monthly ADP jobs report. 

Official labor numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a higher-than-expected increase of147,000 jobs in June. The ADP report, released Wednesday, pointed to a decrease of 33,000 private sector jobs.

That's not just a difference in magnitude, but also of direction. Emphasizing this point, the unemployment rate in June fell to 4.1% from 4.2% in the month before, defying a forecast for an increase to 4.3%.

The details lurking below the official jobs report, however, suggest I could be a tad unfair to the ADP report.

Jobs in the government rose by 73,000 in June, making up around half of the total nonfarm payroll growth for the month, as noted by CNBC's Alex Harring. The ADP report only measures private payrolls — which exclude government jobs.

""The headline job gains and surprising dip in unemployment are undoubtedly good news, but for job seekers outside of healthcare & social assistance, local government, and public education, the gains will likely ring hollow,"" wrote Cory Stahle, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab.

The huge divergence between the ADP and BLS reports, then, might not be that much of a statistical aberration — and could point to a growing schism in the U.S. labor market.

The U.S. economy added more jobs in June than expected. Nonfarm payrolls increased a seasonally adjusted 147,000 for the month, higher than the estimate for 110,000. The unemployment rate also ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2% in May.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite notch new records. Both indexes rose Thursday to extend their streak of new closing highs. Yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury jumped. The Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.47%, pushing itself out of a loss.

Apple's iPhone sales in China grow. The figure jumped 8% year on year in the second quarter of 2025. That's the first time in two years Apple has recorded an increase in sales in China, according to Counterpoint Research.

Trump's massive bill passed by U.S. government. On Thursday, the House of Representatives voted in favor of the tax-and-spending bill, with a finally vote tally of 218-214. The passage of the bill is a major political victory for U.S. President Donald Trump.

What the U.S.-Vietnam trade deal tells us about the future of tariffs

Under the agreement between Vietnam and the U.S., Washington will apply a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports — sharply below the 46% rate Trump had imposed in early April. U.S. imports to Vietnam will not be subject to tariffs.

""What we learned from the Vietnam deal is, if anything, the tariffs are going to go up from here, not down,"" Sebastian Raedler, head of European equity strategy at BofA, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European equities turned red as investors began taking on board the risk of U.S. tariffs being snapped back on again.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell by 0.5%. Regionally, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was flat, France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX ended 0.8% and 0.6% lower, respectively.

The British pound also gave up some of the gains from earlier in the session as one Bank of England official called for a more aggressive schedule of interest rate cuts this year.

The head of pan-Scandinavian airline SAS told CNBC that European airline consolidation ""needed a second phase,"" after Air France-KLM confirmed it plans to increase its stake in the business to 60.5% from just under 20%.

""Scale still matters, consolidation still matters in this industry... this is a capital intense and low margin business, so consolidation is always the name of the game,"" Anko van der Werff told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe,"" adding that it was a ""very good day"" for the airline.

""We have a growth path ourselves... I think we're also well positioned within the Air France-KLM group,"" Van der Werff continued.

SAS has struggled financially in recent years, exiting U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last year after restructuring its debt and business operations and delisting. The European aviation industry more broadly is seen increasing consolidation as it grapples with higher costs, supply chain challenges and competition from the U.S. and the Middle East.

Air France-KLM said in a statement that its increased stake reflected the ""successful turnaround of SAS"" and that the businesses had ""synergy potential."" Air France-KLM shares were 0.18% lower Friday morning.

After a negative open, French spirits names are choppy as investors assess what China's ruling in its anti-dumping investigation mean for the sector.

Pernod Ricard has been moving between losses and gains, last 0.9% lower at 9:40 a.m. in London, while Remy Cointreau is down 1.7%. The Chinese ministry of commerce said Friday it had concluded EU producers had engaged in ""dumping"" activity which had harmed the Chinese brandy industry and said it would impose retaliatory duties of up to 34.9% for a five-year period from July 5.

However, it also noted that any company which met the minimum price commitments submitted to China by EU industry associations would not be subject to the tariffs.

""On the face of it, the tariffs appear hefty, but the effect will be highly minimised due to the price undertaking agreement big producers like Remy Cointreau have reached with Chinese authorities,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNBC.

""Although it's clear it'll still be a harder market, given they will have to adhere to a minimum import price in China, the agreement still appears to be a more favourable outcome than had been feared. It's why there hasn't been a significant drop in share prices. However, there is still pessimism floating around, given that tariffs are becoming more deeply embedded in the global economy,' Streeter added.

CNBC has contacted Remy Cointreau for comment.

China is a key market for European cognac, a form of brandy. Beijing launched its investigation after the EU voted in favor of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

Europe's stock markets are in the red across the board at the open, with the regional Stoxx 600 index down 0.4%, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 down 0.32%, Germany's DAX down 0.29% and France's CAC 40 down 0.72%.

French drinks sellers are taking an early hit, with Pernod Ricard down 3.3%, Remy Cointreau down 4.5% and luxury giant LVMH down 2.1%, as news breaks that China's commerce ministry has issued a final ruling on its probe into European Union brandy.

The investigation ruled that the bloc has engaged in dumping of the spirit, according to a Google translation of a ministry relief. According to Reuters, a tariff rate on EU brandy will be set at up to 34.9% for five years from July 5. The ministry statement notes that no anti-dumping duties will be imposed on products that meet EU industry association price commitments.

Manufacturing orders in Germany tumbled 1.4% month on month in May, statistics office Destatis said Friday, well below the expectations of a 0.1% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. Orders were up 5.3% year on year.

The monthly fall was primarily due to a 17.7% drop in computer, electronic and optical products, an area that received several big orders in April.

— Jenni Reid

Airline group Air France-KLM says it is initiating proceedings to take a majority stake in Scandinavia's SAS, upping its holdings in the company to 60.5% from just under 20%.

Air France-KLM hopes to close the deal in the second half of next year. 

The move ""brings not just stability but will also allow for deeper industrial integration,"" SAS CEO Anko van der Werff said in a statement.

Good morning from London.

European markets across the U.K., France and Germany are heading for a negative start on Friday, according to IG data.

That follows a higher close on Thursday, with global equities boosted by a much stronger than expected U.S. jobs report. Officially, Wall Street is on a break for the 4 July holiday today. 

However, investors are sure to be checking their phones for updates after U.S. President Donald Trump's flagship megabill passed in Congress. A host of changes lie ahead, including to taxes, social spending and energy policy.

We're meanwhile nearing Trump's July 9 deadline for tariff negotiations, which could see duties on key trading partners such as the European Union spike unless a deal is reached. Trump has said the U.S. will begin sending letters to countries setting out their tariff rates on exports to the U.S., with 10 to 12 nations set to receive theirs today. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg he expects around 100 countries will face a 10% levy, the baseline of the so-called 'reciprocal' tariffs.

The EU meanwhile says it is closing in on a ""framework"" trade deal, but that a full agreement will be impossible to reach by July 9.

A year after its landslide win, Britain's Labour Party is navigating a tougher-than-expected path

The last 12 months have been nothing short of tumultuous for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The government's main mission was to kickstart growth and make people better off. But a year on, business optimism, productivity and job creation remain muted — pressured, in part, by a rise in the national living wage and employers' national insurance contributions.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has temporarily barred Jane Street Group from accessing India's securities market, after it accused the U.S. firm of widespread market manipulation.

According to an interim order posted on the regulator's website on Thursday, Jane Street's ""entities are restrained from accessing the securities market and are further prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly.""

SEBI also issued an interim order to freeze over 48.4 billion Indian rupees ($566.3 million) from Jane Street in alleged illegal gains. It further stated that banks have been directed to ensure that ""no debits are made, without permission of SEBI,"" for accounts held by Jane Street's entities either jointly or individually.

Jane Street disputed the findings of SEBI's interim order and said it will further engage with the regulator, in response to queries from CNBC. A Jane Street spokesperson added that the firm ""is committed to operating in compliance with all regulations in the regions we operate around the world.""

Jane Street allegedly used various strategies to artificially influence India's benchmark Nifty 50 index — which tracks the country's top 50 companies — and profit from significantly larger positions in index options.

According to SEBI's 105-page interim order, Jane Street would aggressively buy large amounts of stocks and futures that are part of the BANKNIFTY index, which tracks the performance of India's banking sector, early in the trading day. The quantitative trading firm would then place large bets that the index would decline later in the day.

Jane Street would then sell off the positions it had bought earlier, dragging the index lower and making their earlier bets in the options market far more profitable.

While Jane Street would incur some losses, SEBI contended that it was part of a ""deliberate strategy to manipulate indices to the advantage of the trading and positions,"" and the losses were offset by the firm's much larger and profitable options trade.

While these actions were not a breach of any regulation, SEBI said that the ""intensity and sheer scale"" of their intervention, and the rapid reversal of their trades ""without any plausible economic rationale, other than the concurrent activity in and impact on their positions in the BANKNIFTY index options markets,"" was manipulative.

Options trader Mayank Bansal noted that Jane Street's actions had been ongoing since July 2023, and their alleged manipulations were increasing before peaking in 2024.

""As an options trader, I could see the manipulation happening live on the screen, and so could other traders on every expiry day,' added the president of a UAE-based hedge fund, who declined to disclose the name of his company.

While he lauded SEBI's actions, Bansal said that the regulator should recover any unlawful gains, and a ban on Jane Street ""is the bare minimum.""

SEBI noted that repeated instances of manipulative trading continued on the broader Nifty 50 benchmark even after an ""explicit advisory"" was issued to the firm in February 2025 by the National Stock Exchange of India.

""Such egregious behaviour, in clear disregard/ defiance of the explicit advisory issued to them by NSE in February 2025, amply demonstrates that unlike the vast majority of Foreign Portfolio Investors and other market participants, [Jane Street] Group is not a good faith actor that can be, or deserves to be, trusted,"" the regulator said.

""The integrity of the market, and the faith of millions of small investors and traders, can no longer be held hostage to the machinations of such an untrustworthy actor,"" SEBI added.

Deven Choksey, founder and managing director of wealth management firm DRChoksey FinServ, said SEBI's crackdown on Jane Street sets a ""good example.""

""Any player who is abusing the market requires to be shown the discipline. The regulator is doing their job for keeping intact the market integrity,"" he told CNBC.

While the execution of trades can be customized based on the needs and profile of the trader, price discovery in the market should be ""universal for all,"" Choksey added.

Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities, noted that some companies may ""get into the market with creative and innovative strategies to exploit investors."" Therefore, SEBI needs ""to protect the interests of retail investors,"" he added.

Any impact on markets as a result of this decision will be short-term, Bathini said.

SEBI's move comes as several other global trading firms, from Citadel Securities and IMC Trading to Millennium and Optiver, have been stepping up their presence in India, to ride on its booming derivatives markets, which is the world's largest by contracts traded.

The Indian regulator had previously expressed concerns over practices such as algorithmic trading, which SEBI said in a September 2024 report allowed proprietary traders and foreign portfolio investors to make 610 billion Indian rupees in profits in FY 2024, while retail investors and other market participants lost the same amount during that period.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Friday as investors await details on the U.S.' trade deals ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's deadline for higher tariffs next week.

Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark ended the day flat at 39,810.88, while the broader Topix index was flat at 2,827.95.

In South Korea, the Kospi index ended the day 1.99% lower at 3,054.28, while the small-cap Kosdaq declined by 2.21% to 775.80.

Mainland China's CSI 300 index added 0.36% to close at 3,982.20, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.64% to end the day at 23,916.06.

Over in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 ended the day flat at 8,603.

Meanwhile, India's benchmark Nifty 50 fell 0.17% while the BSE Sensex was down 0.18% as at 12.15 p.m. Indian Standard Time.

Overnight stateside, a better-than-expected jobs report eased investors' concerns of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to fresh record highs.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 344.11 points, or 0.77%, settling at 44,828.53. The S&P 500 added 0.83% to close at 6,279.35, while the Nasdaq gained 1.02% and ended at 20,601.10. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed at records.

U.S. markets are closed on Friday for the Independence Day public holiday.

Indonesian stocks traded in negative territory for the fourth consecutive day as the Jakarta Composite Index declined as much as 0.42% Friday.

The country's central bank reportedly said on Thursday it will cut interest rates again after two reductions so far this year. This comes as the economy grew at its slowest pace in more than three years in the first quarter, according to Bank Indonesia's governor Perry Warjiyo.

Indonesia will reportedly sign a $34 billion pact with trading partners to support imports from the U.S., two days before the higher tariffs kick in on July 9.

This is in line with the country's efforts to strike a trade deal with Washington, Reuters reported.

The deal includes an increase in the import of fuels as well as investments by Indonesian companies in energy and agriculture sectors in the U.S., Minister Airlangga Hartarto reportedly said on Thursday.

The Southeast Asian giant's flag carrier Garuda Indonesia is also reportedly in talks to buy up to 75 Boeing jets.

Jakarta is facing a 32% tariff and has previously offered to increase U.S. imports to facilitate trade talks between the two sides.

The Taiwanese dollar appreciated against the greenback Friday as investors assessed the impact of potentially higher U.S. tariffs on exports as the duties reprieve deadline looms.

The Taiwanese dollar had strengthened 0.25% against the greenback to 28,849 as of 12.55 p.m. local time, after hitting its highest level since Apr. 7, 2022, earlier in the session.

Meanwhile, the benchmark Taiex index was last seen down 0.67%.

The weakness was led by the energy, industrials and healthcare sectors, according to data from LSEG.

The worst three performers were Century Iron and Steel Industrial which had plunged 10%, Cosmo Electronics Corp which declined 7.29% and Asia Optical which dropped 6.67%.

Meanwhile, shares of tech giants Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Hon Hai Precision Industry — known globally as Foxconn — were last seen trading 0.46% and 2.13% lower, respectively.

Indian stocks started the day flat Friday as investors assessed the possibility of a trade deal and digested the Securities Exchange Board of India's ban on U.S.-headquartered trading firm Jane Street over alleged market manipulation.

Alibaba Group is seeking to raise around HK$12 billion ($1.53 billion) through exchangeable bonds to fuel its global cloud infrastructure and commerce push, the Chinese tech giant said in an exchange filing.

The bonds will not pay interest over time, and investors can later exchange them for shares in Alibaba Health, a subsidiary in which Alibaba Group holds approximately 64% of equity interest.

The fundraising plans come after the Group raised $5 billion through a dual-currency bond in November.

This week, Alibaba Cloud revealed new data centers in the Philippines and Malaysia. Its commerce business also reportedly announced a subsidy program totaling 50 billion yuan ($6.4 billion) over the next 12 months.

Japan's average household spending surpassed expectations and rose 4.7% year-on-year rise in real terms, government data released Friday showed.

The reading is its highest since August 2022 and exceeded the 1.2% median forecast by economists polled by Reuters.

In quantitative terms, household spending reached 316,085 yen ($2,183.49) in May, while the average monthly household income ticked up 0.4% year on year in real terms to 522,318 yen.

Household spending, which captures consumption trends, are among the key factors monitored by the Bank of Japan in deciding whether to raise interest rates.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade pact with Vietnam on Wednesday, but its scant details have left economists wondering about what it would mean for the flow of Chinese goods rerouted through the country.

Trump said Wednesday there would be a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 40% ""transshipping"" tariff on goods originating in another country and transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the U.S.

Chinese manufacturers have used transshipping to sidestep the hefty tariffs on its direct shipments to the United States, using Vietnam as a major transshipment hub.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro alleged that around one-third of Vietnam's exports are rerouted from China and described Vietnam as ""essentially a colony of communist China"" in a interview with Fox News in April.

The latest deal is an apparent strike against such rerouted shipments from China, said Yao Jin, an associate professor of supply chain management at Miami University.

But enforcing targeted levies on transshipments will be a tough task for Hanoi, as it will have to define the scope of what would qualify as ""made in Vietnam"" and what constitutes transshipment.

""If it only applies to pure transshipments — goods sent from China to the US via Vietnamese ports, without any local assembly — then there should hardly be any impact on Vietnam,"" Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC Bank told CNBC on Friday.

However, if the 40% tariff applies to ""all Vietnamese goods with even a minimal share of Chinese components, the disruptions could be significant,"" Neumann said.

Similarly, Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group, said ""it is unclear how this would work — presumably the burden falls to Hanoi on the issuance of rules of origin certificates — and what level of Chinese components, if that is the metric, will be deemed too much.""

As more Chinese manufacturers moved their production to Vietnam since Trump's first term, Vietnam's trade surplus with the U.S. more than tripled to a record high of $123.5 billion last year from less than $40 billion in 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The agreement made Vietnam the latest country, after the U.K. and China, to secure some trade relief from Trump and will likely serve as an important reference for other Southeast Asian nations in their ongoing trade negotiations, analysts said.

Many countries are racing to reach trade deals with the U.S. before the 90-day pause expires on July 9, when Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs are poised to take effect.

Many Southeast Asian nations had benefited from the last U.S.-China trade war during Trump's first term by serving as alternative manufacturing and export hubs.

More trade deals will be determined by a country's own judgment of its exposure to the U.S. and China markets, the level of transshipment activity in that country, and the implications for local industries, said Lynn Song, chief China economist at ING.

Shipments from China to many Southeast Asian countries this year rose to a record high, Chinese customs data showed, as exporters diverted shipment to alternative markets to sell to the local markets or transship to the U.S.

If the Vietnam and U.K. trade deals are any indication, the United States' future deals with other countries will likely involve measures to rein in transshipment, increased purchase commitments of U.S. goods and ""provisions aimed at pressuring China,"" Stephen Olson, former U.S. trade negotiator and current visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told CNBC.

The strict security requirements for steel and pharmaceuticals in the U.S.-U.K. deal are widely seen as an attempt to squeeze China out of the British supply chain.

China pushed back against the U.S.-Vietnam trade deal on Thursday over concerns that the Trump administration would use its ongoing tariff negotiations with third countries to curb its exports.

The country's commerce ministry said Thursday that it was ""conducting an assessment"" of the agreement, urging other countries not to seek a deal with Washington at the expense of China's interests.

China will likely see Washington as using ""reciprocal tariff negotiations to get third countries to try to squeeze China out of supply chains,"" Olson added. He expects Beijing will pressure countries not to accede to U.S. demands and push back against that practice in negotiations with Washington.

That said, Beijing will likely hold off from taking any concrete action until details of the deal are clarified, experts said, while waiting to see how other countries' trade deals shape up.

""Flipping the table over a single Vietnam trade deal would be unwise,"" ING's Song said.

The U.S. and China have in recent days walked back a slew of restrictive measures against each other in honor of the trade consensus reached in Geneva, Switzerland, in May. Washington has since lifted export restrictions on ethane, chip-design software and jet engine parts, while Beijing is set to fast-track approvals for rare earths exports.

Both sides reached a trade framework last month following talks in London, which remains in effect until mid-August, with Chinese goods currently facing tariffs of around 55%.

The U.S.-Vietnam deal also implies that the ultimate tariffs on Chinese goods are unlikely to fall under that 40% threshold, according to Nick Marro, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, as lower duties on direct shipment from China could encourage firms to shift production back there, undermining the Trump administration's broader objective of curbing China's industrial capacity.

The U.S. told GE Aerospace Thursday that it can restart jet engine shipments to China's COMAC, according to a person familiar with the matter, in a further sign of de-escalating U.S.-Sino trade tensions that included concessions from Beijing over rare earths.

The United States this week also lifted restrictions on exports to China for chip design software developers and ethane producers, suggesting trade talks between the two countries are moving forward.

License suspensions and new license requirements on the different exports had been issued several weeks ago as part of the ongoing trade war between the world's two biggest economies.

GE did not respond to an email request for comment, nor did the Commerce Department, which notified GE it could restart shipments.

Licenses for GE Aerospace affect engines sold to China's state-owned aerospace manufacturer COMAC, which wants to compete internationally against dominant plane makers Airbus and Boeing.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The restrictions were among the many countermeasures imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in response to China's export restrictions on rare earths and related magnets in April.

Beijing's move on rare earths, part of retaliation against Trump's earlier tariffs this year, has upended supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors. The issue threatened to scupper a bilateral trade deal.

The license suspensions lifted for GE affect LEAP-1C engines to COMAC for its C919 single-aisle aircraft, and GE's CF34 engine for COMAC's C909 regional jet, according to the person familiar, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The LEAP 1-C engines are the product of a joint venture between GE Aerospace and France's Safran.

The C919 is made in China but many of its components come from overseas.

At least one other aerospace company also had its license suspensions for China lifted on Thursday, according to another person, who declined to identify the company.

Honeywell Aerospace has supplied COMAC's C919, too, providing an auxiliary power system, wheels and brakes, flight control package, and navigation package. Honeywell did not return a request for comment.

Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of RTX, which also supplies components for COMAC, declined to comment on the status of its licenses.

In recent weeks, the U.S. also suspended licenses for nuclear equipment suppliers to sell to China's power plants. U.S. nuclear equipment suppliers include Westinghouse and Emerson.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) — A silent transfer of control is reshaping the $2.1 trillion Bitcoin (BTC-USD) market.

A steady stream of sales by long-time whales — miners, offshore funds and anonymous wallets — is being met almost one-for-one by demand from institutional players like ETFs, corporates and asset managers. The result: Bitcoin is struggling to break out of its record high around $110,000, volatility is evaporating, and its place in the investment landscape is being reshaped.

Despite a flurry of bullish headlines — from corporate treasuries embracing Bitcoin to the Trump administration's full-throated crypto endorsement — the largest digital currency has remained stuck in its trading range for months. Underneath the surface, long-dormant whales have been trimming positions just as institutions ramp up their buying. And this switchover is gradually recasting Bitcoin's identity from a high-octane trade to a slow-burn allocation.

Over the past year, large holders, or Bitcoin whales, have offloaded more than 500,000 Bitcoin — worth over $50 billion at current prices — according to data compiled by 10x Research. That's roughly equal to the net inflows into the wildly successful US exchange-traded funds since their approval. And it's not far off from the $65 billion amassed over the past five years by crypto treasury pioneer Michael Saylor and his firm, now known as Strategy (MSTR).

Many of these whales trace back to Bitcoin's earliest cycles, when it traded far below current levels. In some cases, whales aren't simply selling, they're swapping tokens for deals tied to the stock market, bypassing the open market.

“What we're seeing is a churning in the base,” said Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis Capital. “A less covered driver and potential reason for the churn and increasing network activity seems to be driven by whales converting their BTC into equity exposure through in-kind contributions of BTC into financing transactions tied to the public markets.”

Institutions — from ETFs and Saylor's Strategy to dozens of corporate imitators — now control about a quarter of all Bitcoin in circulation. Back in 2020, researcher Flipside Crypto estimated that about 2% of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency's blockchain controlled 95% of the digital asset. The power dynamic is shifting fast.

“Crypto is becoming less of an outlier and more established as a legitimate asset class,” said Rob Strebel, head of relationship management at the trading firm DRW, which includes crypto-focused arm Cumberland. Alongside that shift, “we expect to see a compression in volatility.”

That appears to be already taking place, dampening one of the most alluring aspects of Bitcoin to many traders. A closely watched measure of price swings has declined to the lowest level in about two years, according to Deribit's BTC Volatility Index. The gauge monitors the 30-day forward-looking annualized expectations of volatility.

While the whales cut exposure, ETFs, treasury companies and other institutions combined have absorbed nearly 900,000 coins in the past year, according to 10x Research. These players now hold about 4.8 million coins, out of about 20 million Bitcoin in circulation.

But even as institutions bring stability and legitimacy to the asset class, some observers warn they're also providing the long-awaited exit ramp for whales, raising the risk that it's retail and retirement investors left holding the bag if crypto sentiment falters.

“The goal for a long time has always been to make Bitcoin a palatable asset for institutional investors to provide exit liquidity in volume so the whales could cash out,” said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University's Washington College of Law, a long-time crypto skeptic.

After two straight years in which the price more than doubled, Bitcoin is still hovering around levels reached at the start of the year, despite President Donald Trump's pro-crypto agenda.

Some analysts now expect Bitcoin's appreciation to be capped at 10% to 20% a year. That's a far cry from 2017's almost 1,400% surge that pushed the token into the mainstream.

“Bitcoin is probably more like boring dividend stock over time,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca. “On average it goes higher every year, but by less and less amount. It becomes more of an attractive retirement asset.”

Still, the picture is incomplete. Not all whale activity is visible, and Bitcoin could prove ever-volatile soon enough, especially if a new market catalyst emerges.

Regardless, one big risk right now is imbalance: If Bitcoin whales resume selling at scale while institutional flows plateau, the market could tip into steep declines. Outflows of just 2% in 2018 and 9% in 2022 triggered Bitcoin price drops of 74% and 64%, respectively, according to 10x Research.

“We are nearing a point where the market is hitting its peak,” said Fred Thiel, chief executive officer of Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings Inc., which has yet to sell any of its Bitcoin holdings. “My personal belief, however, is we are in a very different market dynamic today.”

All told, the shift from anonymous whales to institutional allocators may help sustain the current market dynamic for an extended period.

“This can go on for a long time — years,” said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. “It's more of a slow grind, where Bitcoin becomes more of a 10%-20% asset. The nature of Bitcoin really changes.”

A whale who had held onto a Bitcoin fortune for 14 years on Friday started moving the enormous stash of 80,000 BTC—worth $8.6 billion at today's prices. 

The coins started moving in batches of 10,000 BTC, or about $1 billion in BTC, early morning New York time on Friday, data from Arkham Intelligence shows. By 11 a.m. Eastern Time, the $8.6 billion in crypto had been shifted to new addresses. 

Eagle-eyed blockchain observers were quick to point out on X that the movements came from an entity that had received the coins back in 2011 as ""coinbase"" transactions—the first transaction in a block created by miners. When miners create new blocks on the blockchain, they are rewarded with newly minted digital coins. 

THE FINAL BTC BILLIONAIRE ADDRESS JUST MOVED $1.1 BILLION BTC

A single entity that controls $8.6 BILLION of BTC has moved their final 10K wallet.

— Arkham (@arkham) July 4, 2025



CryptoQuant's head of research Julio Moreno told Decrypt: ""It is the largest daily movement of coins aged 10 years or more in history."" He added that the previous record for a whale that held onto crypto for this long was a transaction of 3,700 BTC, which pales in comparison.

Crypto analyst for CryptoQuant J.A. Maartun wrote on X: ""In eight years of analyzing Bitcoin, I've never seen anything like this,"" noting that the entity linked to the Bitcoin addresses which made transactions on Friday has over the years held about 200,000 BTC at one point.

Conor Grogan, the director of America's biggest crypto exchange Coinbase, posted on X that the entity linked to the addresses had a fortune of $21.5 billion—making them one of the top five largest holders of Bitcoin in crypto history.

Grogan added that if he had to guess, the Bitcoin wallet likely belongs to an ""OG miner,"" meaning someone who was very early to mining BTC on the network. 

In the world of crypto, a whale is someone who holds a large amount of digital coins and tokens. A Bitcoin whale is usually defined by an entity that holds 1,000 BTC—worth $108 million at today's prices—or more. 

Experts previously told Decrypt that although difficult to tell, whales are not always individual investors but also companies that got involved in mining crypto early. Though, given that the stash of coins moving today were acquired years before the industrial Bitcoin mining age, it's anyone's guess as to whether the holdings belong to a single person or group.

Bitcoin was recently trading for $107,895 per coin, according to CoinGecko, after dropping by nearly 2% over a 24-hour period. The leading cryptocurrency is about 4% down from the record high of $111,814 it set in May. 

When whales start moving their coins after years of ""HODLing,"" markets tend to move as investors expect imminent selling and therefore downward price action.

About us

Copy link

Michael Saylor just provided the biggest sign that Bitcoin is about to skyrocket to $120,000. 

That's according to Bitcoin analyst James Check, who said that the fact that Saylor's new preferred stock instruments are up as high as 15%, adds a “critical signal” that the top cryptocurrency's price is about to rip. 

“I suspect it takes us to $120,000 quickly,” Check wrote in his latest newsletter Checkonchain, saying this is the kind of behaviour that often happens before some big price movements.

His comments caps a week where analysts have flooded the interwebs with bullish predictions that Bitcoin can surge as high as $136,000 in July. 

The reasons for the optimism? Easing tension in the Middle East, the expectations that the US government will unleash a wave of liquidity, and US President Donald Trump's lasting support of the industry. 

Check also argued that onchain data supports that Bitcoin is about to surge. 

Implied volatility in options markets is near record lows, which can be a prelude to sharp moves, he said. 

Short interest is building in futures markets, raising the risk of a squeeze. Monthly stablecoin inflows are ranging between $4 billion and $6 billion, said Check. 

Meanwhile, the “Realised Cap” — a measure of actual capital stored in Bitcoin — is racing toward $1 trillion. It suggests that big money is quietly buying, Check said.

The surge of Saylor's preferred stock trio is part of that trend, Check said.

Saylor announced his three preferred stock offerings this year.

While all three shares have surged, Check said that it was particularly notable that STRK is leading the rally. It is up 15% in the past week. 

Check said it was notable because it pays a steady yield to investors and also converts into MicroStrategy stock if shares explode higher. The fact that it's soaring shows that traders want exposure to Strategy stocks — and by extension, Bitcoin gains, Check said.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has been a relentless buyer of Bitcoin. The company has accumulated upwards of 597,000 Bitcoin worth about $63 billion, according to Bitcointreasuries.net.

While most of that came from Saylor's unique convertible bond scheme, interest for his newest stock offerings has skyrocketed. 

Still, not everyone is convinced about Strategy's business plan.

Renowned short seller Jim Chanos — famous for calling the Enron fraud in 2001 — has been actively targeting the premium between Strategy stock and the value of its underlying Bitcoin holdings.

In fact, Chanos has called Saylor's latest bout of financial engineering, “complete financial gibberish,” and said Strategy investors must be “crazy.”

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) are showing signs of strength heading into the weekend. BTC has broken out of its recent consolidation phase, climbing above $109,000 and moving closer to its all-time high. Meanwhile, ETH and XRP followed BTC's footsteps, closing above their key resistance levels, which suggests a bullish outlook and potential for continued upside in the near term.

Bitcoin price broke and closed above the upper boundary of a consolidation zone at $108,355 on Wednesday, rallying 3.64% by Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers at around $109,000.

If BTC continues its upward momentum, it could extend the rally toward the May 22 all-time high at $111,980.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 58 after rebounding from its neutral level of 50 on Tuesday, indicating bullish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the daily chart displayed a bullish crossover last week. It also shows rising green histogram bars above its neutral level, suggesting bullish momentum and indicating an upward trend.

However, if BTC faces a correction and closes below its support at $108,355, it could extend the decline to retest the lower boundary of the consolidation zone at $105,333.

Ethereum price rose nearly 7% on Wednesday after it rested its 50-day EMA at $2,445 and closed above the daily resistance at $2,461. It continued its upward trend and gained slightly the next day. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers at around $2,500.

If ETH continues its upward trend, it could extend the rally toward its next daily resistance level at $2,724.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 56, above its neutral level of 50, indicating that bullish momentum is gaining traction. The MACD indicator on the daily chart displayed a bullish crossover on Wednesday. It also shows rising green histogram bars above its neutral level, suggesting bullish momentum and indicating an upward trend.

On the other hand, if ETH faces a correction, it could extend the decline to retest its daily support at $2,461.

XRP price broke above the descending trendline (drawn by connecting multiple highs since mid-May) on Monday and found support around it on Wednesday. On Thursday, it closed above its daily resistance at $2.23. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers at around $2.24.

If XRP continues its upward momentum, it could extend the rally toward its May 23 high of $2.47.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 54, above its neutral level of 50, indicating that bullish momentum is gaining traction. The MACD indicator on the daily chart displayed a bullish crossover last week. It also shows rising green histogram bars above its neutral level, suggesting bullish momentum and indicating an upward trend.

XRP/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if XRP falls and closes below its 50-day EMA at $2.21, it could extend the correction to retest its daily support at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

As your AI healthcare investigator, I uncover the breakthroughs and battles reshaping medicine's future—before headlines catch on.

Ethereum's ongoing evolution as a decentralized infrastructure backbone is colliding with the realities of Layer-2 competition, creating a paradox: while Ethereum's core network fundamentals strengthen, its dominant Layer-2 platform, Coinbase's Base, faces outflow pressures. This dynamic reflects a broader reallocation of capital within the blockchain ecosystem, driven by institutional strategies prioritizing scalability, cost efficiency, and regulatory clarity. Here's why investors should focus on Ethereum's core while navigating the crosscurrents of Layer-2 competition.



Ethereum's resurgence isn't just about price—it's about the deepening institutional conviction in its foundational role. DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) hit $112 billion by June 2025, a 30% increase since late 2024, driven by protocols like AAVE (which commands 60% of the lending market). Meanwhile, Ethereum's supply has trended deflationary post-Merge, with a net reduction of 346,000 ETH due to more burn than issuance. 

Institutional capital is following these fundamentals. Ethereum ETFs saw $1.16 billion in monthly inflows in June 2025—up 10x from January 2024—totaling $10.32 billion under management. SharpLink Gaming's 198,000 ETH corporate treasury and BitMine Immersion's $250M Ethereum-focused fund highlight how enterprises are diversifying beyond Bitcoin. This isn't just speculative interest; it's about Ethereum's role as a settlement layer for stablecoins (USDT, USDC) and its modular roadmap, including the Pectra upgrade doubling blob capacity to 6 per block.

Coinbase's Base, while processing 7.5 million daily transactions in Q2 2025, faces headwinds that underscore the risks of betting on any single Layer-2. A $237M ETH whale deposit to exchanges in June—likely tied to Base's token (BASE) sell-offs—highlighted short-term volatility. Base's success has been tied to retail-driven momentum, such as memecoins and airdrops, but its reliance on Ethereum's mainnet for settlement (via blobspace) means its fate remains tethered to Ethereum's core. 

The outflows reflect a broader truth: Layer-2s are nodes in Ethereum's network, not independent ecosystems. While Base's high fees (spiking during “blobscription” events) and centralized governance model may deter long-term institutional adoption, its role in driving Ethereum's TVL growth remains critical. The real risk isn't Base's performance alone, but whether Layer-2s collectively can sustain Ethereum's growth without draining its mainnet's value accrual.

Institutional players aren't fleeing Ethereum—they're optimizing their allocations. The SEC's pending decision on whether Ethereum ETFs can stake holdings will unlock yield-driven demand, but the real play is in Ethereum's ecosystem. For example, Robinhood's Arbitrum-based Layer-2 integration, offering tokenized equities and staking, shows how Ethereum's modular design is attracting traditional finance. 



Institutions are treating Layer-2s as tools to access Ethereum's utility, not standalone investments. This means capital reallocation is happening within Ethereum's ecosystem, not away from it. The key is to bet on Ethereum's core—its deflationary supply, DeFi dominance, and protocol upgrades—while being selective about Layer-2 exposure.

The risks are twofold. First, Ethereum's validator centralization (Lido, Binance, Coinbase control ~40% of staked ETH) threatens its decentralization ethos. Second, regulatory hurdles like the SEC's stance on staking remain unresolved. If Ethereum ETFs can't stake, institutional inflows could stall. 

The Ethereum ecosystem is evolving into a scalable, institutional-grade platform, even as its Layer-2 nodes face growing pains. The reallocation of capital isn't a retreat from Ethereum—it's a repositioning toward its core strengths. Investors who focus on Ethereum's fundamentals while navigating Layer-2 trade-offs will position themselves for the next leg of its journey.

Altcoins have sagged as U.S. President Trump sparked trade tensions, preparing to send tariff rates letters letters to trading partners.

Cryptocurrencies including DOGE, XRP and SOL posted losses Friday morning.

Trump told the media that ""10 or 12"" letters would be sent Friday, with more to follow over the ""next few days.""

Major altcoins have dropped after U.S. President Donald Trump stirred up trade tensions by threatening tariffs once again, while the controversial “Big, Beautiful Bill” passed its final hurdle in Congress on Thursday—much to the dismay of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

XRP has dropped 2.8% over the past 24 hours, with Solana falling 2.6%, and Cardano 4%. Fan favorite Dogecoin has also tumbled by 4% and Hyperliquid 4.7%.

“President Donald Trump signaled that new tariff notices could be issued as early as Friday, aiming to increase leverage ahead of the July 9 trade negotiations,” an analyst at derivatives exchange Bitunix said in a note shared with Decrypt. “This move signals a potential new round of escalation in U.S. global trade policy. Markets are concerned about further deterioration in global trade and its impact on economic outlook.”

Trump told reporters that “10 or 12” letters were set to be issued on Friday, notifying countries of tariffs ranging between 10% to 20% or 60% to 70%. More letters are set to be issued “over the next few days,” the President said. 

The move comes ahead of the 90-day freeze of U.S. tariffs expiring on Wednesday, July 9. These tariffs were originally announced during Liberation Day in April, which saw Ethereum slide 6.5% and Dogecoin 9.8% in the day following. 

Since then, trade war tensions have eased thanks to deals struck with China and the UK, prompting markets to rise.

However, tariff anxiety has reignited as the 90-day freeze looms. In turn, altcoins like Jupiter have slumped 6.3% on the day, Worldcoin 6.2%, and Algorand 5.8%, while edgy meme coin Pepe sagged by 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Trump's “Big, Beautiful Bill” passed its final hurdle in Congress on Thursday. 

Tesla CEO and former Trump ally called the bill a “disgusting abomination” back in June. He then went on a public social media tirade, claiming Trump was named in files relating to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump later claimed Musk only turned on him once the richest man in the world discovered that the ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" would cut a mandate relating to electric vehicles—the core of Musk's Tesla business.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, predicted that the bill could result in Bitcoin testing $90,000 this year, despite previously predicting the leading crypto would hit $250,000 this year. Hayes argued that the Treasury would refill its General Account, which may act as a potential liquidity drain from assets like Bitcoin. 

However, Bitcoin has traded sideways since the passing of the bill, with altcoins being the hardest hit.

Exchange listings and strategic partnerships propel select altcoins to outperform a sluggish crypto market.

While the broader crypto market remains subdued, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum posting slight losses, a select group of altcoins have defied the trend, registering substantial gains over the last 24 hours.

These market-defying rallies appear disconnected from general market sentiment, instead fueled by project-specific catalysts, including major exchange listings, deflationary tokenomics, and strategic partnerships.

The performance of these top gainers highlights a market phase where individual project developments are the primary drivers of significant price action, a trend best exemplified by the volatile surge of Humanity Protocol.

Humanity Protocol surged over 33% in the last 24 hours, leading a handful of altcoins to post gains against a sluggish broader market. A new listing on a major South Korean exchange overshadowed controversy surrounding the project's user base as it was added to Bithumb's Korean Won market on July 3.

Trading for the H/KRW pair commenced with an initial reference price of 93.81 KRW. The listing on a prominent South Korean exchange generated significant trading volume.

The price action, however, comes amid concerns over the project's fundamental value proposition. The founder of the palm-scanning digital identity project recently acknowledged that a high percentage of its registered users might be bots, a revelation that strikes at the core of its mission to create a bot-free, human-verified network. The admission has created a polarized environment for the token, with the hype from new exchange listings clashing with questions about its long-term viability.

Also posting gains was FUNToken (FUN), which rose more than 30%. The token, which serves the online gaming and gambling sector, benefited from several bullish developments.

FUNToken was recently listed on the Poloniex exchange, a move intended to increase its global reach and utility. This followed another listing on the HTX Innovation Zone.

The project's deflationary mechanics were also on display with a recent burn of 25 million FUN tokens, part of a strategy to reduce the circulating supply.

The team has also signaled the upcoming launch of more than 40 Web3 games on its platform, which may be contributing to positive investor sentiment.

In the real-world asset sector, Plume (PLUME) saw its value increase by over 6%. The modular Layer-2 blockchain, which is focused on the tokenization of real-world assets, announced a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial.

The collaboration will see the integration of the USD1 stablecoin into the Plume ecosystem, aiming to enhance liquidity and provide a stable medium of exchange for tokenized assets. Furthering its strategic growth, Plume is also collaborating with Web3Labs to align with Hong Kong's regulatory framework for digital assets, signaling a move to expand its presence in the Asian market.

Other tokens on the top-performers list include the privacy coin Zcash (ZEC) and the AI-focused Sahara AI (SAHARA). Zcash's 5.5% gain may be linked to ongoing infrastructure improvements.

An upgrade to the BitcoinVN service has reportedly led to faster Zcash swaps and increased liquidity for the privacy-centric cryptocurrency. Sahara AI, which was up over 4%, appears to be riding the momentum from its recent listing on the Bitunix exchange on June 26, as reported by AInvest. The listing has increased the token's visibility and accessibility, tapping into the sustained market interest in AI-related crypto projects.

Rounding out the list, Wrapped NXM (WNXM), the ERC-20 version of the Nexus Mutual insurance protocol token, gained over 6%. Unlike the other top performers, there was no clear, immediate catalyst for WNXM's price movement.

No major DeFi hacks or exploits have been reported in the past week that would typically drive up demand for decentralized insurance.

Humanity Protocol's Bithumb listing stands as the most prominent example of these individual drivers.

Also known as ""Akiba,"" Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change.

The wait for altcoin season continues as the crypto market is still showing signs of bearish movement. Expectations are high that the altcoin market will begin to rally soon, but not everyone is optimistic that the altcoin season is coming. One of those is market analyst and expert Stockmoney Lizards, who has said that it is not happening soon.

Altcoin Season Is Not Happening Soon

In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Stockmoney Lizards informed their over 160,000 followers that the altcoin season could not be happening anytime soon. The analyst said that it is “not even remotely close”, pointing to the rising Bitcoin dominance as the reason why the altcoin season is still far off.

Analyzing the chart, the market expert explains that despite the Bitcoin dominance having fallen by around 2%, it still doesn't mean much. This is because the dominance is still very strong and continues to trade inside the channel. This channel also charts a possible increase in the Bitcoin dominance from here, which would be detrimental for altcoins.

So far, the Bitcoin dominance has also managed to hold above 65%. While this is not the highest it has ever been, it is still incredibly high, with previous altcoin seasons not happening until the dominance had fallen toward 40%. The analyst doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of an altcoin season, saying it will still come. However, for now, Bitcoin continues to dominate, as he explains that “BTC is the measure of all things.”

Altcoin Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels

As the Bitcoin dominance has risen and the altcoin dominance has fallen, they have gone toward levels not seen in years. For example, the last time the Bitcoin dominance was above 65% was back in 2021 before it crashed to usher in the altcoin season, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Even worse is the Ethereum dominance, which has dropped to 5-year lows. Sitting at only 8%, it is now at levels recorded back in 2020 before the market rebounded from the COVID-19 crash. This has greatly diminished Ethereum's ability to pull the altcoin market up with it.

In the same vein, the altcoin dominance, excluding Ethereum, has now dropped to 26%. The last time that the OTHERS dominance was this low was in 2021. However, this was right around when the altcoin season was starting, suggesting that the current market could be at the cusp of another altcoin run.

Nevertheless, for there to be any sustainable altcoin season, the Bitcoin dominance must first crash. Going by what happened back in 2017 and 2021, at least a 40% crash in the Bitcoin dominance is required to usher in the altcoin season.

When it comes to the wild world of cryptocurrencies, whale concentration in altcoins is a significant factor that can affect how stable the market is and how much trust investors have in it. Some recent data shows that a small number of big holders can really move the needle on prices, which presents both chances and challenges for those of us in the game. As decentralized finance (DeFi) keeps gaining traction, getting a handle on whale dominance is critical for anyone trying to navigate this unpredictable scene. So, let's dive into how whale concentration impacts market dynamics, the potential ups and downs for fintech startups, and some strategies for crypto-friendly small to medium enterprises (SMEs) to protect their investments from price manipulation.

Whale concentration is when a handful of holders own a huge chunk of an altcoin's total supply. This can lead to less decentralization and make the market easier to manipulate, which is a double-edged sword. For example, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing a staggering concentration, with almost 62% of its supply owned by the top 10 wallets. This level of dominance raises eyebrows about market stability and investor trust, since big holders can swing prices significantly.

There are a lot of risks tied to high whale concentration. When these whales offload large quantities of their holdings, it can cause sharp price drops, adding to the overall volatility. This unpredictability can scare off retail investors who are worried about losing money due to manipulation. Governance issues also crop up in DeFi projects, as whale dominance can distort decision-making, favoring the interests of a small group over the community at large. This erosion of trust can take a toll on long-term investor confidence in altcoin projects.

But hold on, there's a silver lining. Centralized altcoins offer a lot of growth potential for fintech startups. By integrating payment solutions like stablecoin salaries, startups can boost their service offerings and attract a wider range of customers. The uptick in stablecoin adoption on freelancer platforms highlights this trend, with more workers wanting to be paid in crypto. Plus, the establishment of funds to speed up blockchain startup growth in Asia adds more fuel to the fire.

So what can crypto-friendly SMEs do to shield themselves from the price manipulation that comes with whale dominance? Here are some strategies worth considering:

First off, diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings is crucial. Don't put all your eggs in one low-cap altcoin basket, since those are easier to manipulate. Spreading your investments across various cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help soften the blow from sudden price changes caused by large holders.

Secondly, go for reputable exchanges. Pick exchanges that have strong anti-manipulation policies and are transparent. Platforms like Binance and Coinbase tend to have better fraud prevention measures compared to smaller, less regulated exchanges.

On top of that, consider using market surveillance tools. Advanced market surveillance solutions that leverage AI-driven analytics can help you detect manipulation patterns like spoofing and wash trading.

Also, it's important to keep your stakeholders informed. Make sure your employees and customers are aware of market risks and manipulation tactics. Knowledge is power, and it can reduce the chances of rash decisions.

And finally, you'll want to maintain emotional discipline. Stick to your trading plan and avoid making quick decisions based on short-term price movements, which can be influenced by big holders.

In a nutshell, while whale dominance in altcoins does come with its challenges, it also opens up opportunities for growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency space. By understanding how whale concentration plays out and employing effective strategies, crypto-friendly SMEs can better navigate the complexities of the altcoin market. Following best practices for crypto treasury management can protect your investments and set your business up for success in a decentralized financial ecosystem. As this market continues to change, being informed and adaptable will be essential to thriving in the cryptocurrency landscape.

Digital Asset's $135M Series E round also includes Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, and DTCC.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng (CZ) Zhao's YZi Labs has invested in Digital Asset, the institutional blockchain platform Canton Network developer.

YZi Labs joins a $135 million Series E round that was first announced on June 24 and includes participation from finance incumbents like Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, DRW, and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).

YZi Labs is the new name for what was formerly Binance Labs. It has been restructured into a family office to manage the personal wealth and investments of CZ, and Binance co-founder, Yi He. CZ described the investment as “merging Wallet Street and blockchain.”

The capital infusion from the $10 billion asset manager aligns a major crypto-native fund with established Wall Street entities, all backing a specific technological approach to enterprise blockchain.

The funding is directed at expanding the Canton Network, a platform designed to facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets for regulated financial institutions. It aims to resolve the persistent challenge of enabling blockchain operations while adhering to the strict privacy and compliance mandates of mature markets.

The network functions as a public Layer 1 with configurable privacy, a structure intended to offer an alternative to transparent public ledgers and siloed, private blockchains.

Digital Asset's platform has demonstrated substantial activity according to Yzi Labs, with reports of it supporting over $1.5 trillion in monthly tokenized U.S. Treasury repo volume. The network currently involves nearly 400 participants from both decentralized and traditional finance sectors.

By allowing institutions to set specific privacy controls, the Canton Network addresses the core conflict between the need for financial confidentiality and the interoperability benefits of a shared ledger. The growth in real-world asset tokenization has been substantial, with the sector benefiting from increased institutional interest in bringing assets like bonds and private credit on-chain.

Ella Zhang, Head of YZi Labs, commented on the firm's involvement.

“Through this investment, YZi Labs is proud to support the mission of bringing tokenized real-world assets into the financial mainstream, and to contribute to the broader goal of advancing global institutional adoption,” Zhang stated.

Her comments position the investment as a move to foster the foundational infrastructure required for merging traditional financial assets with blockchain technology.

The collaboration was also commented on by Digital Asset's leadership.

“This investment from YZi Labs reinforces the growing demand for blockchain infrastructure that meets the rigorous standards of global financial markets,” said Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset.

Rooz added that YZi Labs' background in Web3 infrastructure and scaling emerging technologies makes it a suitable partner as Canton expands its reach. The stated goal for the capital is to enhance the Canton Network's infrastructure, streamline the onboarding of new institutions, and support the interoperability required to manage a higher volume of real-world assets.

Over the next 12 to 18 months, the company plans for additional live deployments from major financial institutions and expansion into new global markets.

Franklin Templeton was the first asset management firm to tokenise a fund. 

Now, it's positioning blockchain at the core of its business.

Since launching the industry's first-ever tokenised fund in 2021, the firm's head of innovation says digital assets will play a key role in the $1.5 trillion asset manager's growth strategy over the next decade.

“Big, public blockchains are going to become the ledgers for the world and global utilities within the next 10 years,” Sandy Kaul, Franklin Templeton's head of innovation, told DL News in an exclusive interview. “There's a tremendous amount of opportunity here.”

The firm's push is part of a strategy to broaden its client base beyond vanilla equity and bond funds, and to increasingly tap alternative assets, including private credit, real estate, and crypto offerings. 

Kaul's comments come as Wall Street increasingly eyes tokenisation as a promising business opportunity. 

Ripple, the crypto company, and Boston Consulting Group, the consultancy, estimate that the entire tokenised asset market could skyrocket almost 8,000% to be worth $19 trillion by 2033. 

Franklin Templeton may benefit from a head start. 

Under the stewardship of CEO Jenny Johnson, the company kicked off its crypto experimentation four years ago.

The firm first entered the crypto industry by launching a tokenised version of its $5 billion Government Money Fund, called FOBXX, on Stellar Lumens and became the first asset manager to do so. 

‘That capital will be freed up if I can settle that transaction immediately.'

The fund now exists on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and a host of other blockchains, which has led to more experimentation. 

“Then we built our node operations, and we started getting rewards for being a node operator, and we started staking,” said Kaul. “We suddenly realised there is so much value being created here.”

In June, Franklin Templeton launched a new yield feature for its fund that lets holders earn yield for every second they hold FOBXX. Typically, the yield for a traditional fund is distributed to the holder at the end of the market close.

Unlike yield earned on traditional funds, which is distributed at the end of the month, the crypto-powered yield feature distributes the money at the end of each day.

Kaul expects this to be a key selling point for large corporate treasuries.

“If I'm putting billions of dollars in and taking it out in the same day, and I lose all that yield, that's a significant amount of money,” said Kaul. 

Franklin Templeton's competitors aren't resting on their laurels, however.

BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity, Guggenheim, and Wisdom Tree have also launched similar tokenised funds over the years. 

The tokenisation trend, the process of putting stocks and bonds on a blockchain, has also caught the attention of fintech stalwarts such as Robinhood. 

On Monday, the company's CEO, Vlad Tenev, unveiled a new tokenised stock offering to a captive audience during an industry event in Cannes, France. 

“It has the potential to become the backbone of the global financial system,” he said.

Kraken and Bybit also launched similar services this week. 

Kaul said the key advantage of blockchain becoming more embedded in finance will be the efficiencies gained around settlement. 

While waiting for an investor's purchase of a stock to settle, which can take up to two days to clear, brokers must put up collateral during that period in case the buyer or seller fails to deliver the cash or securities. 

Tokenisation's key promise is that this collateral will no longer be necessary as settlement times become instant on a blockchain. 

“I'm tying up a lot of capital to guard against operational risks in today's system, that capital will be freed up if I can settle that transaction immediately,” Kaul said.

For all its promises, however, tokenisation still has a very long way to go.

Franklin Templeton's fund has raked in nearly $800 million in investment across 661 different wallet addresses, according to data from rwa.xyz. That makes it the second-largest tokenised treasury fund on the market after BlackRock. 

But these figures pale in comparison to traditional capital markets. 

The entire tokenisation market – stocks, funds, private credit, and government debt – is worth $24 billion. The global public stock market alone was valued at nearly $115 trillion in 2023, according to a World Economic Forum report. 

Kaul chalks up this drag to a regulatory hurdle. 

“We're waiting for the regulations to clarify how we can list our regulated products on crypto exchanges,” she said, adding that after that, it's simply a matter of engaging market makers to drum up liquidity around these products. 

And after that?

“That's when you'll start to see wholesale tokenisation.”

InvestorNews

Bitcoin's next evolution may be defined less by raw megawatts than by rigor—rigor in carbon accounting, regulatory compliance, and balance-sheet discipline. “We are a low-cost provider of hashing*,” says Sheldon Bennett, the CEO of DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSXV: DMGI | OTCQB: DMGGF), “and our HODL** has been growing.” [*Hashing is the high-speed cryptographic computation that secures the Bitcoin network; **HODL—short for “Hold On for Dear Life”—refers to the company's ever-expanding treasury of unsold coins.]

DMG began life in 2017 as the first pure-play public bitcoin miner and has since evolved well beyond the pick-and-shovel model. Today the vertically integrated company operates data centers, develops blockchain software, and—through its fully regulated Systemic Trust Company—custodies digital assets for institutions under stringent AML (anti-money-laundering), KYC (know-your-customer), and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury) standards. That trust subsidiary, Bennett notes, lets DMG earn yield on its coins instead of merely choosing between “sell it” or “hold it,” creating a third, transaction-driven revenue stream.

Investors got a taste of that strategy in the latest financials: second-quarter revenue jumped 26% year-over-year to C$12.6 million as the fleet's average hashrate surged to 1.76 EH/s. Preliminary May data show 31 bitcoin mined on 1.89 EH/s, with the firm briefly touching its 2.1 EH/s target after deploying new Bitmain S21+ Hydro rigs; treasury holdings sat at 350 coins even after opportunistic sales to prune debt with Sygnum Bank. “Our costs are coming down, and we have new revenue lines coming in,” Bennett tells host Tracy Hughes.

Why, then, is the ticker DMGI still a whisper in many portfolios? Bennett points to market psychology: “Most investors look at U.S. markets when they look at bitcoin miners… we're not a U.S.-listed stock.” The company's deliberate aversion to PR noise compounds the obscurity. “We don't put out a lot of fluff… when we do press release, something's happened that everybody should know about.” Recent examples include breaking the 2 EH/s barrier and converting air-cooled rigs to liquid immersion, a move designed to tame summer heat.

Environmental, social, and governance claims in crypto can border on greenwash, but DMG built TerraPool—a clean-power mining collective co-founded with Argo Blockchain—to quantify its carbon ledger. Membership is reserved for miners running on renewables; transactions across the pool are certified carbon-free. “There's no other pool that's OFAC compliant, AML compliant, KYC compliant and carbon neutral,” Bennett says, adding that institutions are already paying a premium for bitcoins bearing that provenance.

At its “To Catch a Token” event in Cannes earlier this week, United States brokerage giant Robinhood introduced 200 tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs, as well as perpetual futures, for eligible European customers, with plans to expand the list of stock tokens to 2,000 firms by the end of the year. 

The Menlo Park-headquartered broker also specifically mentioned that it will offer qualifying EU users tokenized private shares, starting with tokens representing private shares of OpenAI and SpaceX.

However, two days after the announcement was made, OpenAI took to X to distance itself from Robinhood's initiative, stating: “These ‘OpenAI tokens' are not OpenAI equity.” The X post from OpenAI's official account continues:

Following OpenAI's official response, Robinhood's co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev responded on X, confirming that the private company stock tokens “aren't technically” equities.

“At our recent crypto event, we announced a limited Stock Token giveaway on OpenAI and SpaceX to eligible European customers. While it is true that they aren't technically ‘equity' (you can see the precise dynamics in our Terms for those interested), the tokens effectively give retail investors exposure to these private assets,” Tenev clarified.

Robinhood's CEO further added that since the announcement, the trading platform has heard “from many private companies that are eager to join us in the tokenization revolution.” 

As of press time, SpaceX has not publicly commented on Robinhood's latest initiative to tokenize the firm's private shares.

Aside from OpenAI's statement against Robinhood's new private stock tokens, others have expressed concerns that the firm's tokenized stock offerings in general appear to be stuck inside a closed-off system.

In a recent X post, Electric Capital partner and former quantitative researcher, Ren, suggested that the stock tokens are built in a way that resembles a “walled garden,” where only approved wallets can move them around. 

In the post, Ren noted that Robinhood's tokenized stock contracts check “every transfer” against a “registry of approved wallets,” suggesting that only whitelisted users can move the assets. If accurate, this setup would likely block any use of the tokens in broader DeFi applications.

“It's unlikely these tokens can interact with defi,” Ren wrote, adding further that it's “very possible cefi with distribution just outcompetes existing defi protocols.”

However, not everyone agrees with that assessment. A blockchain engineer at Offchain Labs, known as @gzeon on X, suggested in replies that the contracts may not include a whitelist at all. 

Based on their testing, transfers between any wallets still work in a forked environment, which points to a setup that may rely more on blacklisting than whitelisting.

The Defiant reached out to Robinhood for clarification about the contract structure and whether the tokens are intended to remain within a closed ecosystem but did not get a response by publication time.

Robinhood's tokenized stocks are currently deployed on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 (L2) network built on Ethereum, and appear to follow a version of the ERC-20 standard, with compliance restrictions. Ren said that they decompiled the contracts using open-source tools and reviewed their logic, including access control mechanisms and transfer rules.

Eventually, Robinhood plans to move the tokenized stocks to Robinhood Chain, its own Arbitrum-based L2, which the firm also announced in Cannes this week and says will launch in 2026.

The U.S. brokerage giant also said that tokenized tokens — which Tenev called a “trading revolution” — will be eligible for dividend payouts and will be tradable around the clock on weekdays.

In an exclusive interview with The Defiant, Robinhood Crypto's general manager, Johann Kerbrat, revealed that the company is also waiting for regulatory approval to roll out tokenized stocks and perpetuals in the U.S.

The long-term plan, according to Kerbrat, is to build a permissionless blockchain that supports self-custody and potentially more integrations with decentralized tools. Robinhood has also said that it plans to let users move their tokenized stocks to self-custodial wallets, like MetaMask and Rabby, though it hasn't shared a timeline for when that might happen.

Robinhood shares, which trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker HOOD, are down 3.7% today, partially retracing gains of nearly 12% this week.

Chimpers Expands Into NFT-Linked Blind Box Collectibles

collectibles

Long-running Ethereum NFT collection Chimpers is expanding its footprint, teaming with IP incubator 223 to produce physical collectibles, starting with a plush keychain blind box collection featuring the cartoonish Chimpers characters. 

The brand, which has amassed millions of followers across social media platforms, will sell its Series 1 collectible exclusively through 223's online marketplace, with plans to expand into retail in the future. 

“We've built a following of over 1.8 million, but the real goal is turning fans into believers. That shift happens when people can hold a piece of the Chimpverse in their hands,” Chimpers co-founder Jacob Timperley told Decrypt.

He said that 223's “experience and network will bring the Chimpverse to life in a whole new way and allow the Chimpverse to grow, inviting new audiences to discover and engage with us.” 

Another big step in our journey to bring Chimpers to the world!

We're thrilled to partner with @223W0RLD, a spinout venture of JCorp, trusted by 150+ IPs across Web2 and Web3, to bring Chimpers to life!

Get ready for our first ever Plush Keychain Blind Box!

Coming soon. pic.twitter.com/lXokWEhwsM

— Chimpers (@ChimpersHQ) June 30, 2025



The brand's Series 1 plush keychain collectible will be sold via a blind box, or packaging that conceals the content within, providing the purchaser with a surprise upon opening. Once revealed, the buyer will be able to further engage with the Chimpverse utilizing 223's NFC technology, which will unlock an NFT proof-of-collectible, a digital card on Ethereum layer-2 network Base, and more.

“For lifestyle character brands, plush is the emotional centerpiece. It's what fans gift, carry, photograph, and bring into their daily lives. It's often the first product that gets passed down, displayed, or treasured, so it holds significant meaning and is key to start with,” 223 founder Cole Gernum told Decrypt. 

In the future, though, the brand plans to expand the line, but “every product will stay true to the Chimpverse,” Timperley added.

Other NFT collections have expanded beyond their digital roots into physical collectibles in recent years, like Pudgy Penguins. The Ethereum NFT collection created its own toy line called Pudgy Toys that ultimately found its way to the retail shelves of Walmart—and led to more than $10 million in toy sales in less than a year.

""Pudgy Penguins has been a trailblazer in this space, proving what's possible when you combine strong IP with smart distribution,"" said Timperley. ""Their success has opened doors for the entire space unlike any other.""

""That said, our brand is different, our story is different, and the way we got here is different,"" he continued. ""There will never be a shortage of IP, but the ones that truly break through the noise are those that create emotional resonance and build a wide reaching distribution network... we believe Chimpers is well positioned to be one of those standout success stories to prove that Web3-born IP can break out into mainstream.""

Chimpers plush keychains will be sold at an affordable price point, according to Timperley, and Chimpers NFT holders will be guaranteed a spot in the presale. Users will be able to pay via fiat or crypto to secure their plush keychain. 

“This first online release is one of many small, but intentional moves that will drive long-term discovery and growth for Chimpers,” said Timperley. 

“223 and Chimpers will be giving our fans one-of-a-kind experiences and opportunities. We're not thinking small—this is the start of something much bigger,” Gernum said.

Cheaper NFTs Mean Sales Are Surging, But Trading Volume is Plummeting: DappRadar

NFTs

NFT trading volumes saw a quarter-on-quarter plunge of 45%, according to a new report—despite sales surging by 78%.

DappRadar says there's still a healthy interest in digital collectibles, but there's been a ""sharp drop"" in the average prices paid.

In a sign that multimillion-dollar Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks sales are a distant memory, trading volume stood at $823 million in Q2—down from $4 billion a year ago.

A total of 12.5 million sales took place over this three-month period. That compares with 15 million in Q2 2024, but it's a huge jump from the 7 million seen in Q1 2025.

Illustrating how the space is becoming more affordable, the DappRadar report added: ""The art category saw a 51% decrease in volume, but a 400% surge in sales suggesting that prices have dropped significantly, making art NFTs more accessible to a wider audience.""

It's also been a good quarter for domain NFTs, with the report suggesting this is primarily due to a surge in activity on the TON blockchain.

""Telegram users are buying anonymous, number-based domains that can be linked to Telegram accounts without SIM cards, a very specific use case that seems to resonate,"" the report says.

NFT marketplaces have also suffered a double-digit drop in sales. But OpenSea is the exception here, with a quarter-on-quarter rise of 156% as excitement builds for its upcoming $SEA token.

""Many users are now actively trading cheaper collections to farm points in hopes of maximizing their future rewards,"" DappRadar noted.

Elsewhere, dapp users remained fairly constant at 24.3 million—and while gaming remains the most popular category overall, the market share of AI-related projects has jumped to 18.6%.

It was also a gloomy period for hacks, with Web3 losing $6.3 billion as the result of exploits in Q2—one of the highest figures since FTX collapsed. That's a 215% increase compared with the first three months of the year.

""We hoped that after all these years, the industry would have learned its lessons to stay vigilant, to be more careful with user funds, and to mature at least to some degree. But unfortunately, this quarter proved otherwise,"" DappRadar added.

If you've been trying to run an NFT marketplace lately, you know the headache: users on Ethereum can't easily bid on Polygon NFTs, Solana collectors stay isolated in their ecosystem, and God forbid someone wants to use their Arbitrum tokens to buy something on Optimism.

Look, the multi-chain future is already here—it's just unevenly distributed and kind of a mess. That's where LI.FI comes in, and honestly, it's about time someone solved this problem.

Remember when NFTs first exploded and everyone just accepted they had to be on Ethereum? Those days are long gone. Now we've got serious NFT ecosystems on Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, and countless other chains.

Problem is, these ecosystems might as well be different planets. Users are stuck juggling multiple wallets, constantly bridging assets, and missing auctions because their money is on the “wrong” chain. It's driving everyone nuts.

Some marketplaces try to handle this with complex backend systems. Others just shrug and say “not our problem.” Neither approach is winning any fans.

LI.FI is a bridge aggregator that acts like a universal translator between blockchains. Think of it as the ultimate switchboard that connects over 20 different networks.

What makes it perfect for NFT marketplaces? It lets users participate in auctions using whatever tokens they already have, on whatever chain they're on. No more “sorry, we only accept ETH on mainnet.”

And if you want to see exactly which chains they support (spoiler: it's a lot), check out their comprehensive chain list.

Let's be real about the challenges.

When you're accepting bids from multiple chains and tokens, you need rock-solid price oracles. A 2% fluctuation might not matter for a 0.1 ETH NFT, but it sure does for a 100 ETH sale.

Smart marketplaces are building in small buffers to account for slippage and bridge fees. Some even lock in exchange rates at specific intervals during auctions.

Cross-chain transactions mean gas fees on multiple networks. There's no getting around it. The marketplace needs to decide: do they eat these costs, pass them on transparently, or build them into platform fees?

The winning approach seems to be a hybrid: marketplace covers costs up to a threshold, then passes on anything excessive.

Ethereum finality isn't Solana finality isn't Avalanche finality. Some marketplaces are implementing chain-specific auction extensions to account for these differences. If a last-minute bid comes in on a slower chain, the auction clock adjusts accordingly.

The benefits break down pretty clearly:

The NFT marketplaces that survive the next few years won't be the ones with the flashiest UIs or celebrity endorsements—they'll be the ones that solved the multi-chain problem.

By implementing LI.FI or similar technologies, marketplaces are breaking down the artificial barriers between blockchain ecosystems. The end result is what NFTs were always supposed to be: truly portable digital assets that users can trade freely, regardless of which blockchain they prefer.

The technology is ready. The question is: which marketplaces will be first to fully embrace it?

Influencer Marketing Hub » Creator Economy » NFT Whitelisting Campaigns: A New Funnel for Influencer Lead Gen

NFT whitelisting has evolved from a simple presale perk into a strategic lead-generation engine powered by influencer collaborations and community activations.

But how can brands leverage scarce allowlist slots to capture high-intent prospects and drive predictable mint conversions? And which emerging patterns are reshaping one-off giveaways into scalable campaigns with transparent ROI?

Two trends crystallize from leading NFT launches: first, projects now reserve significant presale allocations for creators in exchange for targeted social content and Discord engagement; second, on-chain verification of “notable” holders filters for genuine advocates while sidestepping costly gas-war battles.

By integrating gamified Discord quests, tiered ambassador programs, real-time CRM ingestion, and paid-media retargeting, marketers can architect NFT whitelist campaigns that fuel both mint velocity and downstream nurture channels.

In the following sections, we'll unpack the frameworks, scoring matrices, and tooling strategies that transform NFT whitelists into a precision-engineered funnel, turning every whitelist slot into a qualified lead and every influencer brief into measurable campaign success.




Before detailing models, it's crucial to frame whitelist mechanics as integral components of a structured influencer campaign lifecycle—connecting each entry method to your brief development, content delivery milestones, and performance tracking.

By mapping public sign-ups, Discord gating, and social contests to specific phases in your influencer roadmap (Discovery, Activation, Amplification), you can ensure that whitelist initiatives don't operate in isolation but as a synchronized turn-key module within your broader influencer operations. Integrating these mechanics into your campaign brief template and milestone calendar guarantees clear accountability: who sources leads, who verifies wallets, and who reports conversion metrics.

This contextual framing transforms whitelist launches from ad-hoc giveaways into discipline-driven, repeatable lead-generation playbooks that your agency or in-house team can scale and iterate.

Agencies and in-house marketers must standardize language across campaigns and internal documentation. Choose either “allowlist” or “whitelist” and apply it uniformly in social copy, Discord channels, and email blasts to avoid user confusion.

Clearly articulate what the list entails: early access, discounted price, guaranteed mint, or all three. Embed that definition in your project's FAQ, landing page headers, and bot-driven auto-responses.

A consistent term helps signal professionalism and sets clear expectations for prospective leads.

There are three primary entry models that NFT projects deploy:

Each model should tie back into your CRM or campaign dashboard. Whether you use webhooks to feed Form entries into a marketing automation platform or link Discord roles to a tracking database, ensure that every lead's origin is identifiable so you can segment and retarget based on entry source.

Scarcity is the secret sauce of high-intent funnels. By capping whitelist spots to a fraction of the total supply, often 10-20%, you create urgency and drive rapid entry. Equally critical is enforcing “one spot per wallet.”

As one creator noted, “They might have 1000 white list spots and you commit one per wallet”, guaranteeing genuine, unique registrations and preventing gas war attempts or bot stacking.

By architecting these mechanisms deliberately, you not only safeguard against dilution and bot abuse but also build an early funnel stage that maps directly to sales KPIs—form submits, Discord engagements, and ultimately, mint conversions at presale price points.

Mastering whitelist mechanics equips influencer marketers with a modular toolkit that streamlines both brief creation and campaign execution. When you codify entry models into your influencer operations blueprint, you reduce ambiguity in deliverables—creators know which tasks unlock whitelist spots, internal teams track sign-ups in real time, and finance can forecast presale revenue with precision.

This structured approach shrinks cycle times between campaign kick-off and mint day, enabling rapid A/B testing of entry incentives and instant optimization of community activation.

Moreover, by tying scarcity triggers and wallet limits into your CRM synergies, you create a transparent conversion funnel—from awareness to loyalty—that yields clean attribution for each influencer partnership. In turn, this level of rigor not only bolsters campaign scalability across multiple NFT drops but also provides defendable ROI metrics to brand stakeholders, reinforcing the value of influencer collaborations in emerging Web3 ecosystems.

Check out the 8 Things You Need To Know About Influencer Whitelisting

Integrating influencer whitelist allocations into your broader campaign framework requires more than ad-hoc spot reservations—it demands a repeatable, role-based model that aligns creative deliverables, on-chain verification, and performance analytics.

By defining clear RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) roles for your agency or in-house team—covering influencer sourcing, contract negotiation, whitelist issuance, and post-mint reporting—you transform what can be a chaotic manual process into a streamlined, scaled playbook.

This framework ensures that each influencer's whitelist engagement is tethered to measurable KPIs—social reach, community sign-ups, and mint conversions—captured via UTM-tagged forms, Discord bot logs, and smart-contract event listeners. Such alignment enables marketers to not only secure high-intent leads through creator networks but also to gauge each influencer's impact on presale momentum and downstream secondary-market activity.

Brands should establish clear guidelines for influencer whitelist allocations:

Holding recognized NFTs can itself function as a credential for whitelist invitations. Projects can identify high-value holders via on-chain data queries (e.g., holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, or other blue-chip collections) and extend exclusive invites.

To operationalize this dual-track influencer funnel at scale, leverage specialized platforms that bridge on-chain data with creator management.

For example, integrate a tool like CreatorIQ or Grin to manage briefs, track content approvals, and automate compensation tied to whitelist spot issuance. Simultaneously, deploy an on-chain analytics dashboard—such as a custom Dune query or Nansen integration—to monitor each influencer's referred wallet mint events in real time.

By pairing these systems, marketers gain unified visibility into both social performance (impressions, engagement, referral link clicks) and blockchain outcomes (confirmed mints, secondary-market activity). This convergence empowers you to refine your agency's influencer roster dynamically—doubling down on partners who deliver high-intent leads and reallocating budget from underperformers, while furnishing brand stakeholders with granular ROI reporting that elevates Web3 influencer marketing from experimental to enterprise-grade.

To transform fragmented whitelist entries into a disciplined, performance-driven sales funnel, you must architect each data touchpoint as a lead stage—capturing, qualifying, activating, and converting prospects through integrated systems.

Consolidate all whitelist signup vectors—Typeform entries, Discord bot registrations, Twitter/X contest submissions—into a centralized Customer Data Platform (CDP) such as Segment or mParticle. Configure webhooks to push real-time payloads containing wallet addresses, email, social handles, and entry metadata.

Augment each prospect record with the timestamp of sign-up (critical for time-sensitive drip schedules, as with the 4 p.m. public sale vs. 2 p.m. pre-sale window) and source channel identifiers.

This atomic-level data ingestion ensures every lead enters your CDP with a complete engagement profile, enabling dynamic segmentation based on entry type, referral influencer, or community tier.

Assign weighted scores to leads reflecting both on-chain and off-chain intent signals:

Define a threshold score (e.g., 12 points) to automatically transition leads into a “Hot Presale” segment. Sub-threshold leads (8–11 points) enter an “Engaged Nurture” workflow, receiving educational content on project utility and upcoming influencer activations. This lead-scoring paradigm turns raw sign-ups into prioritized lists for high-touch outreach and optimized ad spend.

Leverage your marketing automation platform (e.g., HubSpot, Marketo Engage) to orchestrate multi-channel nurture streams:

Embed UTM parameters in every communication link to feed back into your analytics dashboard, ensuring seamless channel attribution and performance visibility.

Deploy a unified dashboard (Tableau, Looker, or custom Dune Analytics visualization) to track:

With live visibility into these metrics, campaign managers can reallocate budget in real time—scaling high-yield influencer push campaigns or pausing underperforming community contests.

Tag mints at the moment of transaction confirmation via on-chain event listeners. Automatically enroll successful minters into a loyalty drip sequence featuring:

This retention architecture transforms one-off whitelist conversions into multi-stage customer journeys, bolstering long-term LTV and creating a continuous feedback loop where mint behavior informs future lead-scoring adjustments.

By codifying every whitelist interaction as a quantifiable funnel stage—underpinned by integrated CDP ingestion, granular lead scoring, automated workflows, and live KPI dashboards—marketers achieve enterprise-grade presale precision.

Influencer partners become performance channels against clearly defined ROI benchmarks, and brand teams gain the agility to optimize mid-campaign, ensuring that NFT whitelists serve as calibrated lead-generation engines rather than ad-hoc giveaways.

To safeguard whitelist integrity and amplify genuine brand advocacy, community engagement must pair gamified mechanics with rigorous quality filters, ensuring spots accrue only to high-value advocates, not opportunistic bots.

Construct tiered community quests that organically scale advocacy:

Elevate top contributors—measured by message velocity, thread quality, and moderator endorsements—to “Whitelist Ambassador” status. Arm these veterans with co-branding assets (custom Discord roles, social media badges) and allocate an exclusive block of allowlist spots for them to distribute within their personal networks.

This empowers peer-to-peer vetting: ambassadors recruit only those they deem worthy, exponentially amplifying your reach without diluting lead quality.

Deploy community analytics platforms (e.g., Guild.xyz, Collab.Land) to monitor engagement patterns and flag non-human behavior:

At the campaign's end, survey whitelist participants on: task clarity, perceived value of each engagement mechanic, and preference for future reward structures.

Feed these insights back into your community playbook to recalibrate point weights, retire low-impact quests, and introduce fresh engagement formats. This iterative cycle sharpens your filtering rigor while preserving the gamified excitement that fuels UGC generation.

Strategic Payoff: Rigorous engagement and filtering tactics convert whitelist campaigns into high-fidelity advocacy engines, rewarding true brand champions, not opportunistic speculators. This disciplined approach ensures your NFT presale cohort drives sustained organic reach, produces actionable UGC, and fortifies long-term community health—core imperatives for any agency or in-house team executing influencer-driven NFT launches.

By integrating whitelist mechanics into your influencer briefs, you transform early-access lists from ad-hoc giveaways into precision-engineered lead magnets. Centralizing data ingestion and applying a robust scoring matrix ensures that every wallet address is a qualified prospect, while automated workflows and real-time dashboards enable rapid optimization of campaign performance.

Layering in community engagement tactics—gamified quests, ambassador programs, and behavioral analytics—filters out bots and amplifies true brand advocates. When paired with on-chain qualification and influencer-driven amplification, your whitelist strategy becomes a scalable funnel that delivers measurable ROI and predictable presale revenue.

Embrace these frameworks, refine them through iterative feedback loops, and you'll not only secure high-intent leads for each NFT drop but also establish a repeatable model that elevates your agency or in-house team's Web3 marketing capabilities. Start applying these playbooks today, and watch your next whitelist campaign drive both community momentum and bottom-line impact.

 

NFT creators often build the foundational brand narrative that fuels whitelist interest, and working with specialized platforms for NFT makers ensures your campaign aligns with creator intent and technical standards (see how leading NFT makers optimize collection launches).

Music NFT platforms can offer presale access to fans via allowlists, pairing whitelist slots with exclusive track drops—an approach detailed by top music NFT marketplaces to deepen fan engagement.

Brands can leverage branded blockchain domains (e.g., .eth or .crypto) to verify wallet ownership and streamline whitelist entry, as recommended in the guide to NFT domains.

Sports platforms issue allowlist spots tied to team NFT drops, rewarding premium ticket holders with early mint rights—an approach explored in the analysis of leading sport NFT marketplaces.

Projects lacking in-house blockchain expertise benefit from an NFT marketing agency to architect whitelist mechanics, influencer briefs, and CRM integrations.

Automated tools like NFT collection generators handle metadata and smart-contract creation, freeing marketers to focus on whitelist strategy and community activation.

Look for built-in allowlist management, pre-sale modules, and on-chain whitelist proofs in leading NFT marketplaces to ensure smooth presale experiences.

Real estate firms tokenize assets and grant early presale access via allowlists, capturing high-intent investor leads—a trend highlighted among top NFT real estate companies.

Successful campaigns leverage private NFT Telegram groups with role-gated entry and bot-driven verification to filter genuine community members.

Gaming projects allocate presale spots to beta testers and community contributors, using allowlists to incentivize early engagement—an approach outlined by leading NFT games.

The UK's data regulator has called for public feedback on its international data transfers guidance for businesses.

Formulated by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the guidance contains rules about transferring information to other countries, including International data transfer agreements (IDTAs) and Binding corporate rules (BCRs).

The call for feedback will be open until August 7th, 2025. The ICO warns, however, that the guidance may see changes due to the Data (Use and Access) Act coming into law on June 19th.

The ICO says it's issuing the new guidance to make it easier for businesses to transfer data, boosting business confidence and improving the investment climate.

Aside from the document, the ICO has been working with the G7 and the Global Privacy Assembly towards an agreement on increasing mechanisms for trusted free flows of data. It has also been reviewing adequacy assessments for key trading partners with the help of the government.

A UK parliament committee is calling on the government to amend an upcoming immigration bill, which would allow the government to transfer biometric data from people going through emergency evacuation to other nations or organizations.

“Clauses in the Bill that would allow the transfer of personal biometric data to other nations and international organizations remove vital data protections and should be scrapped,” the Joint Committee on Human Rights said in June.

Clauses 34-35 of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill aim to grant new powers to authorities to collect biometric information, such as fingerprints and facial scans, from people going through evacuation or relocation. The new rule is designed to offer flexibility in an emergency. Unlike the current law, it allows biometric information to be captured without the individual applying for immigration to the UK.

“Clause 34 ensures that there is a clear legal framework for collecting biometric information outside the UK in these exceptional circumstances,” Minister of State Angela Eagle said in March.

The clauses were designed for cases in which the UK government assists the evacuation of British citizens and people who live in families that include British citizens, she adds.

The Human Rights Committee, however, argues that the clauses are not compatible with current UK laws, which demand appropriate safeguards to prevent misuse of the information.

“Transfers of such biometric data to third countries and international organisations are deemed to be necessary for the public interest,” says the Committee. “We are concerned that this automatic assumption does not adequately protect personal data.”

The CEPR Fintech and Digital Currencies RPN, in collaboration with the European Central Bank, Review of Finance and Bocconi University, is organising a two-day conference that will take place in Milan on September 25–26, 2025, on The Future of Payments: CBDC, Digital Assets and Digital Capital Markets.

The programme will feature apolicy panels and invited speakers and Piero Cipollone, Member of the ECB's Executive Board and Chair of the Eurosystem High-Level Task Force on the Digital Euro, will deliver the keynote speech.

Overview

In the early stages of a technological breakthrough, it is often difficult to foresee how the innovation will be used, how rapidly it will evolve, or the magnitude of its impact. This meeting is organised to discuss the transformative role of digital currencies, the new technologies in payment systems and capital markets, with a focus on the innovations that can enhance efficiency, reduce fragmentation, and promote regulatory harmonisation. Integration of these innovations into the existing financial system—and ensuring their widespread adoption—requires the development of a robust institutional and regulatory framework.

In this context, academic research can play a pivotal role by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation needed to understand and navigate potential trade-offs such as the one between privacy preservation and economic efficiency, or to evaluate the costs and benefits of public versus private solutions and the balance between safety and innovation. To promote research on these issues that bear on the economics of digital currencies, the Review of Finance, with the support of CEPR, the European Central Bank and the Fintech Lab, Baffi Centre at Bocconi University, is issuing a call for proposals that will culminate in two research conferences.

Submission of academic contributions

To encourage researchers to engage in innovative, high quality research, the selection of contributions will follow a two-stage process. Successful submissions will be published as part of a Special Issue on ‘The Future of Payments and Digital Capital Markets' of the Review of Finance

First Stage

In the first stage, authors are asked to submit a proposal or an early stage working paper, which outlines the questions they will address, the methodologies they will use, the model framework they will explore (in the case of theory work) or the data they will gather (in the case of empirical work). Authors are encouraged to offer as much detail as possible on the research design and analyses proposed to interpret the results. The organisers are especially interested in contributions that are useful to characterise the financial and economic impact of Central Bank Digital Currencies, as well as other emerging digital assets, on existing payment and monetary system and on capital markets in order to provide useful guidance for policy-makers and regulators.

Members of a scientific committee and the programme organisers will select the proposals/working papers to be presented during the first event in Milano, Italy on September 25-26, 2025.

Travel and accommodation costs incurred by presenting authors will be covered by the organisers.

Second Stage

Papers selected in the first stage will proceed to the next phase with a strong indication of publication potential.

Before the second conference, authors will be required to formally submit their completed papers to the Review of Finance through the journal's standard submission system (standard submission fees will apply). The papers will undergo full peer review, in which the usual standards for publication of high-quality scholarship in finance apply and must be met.

The second stage will be concluded by another conference to be held in Milano, Italy in April 2026, where the final papers will be presented. This meeting will follow the standard finance conference format. Presentations will describe the original intent and actual execution of the study. Reviewers and the editors will evaluate the result. A positive evaluation will imply publication in the Review of Finance. If a proposal does not successfully move past the first stage, this does not preclude the possibility that a completed paper based on the same idea could be submitted to the Review of Finance using the normal submission process at a later time.

Travel and accommodation costs incurred by presenting authors will again be covered by the organisers.

Paper Submission Topics

We encourage proposals for both empirical and theoretical research, as well as interdisciplinary submissions. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)

Resilience, Governance, and Strategic Autonomy

Digital Assets, Payment Infrastructures and Capital Markets

How to submit

The submission window will be open from 12 May to 21 July 2025

Decisions of acceptance of the proposal will be communicated by 5 August 2025

Authors should submit their proposals via the Editorial Express system, following the standard submission instructions on the Review of Finance website. The upload at Step 5 should include the authors' names. At Step 6, please select “Registered Report – The Future of Payments”.

The conference organization is fully funded by Bocconi University and the whole initiative is not for profit. A processing charge of €75 is requested by the Review of Finance Editorial office for the submission of each proposal and should be paid directly to their account. The organisers will not consider proposals that are under review at other conferences or at other journals which accept proposal submissions. If authors are uncertain about whether their proposal meets this requirement, it is crucial to alert the editors and inquire before submitting the proposal to the Review of Finance.

The submission should be prepared in two files: one with a cover page including the author names, affiliations, and acknowledgements; and another as an anonymous copy, which does not contain author information and acknowledgements. In the case of a proposal, this should include the following elements:

Preliminary results are not pre-requisites for a successful proposal, but they are very welcome and helpful for evaluation. Proposals/working papers will be reviewed and selected for presentation by the scientific committee. Authors of papers published in Review of Finance are required to disclose code and data for replication. Questions about the submission process should be addressed to the editorial office of the Review of Finance ([email protected]). Questions about the first conference in Milano may be addressed to the Conference Manager, Elena Suragni, reachable by email at [email protected].

Herborg provided an overview of the report released by G+D in collaboration with OMFIF, which collected responses from 34 central banks worldwide, including the Bank of Ghana, Bank of Thailand, and European Central Bank, and in-depth interviews with senior representatives concerning the implementation of CBDCs into the mainstream banking ecosystem.

G+D has been working on several pilot projects to launch retail CBDCs. Explaining the revolutionary potential of CBDCs, Herborg stated that CBDCs can transfer the benefits of cash into the digital world, and would be a public means of payment without transactions fees or the need of a commercial bank – they will be an alternative method of payment comparable to PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard, intended to expand accessibility and inclusivity. “It's this idea of transferring the capabilities of cash into digital world,” Herborg commented.

Herborg emphasised that CBDCs will not replace commercial alternative payments, but provide a public alternative. Commercial banks will not be left on the sidelines of CBDC innovation, and are involved in the progress with central banks acting as a platform for developing new services.

The report found that 48% of the global central banks surveyed in the report expect to issue a CBDC within the next three to five years, and 50% of central banks are developing CBDCs to preserve monetary sovereignty. Key motivators for implementing CBDCs are financial inclusion, offline payment capabilities, and preserving the role of central banks in emerging markets. However, motivations differ according to region, with Europe prioritising sovereignty and African markets focusing on financial inclusion. Herborg stated that in countries in Africa there has been an influx of mobile money providers, but many come with exorbitant fees on transactions, onboarding, and other features.

Providing examples of pilot projects that have seen significant progress and success, Herborg describes CBDCs launched by the Bank of Ghana and Bank of Thailand. With Bank of Ghana, G+D launched a pilot in a rural area where they provided cards to people without smartphones. Herborg detailed that the users were reluctant at first, but as they followed the project and continued to survey adoption, there was a significant uptake. The Bank of Ghana reported a 60% increase in usage.

“For the people in that village, it was the first digital payment in their life. They had only used cash. We had a use case where people were bringing their cash to the merchant to exchange it to CBDC on a card, because they considered the money on the card to be more secure than the cash. That was definitely a big success, that proved that the technology works and can deliver financial inclusion to people in very rural areas.”

With the Bank of Thailand pilot project, there was also a need for offline support that offered working payment solutions. The report found that 20% of respondents were satisfied with their offline payments functionality, up from 0% in 2023. These onboarding processes were not exclusive to a G+D or Bank of Thailand app, but were integrated into the existing technologies of commercial banks – in this case Siam Bank.

Challenges facing CBDC adoption include political approval, regulatory alignment, and protecting against security breaches. Herborg explained: “If you look at countries in Europe, it's a lot about sovereignty. If you want to pay in Europe, it's not easy to pay without using a non-European payment solution. Here in Germany, I'm not sure I have ever used in any European online payments solution. I use PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard - there are no European solutions. Therefore, sovereignty is a big topic. You can imagine, with the current political situation, it's a risk being dependent entirely on North American solutions.”

Herborg went into detail on the progress of the digital euro from the European Central Bank: “If you look at Europe, there's this huge project of the digital euro. There has a big political policy aspect, because it's not only the European Central Bank that wants to drive the topic, but there's also regulation. Since regulation is currently discussed among the European Commission, there also needs to be political approval. That's another learning, confirmed by that report - technology is one thing in that you have to provide great usability, but it's also about the political process that is needed in order to make it really happen.”

Herborg shared an optimistic outlook for CBDC development in the coming years, highlighting their its potential to enhance the ever-evolving digital payments landscape.

The Bank of Canada took a significant step in exploring the technical feasibility of a digital Canadian dollar, proposing a specific system designed for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) focused on simple, everyday payments, according to a new research paper.  

The central bank's research team examined OpenCBDC 2PC, a model developed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Digital Currency Initiative. This design prioritizes privacy, speed and decentralization by allowing users to hold digital funds directly, much like digital cash.

The new research comes after the Bank of Canada said it is shifting its focus away from a retail CBDC last year, saying that it was prepared if the people of the nation decide such a product is needed in the future.

A major focus of the report is privacy, which isn't a big surprise because CBDCs have sparked debate around the world, in part on concerns they could enable state surveillance of financial activity. Unlike cash, which is anonymous, a CBDC could theoretically allow a central authority to track every transaction. 

The report suggested that the system separates personal identity from transaction data, allowing non-registered users to hold funds in self-custodied wallets. The users could then transact without sharing their identity with a bank or payment processor. Even for registered users, the central bank would not have access to identifying information or transaction histories. 

The report goes further, proposing enhanced protection by potentially using cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs to obscure transaction amounts from the core infrastructure. These features collectively offer a level of privacy that the authors say could exceed that of current electronic payment systems.

In contrast to traditional banking systems, where money is stored in user accounts, the report suggests a design that uses ""unspent transaction outputs"" (UTXOs) — a structure more commonly associated with Bitcoin. 

The system processes transactions in two steps: updating a core ledger and transferring funds from one user's wallet to another. This approach supports real-time settlement and offers a higher degree of privacy from both banks and government institutions.

While the report lays out a detailed technical solution to a potential digital Canadian dollar, it also identifies potential hurdles.

One of the main hurdles is that integrating the proposed architecture with existing retail payment infrastructure could require substantial technical upgrades, including in the way point-of-sale terminals handle digital cash-like transfers. 

Additionally, while the system is scalable in theory, performance dips during audits and system recovery operations need further engineering work to meet production-grade standards.

The paper clearly states that this is not a commitment to launch a CBDC. However, the findings lay out a concrete technical foundation for what such a system could look like— one that balances user privacy, institutional control, and operational resilience. 

Whether the central bank will implement it remains a question, given the controversy surrounding CBDC. However, the timing of the report could be right as Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney, was quoted in his 2021 book as a supporter of CBDCs. 

""The most likely future of money is a central bank stablecoin, known as a central bank digital currency or CBDC,” he wrote in his book.

Financial infrastructure provider OpenPayd has partnered with Ripple to offer compliant, efficient, and scalable payment solutions for enterprise clients.

As part of their collaboration, OpenPayd's global fiat infrastructure, which includes real-time payment rails, multi-currency accounts, and virtual IBANs, is set to support Ripple Payments into EUR and GBP. Ripple Payments, the company's cross-border payment solution, employs blockchain and digital assets, as well as a global network of payout partners to facilitate efficient, transparent, and reliable cross-border payments and on and off-ramps for banks, crypto companies, and fintech firms worldwide.

Furthermore, the alliance with Ripple supports the advancement of OpenPayd's recently rolled out stablecoin infrastructure, which focuses on making money movement instant and more optimal by connecting local and international fiat rails to major blockchains and enabling businesses to view, hold, conduct, and receive payments across any digital currency and rail globally.

Through this initiative, OpenPayd is set to offer direct minting and burning capabilities for Ripple USD (RLUSD). Businesses will be able to convert between fiat and RLUSD by accessing OpenPayd's suite of services, including embedded accounts, payments, and trading, through a single API. As an enterprise-grade, USD-denominated stablecoin, RLUSD was developed to deliver utility and compliance, with the asset being backed by Ripple's experience in working with crypto and traditional finance.

Moreover, the solution can be leveraged for a variety of use cases, including cross-border payments, global treasury management, and simplified access to USD liquidity. With enterprise demand for stablecoins increasing, businesses require real-time infrastructure to manage money worldwide, as well as the ability to do so between traditional finance and blockchains. The collaboration between OpenPayd and Ripple seeks to provide more efficient, transparent, and cost-effective payment flows.

The partnership also underlines a shared commitment to optimising fiat infrastructure and supporting mainstream stablecoin adoption. By working together, Ripple and OpenPayd plan to offer the tools that enterprises need to move and manage money worldwide, while future-proofing their payment strategies through blockchain-enabled finance. Commenting on the move, representatives from OpenPayd emphasised that, by merging Ripple Payments with OpenPayd's rail-agnostic and interoperable fiat infrastructure, the two companies can provide a unified platform that links traditional finance with blockchain.

 US Republican leaders say the House will look to pass bills on stablecoins, crypto market structure and CBDCs in mid-July in what they've dubbed “Crypto Week.” 

US Republican House leaders have pledged to consider three key crypto bills starting in mid-July as part of a regulatory “Crypto Week.”

House Finance Committee Chair French Hill, House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson and Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday that they'd use the week of July 14 to 18 to look over a crypto market structure bill, a stablecoin bill and a bill on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

“House Republicans are taking decisive steps to deliver the full scope of President Trump's digital assets and cryptocurrency agenda,” Johnson said 

“During ‘Crypto Week,' the House looks forward to the timely consideration of three landmark pieces of legislation: the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Senate's GENIUS Act,” he added.

The party's push comes as President Donald Trump said last month that he wants the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act passed as soon as possible, before Congress goes on a month-long break in August.

The bills would begin to deliver on Trump's crypto-focused promises during his campaign, which the crypto industry heavily backed and bankrolled. 

The House is seemingly moving ahead with the Senate-led GENIUS Act over its own similar bill known as the STABLE Act, which the House Finance Committee passed in May but has yet to see a full floor vote.

The Senate passed the GENIUS Act with bipartisan support last month, meaning if the House passes the bill as-is, it'll be sent to Trump to sign into law.

However, legal analysts at Pillsbury Law said on Wednesday that the House could amend “key provisions, including those related to issuer eligibility, state-federal oversight dynamics and compliance requirements.”

If that happens, it'll be sent back to the Senate for a vote to approve the changes.

Lawyers at Troutman Pepper Locke said last Tuesday that the House and Senate may form a committee to reconcile the differences between the GENIUS and STABLE Acts, which would then need approval from both chambers before it's sent to Trump.

A notable difference between the bills is around oversight, as the STABLE Act stipulates strict federal oversight of stablecoin issuers while the GENIUS Act allows for state supervision.

A crypto market structure bill, called the CLARITY Act, could be the next on Trump's desk after the House Financial Services Committee and the Agriculture Committee advanced it on June 10 to put it before the full House.

The bill, which still needs to pass the Senate, stipulates the jurisdiction that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have over crypto.

It would require most types of crypto exchanges to register with the CFTC and lays out rules for disclosure, customer asset segregation and recordkeeping.

Democrats have largely opposed both the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, citing the growing crypto empire Trump and his family are building, which includes a crypto exchange, stablecoin and multiple crypto tokens.

The last bill the House will consider is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which has an identical bill in the Senate in a bid to speed up the legislative process.

Related: New York AG urges Congress to bolster protections in crypto bills 

The bill would prohibit the Federal Reserve from being able to test, develop, create or issue a digital currency in any form and stop the central bank from offering financial products directly to individuals.

The bill was introduced in the last Congress by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, but it expired at the end of that Congress's term after it passed the House in May 2024.

Emmer revived the bill in the current Congress, and the House Finance Committee passed its version of the bill in April, while the Senate version is still sitting in the chamber's Banking Committee.

Lawmakers are expected to push for further legislative victories this month following the passage of President Donald Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' on Thursday. 

This time, policymakers will focus on crypto.

To that end, House Republicans will attempt to move the needle forward on three industry-specific bills during their freshly announced  “Crypto Week,” beginning July 14.

The move is a coordinated legislative effort to pass key digital asset bills in the U.S. House of Representatives in the coming weeks and months, forming part of a broader GOP-led initiative to position the U.S. as a global leader in crypto and financial technology under the Trump administration.

In a post on X, the chairs of the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees announced that they will now shift their attention to the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the GENIUS Act.

“After years of dedicated work in Congress on digital assets, we are advancing landmark legislation to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets,” House Committee on Financial Services Chairman French Hill (R-AR) said in a statement.

Those frameworks include safeguarding consumers and establishing regulatory clarity while prohibiting the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency.

🚨NEW: Chairman @RepFrenchHill, @HouseAgGOP Chairman @CongressmanGT, and House Leadership announced that the week of July 14th will be “Crypto Week,” where the CLARITY Act, Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and GENIUS Act will be considered. @SpeakerJohnson @SteveScalise… pic.twitter.com/vIUoGaoSy1

— Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) July 3, 2025



“Time and again, we have heard the calls for regulatory clarity and certainty in this ecosystem,” House Committee on Agriculture Chair GT Thompson (R-PA) added. “The House Agriculture and Financial Services Committees worked together to deliver CLARITY, and it will soon be time for the House to deliver for the American people and send CLARITY to the Senate.

In April, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act passed out of the US House Financial Services Committee with a 27-22 vote. 

In June, the CLARITY ACT, which would strip the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of oversight power related to the crypto industry, was cleared by the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees. That same month, the GENIUS Act was passed by the U.S. Senate. The bill now awaits a vote in the House.

Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), a leading advocate for crypto in the House, said passing the bills will defend financial privacy and reinforce U.S. dominance in blockchain innovation, making the U.S. a global leader in crypto.

“American innovators are one step closer to having the clarity they need to build here at home while ensuring the future of the digital economy reflects our values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free-market competitiveness,” Emmer said. 

For others, Crypto Week marks a shift in the federal government's stance on digital assets, one that aligns with legislation already enacted across several states.

“In Wyoming, we have worked for nearly a decade to embrace digital assets, and it is exciting to see the federal government beginning to follow in the Cowboy State's footsteps,” Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said.

“As we celebrate crypto week, I am thrilled to partner with Chairman Hill and Chairman Thompson to pass comprehensive stablecoin legislation, establish clear market structure rules, and ensure that any central bank digital currency respects Americans' privacy and financial freedom.”

By working together, Ripple and OpenPayd plan to offer the tools that enterprises need to move and manage money worldwide, while future-proofing their payment strategies through blockchain-enabled finance. Commenting on the move, representatives from OpenPayd emphasised that, by merging Ripple Payments with OpenPayd's rail-agnostic and interoperable fiat infrastructure, the two companies can provide a unified platform that links traditional finance with blockchain.

Ripple Labs has applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a charter as a national trust bank. If the US GENIUS Act for stablecoins is adopted, that would mean it could choose for its RLUSD stablecoin to be federally regulated. Currently the stablecoin is issued via Standard Custody & Trust, a New York regulated trust bank. We explore the reasons for the application, and an issue related to Ripple Labs' XRP holdings that could potentially scupper its chance of success.

On X Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said, “if approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.”The obvious question is: why have two banking charters? The simple answer is to hedge its bets and if Ripple believes the stablecoin will grow quickly, it will need to be OCC regulated sooner rather than later.

Ripple has always been keen to serve institutions, and being a national bank would bring added credibility. It already has a solid legal structure with Standard Custody & Trust, which ringfences the stablecoin reserves. We reported on Tuesday that Standard Custody had applied for a master account – a bank account at the Federal Reserve.

A master account brings two potential benefits. For on and off ramping, the bank can make payments directly, rather than using another bank. But it could also allow the bank to hold part or all of its stablecoin reserves at the central bank. That's something the Trump administration might object to, because it's keen for most stablecoin reserves to be parked in US Treasuries. It will be interesting to see whether politics influences the decision making process.

The Federal Reserve has published its tiered process on applying for a master account. Banks regulated by the Federal Reserve will find it comparatively easy to get a master account and are regarded as Tier 1. Those supervised by the OCC are Tier 2 and will receive more scrutiny. State supervised banks are Tier3, will have a much more arduous process and are more likely to fail. This tiered system explains Ripple's dual strategy.

Ripple might not succeed in getting a national trust charter. The only such license awarded to a crypto firm so far has been to Anchorage Digital. Even if Ripple succeeds, it could take a long time. And the OCC charter makes it more likely to land a master account.

So the short term strategy is to continue using Standard Custody, and try for a master account. And the medium term strategy is the OCC national trust path.

The GENIUS Act only requires a stablecoin of more than $10 billion to be federally regulated, and Ripple is still a long way off from that. But the application is good advance preparation. If it gets the charter, it could choose to become federally regulated even if the stablecoin is still below the threshold. But once it chooses, it would need to stick with the choice.

Ripple Labs wants to become a national trust bank, but they have a big “problem”: they own massive amounts of XRP cryptocurrency on the balance sheet.

International banking rules (called Basel III) are tough on crypto. If a bank holds $100 million in Bitcoin or XRP, they must set aside $100 million in capital as a safety cushion. That's like having to keep a dollar in your savings account for every dollar you gamble with. But it gets worse.

Banking rules also say you can't count “intangible assets” as real capital. Intangibles are things that you own but can't physically touch – like brand names, patents, or cryptocurrencies.

So Ripple faces a nasty double hit. They need $100 million in capital to cover every $100 million in XRP holdings. But they can't count their XRP as part of that capital.

Why not just remove XRP from the balance sheet? Problem solved, right?

Well, Ripple has bought lots of companies (Hidden Road, Standard Custody, Metaco, etc). When you buy a company, you often pay more than its assets are worth, with the extra amount classed as “goodwill.” Goodwill is also an intangible asset that gets deducted from capital.

After all these deductions, Ripple Labs might not have enough real capital left to qualify as a bank.

Of course, Ripple has smart people working on this, so maybe they've found a solution we're not seeing and we haven't viewed their balance sheet. But they also have a simpler fallback option that could make the XRP problem disappear entirely.

Instead of applying through Ripple Labs directly, they could route the federal charter through Standard Custody or another subsidiary. This mirrors how Anchorage Digital operates – it holds the national trust charter as a subsidiary of Anchorage Labs, keeping the parent company's balance sheet separate from banking regulations.

This subsidiary approach would let Ripple maintain its dual-track strategy: continue operating RLUSD through Standard Custody in the short term, pursue the Fed master account, and if needed, convert Standard Custody (rather than Ripple Labs) into the federally chartered entity. While it avoids the Basel III headache, it only gives Ripple one avenue to a Fed master account.

Telegram blockchain startup TOP, also known as The Open Platform, has secured $28.5 million in a Series A round at a $1 billion valuation, officially achieving unicorn status. The funding was led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from Pantera Capital, increasing the company's total capital raised to over $70 million.

 The company's journey began in 2023 when founder and CEO Andrew Rogozov — an entrepreneur with a background in blockchain engineering and app development—formally incorporated TOP in Abu Dhabi. Rogozov and his multinational team, blending Russian and Abu Dhabi-based talent, emerged from Telegram's original TON initiative, which was halted by the SEC in 2020. Undeterred, they continued to develop on TON, quietly laying the foundation for what would become TOP.

Rogozov met his co-founders while working on early versions of Telegram's blockchain efforts. The founding team is notable for its diversity in both geography and expertise, combining experience in blockchain, app development, and product scaling. Their persistence through regulatory setbacks and their ability to regroup and innovate after Telegram was forced to return investor funds in 2020 highlights the team's resilience and vision.

TOP's core mission is to build consumer-facing applications on Telegram's official blockchain, TON (The Open Network). Its flagship product, Wallet in Telegram, is a native, non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that has already gained traction in regions such as Russia and Asia. With the new funding, TOP plans to expand Wallet's availability to the US and Europe, aiming to leverage Telegram's one billion-user reach to onboard mainstream audiences into cryptocurrency.

Beyond the wallet, TOP is developing a diverse portfolio of TON-based applications, including blockchain games, NFT marketplaces, TON-keeper non-custodial wallet, STON.fi, a decentralised exchange (DEX), and AI integrations. 

The company's strategy is to utilise Telegram's massive distribution channel to accelerate the adoption of blockchain-based products, thereby making cryptocurrency accessible to everyday users. By embedding these applications directly into Telegram, TOP is positioned to lower the barriers to entry for Web3 technologies and drive mainstream adoption.

The Series A round was led by Ribbit Capital, a firm renowned for its early investments in Coinbase, Nubank, and Revolut. Pantera Capital also participated, with partner Ryan Barney highlighting the inspiration behind supporting technology that can reach a billion people. Earlier in the year, the TON Foundation revealed that top venture capital firms, including Sequoia and Benchmark, had purchased $400 million worth of Toncoin, further underscoring the growing momentum behind TON.

Telegram's rollout of crypto applications, including Wallet and TON Space, has already reached hundreds of millions of users, driving daily transactions above 1.2 million and pushing the total value locked (TVL) in TON beyond $350 million. The TON blockchain, co-developed by Telegram's founders and maintained by the TON Foundation, now supports stablecoins, NFTs, and mini-apps within chats, demonstrating strong product-market fit.

Telegram rolled out crypto applications like Wallet and TON Space to hundreds of millions of users, boosting daily transactions to over 1.2 million and total value locked (TVL) in TON beyond $350 million The TON blockchain, co‑developed by Telegram's founders and maintained by the TON Foundation, now supports stablecoins, NFTs, and mini‑apps within chats.

TOP's transformation from a small app developer to a unicorn signals a bold step in embedding blockchain applications directly into mass-market communication platforms. By leveraging Telegram's vast user base and the capabilities of the TON blockchain, TOP is poised to redefine how billions of people access and interact with crypto, accelerating the mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies.

CEO Andrew Rogozov emphasised that this investment supports TOP's long-term strategy to scale the adoption of blockchain-based products by leveraging the power of Telegram as a distribution channel. The company's vision is to build a comprehensive Web3 ecosystem within Telegram, making blockchain technology an integral part of everyday digital communication and commerce.

Mark Cuban has always been tech's most pragmatic and outspoken billionaire. As an early internet entrepreneur, a prolific investor on Shark Tank, and the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, he's seen multiple hype cycles come and go. He was an early advocate for crypto's potential but has remained a sharp critic of its excesses.

Now, as the twin forces of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency dominate the conversation, we asked Cuban to weigh in. In this exclusive Q&A, he explains why he thinks AI is on the verge of changing everything, why crypto is still waiting for its big moment, and what the future of work looks like in a world where technology gives “superpowers” to anyone willing to learn.

This conversation has been lightly formatted for clarity. All quotes appear exactly as Cuban gave them.

Gizmodo: You've invested in both AI and crypto. Which one do you think will have the deeper impact on society, and which one will deliver more value to regular people?

Mark Cuban: AI. It's not even close.

Gizmodo: On AI, how do you see the traditional office changing in the next five years, with AI now able to handle scheduling, admin, copywriting, even management tasks?

Mark Cuban: More than anything we have ever seen in technology. I think AI will give superpowers to not just companies, but any employee willing to learn how to put it to use. It can take your newest employee and, with some curiosity and effort, make them as accomplished as long-term employees that won't use AI.

Gizmodo: What kinds of jobs or roles do you think will disappear completely in the next wave of AI adoption, and what will replace them?

Mark Cuban: If your job has binary tasks, you will no longer do those tasks. AI will. But if you can be creative and find new ways to use AI to improve the productivity and profitability of your job and company, you will always be able to get hired.

[Editor's note: Binary tasks include things like filling out forms, processing documents, basic customer service, or data entry jobs that follow clear if-then logic.]

Gizmodo: Do you think crypto, particularly bitcoin and stablecoins, is having its “iPhone moment”? If not, what's still missing?

Mark Cuban: No. Not even close. The iPhone App Store drove everyone to use apps for everything and anything they could. Your grandparents asked about how to download Facebook and Instagram to share pictures. Have you had your grandparents ask for help downloading a wallet?

[Ed. note: A crypto “wallet” is a software program or physical device that allows users to store and manage their cryptocurrencies. Unlike mainstream apps, they have not yet been widely adopted by the general public.]

Gizmodo: You've talked in the past about utility being more important than hype in crypto. What's the most promising use case you're seeing now?

Mark Cuban: Honestly, I had hoped that smart contracts on Ethereum, Polygon, and other platforms would lead to applications that would be mainstream by now. It's not even close. [Ed. note: Smart contracts are bits of code that automatically execute transactions. They power decentralized finance, NFTs, and more.]

There are some like Book.IO for books and textbooks, dClimate for climate data, and other apps that I'm still involved in. There can be apps that store video and photos on a chain as a way to combat AI deep fakes and other fraud. I think that could be impactful.

But generally, crypto hasn't had its Instagram moment yet.

Gizmodo: Is the U.S. government getting ahead or falling behind in shaping crypto as financial infrastructure?

Mark Cuban: I think we are behind. It's not as much about a digital financial infrastructure, it's more about allowing types of transactions that cause non-crypto users to question the stability and legality of crypto.

Meme coins are one example. There is no utility. It's a collectible where every transaction siphons off fees and is presented as gambling, or a game of musical chairs, that has no rules.

Another is when crypto is lent out. Unlike when stocks are being lent out, there is no law that I'm aware of that requires collateral to be put in place. This is why FTX didn't collapse in Japan. They have collateral and cold storage laws. If we had the same in this country, crypto would be far more trustworthy. Both cause observers who may be considering using crypto to question its viability.

[Ed. note: Following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in 2022, its Japanese subsidiary was able to make customers whole because Japanese law required customer assets to be held in separate, fully collateralized accounts.]

Gizmodo: Are we in a crypto bubble right now, or is this just what widespread adoption looks like?

Mark Cuban: I think BTC has taken all the thunder. It's a store of value, and we don't expect it to create utility. Every other chain basically does the same as the rest in one form or another, with some differentiation in features, functions, and speed. They just battle it out to lock up as much usage as possible. But the reality is there are far too many chains.

Gizmodo: How do you view the rise of bitcoin treasury companies like MicroStrategy? Are they early visionaries or overly exposed?

Mark Cuban: It's fine as long as you have a long-term horizon. Most companies can't afford to set aside liquid assets for long periods of time. They need the money. But if you can look long term, it's definitely a strategy worth considering.

[Ed. note: MicroStrategy is a software company turned bitcoin holding vehicle that now owns several billions of dollars worth of bitcoin.]

Gizmodo: Stablecoins are being used for real-world transactions at scale. Do you think they'll become the core financial rails of the internet economy, or are there limits?

Mark Cuban: I think they are positioned to continue to grow. If you transact globally in dollars, it's certainly a less expensive and faster option.

[Ed. note: Stablecoins like USDC or USDT are cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. They are used for fast global payments without banks or currency conversions.]

Gizmodo: Are we heading toward a future where corporate treasuries routinely hold bitcoin or stablecoins, the way they hold foreign currencies or bonds today?

Mark Cuban: Yes. Absolutely. You even see JPMorgan using stablecoins. I think it will be a way to transfer money far more effectively. We just need to make sure that we have enough regulation that it's not easy for fraud and hacks to have an impact.

NEW YORK, NY, July 04, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The art world is experiencing a monumental shift, and much of this revolution can be attributed to the rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Initially, NFTs were seen as speculative investments, but they have now emerged as a powerful tool for artists to monetize their work, build connections with audiences, and avoid the exploitative practices of middlemen. By leveraging blockchain technology, NFT platforms provide creators with the ability to securely track ownership, increase transparency in transactions, and avoid the fraudulent transfers that have plagued traditional art markets for years.

At the forefront of this change in the art industry is Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), who has been advocating for blockchain technology and NFTs to empower creators and improve transparency in the market. Silbert has long been a pioneer in the crypto space, and his work with DCG has pushed for the adoption of NFTs as a valid medium for art creators to retain control over their work. By promoting the decentralization of the art world, Silbert's efforts are helping artists keep their intellectual property safe from exploitation by middlemen.

Caitlin Long: Advancing Blockchain's Role in the Financial Ecosystem

Alongside Barry Silbert, Caitlin Long, founder of Avanti Financial Group, has been instrumental in advocating for the use of blockchain technology to transform industries beyond finance, including the art world. Long's experience in both the traditional finance sector and blockchain has uniquely positioned her to lead initiatives that bring crypto-based solutions to the mainstream. As the world continues to adopt blockchain technology, Caitlin Long has been a vocal advocate for ensuring that NFT platforms uphold legal frameworks and compliance, offering a safer space for both artists and collectors to transact without the fear of being defrauded or falling victim to exploitation.

Her Avanti Financial Group continues to push the boundaries of what blockchain can achieve by working directly with regulators to ensure that crypto assets like NFTs are secure, legitimate, and fit for the mainstream market. This commitment to regulatory clarity and security helps protect artists from potential fraud and exploitation in the emerging NFT art market, making NFT platforms more trustworthy for creators and buyers alike.

NFTs: Empowering Artists, Not Exploiting Them

The art world has long been criticized for its opaque structure, where middlemen, such as galleries, auction houses, and brokers, take a large commission on sales, leaving artists with little control or compensation for the resale of their work. Enter NFTs. By leveraging blockchain technology, NFTs enable artists to retain ownership and control over their creations while directly selling to collectors. This decentralized model allows creators to bypass the traditional art market's gatekeepers, offering more fair compensation and protection from fraud.

Artists who use NFT platforms benefit from a transparent, secure environment, where each transaction is publicly recorded on the blockchain. This means that intellectual property is easily verified, and creators are assured that they will receive fair royalties for any subsequent sales or resales. With these mechanisms in place, NFTs offer a way for artists to protect their work and avoid being defrauded by traditional art market players.

Barry Silbert's Role in Shaping the NFT Art Landscape

As a key player in the crypto ecosystem, Barry Silbert has helped shape the conversation around NFTs and their potential to transform the art world. Through his leadership at DCG, Silbert has supported platforms that empower artists by providing a secure, transparent way for them to sell their work. His advocacy for blockchain technology has helped artists avoid the common pitfalls of traditional art markets, where they are often exploited by intermediaries and are unable to track their work's journey.

Silbert's efforts are part of a larger movement that seeks to integrate NFTs into the broader crypto ecosystem, helping artists regain control over their creations. By pushing for greater regulatory clarity and transparency in the NFT space, Silbert is ensuring that digital art platforms will continue to serve as secure, reliable channels for creators to monetize their work without the risks of fraud or exploitation.

The Future of Digital Art and NFTs

The NFT art market is on track to become a dominant force in the art world, with more artists and collectors embracing the benefits of blockchain technology. As platforms continue to innovate, NFTs will provide an increasingly secure, transparent, and accessible way for creators to connect with their audience and ensure they are fairly compensated for their work. With Barry Silbert and Caitlin Long leading the charge in advocating for decentralization, the future of NFTs in the art market looks brighter than ever.

The true power of NFTs lies in their ability to democratize the art world. As Silbert and Long continue to champion this transformative technology, it's clear that blockchain-based platforms will play an essential role in shaping the future of art, giving artists the tools they need to thrive in a more secure and transparent environment.# # #

According to Glassnode, long-term holders (LTHs) are defined as investors who have held bitcoin BTC$107,815.02 for at least 155 days. CoinDesk Research indicates that one reason bitcoin has ye to reach new all-time highs has been selling pressure from these long-term holders.

However, zooming out, Glassnode data shows that the percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply that has not moved in at least three years currently stands at 45%, which is the same level observed in February 2024, one month after the launch of the US exchange-traded fund. 

Three years ago, in July 2022, the market was in the midst of the leverage crisis triggered by the collapse of 3AC and Celsius during the last bear market, when bitcoin was priced at $20,000, which shows the conviction of LTHs. 

Meanwhile, the share of circulating supply that has not moved in at least five years is at 30% and has remained flat since May 2024.

So, even though long-term holders are selling, as they typically do when prices climb higher, these data points suggest that the broader cohort has not significantly changed its aggregate behavior for over a year now, implying that many are waiting for higher prices before making further moves.

Bitcoin BTC$107,837.50 looks poised to climb to an all-time high this July, propelled by converging macroeconomic and market forces that are driving investors into riskier assets.

U.S. equity indexes are already setting records, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all sitting at highs, reflecting widespread investor confidence. As traditional markets soar, capital often spills into alternative assets, and BTC is a prime beneficiary. At around $109,000, the largest cryptocurrency is trading less than 3% below the peak it set in May.

One factor is the U.S. M2 money supply, which has climbed to a record $21.9 trillion and has touched highs each month over the past year. This surge in liquidity means potentially more money flowing into financial assets and a hunt for investments that can preserve purchasing power as government debt balloons. 

According to Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, President Donald Trump's newly passed ""Big Beautiful Bill"" locks in roughly $7 trillion in annual spending against only $5 trillion in revenue. That will push debt levels from 100% of GDP toward 130% over the next decade. 

“Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur,” he wrote in a post on X.

Historically, July has been a strong month for bitcoin, averaging gains around 7%, adding a seasonal tailwind.  All signs point to the digital asset breaking new records in the coming months.

Russian state-owned manufacturing conglomerate Rostec, best known for its role in the country's military-industrial complex, plans to roll out a ruble-pegged token called RUBx alongside a payment hub dubbed RT-Pay before year-end.

Each RUBx, according to state-owned news agency TASS, will represent one Russian ruble held in a treasury account. Rostec will run the token as the sole issuer and operator, anchoring the asset's value through “real obligations in rubles” written into law.

The token is set to be based on the Tron blockchain. Rostec intends to post the contract code on GitHub and has tapped blockchain-security firm CertiK for an independent audit, the report adds.

RT-Pay will plug straight into the country's banking rails. That link lets companies and private citizens move money in seconds, even after business hours, or lock funds in smart contracts.

Rostec says RT-Pay, which will be integrated with the country's banking rails, meets anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism rules and complies with Bank of Russia requirements.

A phased launch will target sectors with high payment friction first, then expand, RUBx project Dmitry Shumayev reportedly said.

The project lands as Moscow tests a separate digital ruble issued by the central bank. The country has been warming up to the cryptocurrency space, with the Bank of Russia earlier this year allowing institutions to offer crypto-linked instruments to qualified investors.

Russia's largest bank Sberbank and Moscow Exchange have already launched products tied to bitcoin BTC$107,837.50.

Cryptocurrencies have also been used to circumvent Western sanctions on Russia's oil trade. Reports suggest some Russian oil firms have used BTC, ETH, and some stablecoins to convert payments made in Chinese yuan and Indian rupees into rubles.

 A crypto analyst suggests that a drop to $108,000 could mark the beginning of Bitcoin's fall back below the six-figure price level. 

Bitcoin needs to keep its momentum as it approaches its all-time high, as a drop back to $108,000 could trigger a bearish downtrend, according to a trader.

“You don't want to see this deviate back below $108K again at this point,” crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades said on Thursday, adding that Bitcoin (BTC) is “attempting a breakout.”

“Any closes up around this $110K region would be good,” he added. Bitcoin reached $110,498 on Thursday but has since retraced to $109,250, according to CoinMarketCap data. It is approximately 2.5% below its all-time high of $111,970.

Daan's chart analysis indicates that if Bitcoin falls back toward $108,000 — a level it only recently regained on Wednesday — it could trigger a bearish downtrend, potentially pushing the price below $100,000 and possibly down as far as $96,000.

Bitcoin hasn't dropped below $100,000 since June 22, when it briefly touched $98,900 amid the conflict between Israel and Iran. A move back below this level would wipe approximately $2.67 billion in long positions, according to CoinGlass data.

Several other analysts appear confident in a Bitcoin uptrend. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher said: “It's very hard to be bearish here.” 

Meanwhile, crypto trader CryptoFayz explained using a chart that if Bitcoin does break its current all-time high of $111,960, it could continue its uptrend to $116,000. 

Similarly, 10x Research's Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph on Thursday that this price level could be reached by the end of July, citing strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve, and the rapid decline of Bitcoin supply on crypto exchanges.

However, Daan said that Bitcoin's current consolidation looks slightly different from earlier ones in this cycle. “It is still following the same pattern where it stalls, deviates below, retakes the range and then grinds higher,” he said, adding that it is missing “the actual breakout and continuation.”

McKay Research founder James McKay said: “The longer we have these periodic, multimonth consolidations, the more it's going to take us off the beaten [path] with respect to the typical four-year cyclical behaviour.”

 SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci has doubts crypto treasuries have legs in the long run, arguing investors will start buying crypto instead of investing in companies that hold it. 

Update (July 4 at 7 am UTC): This article has been updated to add a comment from a BNB Chain spokesperson. 

Chinese microchip firm Nano Labs has officially kicked off its plan to hold up to 10% of the total circulating supply of BNB, with its first purchase of $50 million of the asset. 

Nano Labs reiterated on Thursday that its long-term goal is to purchase up to $1 billion worth of BNB (BNB) and hold between 5% and 10% of the total circulating supply. 

It said its recent purchase now puts the company's holdings at roughly $160 million in BNB and Bitcoin (BTC). 

Nano Labs was founded in 2019 by Kong Jianping and Sun Qifeng after their terms expired on the board of directors for Singapore-based computer hardware manufacturer Canaan. The firm went public in 2022 and primarily produces high-throughput computing chips and high-performance computing chips.

Although Nano Labs' share price rose by over 106% when it first announced a plan to issue $500 million of convertible notes to fund a BNB treasury, the latest purchase didn't impress investors. 

Following Nano Labs' recent BNB acquisition, its stock price dropped more than 4.7% in the Thursday regular trading session and a further 2% after the bell to trade at $8.21. 

BNB gained only slightly, rising 0.3% in the last 24 hours to trade at around $663 per coin.

BNB has a market cap of $93.4 billion, and its circulating supply is 145,887,575, CoinGecko data shows. 

Buying 10% of the current supply at market prices would cost roughly $926 million.

The initial supply of BNB was set at 200 million coins, but the supply is gradually decreasing because of the token burns initiated by Binance to reduce the number in circulation. 

A June 2024 Forbes report noted that Binance and its former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao jointly hold 71% of the 147 million BNB that was in circulation at the time.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, a BNB Chain spokesperson said they recognized a growing institutional interest in BNB. 

“We welcome all organic adoption that supports BNB and the sustainable growth of our ecosystem.”

A growing number of companies are opting to hold crypto for treasuries; however, Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of the hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, doesn't think the interest will last, according to a report from Bloomberg on Tuesday.

In the long run, Scaramucci thinks investors will question the rationale of investing in a company that h﻿olds a valuable asset when they could just buy it themselves.

“The question is, if you're giving somebody $10 and they're putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin. I think that's an issue,” he told Bloomberg.

Adding that, he is bullish on Bitcoin and “not negative” on companies buying up crypto, but as an investor, he thinks “you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies.”

 The victim of a $20 million crypto scam who sued Citibank last week for allegedly ignoring “red flags” has filed a similar complaint against two more banks. 

The self-claimed victim of a crypto romance scam who recently sued Citibank for failing to catch red flags has just filed a second lawsuit targeting two other banks. 

Michael Zidell sued East West Bank and Cathay Bank in a California federal court on Tuesday, accusing the banks of turning “a blind eye to their statutory duties and obligations.”

He claimed he sent 18 transfers totalling nearly $7 million to the alleged scammers' account at East West Bank, and made 13 transfers totalling over $9.7 million to an account at Cathay Bank.

Zidell sued Citibank on June 24, accusing it of ignoring the red flags in 12 transfers totaling around $4 million to accounts at the bank allegedly held by scammers.

Cointelegraph contacted East West Bank and Cathay General Bancorp, the parent company of Cathay Bank, for comment.

Zidell claimed in his lawsuits against the banks that “Carolyn Parker,” a purported business owner, contacted him on Facebook in early 2023, and the pair formed a romantic relationship.

Parker allegedly told Zidell a month into the relationship that she'd made millions investing in non-fungible tokens, suggesting he do the same and directing him to a trading platform. 

Zidell decided to invest and, over the next few months, said he sent 43 transfers totalling over $20 million to various bank accounts given to him by the platform, which claimed it needed to process the funds at multiple banks due to a large volume of customer deposits.

He said by April 2023, the website for the platform “was suddenly gone,” along with his millions. 

Like his complaint against Citibank, Zidell's latest lawsuit seeks to hold East West Bank and Cathay Bank liable for negligence and as “aiders and abettors” of securities fraud.

“Defendants through their recklessness, materially aided Parker and her co-conspirators by opening bank accounts, providing services including wire transfers and allowing them to be used to perpetrate the NFT Enterprise scam,” the suit alleged.

It also argued that the two banks had a “duty to exercise due care in monitoring suspicious transactions,” but they “failed to detect clearly suspicious transactions.”

Zidell said the “large, round numbers of funds, among other things, should have triggered the bank's investigation into the suspicious activity.”

The complaint is also looking to hold East West Bank and Cathay Bank liable for “aiding and abetting elder abuse,” an accusation he didn't make against Citibank.

Zidell doesn't mention his age in the complaint, but California law defines an elder as someone 65 years old and over.

His lawsuit seeks compensatory damages, legal costs and interest at a jury trial.

Once seen as a mathematical quirk, a new study shows that the phenomenon can be physically measured.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

To our temporally embedded minds, the idea of “imaginary time” is a strange one. But in quantum field theory, this isn't imaginary, not in the sense that the tooth fairy is imaginary. Instead, “imaginary time” is defined as a length of time that can be multiplied by the square root of -1, an imaginary number represented by the number i. 

Obviously, we don't encounter these numbers in the natural world, hence the term “imaginary,” but they are particularly useful in quantum and cosmological calculations. Scientists already see “imaginary time” as a helpful mathematical quirk, but a new study from the University of Maryland (UMD) found a way to actually measure imaginary time in a lab. The results of the study were published in the journal Physical Review Letters.

When a beam of radiation—in this case microwaves—travels through a material, they can experience a time delay, which scientists in 2016 previously determined could be imaginary. Fast-forward nearly a decade later, UMD scientists Isabella Giovannelli and Steven Anlage discovered that if you send a pulse through coaxial cables that form a ring shape, close analysis of the microwave pulse using an oscilloscope as it exits the experimental setup shows that imaginary time can appear as one very small physical change, according to New Scientist. 

“It's sort of like a hidden degree of freedom that people ignored,” Anlage, a co-author of the study, told New Scientist. “I think what we've done is bring it out and give it a physical meaning.”

This change occurs due to a slightly shifting frequency as the microwave passes through the material. But the imaginary time delays are incredibly small, presenting an observational challenge. Giovannelli tells New Scientist that they only had a chance at discovering this behavior because they happened to be using the very best oscilloscopes in the world. 

Of course, a small behavior in a pulse of radiation in a material may seem inconsequential, but for nanoscience applications, it's immensely important. Scientists have previously studied the non-imaginary components of this interaction, so the world's first observation of light experiencing imaginary time helps complete the picture. Understanding how light experiences imaginary time can improve sensing devices, along with storage platforms that rely on light. 

“It's like a hammer that we've invented, and now we can find nails,” says Anlage.

One of the first nails, the authors tell New Scientist, will be to look at how information-carrying pulses used in communications are corrupted as they travel through materials, and if they too are related to the imaginary time delays.

Trees in tropical forests are dying at an increased rate, with consequences for biodiversity, carbon storage, and the global climate. While deforestation is the primary cause of forest loss, intact forests are also experiencing a rise in tree death. Drought, higher temperatures, and fires have been the leading suspects, but a new paper led by Evan Gora, a forest ecologist at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, identifies an underappreciated threat: thunderstorms, which are becoming more frequent with climate change.

Not to be confused with hurricanes or cyclones, these convective storms tend to be short-lived but powerful, with tree-toppling winds and lightning. In a perspective paper in Ecology Letters, Gora and colleagues lay out the case for why such storms could be a major driving force behind the rising death toll of tropical trees. As they become more common in the warming tropics, thunderstorms are a growing threat to trees and the carbon they store.

""Tropical forests have massive effects on global climate. They're like the lungs of the Earth, and we're seeing trees in them dying at higher rates than in the past, and the composition of forests is changing, too,"" said Gora. ""That could be really problematic for the future of not just tropical forests, but for the planet.""

Understanding what's causing the trends in tree death is critical to guiding decisions about which tree species to plant or conserve in a forest, so that forest managers can ensure forests continue thriving and storing carbon long into the future.

""Being in the forest during a tropical storm is unforgettable,"" said coauthor Vanessa Rubio, a forest ecologist in Gora's lab at Cary Institute. ""As the storm quickly builds, the sky darkens, humidity changes drastically, and strong winds shake the trees. Then, thunder and lightning come. Leaves and branches fall to the ground, rain pours down, and your instinct is to get back to the field station as quickly as possible.""

Despite their obvious danger to people, storms had been overlooked and understudied as a potential culprit in tree mortality trends. But when the team reanalyzed data from previous studies on tropical forest carbon stocks, they found that storms were at least as good as drought and temperature in explaining the patterns of tree mortality and forest carbon storage.

""We were surprised to find that storms may be the largest single factor causing tree death in these forests, and they're largely overlooked by research into carbon storage in the tropics,"" said Gora. ""Our estimates suggest that storms are responsible for 30 to 60% of tree mortality in the past, and that number must be increasing as storm activity increases by 5 to 25% each decade.""

The team also added storms to the largest plot-based study of forest biomass carbon dynamics to date. That study had previously concluded that when temperatures go above a certain threshold, tropical forests experience a fast decline in carbon stocks. ""But when you add storms, that relationship goes away,"" said Gora. ""It basically shows that you have to include storms, or you might not get the answers right.""

Storms and droughts are not mutually exclusive, the scientists note -- the same forests can experience both high storm activity and drought stress. They found high convective storm activity across the southern Amazon, where water stress is also high and patterns of change are among the most extreme.

""During my studies on threats to tropical forests, my professors, our textbooks, and even overall climate policy never mentioned small, convective storms as a potential source of forest mortality,"" said coauthor Ian McGregor, a Cary Institute forest ecologist in Gora's lab. ""I don't remember seeing them in global climate models used to inform climate policy. Given our findings, however, it's clear we need a more thorough understanding of these storms to have more accurate climate models, and thus more effective policy.""

There are good reasons why scientists have overlooked storms until now. Temperature and water stress can be monitored with meteorological stations and readily connected to long-term forest plot data. It is much harder to detect storms and track their highly localized damage. Mortality caused by thunderstorms is not easily detected via satellite, and it's not practical for researchers on foot to survey large forested areas frequently enough to pinpoint the damage caused by a specific storm.

Gigante, a project led by Gora and co-author Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert from the University of Birmingham, offers one way to overcome these challenges. The project combines a lightning location system, drone scouts, and on-the-ground experts to sample large areas of tropical forest frequently. With these tools, they are starting to quantify when, where, and why tropical trees are dying, and which species are most affected.

Understanding current and future threats to tropical forests is crucial to informing long-term conservation and restoration efforts.

""If we make decisions about which species to plant or conserve based on an incorrect understanding of what's actually killing these trees and which species are most vulnerable, those forests won't reach their full potential,"" said Gora. Storms are most deadly to mature trees, so the consequences of misguided reforestation efforts might not be known until decades after the trees are planted.

""However,"" Gora continued, ""if we can build a more holistic picture of what's driving forest change, we can be a lot more confident in guiding forest management practices for long-term sustainability.""

Washington State University researchers have discovered how the bacteria that cause anaplasmosis and Lyme disease hijack cellular processes in ticks to ensure their survival and spread to new hosts, including humans.

Based in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the team found that the bacteria can manipulate a protein known as ATF6, which helps cells detect and respond to infection, to support its own growth and survival inside the tick. The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could serve as a launching point for developing methods to eliminate the bacteria in ticks before they are transmitted to humans and other animals.

""Most research has looked at how these bacteria interact with humans and animals and not how they survive and spread in ticks,"" said Kaylee Vosbigian, a doctoral student and lead author on the study. ""What we have found could open the door to targeting these pathogens in ticks, before they are ever a threat to people.""

Vosbigian and her advisor, Dana Shaw, the corresponding author of the study and an associate professor in the Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, focused their research on Ixodes scapularis, also known as the blacklegged tick, which is responsible for spreading both Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agents of anaplasmosis and Lyme disease. Both diseases are becoming increasingly common and can cause serious illness in humans and animals.

The team discovered that when ATF6 is activated in tick cells, it triggers the production of stomatin, a protein that helps move cholesterol through cells as part of a normal cellular processes. The bacteria exploit this process against their tick hosts, using the cholesterol -which they need to grow and build their own cell membranes but cannot produce themselves - to support their own survival and success.

""Stomatin plays a variety of roles in the cell, but one of its key functions is helping shuttle cholesterol to different areas,"" Vosbigian said. ""The bacteria take advantage of this, essentially stealing the cholesterol they need to survive.""

When the researchers blocked the production of stomatin, restricting the availability of cholesterol, bacterial growth is significantly reduced. The researchers believe this shows targeting the ATF6-stomatin pathway could lead to new methods for interrupting the disease cycle in ticks before transmission occurs.

As part of the study, Vosbigian also developed a new research tool called ArthroQuest, a free, web-based platform hosted by WSU that allows scientists to search the genomes of ticks, mosquitoes, lice, sand flies, mites, fleas and other arthropod vectors for transcription factor binding sites - genetic switches like ATF6 that control gene activity.

""There aren't many tools out there for studying gene regulation in arthropods,"" Vosbigian said. ""Most are built for humans or model species like fruit flies, which are genetically very different from ticks.""

Using ArthroQuest, the team found that ATF6-regulated control of stomatin appears to be prevalent in blood-feeding arthropods. Since the hijacking of cholesterol and other lipids is common among arthropod-borne pathogens, the researchers suspect many may also exploit ATF6.

""We know many other vector-borne pathogens, like Borrelia burgdorferi and the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium, rely on cholesterol and other lipids from their hosts,"" Shaw said. ""So, the fact that this ATF6-stomatin pathway exists in other arthropods could be relevant to a wide range of disease systems.""

The research was supported in part by a National Institutes of Health R01 grant and a College of Veterinary Medicine intramural seed grant.

The researchers induced the senescent-like state in worms by manipulating the transcription factor TFEB. Under normal conditions, worms subjected to long-term fasting followed by refeeding regenerate and appear rejuvenated. However, in the absence of TFEB, the worm's stem cells fail to recover from the fasting period and instead enter a senescent-like state. This state is characterised by markers such as DNA damage, nucleolus expansion, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the expression of inflammatory markers, which are similar to those observed in mammalian senescence.

""We present a model for studying senescence at the level of the entire organism. It provides a tool to explore how senescence can be triggered and overcome,"" explains Adam Antebi, head of the study and director at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing.

The TFEB-growth factor axis

TFEB is a transcription factor involved in cellular responses to nutrient availability. It plays a crucial role in responding to fasting by regulating gene expression. In its absence, worms attempt to initiate growth programs without sufficient nutrients, leading to senescence.

""With our new model, we conducted genetic screens to identify mutations that can circumvent senescence. We identified growth factors, including insulin and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), as the key signaling molecules that are dysregulated upon TFEB loss,"" Antebi explains.

The TFEB-TGFbeta signaling axis is also regulated during cancer diapause, a state in which cancer cells remain in a dormant, non-dividing condition to survive chemotherapy. In the future, the researchers want to test whether their worm model can be used to find new treatments targeting senescent cells during aging as well as cancer dormancy.

Putting the brakes on an enzyme might rescue neurons that are dying due to a type of Parkinson's disease that's caused by a single genetic mutation, according to a new Stanford Medicine-led study conducted in mice.

The genetic mutation causes an enzyme called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, or LRRK2, to be overactive. Too much LRRK2 enzyme activity changes the structure of brain cells in a way that disrupts crucial communication between neurons that make the neurotransmitter dopamine and cells in the striatum, a region deep in the brain that is part of the dopamine system and is involved in movement, motivation and decision making.

""Findings from this study suggest that inhibiting the LRRK2 enzyme could stabilize the progression of symptoms if patients can be identified early enough,"" said Suzanne Pfeffer, PhD, the Emma Pfeiffer Merner Professor in Medical Sciences and a professor of biochemistry. Researchers can mitigate overactive LRRK2 using MLi-2 LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, a molecule that attaches to the enzyme and decreases its activity.

Pfeffer added that because the genetic mutation is not the only way to end up with overactive LRRK2 enzyme, the inhibitor treatment might help with other types of Parkinson's disease or even other neurodegenerative diseases.

Pfeffer is the senior author of the study published in Science Signaling on July 1. Ebsy Jaimon, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in biochemistry, is the lead author. The work is part of a longstanding collaboration with Dario Alessi, PhD, at the University of Dundee in Scotland.

Cellular antennae

About 25% of Parkinson's disease cases are caused by genetic mutations, and the single genetic mutation that makes the LRRK2 enzyme too active is one of the most common. An overactive LRRK2 enzyme causes cells to lose their primary cilia, a cellular appendage that acts like an antenna, sending and receiving chemical messages. A cell that has lost its primary cilia is like your mobile phone when the network is down -- no messages come through or are sent.

In a healthy brain, many messages are sent back and forth between dopamine neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra and the striatum. These cellular ""conversations"" are possible because dopamine neuron axons, which are tubular extensions coming off the cell body, reach all the way to the striatum to communicate with neurons and glia, cells that support neuronal function.

An important communication that is disrupted by too much LRRK2 enzyme activity occurs when dopamine neurons are stressed and release a signal in the striatum called sonic hedgehog (named after the cartoon character). In a healthy brain, it causes certain neurons and astrocytes, a type of glial support cell, in the striatum to produce proteins called neuroprotective factors. As their name suggests, these proteins help shield other cells from dying. When there is too much LRRK2 enzyme activity, many of the striatal cells lose their primary cilia -- and their ability to receive the signal from dopamine neurons. This disruption in sonic hedgehog signaling means that needed neuroprotective factors are not produced.

""Many kinds of processes necessary for cells to survive are regulated through cilia sending and receiving signals. The cells in the striatum that secrete neuroprotective factors in response to hedgehog signals also need hedgehog to survive. We think that when cells have lost their cilia, they are also on the pathway to death because they need cilia to receive signals that keep them alive,"" Pfeffer explained.

Restored cilia were unexpected

The goal of the study was to test if the MLi-2 LRRK2 kinase inhibitor reversed the effects of too much LRRK2 enzyme activity. Because the neurons and glia that were examined in this study were fully mature and no longer reproducing through cell division, the researchers were initially unsure whether cilia could regrow. Working with mice with the genetic mutation that causes overactive LRRK2 and symptoms consistent with early Parkinson's disease, the scientists first tried feeding the mice the inhibitor for two weeks. There were no changes detected in brain structure, signaling or the viability of the dopamine neurons.

Recent findings on neurons involved in regulating circadian rhythms, or sleep-wake cycles, inspired the researchers to try again. The primary cilia on those cells -- which were also no longer dividing -- grew and shrank every 12 hours.

""The findings that other non-dividing cells grow cilia made us realize that it was theoretically possible for the inhibitor to work,"" Pfeffer said.

The team decided to see what happened after mice with overactive LRRK2 enzyme consumed the inhibitor for a longer period of time; Pfeffer described the results as ""astounding.""

After three months of eating the inhibitor, the percentage of striatal neurons and glia typically affected by the overactive LRRK2 enzyme that had primary cilia in mice with the genetic mutation was indistinguishable from that in mice without the genetic mutation. In the same way moving from an area with spotty cell service to one with good service restores our ability to send and receive text messages, the increase in primary cilia restored communication between dopamine neurons and the striatum.

The striatal neurons and glia were again secreting neuroprotective factors in response to hedgehog signaling from dopamine neurons in the same amounts as the brains of mice without the genetic mutation. The hedgehog signaling from dopamine neurons decreased, suggesting they were under less stress. And, indicators of the density of dopamine nerve endings within the striatum doubled, suggesting an initial recovery for neurons that had been in the process of dying.

""These findings suggest that it might be possible to improve, not just stabilize, the condition of patients with Parkinson's disease,"" Pfeffer said.

The earliest symptoms of Parkinson's disease begin about 15 years before someone notices a tremor. Typically, these symptoms are a loss of smell, constipation and a sleep disorder in which people act out their dreams while still sleeping, according to Pfeffer. She said the hope is that people who have the LRRK2 genetic mutation can start a treatment that inhibits the enzyme as early as possible.

The next step for the research team is to test whether other forms of Parkinson's disease that are not associated with the LRRK2 genetic mutation could benefit from this type of treatment.

""We are so excited about these findings. They suggest this approach has great promise to help patients in terms of restoring neuronal activity in this brain circuit,"" Pfeffer said. ""There are multiple LRRK2 inhibitor clinical trials underway, and our hope is that these findings in mice will hold true for patients in the future.""

The study was funded by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, the Aligning Science Across Parkinson's initiative and the United Kingdom Medical Research Council.

The future of smashed avocado might depend on patches of native vegetation preserved alongside farmland, as new Curtin research reveals the hidden role of these habitats in supporting the insects that keep crops -- and brunch menus -- thriving.

The research, published this week, found that insect communities in avocado orchards adjacent to native remnant vegetation foraged on more than twice as many plant species at times when crop flowering was limited, compared to those in orchards bordered by pasture.

Insects with more diverse food sources are more likely to survive and pollinate crops so this finding offers a potential clue to safeguarding global food security - as almost 10 billion people across the globe will require access to safe and nutritious food by 2050, meaning agricultural productivity will need to increase by 25 to 75 percent.

Lead author Dr Joshua Kestel, who completed the research as part of his PhD at Curtin, said the research was particularly compelling because it had been traditionally difficult to quantify the diversity of pollen collected by entire insect communities -- especially across vast agricultural landscapes.

""Using a novel method pioneered at Curtin University, we applied a cutting-edge biodiversity assessment technique -- environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding -- to pan traps to identify the diversity of pollen transported by entire insect communities collected during sampling,"" Dr Kestel said.

""This approach allowed us to demonstrate that natural vegetation adjacent to orchards may enhance the resilience of insect communities, potentially contributing to greater food security.""

Co-author Associate Professor Paul Nevill, from Curtin's School of Molecular and Life Sciences, said the research was significant because insects pollinate 75 percent of all agricultural crops, yet many face extinction.

""In order to meet the food needs of the planet, diverse and healthy insect communities play a critical role in supporting essential ecosystem services such as pollination and the biological control of pests,"" Associate Professor Nevill said.

""In Australia alone, an estimated 320,000 insect species exist, yet only 35 percent have been formally identified -- and the plant resources many of them rely on remain largely unknown.

""By using sophisticated eDNA metabarcoding capable of detecting the trace of a single grain of pollen or even the footprint of a bee, we're helping to close these knowledge gaps and better understand how these insects might contribute to safeguarding global food security.""

The researchers collected more than 2,000 insect specimens and identified more than 250 plant taxa from eDNA, including crops, weeds and native Australian flora.

The team recommended incorporating standardized biodiversity surveys into regular farm monitoring, protecting agroecosystems by recognizing the value of natural vegetation and revegetating uncultivated land within orchards.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found a major flaw in a key COVID drug study","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250704032925.htm","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 12:30:52 GMT","

The COVID pandemic illustrated how urgently we need antiviral medications capable of treating coronavirus infections. To aid this effort, researchers quickly homed in on part of SARS-Cov-2's molecular structure known as the NiRAN domain -- an enzyme region essential to viral replication that's common to many coronaviruses. A drug targeting the NiRAN domain would likely work broadly to shut down a range of these pathogens, potentially treating known diseases like COVID as well as helping to head off future pandemics caused by related viruses,

In 2022, scientists in China (Yan et al.) published a structural model describing exactly how this domain works. It should have been a tremendous boon for drug developers.

But the model was wrong.

""Their work contains critical errors,"" says Gabriel Small, a graduate fellow in the laboratories of Seth A. Darst and Elizabeth Campbell at Rockefeller. ""The data does not support their conclusions.""

Now, in a new study published in Cell, Small and colleagues demonstrate exactly why scientists still don't know how the NiRAN domain works. The findings could have sweeping implications for drug developers already working to design antivirals based on flawed assumptions, and underscore the importance of rigorous validation.

""It is absolutely important that structures be accurate for medicinal chemistry, especially when we're talking about a critical target for antivirals that is the subject of such intense interest in industry,"" says Campbell, head of the Laboratory of Molecular Pathogenesis. ""We hope that our work will prevent developers from futilely trying to optimize a drug around an incorrect structure.""

A promising lead

By the time the original paper was published in Cell, the Campbell and Darst labs were already quite familiar with the NiRAN domain and its importance as a therapeutic target. Both laboratories study gene expression in pathogens, and their work on SARS-CoV-2 focuses in part on characterizing the molecular interactions that coordinate viral replication.

The NiRAN domain is essential for helping SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses cap their RNA, a step that allows these viruses to replicate and survive. In one version of this process, the NiRAN domain uses a molecule called GDP to attach a protective cap to the beginning of the virus's RNA. Small previously described that process in detail, and its structure is considered solved. But the NiRAN domain can also use a related molecule, GTP, to form a protective cap. Determined to develop antivirals that comprehensively shut down the NiRAN domain, scientists were keen to discover the particulars of the latter GTP-related mechanism.

In the 2022 paper, researchers described a chain of chemical steps, beginning with a water molecule breaking a bond to release the RNA's 5′ phosphate end. That end then attaches to the beta-phosphate end of the GTP molecule, which removes another phosphate and, with the help of a magnesium ion, transfers the remaining portion of the GTP molecule to the RNA, forming a protective cap that allows the virus to replicate and thrive.

The team's evidence? A cryo-electron microscopy image that showed the process caught in action. To freeze this catalytic intermediate, the team used a GTP mimic called GMPPNP.

Small read the paper with interest. ""As soon as they published, I went to download their data,"" he says. It wasn't there. This raised a red flag -- data is generally available upon release of a structural biology paper. Months later, however, when Small was finally able to access the data, he began to uncover significant flaws. ""I tried to make a figure using their data, and realized that there were serious issues,"" he says. Small brought his concerns to Campbell and Darst.

They agreed. ""Something was clearly wrong,"" Campbell says. ""But we decided to give the other team the benefit of the doubt, and reprocess all of their data ourselves.""

An uphill battle

It was painstaking work, with Small leading the charge. Working frame by frame, he compared the published atomic model to the actual cryo-EM map and found something striking: the key molecules that Yan and colleagues claimed to have seen -- specifically, the GTP mimic GMPPNP and a magnesium ion in the NiRAN domain's active site -- simply were not there.

Not only was there no supporting image data, but the placement of these molecules in the original model also violated basic rules of chemistry, causing severe atomic clashes and unrealistic charge interactions. Small ran additional tests, but even advanced methods designed to pick out rare particles turned up empty. He could find no evidence to support the model previously produced by Yan and colleagues.

Once the Rockefeller researchers validated their results, they submitted their findings to Cell. ""It was very important that we publish our corrective manuscript in the same journal that published the original model,"" Campbell says, noting that corrections to high-profile papers are often overlooked when published in lower tier journals.

Otherwise, this confusion in the field could cause problems that reach far beyond the lab bench, Campbell adds -- a costly reminder that rigorous basic biomedical research is not just academic, but essential to real-world progress. ""Companies keep their cards close to their chests, but we know that several industry groups are studying this,"" she says. ""Efforts based on a flawed structural model could result in years of wasted time and resources.""

Married couples in Japan are required by law to share the same family name.Credit: kyonntra/Getty

Japan is the only country in the world that legally requires married couples to share the same family name — and that creates considerable problems for scientists, according to a survey of more than 7,500 researchers in the country. 

The survey found that the naming law created confusion for researchers when obtaining patents, academic qualifications and applying for research grants, and had caused problems when travelling abroad and attending academic conferences and in ensuring that their entire body of work was attributed to them. The results of the survey were presented at a press conference on 16 June. 

“The data clearly show that changing one's surname can cause significant disadvantages,” says Misa Shimuta, a neuroscience researcher at the Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, who was involved in the survey.

Earlier this year, Japan's main opposition party put forward a bill proposing that married couples be allowed to retain their own family names after marriage. A proposal to change the rule, which has been in place for more than a century, was debated in the National Diet — Japan's legislative body — last month, but a decision has been pushed to later in the year. In practice, the current rule mainly affects women — 95% of married women in Japan legally change their name to their husband's.

In response to the proposal to change the rule and other lobbying efforts, the Japan Inter-Society Liaison Association Committee for Promoting Equal Participation of Men and Women in Science and Engineering, an association representing about 100 academic societies working on gender equality, surveyed academics to try to understand how the current law affects them, says Noriko Sato, a forest-policy researcher at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, who led the survey. 

The team collected responses from 7,582 academics, of which roughly one-third were women, between April and May. Just over 5% of the 3,810 married men who responded had changed their name after marriage, but more than 90% of the 1,506 married women had changed their name. Of those who had changed their name, more than 70% continued to use their original name at work, a practice that has become increasingly popular.

Of those who used their original family name at work, 78% said that even doing that caused issues.

Kyoko Ohno-Matsui, an ophthalmologist at the Institute of Science Tokyo, was born Matsui and married an Ohno, and uses the double-barrelled name in her professional life. “I didn't want to change my surname,” she says. At conferences in Japan and when authoring papers in Japanese journals, she uses her legal name, Ohno. When she attends conferences abroad, where she is known as Ohno-Matsui, she often has trouble checking into hotels because her passport details don't match those provided by the conference organizers.

Enzymes are emerging as promising catalysts for selective radical transformations. However, non-natural radical-type enzymatic catalysis is currently limited to utilizing C-, N- and S-centred radical species. Alkoxy radicals are recognized as versatile intermediates with high reactivity, typically engaging in reactivity modes such as hydrogen atom transfer, β-scission processes and intramolecular addition to alkenes. Enantioselective intermolecular alkoxy radical addition to alkenes remained unknown. Here we develop a biocatalytic strategy based on engineered ene-reductases that facilitate the radical hydroalkoxylation of oxygen-centred radicals with alkenes. A single, ground-state ene-reductase adeptly controls the biocompatible generation of O-radicals, the follow-up intermolecular O-radical addition to alkenes and the final prochiral C-radical termination, achieving high chemo- and enantioselectivity (both enantiomers are obtained separately with different enzymes). Mechanistic experiments, including computational simulations, reveal that the radical enzymatic reaction initiates via a ground-state single-electron transfer and elucidate the origins of enantiodiscrimination of the overall reaction.

Whether due to consumer backlash or an aging EV lineup, or both, Tesla sales have again seen a global plunge, this time 13 percent last quarter compared to the previous year—proof that the electric automaker hasn't yet turned around a dismal year that saw public opinion of controversial CEO Elon Musk plummet. It could mean Tesla faces a second straight year of falling sales.

And yet: Tesla is still the world's most valuable automaker by market capitalization, worth some $990 billion. At least some of that market confidence is likely traced to the happenings of June 22, when Tesla finally began allowing paying passengers to ride its autonomous vehicle service in Austin, Texas.

The service rollout has been fairly smooth. If the metric for success is “no crashes,” mission accomplished: There have been no public reports of crashes or fender-benders involving the robotaxis. The select few riders who have been allowed inside them have praised the service online, which for now costs just $4.20 a ride. (The price seems to be a weed joke.)

But there are plenty of caveats. For one thing, the program's “early riders” appear to be Tesla influencers, online content creators who have financial stakes in the company or who run media businesses that tend to cheerlead for Tesla and/or electric vehicles. Tesla has not said when it will open the service to members of the public. (The company, which disbanded its PR team in October 2020, did not respond to any of WIRED's questions.) For another, Tesla's area of operations is notably smaller than Alphabet subsidiary Waymo's, which began offering robotaxi service in the city through the Uber app in March.

For one more, there are plenty of humans involved in this driverless service. Tesla has a safety monitor in the front passenger seat of its robotaxis, who, according to online videos, seems poised to intervene if the technology makes a mistake. And Tesla has been less than transparent about its use of human teleoperators, who can either remotely drive or remotely assist its driverless technology. (The former is likely much safer than the latter, experts say, but Tesla hasn't said which approach it uses.)

“Tesla has what I call the trifecta of babysitting going on right now,” says Missy Cummings, who researches autonomous vehicles at George Mason University, and has herself been the subject of Musk's displeasure. The human contributions likely make Tesla's service much safer, she says—something for which the automaker should be praised. In fact, keeping babysitting humans in the drivers' seat is exactly what rivals Waymo and Zoox did in the early phases of their testing. (Waymo now offers robotaxi service in five cities; Zoox has said it will start service in Las Vegas this year.) “I want to encourage them to keep doing that,” she says.

But, for Cummings, the choice is likely evidence that Tesla is behind its competitors. “If learning to deploy a self-driving car system was grades K through 12, Tesla is in first grade,” she says. “Everything we're seeing in Texas suggests significant immaturity in self-driving operations.”

This means, too, that Tesla hasn't hit the milestone Musk promised back in January, when he told investors that the company would launch “unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June…no one in the car.”

“This is a demo or test using safety drivers—it's not an [autonomous vehicle] deployment,” says Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies autonomous vehicles. “Tesla is splashing around in the kiddie pool and everyone is asking where it's going to place in the Olympic swim competition.”

Tesla has kept quiet about many of the particulars of its technology. And it's hard to reach definite conclusions about its tech from social media posts uploaded by riders. But some of those posts appear to show less-than-smooth rides. In one video, a robotaxi attempting to make a left turn appears to cross a double yellow line into oncoming traffic. In another, a robotaxi apparently fails to detect a UPS truck stopping and reversing to park, and the front seat safety monitor has to intervene to stop the car.

One YouTuber uploaded a video showing a robotaxi “phantom braking”—suddenly coming to a stop for no apparent reason—a phenomenon that's also been flagged by hundreds of users of Tesla's less-advanced Full Self-Driving (Supervised) feature and investigated by the federal government. Unlike actual self-driving technology, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) requires users to keep their eyes on the road.

The service pauses for bad weather, according to Tesla's website. One YouTuber had their ride halted for a rainstorm; the robotaxi dropped the rider in an Austin park as the wind began to whip around them. Minutes later, according to a video, the same Robotaxi picked the creator up to continue their ride. However, contradicting the above, one poster has reported the cars perform “FLAWLESSLY” in heavy rain.

The early bloopers aren't surprising, experts say. Full Self-Driving (Supervised) requires a human driver to intervene when needed, and it appears robotaxi is the same right now, says Philip Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous vehicle safety. The slip-ups the robotaxis have made are not unlike what human drivers do on the road, he says. But autonomy's value add is supposed to be safety, so it makes sense that the videos—and the tech's “rough edges”—are making people nervous.

The launch has reopened public debates about a core tenet of Tesla's technology: its use of cameras alone to perceive and “make decisions” as it drives. Musk and his company have long argued that artificial intelligence, supplemented by the data collected by cameras, is sufficient to operate a safe, driverless car. The CEO has promised that all of its cars can become autonomous without any modifications, with a simple push of updated software (though Tesla also quietly reneged on this claim). Other companies see more expensive sensors, including radar and lidar, as important validators and support. (Lidar has dramatically dropped in price; many Chinese automakers are now including the sensor on every car that they sell.)

Advances in large language models have convinced some in the auto industry that Musk's approach is the right one. In a podcast interview published this week, Kyle Vogt, the former CEO of General Motors AV unit Cruise, argued that images from multiple vehicle-mounted cameras plus advanced models can be “really accurate.” (Vogt stepped down from Cruise after one of its driverless vehicles hit and dragged a pedestrian. The company was not transparent with regulators about the incident, a report later found.)

For Cummings, the reports out of Austin have confirmed her beliefs that cameras alone aren't enough to operate a car autonomously. “There is no robotic system that exists that is safety critical—meaning people can die [using it]—that has ever been successful on a single sensor strain,” she says. “It's unclear why Tesla thinks that they can do what has never before been done.”

One metric that might reveal Tesla's internal success: how quickly it expands. Musk boldly said in May that Tesla will have hundreds of thousands—and perhaps up to a million—autonomous vehicles on the road next year. The company seems motivated. According to a job posting, Tesla is hiring for additional vehicle operators, who are paid to drive cars around Austin to collect data. But, of course, Musk is no stranger to deadlines unmet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The EU Proposes New Rules to Govern the European Space Race","https://www.wired.com/story/europe-prepares-for-the-space-race-with-a-new-legal-and-financial-framework/","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

There are around 11,000 satellites orbiting Earth, and it is estimated that at least 50,000 more will be launched in the next decade. There are also exploration instruments, resupply vessels, and complexes like the International Space Station. But who regulates all this activity in space? In the absence of clear regulations, the European Union has proposed the Space Act, a set of measures that seeks to make the European space sector a cleaner, safer, and more competitive environment, both domestically and in international markets.

The European Commission maintains that current space regulation within the eurozone is fragmented into various national approaches, which slows innovation, reduces European participation in the global market, and generates additional costs.

According to the EU executive, the draft legislation will boost the expansion of companies in the bloc into other markets, as it is designed to simplify procedures, protect assets in orbit, and promote a level playing field. The regulation focuses on three key pillars:

In a statement, the commission stresses that “the new rules would apply to both EU and national space assets, as well as to non-EU operators offering services in Europe. Regulatory requirements will be adapted to company size and level of maturity, and measured against the risks involved.”

Recognizing that compliance with the regulatory framework will entail considerable costs for the industry, the commission proposes a series of support measures, such as strengthening technical capabilities, facilitating access to testing facilities, and assistance with the authorization process. These measures are intended to particularly benefit startups and small and medium-sized businesses in the sector.

The commission also presented a new vision to boost the European space economy, with the aim of responding to the global dynamics of the sector, growing international competition, and emerging geopolitical challenges.

Space, the agency argues, is a fast-growing sector that contributes significantly to the bloc's competitiveness. It encompasses both the industry dedicated to the manufacturing and operation of space systems and a wide range of services that impact areas such as climate, environment, agriculture, energy, transportation, insurance, banking, security, and defense.

The proposed economic strategy includes more than 40 concrete actions to ensure Europe's strong participation in the global space market, strengthen its autonomy, and consolidate its technological advantage. Among the initiatives is the creation of the European Space Team, a high-level forum that will bring together key players in the ecosystem, such as the European Space Agency and the European Union Agency for the Space Program, with the aim of coordinating efforts and unifying capabilities across the bloc. In addition, the commission has planned a number of investment mechanisms to boost its space economy.

Starting this year, the commission will develop a specific methodology to monitor the EU's competitiveness and market share in the global space economy.

“Europe's leadership in space must be rooted in sovereignty, security, and strategic foresight. With the EU Space Act we are taking a bold step to ensure that our space infrastructure is resilient, our innovation ecosystem is empowered, and our autonomy in critical technologies is secured for generations to come,” concluded Henna Virkkunen, executive vice president of the European Commission for Technological Sovereignty, Security, and Democracy.

Cruise robotaxis are back on the road… well, kind of. Though General Motors pulled the plug on its self-driving taxi business last year, the automaker has been quietly repurposing a few of the vehicles as it seeks to develop new driver-assistance technologies.

This week, WIRED spotted a GM Bolt electric hatchback on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and later saw a similar vehicle on Interstate 880 near Oakland. In each instance, the car was being driven by a human. But it held equipment on the roof such as lidar sensors that resembled the setup from the Cruise ride-hailing system. The vehicle had “Mint” written on the hood, but didn't include any visually apparent Cruise branding.

GM spokesperson Chaiti Sen confirms to WIRED that the company is indeed “using a limited number of Cruise Bolt vehicles on select highways in Michigan, Texas and Bay Area for testing with trained drivers to further develop simulation models and advanced driver assistance systems.” She adds, “This is internal testing and does not involve public passengers.”

GM removed the orange-and-white Cruise logo from the cars' sides after it took full ownership of the unit in February, she says. The recent activity began in Michigan and Texas in February and the San Francisco Bay Area-region in mid-April, Sen says. Cruise had named each vehicle in its fleet, and Sen confirmed that “Mint” has been among the vehicles newly active in the Bay Area.

The testing shows for the first time how GM is beginning to give a second life to a fleet of no less than hundreds of vehicles left over from a costly project that ran aground.

GM initially acquired a majority stake in San Francisco-based Cruise in 2016, and invested more than $8 billion into developing a robotaxi service. The operation was off to a fast start and eyeing a rapid expansion until October 2023, when a Cruise vehicle struck a pedestrian in San Francisco who had just been hit by a human-driven vehicle.

In the aftermath of the incident, Cruise misled state regulators, lost a key permit, halted operations, and laid off a quarter of its workers.

After some attempts to restart the business, GM announced this past December that the experiment would be cancelled altogether. At the time, GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts that running a robotaxi fleet was an expensive distraction from the business of making cars.

But the technology behind Cruise is helping improve the roughly 7-year-old Super Cruise system found in some GM cars. It aims to help drivers stay in and change lanes, or apply the emergency brake without needing to use their hands.

Several automakers are racing to develop cars that offload an increasing amount of driving tasks to computers. GM claims about 60 percent of its 360,000 Super Cruise customers regularly make use of the capability.

In the US, the robotaxi industry has been dominated by Waymo, though Elon Musk's Tesla and Amazon's Zoox are among those continuing to try to catch up.

GM's repurposed Bolts blend into San Francisco-area roads, on which cars with heavy-duty computer gear attached to roof, back, and sides have become commonplace. They include not only companies testing sensors and algorithms, but also map providers collecting data and hobbyists attempting to upgrade their personal rides.

The European Union on Friday said it will stick to its timeline for implementing its landmark AI legislation, in response to a concerted effort by more than a hundred tech companies to delay the bloc's AI rules, Reuters reported.

Tech companies from across the world, including giants like Alphabet, Meta, Mistral AI and ASML have been urging the European Commission to delay rolling out the AI Act, saying it will hurt Europe's chances to compete in the fast-evolving AI arena. 

“I've seen, indeed, a lot of reporting, a lot of letters and a lot of things being said on the AI Act. Let me be as clear as possible, there is no stop the clock. There is no grace period. There is no pause,” the report cited European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier as saying.

A risk-based regulation for applications of artificial intelligence, the AI Act bans a handful of “unacceptable risk” use cases outright, such as cognitive behavioral manipulation or social scoring. It also defines a set of “high-risk” uses, such as biometrics and facial recognition, or AI used in domains like education and employment. App developers will need to register their systems and meet risk and quality management obligations to gain access to the EU market.

Another category of AI apps, such as chatbots, are considered “limited risk” and subject to lighter transparency obligations.

The EU started rolling out the AI Act last year in a staggered fashion, with the full rules coming into force by mid-2026.

Structural challenges and the nation's many languages have made it tough to develop foundational AI models. But the government is keen not to be left behind.

In Bengaluru, India, Adithya Kolavi felt a mix of excitement and validation as he watched DeepSeek unleash its disruptive language model on the world earlier this year. The Chinese technology rivaled the best of the West in terms of benchmarks, but it had been built with far less capital in far less time. 

“I thought: ‘This is how we disrupt with less,'” says Kolavi, the 20-year-old founder of the Indian AI startup CognitiveLab. “If DeepSeek could do it, why not us?” 

But for Abhishek Upperwal, founder of Soket AI Labs and architect of one of India's earliest efforts to develop a foundation model, the moment felt more bittersweet. 

Upperwal's model, called Pragna-1B, had struggled to stay afloat with tiny grants while he watched global peers raise millions. The multilingual model had a relatively modest 1.25 billion parameters and was designed to reduce the “language tax,” the extra costs that arise because India—unlike the US or even China—has a multitude of languages to support. His team had trained it, but limited resources meant it couldn't scale. As a result, he says, the project became a proof of concept rather than a product. 

“If we had been funded two years ago, there's a good chance we'd be the ones building what DeepSeek just released,” he says.

Kolavi's enthusiasm and Upperwal's dismay reflect the spectrum of emotions among India's AI builders. Despite its status as a global tech hub, the country lags far behind the likes of the US and China when it comes to homegrown AI. That gap has opened largely because India has chronically underinvested in R&D, institutions, and invention. Meanwhile, since no one native language is spoken by the majority of the population, training language models is far more complicated than it is elsewhere. 

Content moderation systems are being abandoned and defunded, leaving many countries looking for alternatives.

Historically known as the global back office for the software industry, India has a tech ecosystem that evolved with a services-first mindset. Giants like Infosys and TCS built their success on efficient software delivery, but invention was neither prioritized nor rewarded. Meanwhile, India's R&D spending hovered at just 0.65% of GDP ($25.4 billion) in 2024, far behind China's 2.68% ($476.2 billion) and the US's 3.5% ($962.3 billion). The muscle to invent and commercialize deep tech, from algorithms to chips, was just never built.

Isolated pockets of world-class research do exist within government agencies like the DRDO (Defense Research & Development Organization) and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization), but their breakthroughs rarely spill into civilian or commercial use. India lacks the bridges to connect risk-taking research to commercial pathways, the way DARPA does in the US. Meanwhile, much of India's top talent migrates abroad, drawn to ecosystems that better understand and, crucially, fund deep tech.So when the open-source foundation model DeepSeek-R1 suddenly outperformed many global peers, it struck a nerve. This launch by a Chinese startup prompted Indian policymakers to confront just how far behind the country was in AI infrastructure, and how urgently it needed to respond.

In January 2025, 10 days after DeepSeek-R1's launch, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) solicited proposals for India's own foundation models, which are large AI models that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks. Its public tender invited private-sector cloud and data‑center companies to reserve GPU compute capacity for government‑led AI research. 

Providers including Jio, Yotta, E2E Networks, Tata, AWS partners, and CDAC responded. Through this arrangement, MeitY suddenly had access to nearly 19,000 GPUs at subsidized rates, repurposed from private infrastructure and allocated specifically to foundational AI projects. This triggered a surge of proposals from companies wanting to build their own models. 

Within two weeks, it had 67 proposals in hand. That number tripled by mid-March. 

In April, the government announced plans to develop six large-scale models by the end of 2025, plus 18 additional AI applications targeting sectors like agriculture, education, and climate action. Most notably, it tapped Sarvam AI to build a 70-billion-parameter model optimized for Indian languages and needs. 

For a nation long restricted by limited research infrastructure, things moved at record speed, marking a rare convergence of ambition, talent, and political will.

“India could do a Mangalyaan in AI,” said Gautam Shroff of IIIT-Delhi, referencing the country's cost-effective, and successful, Mars orbiter mission. 

Jaspreet Bindra, cofounder of AI&Beyond, an organization focused on teaching AI literacy, captured the urgency: “DeepSeek is probably the best thing that happened to India. It gave us a kick in the backside to stop talking and start doing something.”

One of the most fundamental challenges in building foundational AI models for India is the country's sheer linguistic diversity. With 22 official languages, hundreds of dialects, and millions of people who are multilingual, India poses a problem that few existing LLMs are equipped to handle.

Whereas a massive amount of high-quality web data is available in English, Indian languages collectively make up less than 1% of online content. The lack of digitized, labeled, and cleaned data in languages like Bhojpuri and Kannada makes it difficult to train LLMs that understand how Indians actually speak or search.

Global tokenizers, which break text into units a model can process, also perform poorly on many Indian scripts, misinterpreting characters or skipping some altogether. As a result, even when Indian languages are included in multilingual models, they're often poorly understood and inaccurately generated.

And unlike OpenAI and DeepSeek, which achieved scale using structured English-language data, Indian teams often begin with fragmented and low-quality data sets encompassing dozens of Indian languages. This makes the early steps of training foundation models far more complex.

The Servants of Knowledge collection on the Internet Archive is an effort to make up for the lack of library resources in India.

Nonetheless, a small but determined group of Indian builders is starting to shape the country's AI future.

For example, Sarvam AI has created OpenHathi-Hi-v0.1, an open-source Hindi language model that shows the Indian AI field's growing ability to address the country's vast linguistic diversity. The model, built on Meta's Llama 2 architecture, was trained on 40 billion tokens of Hindi and related Indian-language content, making it one of the largest open-source Hindi models available to date.

Pragna-1B, the multilingual model from Upperwal, is more evidence that India could solve for its own linguistic complexity. Trained on 300 billion tokens for just $250,000, it introduced a technique called “balanced tokenization” to address a unique challenge in Indian AI, enabling a 1.25-billion-parameter model to behave like a much larger one.The issue is that Indian languages use complex scripts and agglutinative grammar, where words are formed by stringing together many smaller units of meaning using prefixes and suffixes. Unlike English, which separates words with spaces and follows relatively simple structures, Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada often lack clear word boundaries and pack a lot of information into single words. Standard tokenizers struggle with such inputs. They end up breaking Indian words into too many tokens, which bloats the input and makes it harder for models to understand the meaning efficiently or respond accurately.

With the new technique, however, “a billion-parameter model was equivalent to a 7 billion one like Llama 2,” Upperwal says. This performance was particularly marked in Hindi and Gujarati, where global models often underperform because of limited multilingual training data. It was a reminder that with smart engineering, small teams could still push boundaries.Upperwal eventually repurposed his core tech to build speech APIs for 22 Indian languages, a more immediate solution better suited to rural users who are often left out of English-first AI experiences.

“If the path to AGI is a hundred-step process, training a language model is just step one,” he says. 

At the other end of the spectrum are startups with more audacious aims. Krutrim-2, for instance, is a 12-billion-parameter multilingual language model optimized for English and 22 Indian languages. 

Krutrim-2 is attempting to solve India's specific problems of linguistic diversity, low-quality data, and cost constraints. The team built a custom Indic tokenizer, optimized training infrastructure, and designed models for multimodal and voice-first use cases from the start, crucial in a country where text interfaces can be a problem.

Krutrim's bet is that its approach will not only enable Indian AI sovereignty but also offer a model for AI that works across the Global South.

Besides public funding and compute infrastructure, India also needs the institutional support of talent, the research depth, and the long-horizon capital that produce globally competitive science.

While venture capital still hesitates to bet on research, new experiments are emerging. Paras Chopra, an entrepreneur who previously built and sold the software-as-a-service company Wingify, is now personally funding Lossfunk, a Bell Labs–style AI residency program designed to attract independent researchers with a taste for open-source science. 

“We don't have role models in academia or industry,” says Chopra. “So we're creating a space where top researchers can learn from each other and have startup-style equity upside.”

The clearest marker of India's AI ambitions came when the government selected Sarvam AI to develop a model focused on Indian languages and voice fluency.

The idea is that it would not only help Indian companies compete in the global AI arms race but benefit the wider population as well. “If it becomes part of the India stack, you can educate hundreds of millions through conversational interfaces,” says Bindra. 

Sarvam was given access to 4,096 Nvidia H100 GPUs for training a 70-billion-parameter Indian language model over six months. (The company previously released a 2-billion-parameter model trained in 10 Indian languages, called Sarvam-1.)

Sarvam's project and others are part of a larger strategy called the IndiaAI Mission, a $1.25 billion national initiative launched in March 2024 to build out India's core AI infrastructure and make advanced tools more widely accessible. Led by MeitY, the mission is focused on supporting AI startups, particularly those developing foundation models in Indian languages and applying AI to key sectors such as health care, education, and agriculture.

Under its compute program, the government is deploying more than 18,000 GPUs, including nearly 13,000 high-end H100 chips, to a select group of Indian startups that currently includes Sarvam, Upperwal's Soket Labs, Gnani AI, and Gan AI. 

The mission also includes plans to launch a national multilingual data set repository, establish AI labs in smaller cities, and fund deep-tech R&D. The broader goal is to equip Indian developers with the infrastructure needed to build globally competitive AI and ensure that the results are grounded in the linguistic and cultural realities of India and the Global South.According to Abhishek Singh, CEO of IndiaAI and an officer with MeitY, India's broader push into deep tech is expected to raise around $12 billion in research and development investment over the next five years. 

This includes approximately $162 million through the IndiaAI Mission, with about $32 million earmarked for direct startup funding. The National Quantum Mission is contributing another $730 million to support India's ambitions in quantum research. In addition to this, the national budget document for 2025-26 announced a $1.2 billion Deep Tech Fund of Funds aimed at catalyzing early-stage innovation in the private sector.

The rest, nearly $9.9 billion, is expected to come from private and international sources including corporate R&D, venture capital firms, high-net-worth individuals, philanthropists, and global technology leaders such as Microsoft. 

IndiaAI has now received more than 500 applications from startups proposing use cases in sectors like health, governance, and agriculture. 

“We've already announced support for Sarvam, and 10 to 12 more startups will be funded solely for foundational models,” says Singh. Selection criteria include access to training data, talent depth, sector fit, and scalability.

The IndiaAI program, however, is not without controversy. Sarvam is being built as a closed model, not open-source, despite its public tech roots. That has sparked debate about the proper balance between private enterprise and the public good. 

“True sovereignty should be rooted in openness and transparency,” says Amlan Mohanty, an AI policy specialist. He points to DeepSeek-R1, which despite its 236-billion parameter size was made freely available for commercial use. 

For Alibaba and several Chinese AI startups, open-source AI presents an opportunity for faster commercialization and global recognition.

Its release allowed developers around the world to fine-tune it on low-cost GPUs, creating faster variants and extending its capabilities to non-English applications.

“Releasing an open-weight model with efficient inference can democratize AI,” says Hancheng Cao, an assistant professor of information systems and operations management at Emory University. “It makes it usable by developers who don't have massive infrastructure.”

IndiaAI, however, has taken a neutral stance on whether publicly funded models should be open-source. 

“We didn't want to dictate business models,” says Singh. “India has always supported open standards and open source, but it's up to the teams. The goal is strong Indian models, whatever the route.”

There are other challenges as well. In late May, Sarvam AI unveiled Sarvam‑M, a 24-billion-parameter multilingual LLM fine-tuned for 10 Indian languages and built on top of Mistral Small, an efficient model developed by the French company Mistral AI. Sarvam's cofounder Vivek Raghavan called the model “an important stepping stone on our journey to build sovereign AI for India.” But its download numbers were underwhelming, with only 300 in the first two days. The venture capitalist Deedy Das called the launch “embarrassing.”And the issues go beyond the lukewarm early reception. Many developers in India still lack easy access to GPUs and the broader ecosystem for Indian-language AI applications is still nascent. 

Compute scarcity is emerging as one of the most significant bottlenecks in generative AI, not just in India but across the globe. For countries still heavily reliant on imported GPUs and lacking domestic fabrication capacity, the cost of building and running large models is often prohibitive. 

India still imports most of its chips rather than producing them domestically, and training large models remains expensive. That's why startups and researchers alike are focusing on software-level efficiencies that involve smaller models, better inference, and fine-tuning frameworks that optimize for performance on fewer GPUs.

“The absence of infrastructure doesn't mean the absence of innovation,” says Cao. “Supporting optimization science is a smart way to work within constraints.” 

Yet Singh of IndiaAI argues that the tide is turning on the infrastructure challenge thanks to the new government programs and private-public partnerships. “I believe that within the next three months, we will no longer face the kind of compute bottlenecks we saw last year,” he says.

India also has a cost advantage.According to Gupta, building a hyperscale data center in India costs about $5 million, roughly half what it would cost in markets like the US, Europe, or Singapore. That's thanks to affordable land, lower construction and labor costs, and a large pool of skilled engineers. 

For now, India's AI ambitions seem less about leapfrogging OpenAI or DeepSeek and more about strategic self-determination. Whether its approach takes the form of smaller sovereign models, open ecosystems, or public-private hybrids, the country is betting that it can chart its own course. 

While some experts argue that the government's action, or reaction (to DeepSeek), is performative and aligned with its nationalistic agenda, many startup founders are energized. They see the growing collaboration between the state and the private sector as a real opportunity to overcome India's long-standing structural challenges in tech innovation.

At a Meta summit held in Bengaluru last year, Nandan Nilekani, the chairman of Infosys, urged India to resist chasing a me-too AI dream. 

“Let the big boys in the Valley do it,” he said of building LLMs. “We will use it to create synthetic data, build small language models quickly, and train them using appropriate data.” 

His view that India should prioritize strength over spectacle had a divided reception. But it reflects a broader growing consensus on whether India should play a different game altogether.

“Trying to dominate every layer of the stack isn't realistic, even for China,” says Bharath Reddy, a researcher at the Takshashila Institution, an Indian public policy nonprofit. “Dominate one layer, like applications, services, or talent, so you remain indispensable.”  

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

The shonen anime landscape is teetering on the edge of a void as big marquee series like Demon Slayer and My Hero Academia approach their final acts. Long before this shift dominated online anime conversations, manga readers had already anointed Gachiakuta as the new hot contender to fill the gap. To their surprise, Bones Studio Films, the spin-off production company behind hits like My Hero Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and Mob Psycho 100, announced it'll be helming Gachiakuta‘s anime adaptation, effectively crowning it as the next big shonen. Gachaikuta‘s two-episode global premiere advanced screening at Anime Expo proves it has the narrative muscle and inventive flair to live up to the hype.

Gachiakuta, created by Kei Urano with graffiti art by Hideyoshi Andou, is a dystopian action-fantasy series. In this world, the privileged “apostles” reside in a pristine metropolis where trash is an afterthought, while the impoverished “tribesfolk” scrape by in the slums, scavenging that very waste between the borderline of their apartheid cities. The series follows Rudo, a social outcast who scours the city for discarded relics and rejuvenates and repurposes them into their former glory. Though Rudo's restoration seeks to breathe fresh purpose into society's refuse, both the Apostles and the Tribesfolk only see him as a freak who will inevitably bring society to ruin.

Framed for a crime he didn't commit, Rudo is flung from the gleaming utopia of “the Sphere” into “the Pit,” a bottomless landfill where junk-born kaiju wreak havoc, poisonous smog chokes the air, and Mad Max-esque raiders roam. Stripped for parts and left for dead like a modern-day Prometheus (or Lucifer), Rudo vows to claw his way back to the floating city that discarded him like trash and make them pay.

As far as shonen protagonists go, Rudo is a far cry from the sunny Goku archetype that has proliferated the genre. If anything, he's got more in common with Denji from Chainsaw Man with his rough-edged, emotionally guarded demeanor. This is made exceedingly clear in the premiere's early goings, where his attempt to sport a grin looks more like a threat than a genuine smile. But the tension between Rudo's rage and glimpses of vulnerability and downright soft-boy nature makes his Greek tragedy revenge arc burn hot in its premiere. By the end of its first episode, the desire to witness him crawl out of that pit, even if it means setting the world that tossed him aside on fire, practically bangs its fists on your chest.

Gachiakuta wastes no time amplifying its controlled yet chaotic visuals and sound to make them feel utterly electrifying. Every frame of Gachiakuta is enveloped in a gritty film grain that overlays its graffiti-charged character designs, wrapping them just enough to evoke the raw texture of vintage anime. Meanwhile, its 3DCG creatures shift and clank with hulking fluidity that doesn't detract but enhances their menace. This stylish distortion also perfectly complements the manga's bold, gritty aesthetic. In tandem with its look, Gachiakuta's action and drama are underscored by a rap-metal soundtrack that bucks the sleek musical shonen polish from its contemporaries and delivers a snarling, distorted musicality that amplifies the feral feel of the series.

But what sets Gachiakuta apart is its power system, which ditches power levels for something more abstract and interesting. After awakening his “Giver” ability, Rudo has the power to channel emotional resonance through scrapped objects, tapping into their sentimental value and transforming them into powerful weapons. It's abstract, deeply thematic, and clever in its connection to the series' broader commentary on how one man's trash can be another's power.

Tonally, Gachiakuta walks a tightrope between the darkness of Doomcore and punchy levity. One moment, Rudo is fighting raiders who've spent countless years scavenging the Sphere's castoffs, dodging junk-born monsters, and mourning loved ones crushed by falling debris. Through them, Rudo's hopeful knack for reviving discarded trash is turned on its head as a deconstruction of abandoned trinkets, utilizing every part of them for both intrinsic and monetary value to stay alive. As a rare survivor from the world above, Rudo becomes the ultimate prize: a living treasure from the very system that condemned them. In the next moment, Rudo and his new mentor, Enjin, are bickering at full volume about trash kaiju while completely ignoring warnings to keep quiet. It's chaotic, it's absurd, and it works.

Sure, Gachiakuta isn't an entire flipping of the shonen script. It still nods to genre stalwarts, serving as a mentor figure and a found family in the making. Still, its spirit, dipping its tone into seinen (the genre's more mature older brother), lends its tale a refreshing atmosphere that its contemporaries aren't offering. Rudo's journey isn't about discovering friendship or self-actualization. It's about revenge, redemption, and resilience in a world built to break him. Sure, those flowery outcomes might inevitably come as a consequence of his revenge-laden odyssey, but its front-heavy themes make it sing.

With just two episodes, Gachiakuta already feels poised to be the next big shonen and more like a necessary one. It's not just filling the gap left by Demon Slayer or My Hero Academia, it's tearing that gap wider to make space for something bold, bruised, and hopefully, unforgettable.

Gachiakuta premieres July 6 on Crunchyroll.

Mark Zuckerberg once sold us the metaverse. Now he wants us to believe he's going to lead us into the age of superintelligence. Should we fall for it again?

Elon Musk once called him “Zuck the Fourteenth,” a jab comparing Meta's CEO to France's King Louis XIV—a monarch infamous for his ego, extravagance, and disregard for limits. It's a fitting label, especially as Zuckerberg floods the headlines, positioning himself as Silicon Valley's new AI king.

But let's rewind.

Just a few years ago, Zuckerberg declared that the metaverse was the future of humanity. In a slickly produced video released on October 28, 2021, he rebranded Facebook as Meta Platforms and declared, “The metaverse is the next frontier.” It was a bold new vision: a 3D immersive virtual world where we would live, work, and socialize as digital avatars using Meta-manufactured VR headsets and smart glasses.

Meta poured nearly $20 billion into Reality Labs, the division tasked with building this digital utopia, in a single year. The promise? A seamless escape from the real world into a vibrant virtual one.

But the promised land never arrived. Despite the investment, the user adoption didn't follow. Horizon Worlds, Meta's flagship metaverse platform, struggled to retain interest. The headsets were clunky, the software buggy, and the use cases unclear. People didn't want to live in VR. The metaverse flopped.

Now, Zuckerberg wants the public, and the tech world, to believe he's leading the charge into the next big thing: artificial general intelligence, or AGI. This is the holy grail of AI. A moment when machines surpass human intelligence across nearly all tasks. It's what some call superintelligence, and it's no longer just science fiction.

But there's a problem. Meta is not leading. OpenAI, Google's Gemini, and China's DeepSeek have pulled ahead with more advanced models and tools. Meta's LLaMA models are competent, but not groundbreaking. The company's biggest claim to fame in the AI arms race so far? Making its large language models open source.

Now Zuckerberg is trying to change that by opening his wallet.

In what's becoming an aggressive poaching campaign, Meta has started offering “giant offers” to top AI researchers. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, some of these offers exceed $100 million. Meta has already lured away key talent, including Alexandr Wang (founder of Scale AI), Nat Friedman (former GitHub CEO), and OpenAI veterans like Shengjia Zhao, Shuchao Bi, Jiahui Yu, and Hongyu Ren.

Zuckerberg isn't hiding it. He recently announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, an ambitious effort to consolidate AI efforts under one roof and leapfrog the competition. In his internal memo, he promised that Meta will lead the way in delivering personal superintelligence, an AI that can manage your life, schedule your time, guide your decisions, and essentially act as a personal brain assistant.

And he's made it clear: he's not done hiring.

It's a dramatic pivot and a savvy one. AI is no longer hype. It's here, and it's transforming everything from how we work to how we think. Whether you fear it or embrace it, AI is shaping the next phase of human life.

But that doesn't mean Zuckerberg gets to be its face.

After all, this is the same executive who once told the world that a legless cartoon avatar in VR was our future. The same person who sank tens of billions into a virtual world that no one wanted. Now he's asking us to trust him on AGI, a technology that could reshape the world, economies, and the future of human labor.

Zuckerberg isn't an AI visionary. He's a ruthless competitor who spots the next big thing and tries to buy his way to the top. He couldn't beat TikTok, so he cloned Reels. He couldn't acquire Snapchat, so he copied Stories. Now he's applying the same playbook to AI: buy the best people, sell a big vision, and hope the world forgets what happened last time.

If anything, his pivot to AI is proof of just how serious this moment is. Because when Zuckerberg starts spending, it's not out of curiosity. It's because he smells dominance.

And that might be the most compelling reason to pay attention.

Not because he's leading the way in building artificial superintelligence, but because he's trying to control who gets to build it, and what rules they play by.

Elon Musk's next xAI data centers are expected to house millions of AI chips and consume so much power that Elon Musk has reportedly bought a power plant overseas and intends to ship it to the U.S., according to Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis, who outlined xAI's recent progress in a podcast. Interestingly, Musk confirmed the statement in a subsequent tweet.

Elon Musk's current xAI Colossus AI supercomputer is already one of the world's most powerful and power-hungry machines on the planet, housing some 200,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs and consuming around an astounding 300 MW of power, and xAI has faced significant headwinds in supplying it with enough power.

The challenges only become more intense as the company moves forward — Musk faces a monumental challenge with powering his next AI data center, one that is predicted to house one million AI GPUs, thus potentially consuming the same amount of power as 1.9 million households. Here's how the data center could consume that much power, and how Musk plans to deliver it.

SemiAnalysis Dylan shares his thoughts on xAI Grok and research labs: > xAI has ALOT of compute concentrated > ALOT of great researchers > 200K GPUs already running > purchased a new factory in memphis > building out a new data center > now they are buying a power plant… pic.twitter.com/FhxxmFBw23July 1, 2025

Elon Musk's xAI has assembled vast computing resources and a team of talented researchers to advance the company's Grok AI models, Patel said. However, even bigger challenges lay ahead.

It is no secret that Elon Musk has already run into trouble powering his existing xAI data center. Currently, the company's main data center, Colossus, which houses 200,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, is located near Memphis, Tennessee. To power this machine, xAI installed 35 gas turbines that can produce 420 MW of power, as well as deploying Tesla Megapack systems to smooth out power draw. However, things are going to get much more serious going forward.

Beyond the Colossus buildout, xAI is rapidly acquiring and developing new facilities. The company has purchased a factory in Memphis that is being converted into additional data center space, big enough to power around 125,000 eight-way GPU servers, along with all supporting hardware, including networking, storage, and cooling.

A million Nvidia Blackwell GPUs will consume between 1,000 MW (1 GW) and 1,400 MW (1.4 GW), depending on the accelerator models (B200, GB200, B300, GB300) used and their configuration.

However, the GPUs are not the only load on the power system; you must also account for the power consumption of CPUs, DDR5 memory, storage, networking gear, cooling, air conditioning, power supply inefficiency, and other factors such as lighting. In large AI clusters, a useful approximation is that overhead adds another 30% to 50% on top of the AI GPU power draw, a figure typically expressed as PUE (power usage effectiveness).

That said, depending on which Blackwell accelerators xAI plans to use, a million-GPU data center will consume between 1,400 MW and 1,960 MW (given a PUE of 1.4). What can possibly power a data center with a million high-performance GPUs for AI training and inference is a big question, as this undertaking is comparable to powering the potential equivalent of 1.9 million homes.

A large-scale solar power plant alone is not viable for a 24/7 compute load of this magnitude, as one would need several gigawatts of panels, plus massive battery storage, which is prohibitively expensive and land-intensive.

The most practical and commonly used option is building multiple natural gas combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants, each capable of producing 0.5 MW – 1,500 MW. This approach is relatively fast to deploy (several years), scalable in phases, and easier to integrate with existing electrical grids. Perhaps, this is what xAI plans to import to the U.S.

Alternatives like nuclear reactors could technically meet the load with fewer units (each can produce around 1,000 MW) with no direct carbon emissions, but nuclear plants take much longer to design, permit, and build (up to 10 years). It is unlikely that Musk has managed to buy a nuclear power plant overseas, with plans to ship it to the U.S.

In practice, any organization attempting a 1.4 – 1.96 Gigawatt deployment — like xAI — will effectively become a major industrial energy buyer. For now, xAI's Colossus produces power onsite and purchases power from the grid; therefore, it is likely that the company's next data center will follow suit and combine a dedicated onsite plant with grid interconnections.

Apparently, because acquiring a power plant in the U.S. can take too long, xAI is reportedly buying a plant overseas and shipping it in, something that highlights how AI development now hinges not only on compute hardware and software but also on securing massive energy supplies quickly.

Without a doubt, a data center housing a million AI accelerators with a dedicated power plant appears to be an extreme measure. However, Patel points out that most leading AI companies are ultimately converging on similar strategies: concentrating enormous compute clusters, hiring top-tier researchers, and training ever-larger AI models. To that end, if xAI plans to stay ahead of the competition, it needs to build even more advanced and power-hungry data centers.

But it isn't cheap, starting from nearly $500, and this developer has no prior crowdfunding history.

There's an extremely popular new crowdfunding campaign that promises an all-in-one portable laser-driven mosquito killing machine for as little as $498. Jim Wong has set up an IndieGogo page for the “World's First Portable Mosquito Air Defense,” dubbed the Photonmatrix.

Key attractions of the Photonmatrix are its LiDAR scanner combined with a galvanometer-directed laser that can seek and destroy mosquitoes at a rate of up to 30 pests per second. Moreover, this miniature Star Wars mosquito defense works in the dark, has a radius of up to 6m (19.7 ft), and can be smartphone power bank powered for up to 16 hours.

Wong's laser-based mosquito-neutralizing product comes in two editions. The big difference between the Basic and Pro editions of the device is that the Basic model has a smaller active radius of 3m (9.8ft) max, which is doubled with the Pro edition to a 6m (19.7 ft) radius no-mozzy zone.

There's also a significant price premium on the Pro version. If the extra radius is appealing to your planned deployment, it will cost you another $200. In other words, the crowdfunding backer price for the Photonmatrix Pro is $698.

While we are talking pricing, the above-mentioned $498 (Basic) and $698 (Pro) prices are standard for the duration of this IndieGogo project. However, there are still ‘seats' for Basic-Earlybird backers, which can save you $40 off the Basic price. The project page asserts that Basic and Pro products will rise to $698 and $898, respectively, after the crowdfunding campaign is over.

Standard equipment coming to backers of the project includes the Lidar/laser unit in Basic or Pro power configs, a locator base, a bracket, a power brick, and a 2m DC connector cable. Optional extras include a rotating base, power banks of various capacities, and an adaptor to convert smartphone power banks to the required 24V.

Wong says a Photonmatrix can run for up to 16 hours with a 39,200mAh brick. Wong sells battery bundles for this IP68-rated laser bug-killing solution for up to $98. But we note that the adaptor dongle to use your own power bank is a modest $10.

Mosquitoes have had a surprisingly large role in human misery throughout our history, perhaps only rivalled by other humans. Thus, it is understandable that projects like this are popular. We previously reported on a Raspberry Pi-powered locator and zapper device (2021) that was claimed to do a similar job for those wishing to make one for themselves.

We also saw a detection-only device that highlights mosquitoes lurking in your environment using a visible laser dot, back in 2023. The Bzigo Iris device is now readily available and much cheaper, currently $199. It could be a good solution for indoors, where only a few mosquitoes usually get through to your living space, if you are handy with an electrified swatter. It comes with a handy app, too.

On the crowdfunding pages, Wong asserts that the Photonmatrix has been built with full consideration of safety for humans and pets, and that it “prioritizes safety as its core feature, it is safe enough and will not harm people, pets or even distant birds, etc.” Lots of medium/slow flying pests will be controlled by this device, but it isn't going to be 100% against common houseflies, as they can go faster (over 1m/s).

As someone who spends time in regions where mosquitoes are a common problem, I also wonder about the safety of my TV screen. It isn't mentioned in the FAQ or elsewhere, but I wonder if the killer laser might damage the screen if a mozzy settles on it and meets its smoky end there.

We hope the app will enable no-kill zones, like security camera apps let you create no-trigger zones. Another potential app feature is a mosquito-killing leaderboard, according to Q&A discussions.

This is Wong's first and only crowdfunder – so the usual precautions apply, perhaps more so here, despite what should be more than adequate funding levels. So far, Wong's product is at the “successfully developed a prototype of the first mosquito air defense system capable of identifying and neutralizing mosquitoes using high-specification lidar technology” stage. There is no doubt that quite a few hurdles remain to commercial production at the touted prices.

Remember that crowdfunding a project is not a guarantee of receiving a finished product. Backing a crowdfunded project is akin to an investment; you believe in the project and want it to succeed. You are not purchasing a retail product.

We're all being fleeced.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Many GPU buyers are hard-pressed to find a listing at MSRP nowadays, meaning you'll have to extend your budget beyond what was announced on stage if you want to build a new PC with a modern graphics card. Unfortunately, it's difficult to track all pricing changes, especially as these, along with stock data, rapidly evolve. Thankfully, Gamers Nexus has compiled all available data as best it could and presented the trends in a video. Gamers Nexus EIC and host Stephen Burke also said that the figures shown would likely change due to the aforementioned reasons, but that the report can serve as a baseline for anyone in the market for a new GPU.

According to Gamers Nexus, out of the 420 total listings found on Newegg, Amazon, and Best Buy, 56 were listed at MSRP, but only 20 were actually in stock. Some retailers also reportedly confirmed that a few of the unavailable MSRP listings were not coming back at the same price, meaning less than 5% of all the graphics cards listed sit at the price given on stage. It also listed the MSRPs of all current-generation cards (except for the RTX 5050), compared them to the average available price, and found that GPUs were priced about 28% higher, or a $134 premium on MSRP.



The worst offenders are the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs, which, on average, are priced at more than 50% of the MSRP. This shows Nvidia's monopoly of the high-end GPU market, highlighting the need for competition. Intel Arc B580 and B570 are also egregiously overpriced, with the average listing getting more than a 50% markup.

Burke noted that this was likely because one add-in board partner — Gunnir — has priced its listings so high that it's skewing overall statistics. It's only the RTX 5060 Ti (16GB) and all the other 8GB graphics cards that have their average selling price that is less than 20% higher than MSRP. In fact, out of the 20 GPU listings that were available at MSRP, only one — the RTX 5070 — had 16GB of VRAM.



If we're going to go by the law of supply and demand, it seems that only a few people are buying 8GB GPUs, as seen by pricing data reflecting an average markup of just around 15%. On the other hand, mid-range GPUs — those priced between $400 and $800 — get an average markup of 25% (except for the RX 9070 XT).

Note that all these data come from the top three retailers on the market — Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy — and that they only reflect U.S. pricing. Nevertheless, these statistics reveal that we can no longer rely on MSRP or launch pricing to determine the actual value that you will get from these GPUs in the long run.

GPU manufacturers would protest this insight, with AMD even telling the press, “It is inaccurate that $549/$599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549/$599 (excluding region-specific tariffs and/or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points, and those will also continue.” However, all this information says otherwise.

In reality, we would not know who to blame for this ruckus. Is it the GPU manufacturers for pricing the silicon too high and not enforcing the availability of options at MSRP? Or is it the board partners who are taking advantage of the hype and pricing their products higher than expected? Or is it the buyer, who willingly parts with their money despite not getting good value for it? But there's one thing for sure — if you're in the market for a current-generation graphics card right now, prepare to pay through the nose.

Large language model AI workloads are unaffected, but content creation and 3D rendering took a real hit.

It's always been clear that PCIe bandwidth has an effect on gaming, especially when playing on some of the most high-end GPUs. But what about content creation? Puget Systems put this idea to the test and found that lacking proper PCIe bandwidth can seriously hinder performance in video rendering and game development. That suggests professionals working with multiple add-in cards may need to take care in their placement to ensure the best possible performance for their workloads.

PCIe generation is almost exclusively down to your motherboard's specifications. But just because a board supports the latest PCIe 5 on its 16x slots doesn't mean they're all equal. Plugging cards into both slots can cause them to default to a mere 8x lane configuration, halving bandwidth for both cards. Installing additional NVMe SSDs can also reduce the number of available lanes, potentially impacting performance in a range of professional tasks. The same goes for older motherboards with support for older standards, too.



Puget proved that PCIe bandwidth can limit performance in its DaVinci Resolve benchmarks. The best performance was, unsurprisingly, with the PCIe configuration with the most bandwidth. Puget found only margin of error differences between PCIe 5 16x, PCIe 5 8x, and PCIe 4 16x. But when switching down to PCIe 5 4x, PCIe 4 8x, or PCIe 3 16x, performance took a 10% hit.

Dropping down one tier further to PCIe 4 4x or PCIe 3 8x saw a total dip of 25% from the original figures. That's the kind of performance drop-off that could have a serious impact on a business, potentially reducing profits through longer time to results, or more staff and equipment time required.

After Effects saw less of a drop off, with only the slowest PCIe configurations falling outside of the margin of error, but they still show an impact from having less available PCIe bandwidth. Puget recorded similar results with Unreal Engine 5.5 virtual production tests, where PCIe 4.0 4x and PCIe 3 8x were around 7% slower than the highest bandwidth configurations.

It also recorded a five percent difference between the highest and lowest bandwidth options in Blender, though the Llama large language model benchmark shows little effect.

In conclusion, it seems that available PCIe bandwidth can have a notable impact on performance in professional applications, and particularly in video editing. However, it should be noted that this test was performed with an Nvidia RTX 5090 graphics card. That's the fastest GPU in the world outside of some professional options, and it demands the most PCIe bandwidth of any card. Systems built around more modest GPUs may not suffer so much from PCIe bandwidth constraints.

Patients with autoimmune skin diseases (ASDs) showed significantly lower risks for death after cancer treatment than those without ASDs, especially those with alopecia areata or Sjögren syndrome.

“This population-based cohort study demonstrated that patients with ASDs, particularly alopecia areata and Sjögren syndrome, experienced better survival outcomes, indicating that ASDs play an important role in cancer prognosis,” the study authors wrote. “Future studies are necessary to better understand the underlying immune mechanisms and explore how this knowledge can be applied to enhance patient care,” they added.

The study was led by Li-Ting Kao, PhD, School of Pharmacy, National Defense Medical Center in Taipei, Taiwan, and was published online on July 2 in JAMA Dermatology.

The study did not account for potential confounding factors such as lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and environmental exposures. Additionally, clinical data on ASD severity, such as the extent of skin lesions, were unavailable.

The study received support through grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan. Kao disclosed receiving grants from IQVIA outside the submitted work.

Remote monitoring and patient-initiated care matched usual care in maintaining low disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) on stable TNF inhibitor therapy.

“The lower resource use in patient-initiated care can liberate time for healthcare providers to care for patients with high disease activity or more complex diseases and thus facilitate more targeted use of healthcare resources in rheumatology,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Inger Jorid Berg, MD, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway. It was published online on May 23, 2025, in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

Selection bias may have influenced results as patients motivated for alternative follow-up were more likely to participate. The open-label design and reliance on patient-reported outcomes could have been influenced by participants' enthusiasm for their assigned follow-up method. Using patient-reported outcomes as the main benchmark for clinical action in remote monitoring may affect interpretation of the results in this noninferiority trial.

Dr Rob Hicks

 July 04, 2025  

Healthcare leaders have cautiously welcomed the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England, praising its ambitions while warning that workforce shortages and funding gaps could derail its success. 

Launched by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday, the policy paper outlined major structural reforms intended to “fundamentally rewire” the NHS by shifting care closer to home and modernising services.

The plan centres on three strategic shifts:

Neighbourhood health centres will be established across England, offering diagnostics, nursing, postoperative care, and mental health services in community settings. These centres aim to reduce pressure on hospitals by extending hours and bringing services closer to patients.

By 2035, most outpatient services — such as cardiology, respiratory medicine, eye care, and mental health — are expected to be delivered outside hospitals.

England's Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the plan as “one of the most fundamental changes in the way we receive our healthcare in history.” He said the NHS should function more like a “supermarket” for healthcare, offering integrated services under one roof.

Dr Jeanette Dickson, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said the plan “promises a lot and, properly implemented, offers an opportunity to revolutionise healthcare.”

Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the shift towards neighbourhood health services is a “vital step” that recognises the “complex and interconnected challenges many patients face.”

Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said the plan could be a “game-changer,” and Daniel Elkeles of NHS Providers said it would simplify the system and speed up innovation. 

The Patients Association's CEO, Rachel Power, praised the plan's multidisciplinary approach, while the social innovation agency Nesta said it revived the NHS's original focus. “Nye Bevan's original vision for the NHS placed prevention at its heart,” said Nesta's chief executive, Ravi Gurumurthy. 

Despite strong support for the plan's aims, many leaders questioned how it will be delivered given current NHS staffing challenges.

Dr Tom Dolphin, British Medical Association council chair, warned that without tackling workforce shortages, the plan risks “rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship.” He warned that existing staff should not be “moved around like pieces on a chess board or made to work even harder.”

Professor Steve Turner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, echoed this, calling for “sustained investment” in staff.

Royal College of Nursing general secretary Professor Nicola Ranger said moving care out of hospitals was necessary but “impossible” with the current state of the workforce.

Janet Morrison, CEO of Community Pharmacy England, stressed that with many local pharmacies under financial pressure, sustainable funding is needed if pharmacists are to play a role.

Leaders also raised concerns over a lack of clarity on how the reforms will be paid for or delivered.

Thea Stein, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said the proposals were “essential” but warned the lack of detail made their success uncertain.

Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of the King's Fund, said patients would expect to see tangible improvements. “When will it mean people can see a GP more easily, or get mental health support for their child, or not wait hours in A&E?” 

Stein also cautioned that “care closer to home doesn't mean care on the cheap,” pointing out that such models can be more expensive due to reduced economies of scale. Dr Steve Taylor from the Doctors' Association UK said neighbourhood health centres already existed in the form of the existing network of over 6000 GP practices. “Investment in GPs and GP practices would be cheaper,” he said.

Dr Jennifer Dixon, CEO of the Health Foundation, agreed the plan was “the right direction” but warned that past plans with similar goals had failed without “concrete policy changes and investment.”

While the plan received praise for its ambition, health leaders agree that its success will depend on political commitment, long-term funding, and a robust workforce strategy. 

“The hard work starts now,” said Elkeles.

Augmenting antidepressant treatment with pramipexole led to a significant reduction in symptoms relative to placebo in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) at 12 weeks, a trial found. The benefits persisted over 48 weeks despite side effects, highlighting the clinical utility of pramipexole in this patient population.

""In this trial involving participants with treatment-resistant depression, pramipexole augmentation of antidepressant treatment, at a target dose of 2.5 mg, demonstrated a reduction in symptoms relative to placebo at 12 weeks but was associated with some adverse effects,"" the authors wrote.

""These results suggest that pramipexole is a clinically effective option for reducing symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression,"" they added.

This study was led by Michael Browning, DPhil, University of Oxford, Oxford, England. It was published online on June 29 in The Lancet Psychiatry.

Functional unmasking occurred during the study, potentially leading to expectancy effects. Additionally, ethnicity data were not collected, limiting the ability to determine the representativeness of the study population across different ethnic groups.

This study was supported through the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme of the National Institute for Health and Care Research.

• A study by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) measured microplastics (MPs) in various beverages sold in France.

• Contamination was found in all drinks, including those in glass bottles.

• Without toxicological data, the health risks associated with the consumption of MPs remain unclear.

Since the 1950s, plastic production has soared, and single-use plastics have driven pollution in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. As they degrade, they form micro- and nano-plastics that permeate every ecosystem — from 10,000 m beneath the ocean surface to Himalayan glaciers and even clouds.

A French national study by the MICROSOF project — led by National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment and Institute for Research in Materials — found MPs in 75% of soil samples across 33 sites. The findings highlight the widespread presence of MP pollution in French soils and its potential risks to ecosystems and agriculture.

Although quantifying MPs in the environment and human samples is challenging, micro- and nano-plastics can penetrate organs of exposure, such as the lungs, colon, and skin, and reach distant organs, such as the testes, placenta, kidneys, and brain.

A report by the Parliamentary Office for Scientific and Technological Assessment stated that 0.5% of the brain mass is made up of plastic. Moreover, the number of MPs in the lungs increases with age, suggesting long-term persistence in the body. Data indicate that MP exposure may increase the risk for conditions such as stomach cancer, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Their toxicity is also linked to the chemical substances they contain or can absorb from the environment; over 4000 are classified as hazardous to human health.

Humans primarily ingest MPs through contaminated food and drinks. Numerous studies have noted the presence of MPs in bottled and tap water and in certain foods, such as vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, tea, and rice.

ANSES researchers recently measured MP counts in bottled water, soft drinks, iced teas, lemonades, beers, and wines. They detected MPs measuring 30 μm to 500 μm in every beverage, with levels varying by beverage type.

Bottled water showed relatively low concentrations (2.9 MPs/L compared to the results already published in the literature. Sodas and lemonades registered 31.4 MPs/L and 101.5MPs/L, respectively; iced teas, 14.6 MPs/L; and beer, 84 MPs/L, with no notable difference between the varied brands evaluated. Wine in glass bottles averaged 12.0 MPs/L, although other studies have reported higher levels. The authors caution that comparing studies is challenging given the variations in standards, the variability in the size of the particles considered, the samples, and the volumes taken.

Beverages in glass bottles contained higher levels of MPs than those in plastic bottles or cans. The MPs matched the colour and polymer composition of the cap materials, suggesting that cap abrasion during large-scale storage drives contamination. Washing caps before sealing can significantly reduce MP levels. Within the glass bottle category, only wine stands out because of the use of cork stoppers.

An artificial intelligence (AI) model achieved a sensitivity of 91.8% in detecting pancreatic cancer on CT scans at diagnosis, with a 53.9% sensitivity for scans taken 1 year or more before diagnosis. The model demonstrated a sensitivity of 82.9% for stage I pancreatic cancer detection, suggesting potential for earlier diagnosis.

""This study showed that PANCANAI was able to detect pancreatic cancer in approximately half of the CT scans acquired more than a year before histopathologic diagnosis. This result suggests that the algorithm may enable timely diagnosis, which could drastically improve patients' survival,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Laura Degand, MSc, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. It was published online on June 24, 2025, in Investigative Radiology.

The study cohort consisted of only patients with pancreatic cancer, limiting the evaluation to sensitivity without the initial specificity assessment. Additionally, most CT scans were from patients diagnosed at stage IV or with undetermined staging, constraining the evaluation of the algorithm on early-stage cases. The researchers also noted technical limitations that prevented a proper evaluation of the model's segmentation accuracy through radiologist verification.

No funding information was provided for this study. Several authors reported receiving funding from and having other ties with various sources.

New research reveals that women with higher levels of hidden visceral fat face greater infertility risk, even if their BMI is normal, spotlighting the need for better screening tools in reproductive health.

Study: Association of relative fat mass with female infertility: a cross-sectional study based on NHANES 2017–2020. Image Credit: Neirfy / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined the associations between relative fat mass (RFM) and female infertility.

Infertility is the inability to achieve pregnancy after one year of regular, unprotected sex. It affects about 10% to 15% of couples worldwide and significantly impacts mental and physical health. The etiology of infertility is diverse and complex, including reproductive system abnormalities, lifestyle factors, immunological diseases, and endocrine disorders. The relationship between infertility and obesity has attracted substantial interest in recent years.

Female infertility could be due to tubal disease, ovarian dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and endometriosis. PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and impaired ovarian follicular function; these abnormalities are particularly more pronounced in females with obesity. Evidence suggests that obesity is positively correlated with infertility risk.

RFM is a more effective measure of visceral fat than body mass index (BMI). RFM is calculated using the formula: RFM = 64 − (20 × height/waist circumference) + 12 (for females). RFM integrates waist circumference (WC), more accurately reflecting visceral fat distribution. Unlike BMI, which may fail to identify women with normal weight but excess visceral fat, RFM offers improved screening for metabolic and reproductive risk.

Besides, visceral fat directly affects fertility and ovarian function by influencing chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, which are better captured by RFM. While RFM correlates with metabolic diseases, how it relates to the female reproductive system, particularly infertility, is poorly defined.

The study also notes that infertility and obesity are both linked to psychosocial impacts such as stress, anxiety, and depression, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to reproductive health.

In the present study, researchers examined the associations between RFM and infertility in females. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2017 and 2020 were used in the current analyses. Females aged 20–44 were included; those with a history of oophorectomy or hysterectomy, or missing RFM or infertility information were excluded. The primary exposure was RFM, calculated from an individual's height and WC.

The primary outcome was infertility, ascertained using questionnaire items asking whether participants attempted to achieve pregnancy for a year without success or if they consulted a healthcare provider for being unable to conceive. Covariates included age, ethnicity, marital status, education level, BMI, household income, alcohol intake, menstrual cycle regularity, sleep disorders, smoking status, and prior treatment for pelvic infection or pelvic inflammatory disease.

The association between infertility and RFM was assessed using multivariate logistic regression models. One model was adjusted for sociodemographic variables, while another was adjusted for all covariates. In addition, RFM was stratified into quartiles to test linear trends. The study also employed restricted cubic spline analysis to assess the shape of the association, confirming a linear relationship.

Finally, subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the stability of the association(s) across various demographic factors, including ethnicity, education, income, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking, sleep patterns, menstrual cycle regularity, and history of pelvic infection or pelvic inflammatory disease.

The study included 1,487 females, with a mean age of 31.9 years and RFM of 41.2. Of these, 200 subjects were infertile. Most participants were non-Hispanic White (29%), followed by non-Hispanic Black (28%), and Mexican American (14%). Around 56% of participants were married or cohabiting, and 36% were unmarried. Most participants did not smoke (70%) or have trouble sleeping (77%), and had regular menstrual cycles (93%).

Infertile females were older, married or cohabiting, and had higher RFM than those without infertility. The mean RFM was 42.8 for the infertile group and 40.9 for those without infertility. The researchers noted a significant correlation between RFM and infertility. The crude (unadjusted) model showed that the infertility risk increased by 4% for each unit increment in RFM.

In the fully adjusted model, after accounting for all covariates, each unit increase in RFM was associated with a 6% higher risk of infertility (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.12, p = 0.019).

The relationship of RFM with infertility remained after adjusting for sociodemographic variables or all covariates. Further, the highest quartile of RFM had a significantly higher risk of infertility than the lowest quartile. Specifically, the risk of infertility in the highest quartile was 2.38 times higher than in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.38, 95% CI: 0.99–5.70), although the confidence interval included 1.00, indicating borderline statistical significance for this finding. T

here was a significant and linear association, with infertility risk increasing continuously with an increase in RFM. Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed that this association was linear rather than nonlinear.

Results were stable across subgroups. The study found consistent associations across major demographic and clinical subgroups, including ethnicity, education, income, BMI category, alcohol and smoking status, sleep disorders, menstrual cycle regularity, and history of pelvic infection.

Taken together, the findings indicate a significant association between RFM and female infertility, with similar results across different subgroups. The study's limitations include its cross-sectional design, which precludes causal inference, and poor generalizability due to the sample's limited representation of the United States population.

Additionally, unmeasured confounding factors could not be entirely ruled out. Overall, RFM could be used as a potential infertility screening indicator, particularly in women who may have normal BMI but elevated visceral fat.

Future studies should evaluate its clinical significance, including through prospective and multi-level research addressing genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors.

A new study reveals that while routine heading in women's football doesn't affect balance, it subtly alters fine motor function, raising questions about the game's neurological toll.

Women exposed to various header shots in a typical football match may not experience gross motor control impairment, but rather subtle, acute changes in motor-cognitive functions. A recent Frontiers in Sports and Active Living study evaluates the effects of football heading on gross and fine motor control among women footballers.

In football, also known as soccer, heading is a relatively common and essential shot contributing to approximately 32.5% of contestable goals scored at the 2022 Women's World Cup. The average impact forces experienced by a player during heading are below established thresholds for brain injury.

Previous studies have revealed that repeated head injuries could increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases; however, more research is required to establish causality. In one instance, after a “standard” bout of football heading, a player exhibited immediate and measurable adverse effects, such as increased corticomotor inhibition and reduced memory function. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend both the immediate and long-term effects of sport-related head impacts on brain function.

Motor control assessments evaluate an individual's capacity to regulate and coordinate movements to achieve a specific task. Scientists have used this approach to assess the neurological changes following head impacts. Gross motor control is evaluated based on the form of standing balance. This assessment is based on the principle that standing balance relies on a complex interplay of mechanisms, including cortical and subcortical pathways.

Previous studies have presented contradictory results on the association between football heading and standing balance. For instance, some studies have shown impaired standing balance following heading, while others have recorded no significant changes. In comparison to male athletes, MRI analysis has shown that female athletes are more prone to undergo negative changes in white matter microstructure following football heading. As a result, researchers are more interested in understanding the effects of football heading on the brain function of female athletes.

Fine motor skills are used to assess brain function following heading. Individuals without a history of concussion perform significantly better in precision grip tasks than those who have previously experienced a concussion. Amidst the contradictory results, it is essential to determine whether heading influences the cognitive functions of female footballers.

Nineteen female football players, including ten defenders, five midfielders, and four forwards, were initially recruited from the University of Exeter Football team. The average age of the participants was 21, with approximately 11 years of playing experience. These participants were screened according to the eligibility criteria.

After familiarizing the participants with testing protocols, they were invited to the laboratory for data collection associated with a heading protocol or a control condition, which was performed in a counterbalanced order. The heading protocol was developed to replicate the match-play heading frequency, i.e., participants heading an official size 5 UEFA Women's Champions League football, launched six times every hour by a motorized ball launcher positioned 15 meters away. Considering previous literature recommendations, a ball velocity of 40 ± 5 km/h was selected to reflect match play heading intensity.

During the control condition, participants were asked to remain seated and rest for one hour. After completing the heading protocol or the control condition, they underwent cardiovascular assessments, followed by the balance and grip force tasks.

Participants completed the precision finger grip test (PFG) in the full vision (FV) and non-vision (NV) trials. All participants completed one FV, followed by two NV trials. The balance task required participants to stand in a double-leg stance with their hands on their hips, and data were collected under two conditions: eyes open and eyes closed.

The current study observed that the heading intervention induced a statistically significant decrease in oscillations in force production (OFP) tremor frequency in the 0-4 Hz band for the NV PFG (p = 0.03), while the control condition resulted in an increase in OFP in the 0-4 Hz band.

Following the heading intervention, no significant change in gross motor control regarding standing balance was observed. A higher value in the balance test centre of Pressure (CoP) sway velocity, and the range of motion (ROM) in the mediolateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions resulted in the eyes-closed condition for both intervention and control conditions.

In contrast to the control condition, a significant difference in tremor frequency of precision grip was observed after the heading protocol. This medium effect size (Cohen's d = -0.53) suggests an altered motor control strategy.

The current study indicated that a realistic number of headers at a standard ball speed in women's football games did not exhibit any change in gross motor control. However, as per a precision gripping task, heading might have induced a change in fine motor control. These studies should also account for whether observed changes are due to heading itself or confounded by exercise-related fatigue or effort.

In the future, more research must be conducted to evaluate the effect of a wider range of realistic ball velocities, beyond ~40 km/h, on acute neurological and physiological function in women's football. Furthermore, longitudinal studies must be conducted to assess the effect of heading on fine motor control. Scientists should consider brain imaging and electrophysiological measures to uncover the mechanisms underlying changes in fine motor control performance after heading a ball. The authors also noted that the absence of neuroimaging in the current study limits the ability to determine which brain regions may be responsible for observed motor changes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mapping the T cell response to Chikungunya virus","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250703/Mapping-the-T-cell-response-to-Chikungunya-virus.aspx","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 03:25:00 GMT","

A new study, published recently in Nature Communications, offers the first-ever map of which parts of Chikungunya virus trigger the strongest response from the body's T cells. 

With this map in hand, researchers are closer to developing Chikungunya vaccines or therapies that harness T cells to strike specific targets, or ""epitopes,"" to halt infection. The new study also offers important clues for understanding why many people experience chronic, severe joint pain for years after clearing the virus.

Now we can see what T cells are seeing patients with chronic disease.""

Daniela Weiskopf, Ph.D., LJI Assistant Professor, senior author of the new study

This research comes as many mosquito-borne viruses, including Chikungunya, are moving into new areas of the globe.

""Historically, Chikungunya was considered an emerging virus. Now all of Latin America has been exposed,"" says Weiskopf. ""These mosquitoes are traveling further north, and we need to know what's going on with this virus before it arrives in the United States.""

Chronic Chikungunya virus disease strikes between 30 to 60 percent of those infected-usually women-and causes chronic, severe joint pain. This debilitating joint pain can last for years following the initial viral infection. 

In a study out earlier this year, Weiskopf and her colleagues showed that these patients have a population of inflammatory CD4+ T cells that closely resembles the T cell signature of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease.

""So many people, mostly women, have chronic disease following Chikungunya virus infection,"" says Weiskopf. ""This has an impact on the workforce and impacts the economy. And there's no treatment.""

Weiskopf and her colleagues are working to understand why these CD4+ T cells linger and cause problems after a person clears the virus. For this study, they investigated whether people who develop chronic disease produce T cells that naturally target a different set of epitopes on Chikungunya virus.

Would a different ""flavor"" of T cells be more likely to stay in the body after infection?

Weiskopf and her team used a ""peptide pool"" approach to assemble a map of key T cell epitopes on Chikungunya virus. The researchers broke up the virus into very small amino acid sequences, called peptides. Then they took T cells from people with chronic Chikungunya virus disease and exposed these cells to the pool of peptides.

By stimulating the T cells, the researchers discovered exactly which parts of the virus are most likely to be recognized by T cells. These ""immunodominant"" regions may prove to be good targets for future Chikungunya treatments.

Rimjhim Agarwal, a UC San Diego graduate student and member of the Weiskopf Lab, spearheaded experiments to learn more about these T cells. Agarwal received funding from The Tullie and Rickey Families SPARK Awards for Innovations in Immunology to take a closer look. 

For her project, funded through the generosity of the Rosemary Kraemer Raitt Foundation Trust, Agarwal compared CD4+ T cells from people with chronic Chikungunya virus disease to people who cleared the virus quickly with no lasting symptoms.

Agarwal found that both patient groups had T cells that targeted the same viral epitopes. People who developed chronic disease did not recognize different proteins of the virus.

Now the question is-why do these T cells stick around to cause inflammation in some but not all people? Weiskopf and Agarwal are now looking at where Chikungunya virus might hide in the body to stimulate a long-term T cell response.

The LJI team also hopes to help other laboratories shed light on how to fight the virus. ""Identifying the immunodominant T cell epitopes could seed new research into Chikungunya-specific T cell responses,"" says Agarwal.

New research reveals that taking a quick walk immediately after eating is a simple yet powerful way to keep post-meal blood sugar in check, making it a practical strategy for healthier living.

Study: Positive impact of a 10-min walk immediately after glucose intake on postprandial glucose levels. Image Credit: Open FIlms / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined whether walking for 10 minutes immediately after consuming glucose would improve post-meal blood sugar control more effectively than walking for 30 minutes starting half an hour after glucose intake.

Their findings indicate that both approaches improved blood sugar control compared to resting, but that the 10-minute walk immediately after glucose intake was uniquely effective at reducing peak glucose spikes.

Participants chose their own comfortable walking pace, averaging a gentle 3.8 km/h (approximately 2.4 mph), which mimics how people naturally move in daily life.

Controlling blood glucose levels after meals, known as postprandial glucose control, is essential for reducing the risk of various health issues, including cardiovascular disease and dementia.

Spikes in blood sugar after eating contribute to higher glycated hemoglobin levels, a key marker of long-term glucose control, and are linked to increased oxidative stress that can damage blood vessels and impair cognitive function.

Regular physical activity has been shown to help reduce these spikes, and current guidelines recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five times per week. However, many people struggle to meet these exercise goals due to time constraints, low motivation, or physical limitations, such as during pregnancy.

To make exercise more accessible, researchers have explored shorter, more feasible alternatives. One study found that a 10-minute walk 30 minutes after dinner was as effective as a 30-minute walk in controlling post-meal blood glucose levels. Another suggested that walking immediately after a meal may be even more beneficial than waiting.

The clever study design had each person try all three routines (rest, short walk, long walk) in random order to get the clearest comparison.

Building on previous studies, researchers from Ritsumeikan University aimed to determine whether a 10-minute walk taken immediately after glucose intake could be more effective than the commonly recommended 30-minute walk taken later. Their goal was to develop a straightforward and practical approach for enhancing post-meal blood sugar control.

The randomized trial involved 12 healthy young adults (6 female, 6 male; average age 20±1 years) who were nonsmokers and free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Participants completed three test conditions: resting (control), a 10-minute walk immediately after glucose intake, and a 30-minute walk beginning 30 minutes after glucose ingestion.

Participants walked at a self-selected, comfortable pace (average 3.8 km/h) on a treadmill, with the speed maintained consistently across both walking trials. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered in each session.

Each participant visited the lab four times, once for consent and baseline measurements, and three times for the experimental conditions. Each session began at 8:00 AM with a 20-minute seated rest, followed by baseline measurements of heart rate and blood glucose.

After consuming the glucose solution within one minute, participants either remained seated or walked, depending on the assigned condition. Blood glucose levels were recorded every 10 minutes for two hours using fingertip samples. Post-exercise measures included heart rate, perceived exertion (Borg scale 6-20), and gastrointestinal discomfort.

That sharper drop in peak sugar after the quick walk? It had a strong measured effect, nearly twice the impact seen with the longer, delayed walk.

The study found that both the 10-minute walk immediately after glucose intake and the 30-minute walk beginning 30 minutes later significantly reduced blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) and average blood glucose levels compared to the control (no walking) condition.

However, only the 10-minute walk significantly lowered peak blood glucose levels (164.3 mg/dL vs. the control's 181.9 mg/dL, p = 0.028) with a large effect size (d = 0.731). The 30-minute walk showed no significant reduction in peak levels (175.8 mg/dL vs. control, p = 0.184).

Participants rated the 10-minute walk as significantly easier (median RPE 7 vs. 9 for the 30-minute walk, p = 0.003). Heart rate increased during walking but did not differ significantly between conditions. Gastrointestinal discomfort was minimal and comparable between walking sessions.

Heart rates rose during both walks as expected, but didn't spike differently between the short and long sessions, hinting at similar effort levels.

Researchers found that a brief 10-minute walk immediately after glucose intake was uniquely effective at reducing peak glucose levels compared to both resting and a 30-minute delayed walk.

These results highlight the critical importance of timing, as starting exercise immediately after eating prevents the early glucose spike that typically peaks between 30 and 60 minutes post-meal. The 10-minute walk's significant effect on peak glucose reduction (d = 0.731) suggests clinical relevance for cardiovascular risk management.

The protocol was perceived as easier and caused minimal digestive discomfort, making it practical for busy lifestyles. The authors note that this aligns with Japan's ""Plus Ten"" health initiative, which promotes small daily activity increases.

While the study focused on healthy young adults, evidence from other research suggests the benefits may extend to older adults and those with metabolic risks. Limitations include the small, homogenous sample and the use of a glucose drink instead of a real meal.

Future studies should test this approach with mixed meals and in diverse populations, including those with glucose intolerance. Overall, this study supports a time-efficient strategy—walking briefly right after eating—to improve glycemic control in daily life.

Julie Rovner KFF Health News  @jrovner  @julierovner.bsky.social

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, ""What the Health?"" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book ""Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z,"" now in its third edition.

Early Thursday afternoon, the House approved a budget reconciliation bill that not only would make permanent many of President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, but also impose deep cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and, indirectly, Medicare.

Meanwhile, those appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a key vaccine advisory panel used their first official meeting to cast doubt on a preservative that has been used in flu vaccines for decades — with studies showing no evidence of its harm in low doses.

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico, Maya Goldman of Axios, and Sarah Karlin-Smith of the Pink Sheet.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Plus, for ""extra credit,"" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week that they think you should read, too:

Julie Rovner: The Lancet's ""Evaluating the Impact of Two Decades of USAID Interventions and Projecting the Effects of Defunding on Mortality up to 2030: A Retrospective Impact Evaluation and Forecasting Analysis,"" by Daniella Medeiros Cavalcanti, et al.

Alice Miranda Ollstein: The New York Times' ""'I Feel Like I've Been Lied To': When a Measles Outbreak Hits Home,"" by Eli Saslow.

Maya Goldman: Axios' ""New Docs Get Schooled in Old Diseases as Vax Rates Fall,"" by Tina Reed.

Sarah Karlin-Smith: Wired's ""Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA,"" by Will Bahr.

The CYMEDSEC project is proud to announce a new Perspective article, recently published in npj Digital Medicine.

Authored by Chiara Carboni, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Chair of Digital Cultures, TU Dresden, recently, a result of a collaborative effort by a team of researchers from TU Dresden, including co-authors Celia Brightwell and Orit Halpern (Chair of Digital Cultures), as well as Oscar Freyer and Stephen Gilbert (Else Kröner Fresenius Center for Digital Health).

As a matter of fact, in current cybersecurity frameworks, patients, healthcare professionals, and other end users are often framed as sources of risk. This perspective argues for a fundamental shift: recognizing these users as contributors to security rather than liabilities. Through the secondary analysis of two case studies one involving Swedish hospitals and the other a UK smart-home health monitoring system the article explores the everyday tensions between standardized digital security protocols and the practical, relational needs of care.

We need a new way to think about cybersecurity in digital medicine. Rather than looking down on end-users' non-compliant practices, we should to be curious about the goals and values that inform them, and try to integrate them into security frameworks. In medicine, there can be no security without care.""

Chiara Carboni, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Chair of Digital Cultures, TU Dresden

The article outlines three key approaches to bridge the gap between cybersecurity and care:

drawing inspiration from existing care practices to reshape security design

acknowledging and empowering end users as co-creators of secure systems

using participatory design to align cybersecurity measures with on-the-ground needs and values

These findings resonate with CYMEDSEC's core mission: to develop robust cybersecurity solutions for connected medical devices that are not only technically sound but also aligned with real-world care practices. In this light, the article offers insights into how care and security, often treated as opposing logics, can in fact be reconciled.

The article is available in npj Digital Medicine.

Researchers working on an incurable blood cancer can now use a new lab model which could make testing potential new treatments and diagnostics easier and quicker, new research has found.

In a paper published in Nature Communications a team of researchers led from the University of Birmingham have studied blood cells from patients with a blood cancer called myelodysplastic syndrome disease (MDS). This disease often develops into a highly aggressive form of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML).

Working with this new model has led to confirmation that a mutation in the gene CEBPA causes progression from MDS to AML.

Our study using blood cancer cells from a patient with MDS before and after disease progression presents two exciting developments for a better understanding of the condition.

Firstly, we developed a powerful and true to life model for future research using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an actual patient which presents an exciting future for studying blood cancers as we are also able to recreate the mutations that led to the cancer.

Secondly, the confirmation that the mutation of the CEBPA gene plays such an important role in disease progression presents a significant step towards new ways to treat and diagnose MDS and avoid more serious conditions.""

I believe that our new cell culture model could form the basis of elaborate drug screening experiments which could help to find potential treatments for what currently is a highly aggressive blood cancer.""

Dr. Paloma Garcia from the University of Birmingham and lead author of the study

The team set out to examine whether changes to the gene CEBPA were driving disease progression in patients with MDS, or whether mutations were a passenger as the blood cancer developed into the more serious AML.

The team took blood cells from a patient that was diagnosed with MDS and reprogrammed these cells into iPSCs using a genetic trick. Once obtained, these cells can give rise to any cell type of the body. They then used sophisticated cell culture methods to convert them into white blood cells and red blood cells in the lab. Using multiple tests, they showed that the lab-grown cells behaved just like the patient's real cells.

Using patient cells that were obtained early during disease progression without the mutation, the researchers were then able to modify the cells' genome to include the mutation in CEBPA gene as it happened in the patient two years after being diagnosed with MDS. This change made the disease more aggressive: it reduced the number of healthy cells, blocked the formation of white blood cells, aberrant cells were formed that divide more rapidly, even when they were treated with chemotherapy, mimicking what happened to the patient.

Prof. Constanze Bonifer, a Birmingham Emeritus Professor and one of the Senior Authors on the paper said:

""To show that this was true, we did not only study the behaviour of the in vitro generated cells but also looked at how every gene in the cell population changed its activity. The experiments revealed that adding the CEBPA mutation to the mix of mutations that were already there alters how DNA is organised in blood cells, which completely changed gene activity and pushed the cells on the path to malignancy. ""

Dr. Paloma Garcia lead author of the study said: ""Using iPSC cells to model disease processes is a new and exciting way of understanding how blood cancers develop and will significantly expedite our ability to find novel treatments.""

The research group is open to collaboration, licensing, or partnering opportunities.

From wildfire triage to refugee immunization apps, AI technologies are rapidly reshaping how the world delivers care during crises, offering speed, scale, and smarter decisions when lives are on the line. 

Study: AI in humanitarian healthcare: a game changer for crisis response. Image credit: stockvideo24/Shutterstock.com

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary blend of computing technologies that could transform humanitarian healthcare by developing novel solutions to crises. A recent review in Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence examines the scope of AI-assisted healthcare crisis responses, showing how it could make them more resilient and efficient.  

AI can partner with and power various technologies that could provide more efficient and high-quality healthcare responses in emergency situations, improving decision-making and resource allocation. It can predict natural disasters, ensuring and improving real-time communication. Its use could ensure that populations at risk receive adequate and timely aid. The review analyzed peer-reviewed literature and real-world case studies from 2001 to early 2025, focusing on disease surveillance, disaster response, mental health, and ethical concerns.

Some ways in which AI empowers humanitarian healthcare are illustrated below.

AI allows first responders and planners to respond more quickly and accurately to disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires.

For instance, during the Los Angeles wildfires, AI-powered drones imaged the fire in real time and analyzed the data to predict how the flames would spread. This enabled the identification of the best evacuation routes and helped send medical teams to the right spots. In addition, the AI-driven triage of patients with burns or respiratory symptoms ensured that resources were used to help those in greatest need.

AI is being used in refugee camps on a pilot basis to analyze local conditions and predict disease outbreaks at an early stage. It also drives telemedicine applications in remote spots or when local medical resources are overwhelmed. The Children Immunization App (CIMA), implemented in Jordan's Zaatari refugee camps, supports vaccination surveillance in refugee populations and has increased the rate of follow-up vaccinations in such groups.

According to a non-randomized controlled trial by El-Halabi et al (2022), the intervention group using CIMA had a 26% follow-up return rate within one week, compared to 22% in the control group, with a 19% relative risk reduction in loss to follow-up.

AI can track and predict infectious outbreaks, including malaria, tuberculosis, and dengue, integrating variables related to the climate, human population movement, and socioeconomic factors. This could improve resource allocation and drive preventive policies.

For instance, IBM's Watson Health is used by ZzappMalaria's AI-powered app to increase the effectiveness and coverage of malaria elimination strategies while reducing the campaign's time required. The app analyzes satellite and environmental data to identify mosquito breeding sites, enabling more targeted and effective larvicide operations.

AI provides counseling to help victims of natural disasters or displacement who are suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety. Mental health resources are typically unavailable in these settings, enhancing the value of AI tools.

Chatbots like Wysa and Woebot use AI to deliver psychological support through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness strategies. They offer immediate, multilingual assistance and help reduce the burden on overwhelmed mental health systems.

AI tools are also used to monitor real-time sentiment on social media and emergency channels, helping identify mental health crises and enabling targeted intervention. In addition, AI-powered simulations are being used to train mental health professionals in crisis counseling scenarios.

Search-and-rescue robotic devices can help detect and rescue people trapped in debris after earthquakes and other natural disasters. Other robotic devices can help monitor or treat people with infectious conditions such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enhancing care accessibility.

Robotic prostheses and other rehabilitative systems also help survivors regain or improve mobility and recover faster. Such platforms will likely be used even more as digital health technologies develop. For example, the MERON app, developed and piloted by UNICEF, uses AI to screen for malnutrition in children through image analysis, improving diagnosis and care.

Differences in language often hinder humanitarian aid. AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) tools translate public health guidelines, medical instructions, and emergency alerts into other languages, reaching widely diverse populations and improving compliance with the recommendations.

The review notes that tools such as Google BERT and OpenAI's large language models are being deployed to perform real-time translations. However, challenges like mistranslation risks and language model training data bias remain.

AI can optimize aid distribution, including medical supplies, food, and equipment. Predicting demand streamlines the process and reduces waste, helping people in need to access the available resources as quickly as possible. AI-powered drones also deliver emergency medical aid and vaccines in remote or cut-off areas.

Organizations like the World Food Programme and Médecins Sans Frontières have begun using AI-powered analytics and drone systems to improve delivery efficiency and minimize waste in emergency supply chains.

AI can be used along with blockchain to provide disaster victims with secure identities. This lets them access healthcare and medical data anywhere without losing their medical history. This helps both the treating professionals and the patients. Pilot studies are ongoing in refugee camps. According to the authors, these tamper-proof digital identities enable continuity of care and reduce the administration burden associated with displacement.

AI can help forecast extreme weather events using environmental and meteorological data. Thus, it can provide early warning of environmental disasters, including drought, floods, heat waves, hurricanes, and locust swarms. This would enable preventive measures, minimizing the loss of life and property damage.

For instance, Google's Flood Forecasting Initiative is working in Bangladesh and India, among other places, providing local flood predictions based on real-time rainfall and river level data combined with the local terrain. In Africa, AI models are also being used to predict and track locust swarm patterns, helping improve food security by supporting preventative agriculture responses.

Using AI in humanitarian healthcare is challenging unless urgent limitations are faced and resolved. These include biased algorithms that could skew medical decisions and wrongly allocate resources to the wrong people. This could deprive people in need who lack political or social power or representation of help. AI training requires deliberate use of diverse datasets with constant monitoring and transparency to avoid this.

Data privacy and security are other crucial issues. Another question is accountability: Who is responsible for AI–driven patient care decisions: the doctors, the algorithm developers, or the humanitarian aid providers?

Infrastructural issues could widen healthcare inequities, as AI-powered solutions demand internet connectivity and digital infrastructure, which some populations lack. Regulatory oversight is essential to ensure AI's neutral, impartial, and humane use. This requires collaboration between government and non-governmental stakeholders.

As the paper emphasizes, achieving ethical AI deployment requires inclusive governance, human oversight of critical decisions, and deliberate efforts to avoid digital exclusion in low-resource settings.  

While AI-powered interventions promise increased responsiveness, data-driven decision-making, and inclusivity, ethical regulation is vital during the' design and implementation phases of such solutions during humanitarian healthcare crises.

With coordination between governments, NGOs, academic researchers, and technology companies, AI has the potential to become a core enabler of a more responsive, equitable, and human-centered humanitarian healthcare system.

In recent years, the application of picosecond laser (PSL) treatment for skin discoloration caused by nevus of Ota has been advancing in the fields of dermatology, plastic surgery, and cosmetic surgery. However, setting appropriate irradiation conditions is necessary to achieve effectiveness. This poses a challenge as previous meta-analyses on laser treatment research did not account for proper laser irradiation levels. Further, such analyses included results from cases with over- and under-irradiation, prompting the need for a more accurate evaluation.

A research team led by Postdoctoral Fellow Yu Shimojo, Specially Appointed Professor Toshiyuki Ozawa, and Professor Daisuke Tsuruta from the Graduate School of Medicine developed the EICF (Excessive Setting Index of Clinical Fluence) indicator using an in-silico mathematical model to determine the appropriate laser irradiation conditions. Based on this index, the irradiation parameters used in clinical practice were evaluated. The team then conducted a meta-analysis on treatment studies that were consistent with theoretical irradiation conditions.

In the case of nevus of Ota, a comparison of PSL and nanosecond laser (NSL) treatments revealed that PSL treatment demonstrated higher efficacy and equivalent safety under proper conditions.

This achievement provides scientific evidence that answers questions such as 'Why was it effective?' and 'Why did side effects occur?' in PSL treatment. Although further verification is needed, we hope EICF can be used to ensure safer and more effective laser irradiation conditions.""

Can probiotics reverse early ovarian decline? A new study in mice suggests they might restore hormonal balance and microbial health after chemotherapy-induced damage.

Study: Probiotics may improve vaginal microbiota, metabolic disorders and ovarian function-related markers by modulating gut microbiota in POI mice. Image credit: ALIOUI MA/Shutterstock.com

A study conducted by Nanjing Medical University researchers revealed that probiotics can potentially improve ovarian functions and gut and vaginal microbiota compositions in mice with premature ovarian insufficiency, a condition characterized by early deterioration of ovarian function. The study was published in BMC Microbiology. 

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a condition of premature menopause, causing deterioration of ovarian functions before the age of 40 years. The condition is characterized by abnormal menstruation and hormonal imbalance.

Women with POI experience a range of short-term and long-term health complications, which collectively affect their mental health and overall quality of life. Apart from increasing the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, POI can potentially affect fertility.

Existing evidence on the pathophysiology of POI indicates that the condition can lead to changes in gut and vaginal microbiota compositions, and that these changes are associated with hormonal imbalance observed in women with POI.

Given the potential link between microbial composition and POI pathophysiology, researchers at the Nanjing Medical University, China, conducted this study in a chemotherapy-induced mouse model of POI to investigate the effect of probiotics on the composition of gut and vaginal microbiota, markers of ovarian function, and markers of lipid metabolism.

Probiotics are a class of microorganisms that promote the growth of beneficial bacterial populations and suppress the growth of harmful bacteria. This leads to improvements in gut microbiota and a range of physiological processes in the host's body. 

The researchers generated a mouse model of POI by injecting cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapeutic drug that damages ovarian follicles. They randomly divided these mice into the POI and probiotic-treated POI groups and used healthy mice as controls.

The mice in the treatment group received a mixture of 12 probiotics for 28 consecutive days, while the control and the POI group mice received normal saline for the same duration.

Blood samples collected from the mice following treatment completion were analyzed for anti-Müllerian hormone (a crucial hormone for reproductive development) and sex hormone levels, the number of follicles, and serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. The gut and vaginal microbiota compositions were analyzed using fecal and vaginal samples, respectively.

The analysis of mice with POI revealed significantly lower levels of anti-Müllerian hormone and growing ovarian follicles and significantly higher levels of atretic follicles (degenerated ovarian follicles) than healthy mice. The POI mice also exhibited impairments in gut and vaginal microbiota.

Regarding the effect of the study intervention, the study reported that 28-day probiotic treatment caused non-significant (P > 0.05) but trending improvements in ovarian function markers, including anti-Müllerian hormone and estradiol levels, in mice with POI. The treated mice also exhibited a slight increase in growing follicle numbers and a notable, though not statistically significant, decrease in degenerated follicle numbers compared to untreated mice with POI.

The probiotic treatment caused a slight reduction in serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, with a statistically significant decrease observed in triglycerides, indicating possible metabolic improvements in POI mice.

Regarding microbial compositions, the study found that the probiotic treatment significantly altered the gut microbiota, leading to restoration of microbial compositions to levels that trended towards those of healthy mice.

While alpha diversity measure of gut and vaginal microbiota did not differ significantly amoung groups (P > 0.05), beta diversity and microbial composition showed notable shifts with probiotic treatment.

Probiotic treatment also increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the vagina, particularly Rodentibacter, with bacterial populations even exceeding those in the control group; however, the health implications of this increase require further study.

The study highlights that probiotics may help mitigate ovarian dysfunction, improve lipid metabolism, and restore vaginal microbiota homeostasis in POI mice by modulating gut microbiota composition.

Existing evidence regarding reproductive endocrine diseases suggests a link between gut and vaginal microbiota disruption, which in turn is associated with the progression and outcome of diverse reproductive endocrine disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis. The gut microbiota plays a vital role in shaping various physiological functions, including immune, neurological, metabolic, and endocrine functions. Recent evidence indicates that both gut and vaginal microbiotas are involved in the regulation of sex hormones and female reproductive system.

Scientific literature also documents that gut microbiota alterations can remotely affect vaginal immunity through the modulation of circulating immune cells. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, can reach the vagina through circulation and modulate the vaginal microenvironment.

Given the study findings, the researchers suggest that probiotics could offer a promising avenue for future therapeutic development. However, they emphasize that clinical trials in humans are needed to confirm these effects. The current results are based on a preclinical mouse model, and direct clinical application in women with POI is not yet supported by sufficient evidence.

Probiotics may help alleviate clinical symptoms, such as atrophic vaginal inflammation and metabolic syndrome, and improve long-term quality of life in women living with POI.

Future studies should focus on exploring specific mechanisms involved in probiotic-mediated regulation of microbial composition and improvement of ovarian functions to clinically establish the therapeutic potential of probiotics in patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian insufficiency. The researchers noted that clinical studies in human populations are currently underway.

The USWNT were never threatened against Ireland and Canada, outscoring opponents by combined 11-0 in three matches

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. women's national team closed out their three-match summer campaign by defeating Canada 3-0, just days after beating the Republic of Ireland twice - both by 4-0 scorelines. Given the history of U.S. vs. Canada, this final match was going to be the biggest test of the three-game run.

And, although USWNT head coach Emma Hayes started a fairly inexperienced team, they completely dominated Canada, extending their all-time record against the Canadians to 54 wins, four losses and nine draws. Beating a nation 54 times? That's the most for the U.S. against any opponent.

Hayes experimented with just about everyone on the roster across the three games, with the match against Canada the closest (roster wise) to what we saw in the opening match-up against Ireland. The only change was Lynn Biyendolo in for Ally Sentnor in the No. 9 role.

Across all three matches, the USWNT scored 11 goals and kept a clean sheet. Many players earned first appearances, and Claire Hutton and Avery Patterson recorded their first international goals. Hayes called on Coffey and Biyendolo to lead the squad, and both chipped in goals across the three-match window. Coffey scored her third of the year, and the fourt of her career. Biyendolo's finish against Ireland was her 25th career goal.

The USWNT will take a brief break until the fall which will allow for Hayes to get back to the drawing board and think about what she's going to do with all of this talent. Mind you, we haven't even talked about Sophia Wilson, Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman, as ""Triple Expresso"" were not in this camp.

So who stood out? Whose stock rose against the Republic of Ireland and Canada, and whose fell? GOAL takes a look.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

To make it this far, the US men's national team were pushed to the limit in knockout-round triumphs over Costa Rica and Guatemala.

Now they'll face a challenge multiple orders of magnitude more difficult in Sunday evening's 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup final: A fired-up, in-form Mexico eager to defend their title against their border rivals on hospitable turf at NRG Stadium in Houston (7 pm ET | FOX, Univision, TUDN).

It's a showdown the Yanks say they've been hoping for.

“We owe 'em a little something from October (when the US lost 3-0 to El Tri in a friendly in Guadalajara),” defender Chris Richards told Yahoo! Sports' Henry Bushnell after Wednesday's narrow victory over Guatemala in St. Louis, as Mexico dueled and eventually edged Honduras 1-0 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California in the tournament's other semifinal.

“We'll do it by winning a trophy.”

Mexico are not only reigning Gold Cup champions, but also possess the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League title, after the US won the first three editions of that competition. El Tri didn't even have to beat the Yanks to accomplish that: Thanks to an upset loss to Panama, the US didn't reach the final.

For a variety of reasons, and for better or worse, plenty of the program's established stars aren't part of Mauricio Pochettino's current group. Sunday's final will be the first direct experience of the storied rivalry for many among this relatively inexperienced roster. Yet it's safe to assume all have watched these clashes for many years, and dreamed of taking part.

Perhaps none more so than Diego Luna, the hero of Wednesday's win and a Mexican-American talent who was eligible to play for both countries before committing his international allegiance to the land of his birth.

“I'm very proud to be Mexican-American, my family's heritage and stuff like that, my parents,” the Real Salt Lake player explained during a Thursday appearance on the Pat McAfee Show. “But I was born in the United States, I've played here all my life, and they've given me everything I've had, and I've been able to perform for them. They've given me the opportunity to do what I do and have supported me.

“There's no better feeling than to give back to the country that has supported me and allowed me to be where I am today. And then going into Sunday, it's going to be an awesome game. There's definitely going to be some emotions – it's going to be cool to play against Mexico. My family's going to be there. But it doesn't change that I'm going all-in for the USA, and I'm going to give it my all to bring us the championship.”

The Legend of Luna continues on Sunday in the Gold Cup Final 🌕🚀 @USMNT | @MLS | @realsaltlake pic.twitter.com/c4fc2fcqAs

These North American giants have faced off in this situation seven times over the decades, Mexico winning five of them, and the odds-makers have marked them as the favorites on this occasion, too. Veteran manager Javier Aguirre arguably has more first-choice talent at his disposal than Mauricio Pochettino, particularly in a sturdy spine featuring European-based mainstays Raul Jiménez, Edson Álvarez and César Montes, and his side have posted four consecutive clean sheets after leaking two goals against Caribbean Cinderellas the Dominican Republic in their opening Gold Cup match.

The Yanks might counter that they have the quality and tenacity of Luna, standout playmaker Malik Tillman and an increasingly tight-knit collective spirit that's crystallized over an eventful month together.

“I think about Malik in previous years, and he's – I don't even recognize him,” veteran center back Tim Ream said in remarks from Wednesday's postgame mixed zone distributed by U.S. Soccer, calling the attacking duo “such a joy to play with and watch” as they each totaled a team-leading five goal contributions in the first five games of this tournament. “He's all over the place in such a good way, with and without the ball, physically strong, working for the team.

“Diego's not fazed by anything. He wants to get on the ball and make things happen,” Ream continued. “He just has that something about him, that chip on his shoulder that's like, ‘you know what? This is me, unapologetically me. Get me the ball, I'm going to make things happen, and let's drag the rest of us into the fight and get after it.'”

The US don't have to qualify for next summer's FIFA World Cup as tournament co-hosts alongside Canada and Mexico. Yet those who haven't walked the gauntlet of Concacaf qualification in past cycles got a small taste of the region's difficult road trips in St. Louis, thanks to thousands of Guatemalan supporters who trekked to Energizer Park from across the country to provide vociferous support for their team, drawing extensive praise from Pochettino.

“Yeah, it was an away game. They brought a lot of fans. The whole city was blue and white,” Richards told FOX's Jenny Taft after his team survived a bracing challenge from the Central American underdogs.

With all respect to South Texas' substantial ranks of USMNT faithful, the atmosphere at an NFL-scaled venue in Houston – one of El Tri's most-visited US cities thanks to the region's huge Mexican-American population – figures to be several times more hostile to the Yanks than Wednesday's.

For a squad desperate to show ‘Poch' they've got the fighting spirit he demands, that's one more challenge to embrace.

“With Poch coming in here, bringing in that new energy and that grit and that hard work and that mentality of doing that, but also having the technical and the tactical side of the game, I think it's bringing us to another level,"" Luna said.

“We're going to showcase it on Sunday against a very difficult Mexico team,” added the RSL star. “We're going to have a lot of flair with a dog mentality going in.”","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

This particular Gold Cup roster came into camp with just an average of 16 caps. There were a lot of question marks entering the tournament as to whether this rather inexperienced USMNT squad was talented and capable enough to lift the Concacaf trophy in July.

Several USMNT mainstays missed the Gold Cup due to injury, the FIFA Club World Cup or personal reasons, but the players on the roster saw it as an opportunity to tune out the noise and write their own story.

“We've dealt with a lot of adversity, but we've done it with a lot of heart,” defender Chris Richards said. “I think that's been the big thing this summer.”

The summer didn't start easily with two losses to UEFA teams, Türkiye and Switzerland, in international friendlies in early June. However, the USA quickly turned the page in the Gold Cup and didn't look back. The Americans came out of Group D on top, winning all three group matches. Then they knocked out Costa Rica and Guatemala in the quarter and semifinals, respectively.

“We're all eyes on Houston, and we want to win a whole trophy,” Richards said.

The USA will face Mexico in the Gold Cup Final at NRG Stadium on July 6 (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

Fellow center back and veteran leader Tim Ream said that this opportunity wasn't just happenstance. It was an intentional effort to develop chemistry on and off the field.

“What happens on the field doesn't just magically appear,” Ream said. “It takes time, and it's something that we've cultivated throughout these last four weeks. Without all the togetherness, without fighting for each other, without standing shoulder to shoulder, without having each other's backs, we don't get to this point to be able to fight for that.”

The knockout round proved to be the biggest catalyst in bringing the team together— a penalty shootout in the quarterfinal and a physical, competitive semifinal.

Now, the USMNT will face its biggest rival El Tri, for the eighth time in a Gold Cup Final. Its southern neighbor is favored over the Americans, and for the first time this tournament the U.S. enters a match as the underdog.

This isn't anything new for this group. They came into the tournament feeling overlooked, and now hope to finish as champions.

“It's something as players, you always want to be able to do,” Ream said. “You want to be able to play for trophies, you want to win trophies. And so, now here we are.”

Mauricio Pochettino reflects on the USMNT's performance after securing a Gold Cup final spot with a 2-1 win vs. Guatemala. (1:12)

Think back to a little over a month ago. Before the ChatGPT screenshots. Before the feuds. Before the say-it-to-my-face provocations. Before U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino told us, ""I am not a mannequin."" Before Christian Pulisic played golf at the wrong time. Before the embarrassing loss to Switzerland.

Now that you've occupied that headspace, imagine if I told you that the U.S. men's national team would go undefeated through the first five games of the Gold Cup. The USMNT would get a pair of breakout performances from Diego Luna and Malik Tillman. And would get a date in the final against Mexico.

You'd be pretty happy with that, wouldn't you?

And by and large, many USMNT fans and watchers are pretty happy. The team hasn't lost yet. It has overcome some adversity. Luna has become a cult hero. And Tillman is about to join Bayer Leverkusen for a transfer fee of around $40 million. Given that most of the team's first-choice players are not on the roster, it has been a successful summer.

There's one thing missing -- from this summer and the Pochettino era, at large: The team hasn't played a good game yet.

It has been 15 matches since Pochettino took over, and we still haven't seen the USMNT outplay decent, competitive opposition in a systematic, repeatable way. The U.S. has taken advantage of mistakes against bad teams, struggled to score against defensive sides, fallen apart against talented opponents and hung on against national teams that might not qualify for the next World Cup.

Sunday's final -- against Mexico, in front of what could be a partisan Mexico crowd at Houston's NRG Stadium -- will be the toughest game of Pochettino's fledgling tenure. It'll be the final time the U.S. plays a competitive match before the World Cup. It'll also be Pochettino's last chance to show that his team might be headed in the right direction.

Since 2013, the USMNT has played 60 tournament games in Concacaf across the Nations League and Gold Cup. This isn't a perfect baseline, given the drastically different opponent quality game to game, but it's a nice way of presenting the average expectation for a Gold Cup or Nations League match.

In these games, per Stats Perform data, the USMNT averages:

• 2.4 non-penalty goals scored
• 0.6 goals against
• 14.7 shots
• 9.6 shots against
• 61.6% of all final-third possession
• 28.9 touches in the penalty area
• 14.6 touches allowed in the penalty area

None of that should be surprising. The U.S. has basically doubled up its opponent in most of the top-level attacking statistics: goals, final-third possession and penalty-area touches. This is expected from a country that has been one of the two dominant powers in the region over the past 30 years.

Here, though, are the same numbers for the USMNT in Pochettino's nine games in charge across the two competitions:

• 2.0 non-penalty goals scored
• 0.9 goals against
• 12.6 shots
• 8.0 shots against
• 63.7% of all final-third possession
• 24.7 touches in the penalty area
• 15.1 touches allowed in the penalty area

This, roughly, paints the tactical picture of the USMNT under Pochettino, thus far. The team is controlling more of the territory than the USMNT had in the past, but that's not leading to better outcomes or outputs. The U.S. is generating fewer goals, shots and penalty-area touches from the increased final-third dominance, but it is also allowing more penalty-area touches and goals despite the final-third dominance.

Of course, some of that could be randomness. Perhaps this newfound level of territorial control is creating a more sound process -- but the bounces just aren't going the USMNT's way. That's possible across a nine-match sample. But that hasn't been the case.

Across the same 60-match span of games, the USMNT has created 2.0 non-penalty expected goals per game and allowed 0.7. Under Pochettino, the defense has been right at that 0.7 average, but the offensive production has dipped to 1.5 xG created per game.

This happened in each of the USMNT's past two matches. Against Costa Rica, the only chance the U.S. created worth more than 0.15 xG was Malik Tillman's missed penalty. The totals below include the penalties for each team, but even with a lopsided shot count in the USMNT's favor, the overall chance quality was roughly even. This game went to a penalty kick shootout, and deservedly so.

Orange dots are goals, purple dots are shots, and the bigger dots mean higher xG per attempt.

Then, after grabbing an early 2-0 lead in the semifinals, the U.S. hung on. Conceding 20 shots to Argentina or Spain is one thing, but this was against Guatemala.

Transfermarkt estimates the transfer value of Guatemala's Gold Cup squad to be one-fifth of what Bayer Leverkusen will pay to acquire Tillman. Put another way, the average player on the USMNT squad this summer carries an estimated transfer value of about €7 million. Added together, Guatemala's entire squad comes out to €8.3 million.

I'm not sure you need advanced stats to understand this. Across two matches against Costa Rica and Guatemala, the USMNT scored four goals and conceded three. Costa Rica ranks 46th in the World Football Elo ratings, while Guatemala ranks 75th. Even with a U.S. B-team, you'd expect some more comfortable results.

Mexico, meanwhile, is 22nd. So, Sunday's match presents a first and last for Pochettino: the last chance to win something before the World Cup, but the first time he has coached the team in a game it is not expected to win.

Due to the USMNT's depleted roster and what's expected to be a pro-Mexican crowd in Texas, El Tri are very slight favorites. Per the implied odds from ESPN BET, Mexico has a 52% chance of lifting the trophy.

Strangely, it feels like everything and nothing hinges on Sunday's game.

Nothing matters because this isn't the team Pochettino will take to the World Cup. Plus, a lot can and will change between now and next summer -- and most of it will have nothing to do with decisions made by anyone in a U.S. Soccer shirt, either.

But there are so few games in international soccer that we have no choice but to give each game an outsized amount of weight. Every successive match is another bit of imperfect information about the quality of the team.

That's how a rating system will view it, too. Per the Elo ratings, the USMNT had a rating of 1738 and a ranking of 37th when Pochettino took over. Currently, it has a rating of 1727 and a ranking of 40. Teams win and lose points every time they play a game, based on the result, quality of the opponent and level of the competition.

So, if the USMNT wins Sunday, it'll make progress under its new coach. If the team loses, it'll take a step backward. And if the match ends in a draw (and goes to penalties), the U.S. will stay where it is now: not significantly better or worse than where it was before.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The United States men's national team will face their historic rivals Mexico in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup final on Sunday, and they'll do it without some of their biggest and brightest stars.

Unlike Mexico, who came into this tournament at near-full-strength, the U.S. is missing several key players, including ""Captain America"" himself, Christian Pulisic. But why will the U.S. be so shorthanded for the final?

Here's a breakdown of why some of the biggest names in the U.S. player pool aren't at the Gold Cup:

Christian Pulisic isn't with the U.S. after deciding to sit out of the Gold Cup following two grueling seasons in Europe with AC Milan. The 26-year-old attacker told CBS Sports that he offered to play the two friendlies versus Turkiye and Switzerland before the tournament started, but coach Mauricio Pochettino turned him down.

""That's the coach's decision,"" Pulisic said. ""I fully respect that. I didn't understand it, but it is what it is.""

During a pregame press conference earlier in the tournament, FOX Sports' Doug McIntyre asked Pochettino about Pulisic's comments, and the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager didn't hold back.

""Players don't need to understand,"" Pochettino said. ""Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.

""He explained why he only wanted to be involved in two games and not the Gold Cup, and I respect that,"" added Pochettino. ""I understand him. But I do need that he understands our decision.

""When I signed my contract with the [U.S. Soccer] Federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin.""

While the best international squads in Concacaf are competing in the Gold Cup, the top clubs in the world are playing in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, including Borussia Dortmund, where Gio Reyna is under contract, and Juventus, where Weston McKennie and Tim Weah both play.

McKennie appeared in all four of Juventus' Club World Cup matches before they were eliminated by Real Madrid in the Round of 16. Weah also featured for Juventus during the tournament, but only for a single half. He's been linked with a move away from Juventus, but recently turned down a move to Premier League club Nottingham Forest.

Reyna has been the most sparsely-used American at the Club World Cup, playing just 12 minutes in the entire tournament. Dortmund will play Real Madrid in the semifinals on Saturday.

The United States' starting fullbacks at the 2022 FIFA World Cup were both left off of the Gold Cup roster due to injuries.

Sergiño Dest, who last appeared for the U.S. in March 2024 due to a torn ACL, was dropped from Pochettino's Gold Cup roster so that he could continue his recovery in the Netherlands with PSV Eindhoven. He was replaced by Holstein Kiel's John Tolkin on the U.S. roster.

Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson had an outstanding season in the Premier League with Fulham, but had it cut short after undergoing minor surgery to his right knee. He's expected to be available for the start of the 2025-26 Premier League campaign, which kicks off on August 15.

Diogo Jota, a Premier League champion with Liverpool and Portugal international, died in a car accident on Thursday in Spain, as did his younger brother Andre Silva. Jota was 28 and Silva was 25.

The tragedy inspired an outpouring of tributes to Jota and condolences to his loved ones, including his three young children and his wife Rute Cardoso, who he married less than two weeks ago. A moment of silence was observed before both matches at the Women's Euro on Thursday including Portugal's clash with Spain, while both teams in that match wore black armbands and many supporters brought images and signs paying tribute to Jota. Many of Jota's teammates and colleagues around the world took to social media to remember their friend, not only for the brilliant player that he was but the impact he left behind as a person.

The U.S. men's national team will meet Mexico in the Concacaf Gold Cup final on Sunday, not only marking the regional heavyweights' first meeting in the final in four years, but also presenting as perfect an opportunity as any for a young USMNT to finish their summer on a high.

Mauricio Pochettino's side earned their spot in the final after a 2-1 win over Guatemala in the semifinals on Wednesday, one that offered a mixed bag for an inexperienced version of the USMNT. Diego Luna stole the show with a brace in the opening 15 minutes, continuing his meteoric rise with the national team and furthering his case for a spot on next year's World Cup roster. The 21-year-old now has three goals and four assists in 11 appearances for the USMNT, performances that will likely Pochettino roll out a new-look midfield over the next few months, one that will likely include fellow Gold Cup standout Malik Tillman – and may exclude Gio Reyna, barring a strong run of form for club and country over the next year.

Sunday will offer the best opportunity for Luna, Tillman and company to impress and notch perhaps the first statement-making win of Pochettino's tenure with the USMNT, as well as a chance to work on their areas of improvement. While Pochettino's experimental Gold Cup roster has allowed him to successfully identify new options in attack, there's a lot to be desired in defense. Luna's first half brace ensured the USMNT would survive a nervy defensive showing against Guatemala but Mexico are likely to pose a stronger test not only for World Cup hopefuls, wingbacks Max Arfsten and Alex Freeman, but the center backs who are likely to make next year's roster, Chris Richards and Tim Ream.

There will be positives to take away from this summer's run no matter Sunday's results but for the USMNT to chart a true redemption arc after a year of disappointing results, lifting the final piece of silverware available to them before the World Cup will be key.

The Estêvão Derby

Chelsea have reached the quarterfinals of the Club World Cup, satisfying expectations from before the tournament.  But given the way the knockout rounds have shaped up, the expectations have shaped up to be higher as well.

That's not to say that Palmeiras are “easy” opposition.  Not by any stretch.  In fact, they have yet to lose at this tournament, getting draws against FC Porto and Inter Milan in the group, sandwiching a 2-0 win against Al Ahly, then beating fellow Brazilian Série A side Botafogo in the Round of 16 last time out.  Inter were the only team to be able to score against them, before giving up their two-goal lead in the final ten minutes.

But in some way, this was almost meant to be.  Palmeiras star Estêvão, who earned the “Superior Player of the Match” award in their first two games, will be joining Chelsea at the conclusion of the tournament.  The football gods love this sort of thing; Enzo Maresca does not.

“In this moment, he's Palmeiras player. He's going to play against [us] so we don't care if in the future, he will be with us when this competition is finish. [We] start to talk about the future when this competition is finished.”

-Enzo Maresca; source: YouTube via Reddit

All aboard The Estêvão Derby!

Date / Time: Friday, July 4, 2025, 9pm EDT; 2am BST (next day); 6:30am IST (next day)Venue: Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia, PA, USAReferee: Alireza Faghani, with VAR (he refereed the final at the Rio Olympics in 2016)Forecast: Slightly cooler and less humid than it's been

Palmeiras team news: The win against Botafogo in the previous round was all the more meaningful as Palmeiras finished second to them in the league last season.  This season, it's Flamengo with the early lead, and we know their quality already.

Abel Ferreira has been Palmeiras' head coach since 2020 and has maintained their legacy of winning, with a couple league titles to go along with a couple Copa Libertadores triumphs, plus a handful of other major and minor trophies to go along with those.  One of the few occasions they did not bring home the bacon was when they lost to Chelsea in the 2021 Club World Cup final, back in February, 2022.

Estêvão's obviously their big star and most dangerous player as well, though others have stepped up to shine as of late, including former Bayer Leverkusen forward Paulinho, who leads the team with two goals.  The most expensive signing in South American football history, young Vitor Roque, has gotten off to a very slow start since joining earlier this year, but should not be slept on either.

Ferreira has built his successes on defensive solidity and tactical flexibility, and has not been afraid to make substitutions early and often to try to change games.  The backline is anchored by captain Gustavo Gómez, with the veteran Weverton still keeping goal, as he has been for the last seven years.  Fortunately for us, Gómez is suspended due to yellow card accumulation, as is enterprising left back Joaquín Piquerez.

Chelsea team news: We have a critical absence of our own to deal with as well, with Moisés Caicedo picking up his second yellow of the tournament in the last game and thus getting suspended for one game.  To make matters worse, Roméo Lavia is dealing with a knock and may not be able to feature either.  New signing Dário Essugo looks set to start his first game in their stead.

“Not sure he can be fit. We're gonna try [but] he had a small problem at the end of the last game against Benfica, and — it's just a muscle problem. [...] We'll see if he's fit, otherwise we're gonna find different solution.”

-Enzo Maresca; source: YouTube via Reddit

We do get Nicolas Jackson back from suspension and new arrival João Pedro has been registered and should be available (if not quite match fit).  Pedro Neto's availability is in doubt however following the tragic news of his friend Diogo Jota dying in a car accident on Thursday morning in Spain.  Neto was granted compassionate leave and missed Thursday's training.

The ESPN FC crew predict the winner of the FIFA Club World Cup. (2:32)

ORLANDO -- Al Hilal coach Simone Inzaghi has admitted Rúben Neves and João Cancelo have found it ""difficult"" to prepare for the FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinal against Fluminense following the death of their international teammate Diogo Jota.

Liverpool forward Jota, 28, died in a car crash in Spain on Thursday alongside his brother André Silva.

Neves and Cancelo have both represented Portugal alongside Jota and were informed of the news while in the U.S. with club side Al Hilal, who face Fluminense in Orlando on Friday.

""We all know it's a very sad day because of what happened to Diogo and André,"" Inzaghi told a news conference on Thursday. ""These things should never happen. We're all aware of the tragedy. We have two Portugal players Rúben Neves and João Cancelo who were friends to them.

""Today has been a very difficult day for all of us. We tried to work in the same way but the atmosphere was different. It's a very, very sad tragedy.""

Cancelo was among a number of teammates to post a tribute to Jota following the news.

""Today, we didn't just wake up without two players,"" he posted on social media. ""Today, three children woke up without their father. Today, a mother and a father woke up without their two sons.

""Today, a wife woke up without her husband by her side. Today, we all woke up in shock.""

Al Hilal and Fluminense will face off in the only quarterfinal which does not include a European team, with the Brazilian side reaching the last eight by beating domestic rivals Botafogo in the round of 16.

Coach Renato Gaucho told his players to ""make history"" when they line up at Camping World Stadium.

The 62-year-old also branded his team the ""ugly duckling"" of the quarterfinalists because they don't have the same financial resources as Al Hilal -- backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund -- or European heavyweights like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or Chelsea.

""We are living this magical moment with Fluminenese,"" said Gaucho. ""We have the opportunity of playing in the semifinals among the best teams in the world. I don't know when another opportunity like this will come, if ever.

""Looking at all of these teams [in the quarterfinals] Fluminense is the ugly duckling, in financial terms at least.

""Football is decided on the pitch. We have certain difficulties when it comes to the budget so there is a gap with them [Al-Hilal]. Outside the pitch they have different conditions financially, but on the pitch it's a different story.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Enzo Maresca says Neto will make decision if he is ready

Portuguese teammates won Nations League last month

Enzo Maresca said that he will let Pedro Neto decide if he is ready to face Palmeiras after Chelsea excused the winger from training following the death of his friend and international teammate Diogo Jota.

Neto played with Jota at Wolverhampton Wanderers and won the Nations League alongside the Liverpool and Portugal forward last month.

The mood was sombre at Chelsea's training camp as they prepared to face Palmeiras in the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup on Friday. Neto was given permission to miss the session and Maresca was unsure if Neto will be in the right frame of mind to play.

“It's a very sad day,” Maresca said. “I struggle to find words, it is very difficult. You feel a little bit helpless in this situation. I can only say all my love to [Jota's] family. It's a big tragedy for them. In terms of Pedro, he is very sad. Probably more than sad. We are close to Pedro to support him.

“Because I didn't see him in training earlier. It's completely Pedro's decision [to play]. I had a chat this morning with Pedro. We support him. Any decision he will take is the correct one.”

Marc Cucurella backed Neto, who has scored three goals during the tournament, to rise to the occasion if he plays.

“The manager and he must decide but it's important that Pedro feels good,” the Chelsea left-back said. “Football is secondary but it's a long day tomorrow and whatever they decide will be good. But right now he's a player in form and I think Pedro can help us in this game.”

Chelsea have rallied around Neto. “In the morning he was sad and it was not his best moment,” Cucurella said. “But we tried to stay together and in the afternoon he was a bit better and I told him that if he's going to play then he will score because that is destiny. Hopefully we can show his love and all the good friends that we are and dedicate the goal to him.”

Chelsea also have selection problems in midfield. Moisés Caicedo is serving a one-match ban and Maresca revealed that Romeo Lavia, who has not been seen in training this week, is in doubt with a muscle problem.

“We are not sure he can be fit,” Maresca said. “We will try tomorrow. He had small problems at the end of the last game against Benfica. It is just muscular problems and tomorrow we will see if he is fit. Moi is suspended also so we need to find solutions.”

Chelsea have agreed a fee of £48.5m plus add-ons for the Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens and have added Joao Pedro to their squad after signing the forward from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m. It remains to be seen if João Pedro is ready to feature against Palmeiras.

“João Pedro's situation is a bit strange as he was on holiday,” Maresca said. “Even if he was working it is not the same when you work alone rather than with the team. We are very happy with Joao in the two days he worked with us. We will see if we need him tomorrow.”

The other key subplot to the tie is Willian Estêvão, the 18-year-old Palmeiras winger, taking on his future employers. The Brazil international has been the subject of huge attention given that he joins Chelsea after the Club World Cup.

“Everyone knew this could happen during the negotiations,” Abel Ferreira, the Palmeiras manager, said. “Everyone knew he could play. So he will do what he does. I don't have to say anything. He has to do his job. He won't play alone. Nobody plays alone in my team. He will do what he always does. As long as he is playing with us, he has this commitment with us and once he finishes his commitments with Palmeiras, he is free to start with his new club.

“He knows what he needs to do for tomorrow. I hope he gives his best for the owners of Chelsea. It will be an important opportunity for him to show how good he is. We can expect his best. Maybe to score a goal to give a goodbye for our fans, because we helped him. We helped him to grow as a man, as a professional, so it can be a good moment for him to give a goodbye with one amazing game.”

Ferreira, who is without Gustavo Gómez and Murilo in defence, jokingly called on Philadelphians to tap into their patriotism by coming to the game to support his team on the Fourth of July.

“We are the underdogs,” the Portuguese said. “It can be an opportunity for local people to join with us against the English. It can be a good moment. Tomorrow it will be Independence Day, against the English. Join us! Come with us! We need your support.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Jota, who also played alongside Neto at Wolves, died on Thursday following a car crash in Spain

Pedro Neto is a doubt for Chelsea's Club World Cup quarter-final against Palmeiras following the death of Portugal international teammate Diogo Jota.

The Liverpool forward died on Thursday following a car crash in Spain, leaving the football world in shock and a state of mourning. 

Neto, who played alongside Jota during their time together at Wolves, has not trained with the Blues on the eve of their Club World Cup last eight fixture.

And manager Enzo Maresca has now revealed that he will grant compassionate leave to the player, should he want to sit out the match.

The Blues face the Brazilian outfit on Friday evening (2am Saturday UK) at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field.

Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Maresca said: “It's a very sad day.  I struggle to find words because it's very difficult, the feeling that you have is of helplessness in this kind of situation.

“The only thing I can say is all my love to his family, the people in this moment. It's a big tragedy for them.

“In terms of Pedro it is very sad, probably more than sad.

“It's completely Pedro's decision. I had a chat with Pedro and we support him. Any decision he will take is the correct one.

“It doesn't matter if he'll be on the pitch or not. We'll see how he is feeling but, in any case, we're going to support him.”

The game could see Chelsea come up against the teenage Brazilian forward Estevao Willian, who is due to join them after the tournament.

The highly-rated 18-year-old agreed a move to Stamford Bridge last year and the current competition in the United States is his final assignment with Palmeiras.

Maresca said: “When we prepare for games, we prepare thinking about the team, not the players that are on the other side, and we have done exactly the same in this game.

“We prepare for the game against Palmeiras, not against Estevao. In this moment he is a Palmeiras player.

“We don't care if in the future he will be with us when this competition is finished. The only thing we are focused on is doing our best to try to beat Palmeiras.”

Chelsea have a fitness doubt over Romeo Lavia due to a muscular injury and fellow midfielder Moises Caicedo is suspended.

Forward Joao Pedro could make his debut after completing his £60million move from Brighton earlier this week.

Maresca said: “Joao's situation is a bit strange or different because he was on holiday. Even if he was working it is not the same when you work for yourself, compared with when you work with the team.

“But we are very happy with Joao. In the last two days he worked with us. We'll see if we need him and if we have a chance to give him some minutes we're going to give him some minutes.”

Some fans question US readiness for 2026 World Cup after Club World Cup experience

By STEVE REED AP Sports Writer



CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Lifelong soccer fan Victor Dumois expressed concern about the United States co-hosting the 2026 World Cup after attending a recent Club World Cup match in Miami.

“I think after the Copa America, a weird phenomenon has occurred here,” said Dumois, who is from Spain. “There's people that don't like the World Cup being in the United States.”

The Copa America championship game last year in Miami was a security nightmare, with overheated and ticketless fans breaking down the barriers at Hard Rock Stadium to get inside. Eventually the game was played, although some paying customers never were able to get to their seats because they were occupied. Some cited the debacle as one example of how unprepared the United States is to host soccer's biggest tournament.

Fast-forward to this summer and the 32-team Club World Cup hosted solely in the United States.

Dumois said security was tight this time around — almost to a fault.

“In Spain, it is different, you can just have an Uber or taxi take you right up to the stadium,” Dumois said, sharing his thoughts on the Round 16 match between Real Madrid and Juventus. “Here in Miami, they have to leave you outside and far away. There's so many layers of security, it's too much.”

The Club World Cup, which is entering the quarterfinals this weekend, has served as a tune-up for the United States which, along with Canada and Mexico, will host the 2026 World Cup in cities like Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle.

So far, the club tournament has not been well-attended, except for a handful of matches.

A Round of 16 knockout match at Charlotte's 75,000-seat Bank of America Stadium between Fluminense and Inter Milan drew just 20,030 fans. Stadium officials allowed fans who'd purchased upper deck tickets to move down to the lower bowl. Even then, lower bowl looked half full.

Empty seats have been a common sight across the country.

There are variety of reasons why.

First, the club tournament simply isn't as popular as the World Cup, where players are competing for their countries rather than a club team.

The costs — both for games and travel — have also kept some away.

And, for some, there have been lingering concerns of potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids at matches amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.

The weather hasn't helped either.

Benjamin Cabral lives in Boston, but his family is from Azoras, an autonomous region of Portugal.

He said if FIFA hopes to grow the game in America, a scheduling change is necessary. Due to soccer's popularity in Europe, many club matches have been played in the middle of the day so fans overseas can watch games on television or livestream in real time at night.

The downside is players have been forced to play with temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) while a major heat wave gripped the States.

“If they're trying to grow their game in the US, they need to make the games later,” Cabral said. “It's too hot out here for the players.”

It hasn't been easy on fans, either.

“There's no roof, no screens, not much,” said Carlos Olguin, who made the trek from Mexico to Charlotte to watch Pachuca play Real Madrid.

Next year's World Cup will be played during a similar time frame, beginning in mid-June and concluding in mid-July.

Excitement surrounding the current event also remains a concern.

“The other thing in the city is that it should be more prepared for the event, because there are people who don't even know there's an event and so you go to a restaurant with the idea that there are flags, fans, more football things and there's nothing,” Olguin added of the Club World Cup. “The city should be more prepared for the event, because there are people who don't even know there's an event.”

As for the venues, spectators attending Club World Cup matches offered differing reviews of American stadiums and host cities leading up to the country hosting the World Cup for the first since 1994.

“I'll be honest, the U.S. is not ready to host the World Cup,” said Jeremy Zuniga from South Carolina. “There's too many people coming from South America, Europe, everybody.”

Others, like Rogerio Bajos from Peru, feel differently.

“I think it's been good, we haven't had any problems,” said Bajos, who also attended a CWC game in Miami. “The parking is no problem, the security has been good. Overall, a stupendous spectacle.”

Humberto Contasta from Miami said the Club World Cup should help the American co-hosts iron out some issues before next summer.

Daniel Marques, who made the trek from Portugal to Charlotte for the sole purpose of watching Benfica battle Chelsea in a group play match, said he was impressed overall with how the tournament was run.

Guilherme Altoe agreed.

Altoe, who grew up watching World Cup matches in Brazil before moving to the United States nearly a decade ago, said he thinks the United States will put on a good event next summer.

“I think the United States has everything, all the infrastructure to host a World Cup,” he said. “So we are excited to have them see all the fans from different places and have family come around and it will be a great time.”

Updated 9m ago

The Club World Cup quarter-finals begin today with Fluminense and Al Hilal meeting at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida.

These two teams making it to this stage of the tournament guarantees that at least one of the semi-finalists will a non-European team. They were involved in two of the shocks of the Club World Cup in the last 16; Al Hilal beat Manchester City in extra time and Fluminense took out Inter.

Today's winner will face either Palmeiras or Chelsea in the semi-final.

You can sign up to DAZN to watch every FIFA Club World Cup game for free.

There are lots of Diogo Jota's past and present team-mates playing at this Club World Cup so today and tomorrow's games will be particularly hard for them. Al Hilal's Joao Cancelo played with him for Portugal numerous times while Ruben Neves was a team-mate of his international and for Wolves.

Their current manager, Simone Inzaghi, was asked about it in his pre-match press conference.

💬 “We all know it's a sad day because of what happened to Diogo and Andre Silva Unfortunately, these are things that shouldn't happen, which happen. As we are all aware, we have two Portuguese players, Ruben Neves and Cancelo, who were very close to the guys.

“Clearly today was a difficult day for everyone. We tried to work but clearly, the atmosphere today was not the same as other days. It was a tragedy.”

At the start, you hope it cannot be true, that it has all been a terrible misunderstanding and that something will pop up online to let us know that the internet is a wicked place when it comes to the distribution of fake news.

But then the reports start to accelerate and, waking up to the news about Diogo Jota, you realise there has been nothing on his social media accounts since the wedding photographs that he posted, lovingly, heartbreakingly, just a few hours before his life was taken away.

“A day we will never forget,” Jota had written alongside a video montage from the ceremony in Porto, the Portuguese city where he and his childhood sweetheart, Rute Cardoso, fell in love.

The football world is in mourning after the desperately sad news og Diogo Jota's passing yesterday.

The Liverpool forward and his brother Andre Silva, a professional player for Portuguese side Penafiel, died after being involved in a car crash in Spain.

Local police confirmed to The Athletic the incident occurred at 00:30 local time on Thursday morning on the A-52 — a 400km carriageway running from Madrid to the Spanish region of Galicia, north of Portugal — in the province of Zamora, in north-west Spain.

The Lamborghini car, which was occupied by 28-year-old Jota and Silva, 25, went off the road and suffered an impact, causing the vehicle to catch fire, local authorities confirmed. It is yet to be confirmed which of the two were driving the vehicle at the time of the incident.

A moment of silence will be held before each of the four Club World Cup quarter-finals.

We were treated to some real entertainment during the last 16. There was an expectation that it would be European dominating across the board but the teams from the other continents stood up to be counted.

Inter and Manchester City were eliminated in the space of a few hours on Monday in the two biggest shocks of the tournament so far.

Camping World Stadium, Orlando, Florida

This afternoon marks the final time we will be in Orlando at this tournament.

Camping World Stadium opened before World War II, and it's a huge stadium that is well known in the U.S. as a neutral site stadium for college football games. It has undergone several remodels and expansions that make the venue ideal for big concerts.

In that sense, it's clear why FIFA picked Camping World Stadium as one of the stadiums that will host one of the tournament's marquee games. Juventus versus Manchester City will have a U.S. summer tour feel to it. This time it'll be, in theory, a meaningful match in which two European powers battle for first place in Group G.

If you're a sports fan, there is no better place to follow all your favourite teams, leagues, and players than with The Athletic.

From the UK, we've got you covered throughout this expanded Club World Cup and on into the build-up to next summer's World Cup, while Wimbledon started a couple of days ago. Elsewhere, the F1 season is well into its European swing and there is Open Championship golf just a couple of weeks away.

We have the lot covered and much more besides, so make sure you're fully informed with access to our full experience. And you're in luck — you can subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here.

DAZN are the broadcast right holders for the Club World Cup, so every game will be available on their platform wherever you can access it in the world.

This game will also air on TNT in the United States. 

Amazon Prime also carry the rights to that game in Brazil for those of you hoping to follow Fluminense's progress.

This one is being played in the earlier of the two kick-off slots. That is 3pm local time (ET), so 12pm (PT) on the west coast, 8pm (BST) in the UK and 9pm (CET) in Central Europe.

For the teams involved, it is 10pm (SAST) in Saudi Arabia and 4pm (BRT) in Rio de Janeiro.



Hello! And welcome along to The Athletic where it is quarter-final day at the Club World Cup.

I don't think there were many people expecting this first last-eight tie to be without a European team, but the exploits of Fluminense and Al Hilal mean that at least one of the semi-finals will feature a team from outside Europe.

Both of these teams will really fancy their chances of progressing given they both overcame the odds to get this far.

Individuals from across the globe who are members of FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football association) have the opportunity to participate in the FIFA World Cup. This prestigious event is widely viewed across the world. 48 Teams are set to take part in the 2026 FIFA World Cup which will take place during June and July. The event will be hosted in 16 cities divided over three countries (USA, Canada as well as Mexico). The opening match has been scheduled for 11 June in Azteca in Mexico City whilst the final match will be played in the New Jersey Stadium in New York on 19 July. These 16 cities contain some amazing venues where these matches will take place.

The place division for the 2026 World Cup has already been set out as per the continental confederations. 16 Direct spots have been allocated to EUFA. 1 FIFA play-off tournament place and 8 direct spots for AFC. 1 FIFA play-off tournament place and 1 direct spot for OFC. 1 FIFA play-off tournament place and 9 direct spots for CAF. 1 FIFA play-off tournament place and 6 direct spots for Conmebol.

2 FIFA play-off tournament places and 6 direct spots for Concacaf. Three of the Concacaf slots will be allocated to the various host countries, who automatically qualify for the tournament. The top two teams per group as well as eight of the best third-place teams will progress to the round of 32. Teams will then have to play eight games from the group stage onto the final.

In any sport, the weather plays a significant part in the proceedings. With the FIFA World Cup this is no exception. Considering the current weather conditions in the United States, fears have arisen about how these conditions will affect both players and spectators alike. Current heatwave conditions are experienced across certain parts. Considering that the kick-off times is estimated to be during noon, 15:00, 18:0.0 as well as 21:00 local time, these fears are not completely unfounded.

The MetLife Stadium, located just outside New York City is the venue set for eight of the World Cup matches. This stadium has no roof and limited shading available within the stadium. The concern is not only about the wellbeing of the players but also affects the spectators and officials alike. An ideal situation in this regard would be to make use of enclosed, air-conditioned stadiums.

Another option would be to move the whole World Cup to a cooler time of the year, but this may not always be a possibility, as is the case now. University of Portsmouth's Professor Mike Tipton suggested that kick-off times be moved to the morning, but this has some logistical implications. Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, medical director of the global player's union Fifpro further suggested that extended half time breaks of 20 minutes each be considered.

According to FIFA, the WBGT or Wet Bulb Globe Temperature system is used as a guideline in these situations. The moment the measurement exceeds 32°C, shorter “cooling breaks” become mandatory during each half of the specific match. Fifpro suggested that a WBGT above 28°C should be motivation enough to implement these breaks. This is not the first time that climate conditions have been a cause for concern during the FIFA World Cup. The 2022 Qatar World Cup was moved to the cooler winter since summer temperatures were known to reach between 40-45°C. These fears and worries are very real. Some of the suggestions can however not be implemented quite as hoped for. But some of the other changes can be made which will be to the overall benefit of all the parties involved.

Chelsea and Palmeiras lock horns after meeting in the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup final, which Chelsea won 2-1. Both teams enter on the heels of extra time wins, with Chelsea winning 4-1 over Benefica and Palmeiras winning 1-0 over Botafogo. 

Both teams are defensive-minded. Chelsea will want to hold possession for long stretches, while the Brazilian side held PSG scoreless in a 1-0 surprise win during the group stage of this tournament. PSG are the betting favorites to win the tournament and boast a strong attack, which should tell you enough about Palmeiras. 

Chelsea is the betting favorite to advance and have the third-shortest odds to win the tournament at +410 at FanDuel, behind PSG (+220) and Real Madrid (+270). Palmeiras is +1600. 

Let's get into this matchup with betting picks below and all odds coming via FanDuel Sportsbook. 

Chelsea is the superior team. There's no denying it. That talent discrepancy will pan out in the end, though I'm not sure that this will be a straight forward win for the Blues. 

Their deliberate style actually plays into the hands of Palmeiras. They'll drop back and let Chelsea bring the game to them. That could make this game feel one-sided, but it's actually the match Palmeiras will want. 

That said, Chelsea's one-sided possession should also lead to few chances for Palmeiras. With such pressure on them to take advantage, they could try and be too perfect in the finish. 

Chelsea's defense has been solid for the most part and the openings will be slim. Even Benfica struggled to find room against them. 

I see a low-scoring game. While the juice is high at -154, that's the best bet. 

If you want to get more aggressive, Palmeiras UNDER 0.5 goals is another bet I'd wager.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Lifelong soccer fan Victor Dumois expressed concern about the United States co-hosting the 2026 World Cup after attending a recent Club World Cup match in Miami.

“I think after the Copa America, a weird phenomenon has occurred here,” said Dumois, who is from Spain. “There's people that don't like the World Cup being in the United States.”

The Copa America championship game last year in Miami was a security nightmare, with overheated and ticketless fans breaking down the barriers at Hard Rock Stadium to get inside. Eventually the game was played, although some paying customers never were able to get to their seats because they were occupied. Some cited the debacle as one example of how unprepared the United States is to host soccer's biggest tournament.

Fast-forward to this summer and the 32-team Club World Cup hosted solely in the United States.

Dumois said security was tight this time around — almost to a fault.

“In Spain, it is different, you can just have an Uber or taxi take you right up to the stadium,” Dumois said, sharing his thoughts on the Round 16 match between Real Madrid and Juventus. “Here in Miami, they have to leave you outside and far away. There's so many layers of security, it's too much.”

The Club World Cup, which is entering the quarterfinals this weekend, has served as a tune-up for the United States which, along with Canada and Mexico, will host the 2026 World Cup in cities like Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle.

So far, the club tournament has not been well-attended, except for a handful of matches.

A Round of 16 knockout match at Charlotte's 75,000-seat Bank of America Stadium between Fluminense and Inter Milan drew just 20,030 fans. Stadium officials allowed fans who'd purchased upper deck tickets to move down to the lower bowl. Even then, lower bowl looked half full.

Empty seats have been a common sight across the country.

There are variety of reasons why.

First, the club tournament simply isn't as popular as the World Cup, where players are competing for their countries rather than a club team.

The costs — both for games and travel — have also kept some away.

And, for some, there have been lingering concerns of potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids at matches amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.

The weather hasn't helped either.

Benjamin Cabral lives in Boston, but his family is from Azoras, an autonomous region of Portugal.

He said if FIFA hopes to grow the game in America, a scheduling change is necessary. Due to soccer's popularity in Europe, many club matches have been played in the middle of the day so fans overseas can watch games on television or livestream in real time at night.

The downside is players have been forced to play with temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) while a major heat wave gripped the States.

“If they're trying to grow their game in the US, they need to make the games later,” Cabral said. “It's too hot out here for the players.”

It hasn't been easy on fans, either.

“There's no roof, no screens, not much,” said Carlos Olguin, who made the trek from Mexico to Charlotte to watch Pachuca play Real Madrid.

Next year's World Cup will be played during a similar time frame, beginning in mid-June and concluding in mid-July.

Excitement surrounding the current event also remains a concern.

“The other thing in the city is that it should be more prepared for the event, because there are people who don't even know there's an event and so you go to a restaurant with the idea that there are flags, fans, more football things and there's nothing,” Olguin added of the Club World Cup. “The city should be more prepared for the event, because there are people who don't even know there's an event.”

As for the venues, spectators attending Club World Cup matches offered differing reviews of American stadiums and host cities leading up to the country hosting the World Cup for the first since 1994.

“I'll be honest, the U.S. is not ready to host the World Cup,” said Jeremy Zuniga from South Carolina. “There's too many people coming from South America, Europe, everybody.”

Others, like Rogerio Bajos from Peru, feel differently.

“I think it's been good, we haven't had any problems,” said Bajos, who also attended a CWC game in Miami. “The parking is no problem, the security has been good. Overall, a stupendous spectacle.”

Humberto Contasta from Miami said the Club World Cup should help the American co-hosts iron out some issues before next summer.

Daniel Marques, who made the trek from Portugal to Charlotte for the sole purpose of watching Benfica battle Chelsea in a group play match, said he was impressed overall with how the tournament was run.

Guilherme Altoe agreed.

Altoe, who grew up watching World Cup matches in Brazil before moving to the United States nearly a decade ago, said he thinks the United States will put on a good event next summer.

“I think the United States has everything, all the infrastructure to host a World Cup,” he said. “So we are excited to have them see all the fans from different places and have family come around and it will be a great time.”

We preview
this quarter-final match at the 2025 FIFA Club
World Cup with our Palmeiras vs Chelsea prediction. Which club
will progress to the semis and move closer to
glory?

After Manchester City's exit in the last round, Chelsea
are the Premier League's only remaining club at the 2025 FIFA Club
World Cup. What's more, Man City's exit to Al-Hilal along with
Inter's defeat to Fluminense have opened up Chelsea's half of the
draw and, on paper, made their route to the final a potentially
simpler task.

But we know football isn't played on paper, and as Brazilian
clubs have proved so far at this tournament, they are no pushovers.
In beating Inter on Monday, Fluminense sealed a third victory for
Brazilian clubs against European opposition at the FIFA Club World
Cup – one more than they've lost (2).

Palmeiras will be looking to take that tally of wins to four on
Friday as they face Chelsea at Lincoln Financial Field in
Philadelphia with a place in the semi-finals on the line.

This will be the second meeting between Palmeiras and Chelsea,
with the Blues winning the final of the 2021 Club World Cup (2-1
after extra time), but the Brazilian side could be a much harder
proposition this time around. Their 1-0 extra-time win over
Botafogo in the last round was their 10th clean sheet in their last
14 matches in all competitions, a run dating back to 30 April.

Chelsea only have to look back to the group stage to remember
how difficult a Brazilian opponent can be, as they lost 3-1 to
Flamengo despite taking the lead through Pedro
Neto.

Neto has been one of Chelsea's best players at the Club World
Cup, with the Portuguese winger heading into this match having
scored in three consecutive matches for the first time in his
senior club career. Before this run, he'd scored only three goals
in his previous 30 appearances in all competitions for the English
club.

Moisés
Caicedo has also impressed at this tournament and leads all
Chelsea players for regaining possession from opponents (20),
tackles made (12) and duels won (22). He will be missing for this
game, however, after his second yellow card of the Club World Cup
in the 4-1 victory over Benfica. Another player who will miss out
is 
Benoît Badiashile after he was injured in that clash against
the Portuguese side, but Enzo Maresca will welcome back Nicolas
Jackson after serving a two-match ban.

João
Pedro, who signed from Brighton on Wednesday for a reported fee
of £60m, is expected to go straight into the Chelsea squad for this
game and could make his debut.

Palmeiras will be missing captain Gustavo Gómez through
suspension following his red card in the last round against
Botofogo, while Joaquín Piquerez is also suspended after picking up
his second caution of the tournament in that win.

Estêvão will be a player that Chelsea fans will have a close eye
on in this match, not just because of the threat he poses to the
Premier League side in this game, but also because he'll join the
English club after this tournament. No Palmeiras player has been
involved in as many open-play sequences (16) or as many shots at
this tournament as he has (16 – 8 shots, 8 chances created), so
expect him to cause his future side some problems.


Chelsea are strong favourites to knock out Palmeiras and
advance to the semi-finals of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup,
according to the Opta supercomputer.

The Blues progressed to the next round in 74.8% of the
supercomputer sims – more than any other side in the last eight of
the competition. They made it to the final four inside 90 minutes
64.8% of the time, while Palmeiras won in normal time in 15.3% of
the 10,000 pre-match simulations.

Including the possibility of extra-time and a penalty shootout,
the Brazilians advanced to the semis just 25.2% of the time.

Some fans question US readiness for 2026 World Cup after Club World Cup experience

Preparations are afoot for the biggest World Cup in football ever, as U.S. vice president J.D. Vance, president Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino took part in a meeting of the White House Task Force in May 2025.  Photo: Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images

Opinions on playthegame.org reflect the views of the author(s).Now less than a year away, the 2026 FIFA World Cup is already proving to be a hugely contentious event, particularly in the context of the volatile and increasingly totalitarian US political climate under President Donald Trump. I have previously argued here about the grotesque use of the tournament to legitimise his ecocidal energy regime, and credible concerns have been raised by many about the safety of visiting fans, about the potential impact of travel bans, regarding discord between the host nations related to Trump's tariff war, and so on, all of which have culminated in what is likely to be the first of many organised calls to boycott the tournament. To these, we might add another, less politically contentious, and more straightforward objection to the upcoming event: the human costs in premature deaths.

According to the literature on the human impacts of the climate emergency, the 1000 ton rule refers to a formula that for every 1000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere, approximately one person will die prematurely as a result. More on the formula later, but applying it to expected World Cup emissions, the 2026 World Cup could lead to the premature deaths of 69,777 people.   In this article, I will show how I arrive at a figure for World Cup-related emissions of 69,777,892 tons which - using the 1000 tons formula - will lead to the premature deaths of 69,777 people. It is also a figure that is more than 18 times greater than the preliminary estimate in the bid for the 2026 World Cup.  

How could we end up in this situation? The C02 emissions estimate for the 2026 World Cup currently in use is 3.7 million metric tons, which, if true, would make it the deadliest sporting carbon bomb in history. However, this number significantly underestimates the actual impact of the tournament for several reasons. 

The one year count down to the World Cup 2026 has begun in host cities like Toronto in Canada. Photo: Arrush Chopra / NurPhoto / Getty Images

It should be clarified at the outset that an agreed-upon framework for calculating the true carbon footprint of these mega-events does not exist, necessitating a good deal of guesswork. The widely cited 3.7 million tons figure is derived from an environmental impact assessment (EIA) done by the sustainability consulting firm ARUP in 2018 as part of the United 2026 bidding process. Even they acknowledge that “[A]t present, there is no standardised or agreed methodology for undertaking a carbon footprint of major sporting events.” Instead, they utilise the typical approach, which is to duplicate the previous estimating practices from various other mega-events.It is also true that these assessments are frequently done by or for sporting bodies who have an incentive to underestimate the environmental impact of their activities in line with their many green declarations. This is a greenwashing tendency that various environmental watchdog organisations and legal bodies have identified.For instance, FIFA was found guilty by Swiss advertising regulators of misleading the public about Qatar 2022 being carbon neutral, and emissions calculation expert Mike Berners-Lee suggested the tournament would emit at least 10 million tons, more than triple the official estimate. The desire to appear green leads to convenient omissions in the types of pollution that are included in their estimates. As such, much remains uncounted in these accounts, despite the now voluminous data associated with increased consumption during mega-events. Thus, no consideration is given to the impact of increased global spending on food, drink, and electronics during the tournament, to off-site broadcasting centres, to the mountains of books, magazines, stickers, and other fan paraphernalia, to increased sales by energy behemoth tournament sponsors and advertisers, to enlarged non-official media and social media consumption, to massive increases in online betting, and so on. While these all should be incorporated into a full true cost accounting of the entirety of the tournament's impacts, here I will simply add in a few emissions sources that obviously ought to be included.

Predictably, the now seven-year-old environmental impact assessment from ARUP is the most up-to-date accounting of the World Cup's anticipated impacts. In this document, they sensibly call for the creation of an ongoing carbon management plan and the formation of an environmental protection advisory group. 

However, a FIFA spokesperson could not confirm the existence of either entity and said that FIFA's updated estimates of the tournament's impacts would be unavailable until after its conclusion, so ARUP's assessment is the only data available, excluding this almost entirely content free “sustainability strategy” document. The most indisputable flaw in the assessment is that it is based on now-outdated assumptions. The 3.7 million tons estimate is based upon a tournament that was understandably imagined to last 32 days and include 80 games. As a result of FIFA's decision to maximise the scope of their newly expanded 48-team tournament, the finals will now last for 39 days and have 104 games. If we adjust the estimate to include the additional 24 games, we are starting from 4.81 million tons of emissions.

Given the location FIFA chose for the tournament, most of the predicted emissions originate from international (51%) and domestic travel (34%), as fans fly to the continent and then travel between widely dispersed cities across North America. 

However, the emissions estimates per passenger are based on average passenger behaviour, and the nature of this World Cup is such that its attendees will be far from normal consumers. FIFA's use of dynamic ticket pricing, inflated accommodation and airfare prices during the tournament, and the costly distances between events all conspire to ensure that this will be a festival restricted primarily to the global elite.For instance, FIFA packages of tickets to see the first four games of any team at the tournament currently start at 6,750 US dollars, with eight match packages including the final costing 73,200 US dollars. Obviously, this is beyond the reach of most fans. But within this already affluent audience, FIFA requires that each stadium set aside between 3,025 and 9,300 particularly luxurious seats per game for “commercial affiliate hospitality,” VIPs, and VVIPs, and insist upon the provision of several thousand 4-5 star hotel rooms for these one-percenters.   This socioeconomic group does not consume or emit anything like the rest of us, and they are, in fact, largely responsible for the climate emergency that imperils our collective future. As Oxfam reported in its briefing 'Extreme Carbon Inequality':

“Around 50 per cent of [global] emissions can be attributed to the richest 10 per cent of people around the world, who have average carbon footprints 11 times as high as the poorest half of the population, and 60 times as high as the poorest 10 per cent. The average footprint of the richest 1 per cent of people globally could be 175 times that of the poorest 10 per cent.” The impact of their extravagant lifestyles is quantifiable. In his book 'The Carbon Footprint of Everything', Mike Berners-Lee explains that a first-class airline ticket has four times the carbon footprint of an economy one, and a night in a luxury hotel room has 25 times that of an ordinary room. 

Perhaps the most repulsive symbol of this opulence is the private jet, which has roughly ten times the emissions of someone travelling on a first-class ticket, and is essentially the worst thing a human being can choose to do in terms of their deleterious impact on our planet's ecosystem.

Depending on the model, an hour flying in a private jet produces the same emissions as a global annual average person's emissions of 4.5t C02. Leading from the front as always. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has travelled 600,000 km on a Qatari-owned private jet in the last three years. He will be amongst friends at the World Cup in this regard. A recent study in Nature on the growing environmental impacts generated by private aviation revealed that 1,846 private jets flew to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, surpassing the total for the next four largest events (the WEF, Cannes, COP 28, and the Super Bowl) combined. This profligacy will be significantly increased in 2026, not only because the tournament will feature 16 more teams and 40 more games, but also because fans will not be flying to one tiny country with stadiums clustered tightly together, but to and across a vast continent with host cities several thousand kilometres apart. Again, using a lowball estimate (here utilising a bootstrapping statistical analysis to create average flight patterns), 2,400 private jet-setting fans travelling this way will spew an additional 101,500 tons of carbon, and 5,000 fans choosing to fly first class will add 81,000 tons. It is worth pausing here to remind ourselves that all of the emissions associated with a World Cup are, by definition, what Henry Shue calls luxury rather than subsistence emissions, as the tournament doesn't need to happen at all. The lavish activity of the ultra-wealthy in this very public context is thus particularly obscene and dispiriting. As Andreas Malm argues in his book 'How to Blow Up a Pipeline', luxury emissions “represent the ideological spear of business-as-usual, not only maintaining but actively championing the most unsustainable kinds of consumption,” and they must be the first to be erased before we can ask struggling people to make sacrifices: “if we have to cut emissions now, that means we have to start with the rich.” We do.

Another anomaly in the environmental impact assessment is the inclusion of the nominal 4,626t of C02 emissions produced by on-site TV broadcasting centres, but not the gargantuan impact of those generated by the world's consumption of the same content that is produced there. 

Watching football on television is a relatively low emissions activity, but when billions of people do it for several hours a day, many days of the congested schedule include 4-6 games per day, for 39 days, it adds up jarringly.

These emissions are difficult to track, but we can extrapolate from the official figures for the previous tournament and adjust them for the greater scale of this event, generously assuming no increased global appetite for football in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.Given this, the World Cup finals will generate 121,171 hours (approximately 13 years) of licensed video content. This will correspond to 58,857,500,000 hours of linear global television consumption, which, using Berners-Lee's estimate of 295.5g per hour, contributes a staggering 17.4 million tons of emissions. The 4.8 billion hours of online video content consumption and live digital streaming will add a further 2.6 million tons. This is a low estimate, as it doesn't include the massive and growing world of illegal streaming. At the 2018 Russia World Cup, online security experts identified 40,713 piracy links viewed by an audience of 41,317,139, primarily on social media. But the authorised consumption of World Cup content alone contributes roughly 20 million extra tons.

In terms of merchandise, there is no clear reason why we should only include the 4,909 tons associated with official apparel bought through FIFA, but not the far greater volume associated with World Cup fan gear more broadly. 

Remarkably, as a major part of the fashion sector (the fourth largest source of pollution), the football apparel industry alone is estimated to produce 0.4 per cent of global carbon emissions, and this figure spikes around major tournaments. 

The 2022 tournament saw a 700 per cent increase in the sales of football shirts, and the market is growing quickly. The average football shirt generates 5.5 kg of CO2, and 60 per cent of them are thrown away annually.

Actual sales figures are suspiciously hard to come by, so let's very conservatively assume increased shirt sales of 250,000 per team - for context, top club teams can sell over 3 million shirts annually, and in 2018, Nigeria sold 3 million of its famously stylish shirts, as did Germany. That's 12 million extra shirts, producing 66,000 additional tons of C02. However, this only includes replica shirts, not the even greater mountains of fan apparel that is consumed globally around the tournament, and also doesn't include the illegal market for fake team shirts, which now accounts for one and a half shirts for each licensed one that is made, each with a worse environmental impact.

To recap, our running total for the finals is now 25,058,500 tons, or 240,947 tons per game.

But we need to account for another curious decision: why FIFA would only include the emissions associated with the 104 games in the finals and exclude those generated by the approximately 865 qualifying matches that are also obviously a part of the same tournament. It makes sense that the bidders for the World Cup 2026 would exclude these emissions, but FIFA is responsible for the tournament in its entirety, not just the finals. If we assign each of these matches only a fifth of the carbon impact (48,189 tons) of those at the World Cup finals due to a reduced average attendance, television audience, and so forth, this adds another 41,683,485 tons, raising the total to 66,741,985 tons.  

Emissions from qualifying matches for the World Cup 2026 like the recent match between the Netherlands and Malta, should also be included in the total emissions of CO2 generated by the World Cup, argues Tim Walters. Photo: Marcel van Dorst / NurPhoto / Getty Images

It is also true that until its abandonment in 2021, FIFA's World Cup emissions estimates have always included those from the Confederations Cup held the summer before. As part of a broader pattern of emissions gigantism, this once minor warm up event involving 4-8 national teams, which served as a sort of dress rehearsal or stress test for the host nation, has been replaced with the rightly derided and unlovable Club World Cup, a considerably more energy intensive affair involving 32 club teams. If we follow the tradition of including the emissions linked with this event in the World Cup estimate and allot each of the 63 games only the same as a World Cup qualifying match, then the Club World Cup matches add another 3,035,907 tons. This leaves us with a grand total of 69,777,892 tons, more than 18 times greater than the preliminary estimate in the bid for the 2026 World Cup.  

The most famous quote about the uniquely obsessive nature of our love of football comes from legendary Liverpool FC manager Bill Shankly: “Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.” 

The football industry's expansive and hypercapitalist disposition in the human-influenced geological age called the Anthropocene provides a grim opportunity to test Shankly's hypothesis, as we can now roughly calculate the human casualties associated with the beautiful game in its ugly current incarnation. In the literature on the human impacts of the spiralling climate emergency and the “social costs of carbon,” the 1000-ton rule refers to the formula that, for every 1000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere, approximately one person will die prematurely. This is a powerful psychological and political tool for making the consequences of our emissions less abstract. Rather than comparing events to the emissions produced by countries, which is a popular but seemingly unmotivating strategy, we can now actually assign a number of victims to our activities.If we take FIFA's own current emissions estimates for the 2026 finals, then their newly expanded tournament will kill 3,700 people. Including the emissions additions proposed above, a more plausible number is 69,777 people. The question then becomes: how many thousands, or tens of thousands, of our fellow humans are we willing to knowingly sacrifice in order to enjoy a certain kind of bloated and garish football tournament, one increasingly only accessible to the global elite? Is 69,777 corpses a price humanity is willing to pay to allow 6.5 million of the world's wealthiest people to live, and emit, like kings for 39 days in the name of football?69,777 is too many and could have been avoided had FIFA been driven by motives other than short-term self-enrichment. Given our catastrophic and ongoing failure to do so, convincing ourselves to reduce our global emissions seems to be a genuinely wicked problem of existential proportions. But reducing the emissions produced by a football tournament really isn't difficult, even if the football industry appears committed to making exactly the most environmentally wrong choice at every opportunity. There is a place for football in the Anthropocene, but as I have argued elsewhere, this must begin with a sectoral commitment to degrowth, to reducing the scale and scope of these tournaments in favour of smaller, healthier competitions, featuring less but better football. 

Football's governing bodies have insanely chosen precisely the opposite path, and are already contemplating a 64 team World Cup and a 48 team Club World Cup. For the world beyond the World Cup, this is the path of no tomorrow, and the consequences for humanity will be deadly. 

Many theorists have noted that our current language is inadequate to describe the uncanny new realities of an era of spiralling climate catastrophe. How can we characterise a global sporting organisation's decision to repeatedly choose expansionism, profiteering, and willful entanglement with the fossil fuel industries that are driving us to a sixth mass extinction, in total disregard of the human toll it will take? Given the relentless ecophobia and abject misanthropy that have defined FIFA's decision-making during his tenure, we might consider the following grim neologism: Infantinocide.

France is one of the most historic and prolific football nations in the world. In the women's game, Lyon, its dominant domestic force, have won eight Champions League titles in the last 15 years, including five in a row between 2016 and 2020, with three more narrow final defeats coming in that same time period. Yet, despite French players consistently being at the very forefront of OL's achievements, it has never translated into success for the national team.

Les Bleues are notoriously a 'nearly' side. After finishing fourth at the 2011 Women's World Cup, France have never made it beyond the quarter-finals - despite hosting the 2019 tournament - and only once have they progressed to the semi-finals of a European Championship. At the Olympic Games, its a similar story, with a fourth-placed finish in 2012 followed up by quarter-final exits in 2016 and 2024, the latter of which was again on home soil.

As Euro 2025 begins, there are signs that their fortunes could change. Under new head coach Laurent Bonadei, Les Bleues are in flying form, having won all eight of their fixtures this year, and are certainly a serious contender for the title. But as they prepare to compete in the 'group of death' with England, the Netherlands and Wales, there are also suggestions that this could actually just be another underwhelming campaign characterised by chaos.

The UEFA Women's Euro 2025 starts on July 2 and runs until the grand final on July 27. The Women's Euro 2025 will take place across Switzerland, featuring stadiums in Basel, Geneva, and Bern.

If you're looking for your chance to secure Women's Euro 2025 tickets, fret not. We've got all of the intel for you to get a seat at this international tournament in Switzerland.

UEFA Women's EURO 2025, which is the 14th edition of the Women's European Championship, is being held from Wednesday, July 2 to Sunday, July 27. Switzerland is staging the tournament for the first time, and the host nation will be hoping that playing in front of their fervent home fans will prove to be a good omen. The Netherlands were the host nation when they won the Women's Euro 2017, and England reigned supreme on home turf at Women's Euro 2022. Women's Euro 2025 matches will be staged in eight Swiss cities: Basel, Bern, Geneva, Zurich, St.Gallen, Lucerne, Thun & Sion.

Other major timelines for the events you might want to note include:

Here's a closer look at where you can watch the Women's Euro 2025 from where you are:

Women's Euro 2022 was won by the tournament hosts, England. Chloe Kelly was the goalscoring heroine as she netted the winning goal in extra time against Germany. It was the first time an England senior team had won major footballing honours since the men's side had won the FIFA World Cup in 1966. The Lionesses were led by Sarina Wiegman, who had coached the Netherlands to glory five years earlier at Women's Euro 2017.

The 16 teams playing at Women's Euro 2025 are split into four groups of four teams. The top two sides in each group will progress to the quarter-finals. The groups were confirmed during December's draw in Lausanne and are as follows:Group A: Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Finland

Group B: Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy

Group C: Germany, Poland, Denmark, Sweden

Group D: France, England, Wales, Netherlands","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Gonzalo Garcia: Real Madrid's 'new Raul' can save Los Blancos millions and keep Kylian Mbappe fresh","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/gonzalo-garcia-real-madrid-new-raul-can-save-los-blancos-millions-keep-kylian-mbappe-fresh-club-world-cup-endrick-future/blt428dabc989598e77","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The 21-year-old has been key to Los Blancos' progression in the United States, and is now set for a role in Xabi Alonso's squad next season

Thibaut Courtois claimed that he knew what Real Madrid's biggest problem was. He'd been out there at Santiago Bernabeu, watching from his own 18-yard box as Madrid toiled through their 5-1 aggregate loss to Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-finals.

The issue wasn't that Raul Asencio was rash at centre-back, nor that the midfield was mightily unbalanced. It wasn't Rodrygo's quiet night, or Lucas Vazquez's suspect defending. Rather, it was because Madrid were missing a gangly striker in his mid-30s who had left nine months earlier.

""We put in a lot of crosses, but this year we don't have a Joselu, a born striker up there,"" Courtois said following the 2-1 home defeat to the Gunners in the second leg. ""Sometimes you have to be self-critical. I feel that we have to make more team plays and not all individual.""

Courtois had a point. Madrid put in cross after cross on the night, but Arsenal dealt with them with some ease, despite missing Gabriel Magalhaes. The fact that the Madrid goalkeeper brought up Joselu - someone who is below the technical levels usually required at the very highest level - ensured the quote go somewhat viral, but his broader point was true: Madrid needed a No.9.

Three months on, and little has changed. Madrid are an expensively assembled football team with more attacking talent than pretty much anyone out there, but they don't really have a big lad to put the ball in the net. In Gonzalo Garcia, however, they might have found the answer.

Garcia, a product of the Madrid academy, has impressed at the Club World Cup while Kylian Mbappe has sat out due to illness, and has scored or assisted in every game during their run to the quarter-finals. That's a small sample size, but perhaps significant enough to keep him in Xabi Alonso's plans, thus save the club a fair few Euros in the process.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

All you need to know about Spain's squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup

Reigning European champions Spain will be one of the favorites for the upcoming World Cup in 2026. The Spanish national team has undergone a major transition in recent years, with a new generation of young stars replacing the veterans.

Confident and full of energy, these youngsters will lead La Roja at the global stage next year, following a successful Euros campaign in Germany in 2024. Spain had waited 12 years to lift a major international trophy since Vicente del Bosque's legendary team that won back-to-back European Championships and the 2010 World Cup.

However, their World Cup performances have been disappointing since that historic win in 2010. Spain were eliminated in the group stage of the 2014 tournament and exited in the Round of 16 in both 2018 and 2022.

Nevertheless, there is no denying that the current Spanish team has quality, and with a capable manager like Luis de la Fuente in charge, La Roja will be hopeful of making a strong impact on the biggest stage of them all next year.

So what does their roster look like? GOAL takes a look at the players at their disposal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The football world was in mourning after the tragic passing of Liverpool and Portugal forward, Diego Jota, on Thursday.  Various media reports revealed that the 28-year-old died in a car accident with his younger brother, Andre Silva.

A relatively peaceful July 3 in the football world was suddenly shaken by the tragic news of Jota's passing, which many found hard to believe. There was certainly no indication that the Portuguese striker, who was still 28-year-0ld would be leaving so soon.

However, with many reputable media outlets and eventually official statements from Portugal and Liverpool, the world finally accepted that Jota has indeed died. According to the reports, the attacker passed away due to a tragic car accident while he was driving with his brother, Andre Silva, in Spain.

Jota's sudden passing brought the football world into sadness, especially for those related to Liverpool and Portugal. The striker has just won the Premier League title with his club and the Nations League title with his national team.

Moreover, in his personal life, the former Wolves striker has just tied the knot with his high school sweetheart, just 11 days before his passing. The couple already had three little kids together, which makes Jota's passing even more gut-wrenching.

Following the official confirmation regarding the Portuguese international's death, the football world is officially in mourning state. Jota's teammates in Liverpool and Portugal bid their farewell to Jota via social media, along with many other footballers and ex-players.

Fans have also shown their respect, not only via social media but also by visiting Liverpool's ground and his former club, Wolves, as well. The supporters bid their farewell with flower bouquets, scarves, and some also sang his chants to remember him.

In respect for his passing, Liverpool have also announced that they will be retiring Jota's shirt number, 20, from now on. The number 20 is not only the number he has worn since joining the Reds, but it somehow has other interesting coincidental meanings as well. Jota joined Liverpool in 2020, and last season he helped them win their 20th league title.

Rest in Peace, Jota

“It was a childhood dream,” Mensik told ATPTour.com in London when speaking about his meeting with Messi following the Miami final. “When I was a kid, Messi was already one of the most famous people in the world. Meeting him, chatting, taking a picture—it's something special. You realise he's actually a real person.”

Messi, a World Cup victor with Argentina and a record eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, watched Mensik shock Djokovic in straight sets to become just the fourth player to win their first title at an ATP Masters 1000 event.

“I definitely felt nervous, of course! He's not watching your match every day,” Mensik said with a grin. “It might be a once-in-a-lifetime thing. You're used to watching him play football, but now he's watching you play tennis. That's pretty cool.”

A post shared by Jakub Menšík (@mensik.jakub)

If Mensik continues his current trajectory, he will have stars like Messi attending his matches more often. Following his Miami crown, the Czech has risen to a career-high No. 17 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The key to his success? Staying grounded.

“I like to also be a normal person, doing normal things, like everyone else,” Mensik said. “So that might mean eating some ‘cheat foods' during the offseason or when I'm not practising or in tournament periods. I like to go out and have fun, playing golf, relaxing.

“Of course, I'm a professional athlete and I want to do things as professionally as I can. But at the same time, I want to enjoy life.”

It's a tricky balance. The Tour can be relentless with long-haul flights, quick turnarounds, and minimal time at home. For a 19-year-old in just his second year on the circuit it's a steep learning curve but one he is enjoying.

“Sometimes you're on Tour for so long, two months abroad, maybe more. You don't see your friends, it's tournament after tournament,” Mensik said. “You've got to practise, stay focused on the game… but at the same time, you want to relax and enjoy yourself.

“When you're between tournaments, you try to enjoy life as much as you can. You've got to stay grounded. But yeah, too much of that can also be a problem, you can lose your edge.”



Right now, Mensik's edge is sharp. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF competitor is 24-12 on the season and is into the third round at Wimbledon for the first time.

Speaking earlier this week, Mensik opened up on why Wimbledon is so special.

“It does feel different, because Wimbledon is full of tradition, and I love it,” Mensik said. “Some of the traditions, I didn't even know. I'm getting to know them when I'm here. You can just see how the tournament is and how historic. You can see that there are almost ‘laws' that have kept everything as it is throughout the decades.”

On court, the 15th seed has defeated Hugo Gaston and Marcos Giron and will next meet Flavio Cobolli. After going 2-4 on the surface last year, Mensik is chasing small improvements this year.

“I had my first experience of grass at ATP Tour events last year but now I am excited to continue playing on the surface,"" Mensik said. ""I think I can find a good level on it, with my forehand, serve. I have things to improve for sure but I am feeling great now and I love it here in London.”

After a restless night, Ben Shelton needed just 71 seconds, yes, seventy-one, to punch his ticket to the third round at Wimbledon on Friday.

The American was already in command, leading Rinky Hijikata 6-2, 7-5, 5-4 when their match was halted Thursday night due to fading light at 9:29 p.m. Sixteen hours later, Shelton strode back onto No. 2 Court with one goal, finish it quickly. Four crisp swings of the racquet later, it was game, set and match.

“He [the supervisor] said it was a five-minute warning until Hawk-Eye went down,” Shelton explained of the decision to suspend play on Thursday. “I was telling him, ‘I only need 60 seconds.' That was kind of my goal when I went out there today.”

Shelton recounted the conversation with a smile, recalling his confusion over why the match couldn't continue.

“I'm like, ‘I'm already serving for the match.' At that point I was not as upset about the decision,” he added.

Despite his dominant position in the match, the 22-year-old admitted that switching off overnight was nearly impossible.
“When you're in the middle of a match, you're thinking about what you did, what you could have done, how you could have been off the court, what you're going to do when you get back out there,” Shelton said. “For me it's what my game plan is going to be for that one service game to make sure that I hold. You can't really completely switch off.”
Aiming to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon for the second consecutive year, Shelton will next meet Hungarian Marton Fucsovics. The 22-year-old is currently 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will hope to boost his Nitto ATP Finals hopes with a deep run at SW19. Four of the top eight players in the Live Race To Turin have fallen at Wimbledon, with Casper Ruud missing the event due to injury.

Taylor Fritz flipped the script on Friday at Wimbledon, where he channeled a bit of Alejandro Davidovich Fokina's own gritty energy to move past the Spaniard into the fourth round.

After two testing five-set clashes to reach this stage, Fritz delivered a more dominant display to triumph 6-4, 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1. The fifth-seeded American twice received a medical timeout to treat a cut on his right elbow from diving on the grass — something Davidovich Fokina is known for — before earning a three-hour, 12-minute victory.

In the fourth game of the second set, Davidovich Fokina charged the net and produced a clean drop shot, which sent Fritz diving to the grass in a bid to recover it. He subsequently lost the point and received his first medical timeout of the day during that game.

“It's getting pretty annoying having to stop all the time,” Fritz said with a smile when asked about his diving. “I feel bad for my opponent when I keep having to stop all the time, but you can only really do it on grass. I'm just really determined to get some of these balls, and eventually I'm going to win one of these points.”

Tennis or aerobics? 🤔@Taylor_Fritz97 | @Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/sOSE2t2n6X

Competing in front of a star-studded lineup in the Royal Box, which included British boxer Anthony Joshua, Fritz failed to serve out the match at 5-3 in the third set when Davidovich Fokina produced an inspired turn in form to extend their third-round clash. Yet Fritz quickly brushed aside the momentum shift by sealing an early break and racing into the fourth round at SW19 for the third time in four years.

Fritz took another medical timeout after winning the second set to treat a blister on his right foot, but he showed few signs of discomfort en route to levelling his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Davidovich Fokina at 3-3.



After winning a record-extending fourth title in Eastbourne, where he defeated Davidovich Fokina in the semi-finals, Fritz is riding a seven-match winning streak. In the fourth round at Wimbledon for the third time, the two-time quarter-finalist Fritz will next face Luciano Darderi or Jordan Thompson.

Fritz produced a memorable fourth-round comeback win against Alexander Zverev, in which he rallied from two sets down to stun the fourth seed. Currently at No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, Fritz has the opportunity to reclaim the World No. 4 spot from Jack Draper, who was upset by Marin Cilic on Thursday, with another deep run at Wimbledon.

The billionaire activist investor tells FOS his pro tennis debut at the Hall of Fame Open in Newport is his chance to become the oldest person to earn ATP points.

While the Wimbledon quarterfinals are underway next week, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman will be competing in a different grass tennis tournament in Newport, Rhode Island.The 59-year-old founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management will play in the Hall of Fame Open, an ATP Challenger event at the International Tennis Hall of Fame, where he'll battle alongside doubles partner Jack Sock.

If the duo win their first match, Ackman is “pretty sure” he'll be the oldest person in tennis history to win ATP points. (ATP did not respond to a request for comment.) Victory would earn them 25 points each and prize money of $2,030, which Ackman says will go to Sock.

“I've never met Jack Sock,” Ackman said in an interview with Front Office Sports on Thursday. That'll change on Friday, when the partners start training in Bridgehampton before traveling to Newport on Sunday ahead of the tournament. Doubles matches begin Tuesday.The duo will be sponsored by Nike. The two have not discussed which side of the court they'll take, but Ackman is prepared to be a team player: “I assume I'm playing on the deuce side because Jack prefers the ad side, so to accommodate Jack, I'll switch.”

Ackman says he tries to hit for 90 minutes four to five times in a regular week and every day during the summer. He plays with a Tecnifibre racquet after switching from one made by Babolat within the past year on the recommendation of his coaches Olivier Morel and Georgy Chukhleb. 

“When my serve is on, it's good,” says Ackman, a right-hander who has a one-handed backhand. He declined to identify the strongest part of his game. “I'm peaking next week,” he adds with a laugh.Ackman says he doesn't play on grass often, which puts him in the same camp as most ATP players, who spend the majority of the year competing on clay and hard courts. But he is at least familiar with the grass courts at the Hall of Fame, which last weekend hosted the “Finance Cup,” where Ackman and his partner Richey Reneberg reached the semifinals.

The Hall of Fame Open overlaps with the second week of Wimbledon, and often lures competitors who have made an early exit from the year's third Grand Slam. Ackman has no plans to fly to London to watch; he says he's hyper-focused on Newport, where he's hoping for cooler temperatures and mild humidity.

“I'm going to try to have a lot of fun, we'll do everything we can to win and put on a good show,” says Ackman. “It's a once in a lifetime experience—unless we win.”Nebraska-born Sock is an accomplished 32-year-old former pro who earned four ATP Tour singles titles and 17 doubles titles during his career. He retired in 2023 and now plays pickleball and hosts the Nothing Major podcast with former tennis players John Isner, Sam Querrey, and Steve Johnson. Sock is reemerging from retirement to play with Ackman.So how did Ackman and Sock gain their wildcard entry to next week's tournament?“As a former champion here in Newport, Olympic gold medalist, and three-time major champion in doubles, the Hall of Fame was happy to support Jack Sock's wildcard request,” a spokesperson for the International Tennis Hall of Fame tells Front Office Sports.

“Jack asked Bill Ackman to be his doubles partner, and the ATP approved the selection,” she added, highlighting that Sock is a fan favorite in Newport and that Ackman is a long-standing supporter of the Hall of Fame's nonprofit mission. Sock lifted the men's doubles title in Newport in 2021 alongside William Blumberg.

“I am playing the best tennis of my life and Jack is one of the greatest doubles players ever,” Ackman wrote in a post on X on Wednesday that, as many Ackman tweets do, got a lot of media attention. He said it was initially Nick Kyrgios who proposed they play in a tournament together, but Kyrgios's injury delayed that plan.Ackman, a longtime tennis aficionado who helped finance Frances Tiafoe's junior career, has been across the net from some of the greatest ever to hold a racquet, including 20-time major champion Roger Federer. “I was so intimidated, I played poorly,” lamented Ackman.The hedge fund titan did, however, get the better of Andre Agassi in a doubles match, and has practiced with professionals including Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas and Canada's Vasek Pospisil, a co-founder of the Professional Tennis Players Association which counts Ackman as a backer.

He's also earned a doubles victory over former pro Noah Rubin, who reached a career-high singles ranking of 125. 

“He's definitely accustomed to pressure,” Rubin tells FOS. “The first time we played, I was shocked by his serve—for a guy that didn't really play his whole life, he can really pop a serve,” adds Rubin, founder of the media platform Behind the Racquet, who has known Ackman for roughly five years.“If he's accelerating and going for his shots, he can definitely surprise people,” Rubin says, noting that opposing players will face another type of pressure: not wanting to lose to Ackman. “I'm curious to see how he acclimates to the pressure of a tennis arena.”

Rubin will be on site in Newport as the coach of Eugenie Bouchard, a former Wimbledon singles finalist who is making a return to women's tennis.

On Wednesday, Ackman encouraged his 1.8 million X followers to buy tickets to the event, but his presence has not yet shown signs of boosting the tournament's bottom line—though it should certainly boost Tennis Channel viewership.“Ticket sales have been strong the past several weeks,” the Hall of Fame spokesperson says, “and yesterday was no different heading into the holiday weekend.”

Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 3-1 Struff

Jan-Lennard Struff gets on the board in this third set. 

Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 3-0 Struff*

Tim HenmanFormer British number one on BBC Two

It's a fine line, isn't it? We commend Jan-Lennard Struff when he goes for his shots and he makes some winners, but he just went for too much there.

Three double faults in one service game makes it a difficult one to hold.

Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 3-0 Struff*

It's a second hold to love for Carlos Alcaraz in this third set.

Ominous signs that the Spaniard has regained his poise. 

*Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 2-0 Struff

Jan-Lennard Struff blinks first in the third set.

The German double faults twice, giving Carlos Alcaraz two break points.

After saving both, Germany's number three double faults again to give the defending champion a break up. 

Jarry 6-3 6-4 3-6 4-3 Fonseca*

BIG hold for Nicolas Jarry.

A huge roar from Joao Fonseca as he passes Jarry at the net to bring up break point at 30-40.

It's a tremendous response from Jarry though, sending Fonseca scurrying to his right but unable to retrieve a powerful forehand.

That's the first of three break points saved by Jarry before he eventually wins the game.

Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 1-0 Struff*

Beware an angry Carlos Alcaraz.

The Spaniard came out swinging there, winning to love and taking the hold with a world class, deft touch at the net. 

*Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 Struff

Mark Woodforde17-time Grand Slam doubles champion on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

Struff is being very brave and he is staying true to his type of tennis. The standard is really starting to pick up here. 

The weight and pace of shot from Struff has started to pick up and Alcaraz is struggling with the strength from the big German. 

*Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 Struff

Gary RoseBBC Sport at Wimbledon

There was one excellent point at the net in there that prompted a shake of the fist by Carlos Alcaraz but otherwise it was more frustrated looks at the ground from the world number two as he just had no answer to some of Jan-Lennard Struff's big hitting.

Alcaraz has a battle on - not for the first time at this tournament.



Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 Struff*

Tim HenmanFormer British number one on BBC Two

Jan-Lennard Struff has definitely settled in now. He is showing the type of tennis that he is capable of. It was all one-way traffic to begin with, but Struff has definitely established himself in this match.

He is building pressure on Carlos Alcaraz's serve and applying scoreboard pressure here.

*Alcaraz 6-1 3-6 Struff

What a turn up for the books.

Jan-Lennard, from a break down, wins the second set.

What a massive improvement that was from Germany's number three. 

*Jarry 6-3 6-4 3-6 3-3 Fonseca

Harry PooleBBC Sport at Wimbledon

“Jooo-owwww!”

“Fonseccccaaa!”

That back-and-forth chant has been the backdrop of much of this match, since Joao Fonseca's fans really livened up with their star man a set and a break down.

It continues to echo around court two between points, as they hope to have an influence on this finely poised fourth set.

He's got plenty of work still to do if that's to become the sound of the summer at SW19.

Alcaraz 6-1 3-5 Struff*

Hello!Jan-Lennard Struff earns himself a break point and takes it in emphatic fashion, stepping into Carlos Alcaraz's serve and crashing a forehand winner to go a break up.

He'll serve to win the second set. 

Jarry 6-3 6-4 3-6 3-2 Fonseca*

Nicolas Jarry follows Joao Fonseca's lead in the previous game by falling 0-30 down and then turning it around to hold serve.

A massive ace gets it done and there's a guttural roar from the Chilean straight afterwards.

*Alcaraz 6-1 3-4 Struff

Gary RoseBBC Sport at Wimbledon

A big shout from Carlos Alcaraz there as he watched a big serve flash past him. Another ace seals the hold and there's yelps of surprise at this sudden - and massive - upturn in performance from Jan-Lennard Struff.

We've got a game on now.

*Alcaraz 6-1 3-4 Struff

Much, much better from Jan-Lennard Struff.

The German's mixing up his serve - both in terms of speed and direction - to keep Carlos Alcaraz guessing. 

He holds to 15. 

*Jarry 6-3 6-4 3-6 2-2 Fonseca

A good recovery from 0-30 down on his own serve from Joao Fonseca, who levels things up in the fourth set.

Alcaraz 6-1 3-3 Struff*

Jan-Lennard Struff misses a sniff of an opportunity for a break there.

The German goes 15-30 up but Carlos Alcaraz wins three points in a row to turn it around. 

Jarry 6-3 6-4 3-6 2-1 Fonseca*

Nicolas Jarry has never made it beyond the third round at Wimbledon before. Currently ranked 143 in the world, he got through three qualifying matches to make the main draw and then knocked out eighth seed Holger Rune in round one.

Two confident service holds nudge him narrowly in front in the fourth set.

*Alcaraz 6-1 2-3 Struff

Much better from Jan-Lennard Struff.

He's finding his rhythm now and it's much harder for Carlos Alcaraz.

The German holds to 15.

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — Thursday night, Ben Shelton remonstrated with officials as darkness fell over Wimbledon, after the tournament suspended his second-round match just as he was about to serve for the win.

Friday afternoon, Shelton took one minute, 10 seconds, three aces and one unreturned serve to complete a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 win.

Though that's not really true. His brain missed getting its full day of relaxation during a Grand Slam. He would have hit on his off-day anyway, but in this case, he had to mentally prepare for playing another two sets.

Later, he described his interchange with a tournament official Thursday night, who told him that the electronic line calling system was going to shut down in five minutes. Wimbledon deemed that wasn't enough time to finish his match.

The 22-year-old American was four points from closing out his match against Rinky Hijikata on No. 2 Court, set to serve at 6-2, 7-5, *5-4, when a tournament official appeared on the court and told him the match was being halted for the night.

Shelton just about lost it, especially given he and Hijikata discussed the match's being suspended at the start of the third set, and again three games later. Officials told them to play on, and then, at 9:30 p.m., told them to stop.

A spokesperson for the tournament said that “due to poor light it was not possible to continue and not an option to move to another court.”

“I was telling him, I only need 60 seconds,” Shelton said in his news conference Friday.

“That's kind of what my goal was when I went out there today. Yeah, he told me there wasn't enough time. I was like, ‘well, has it gone down yet, or did they give you the five-minute warning?'”

Shelton wanted to play until the system shut down. The official said they didn't want to have to stop in the middle of the game.

In his news conference, Hijikata confirmed that he and Shelton and been unanimous in their desire to stop play.

“I think we both knew that we weren't going to finish the third before it got dark,” he said.

“We both said to the umpire: ‘I don't think we're going to finish this set, I think we should stop now and come back at the beginning of the set the next day.'

“I don't know what the reasoning was, but they told us to keep playing. By 3-2 or 4-2 it was already dark. Then we were playing in the dark for, like, 10, 15 minutes. Again, it's the same for both of us.

“It was slippery also. I asked the umpire as well in the third set to come check the court. Yeah, he said it was fine. I said, ‘mate, I think it's slippery.' Ben agreed,” Hijikata said.

Shelton also addressed how the official had stepped across his path as he went up to speak to the chair umpire.

“I don't think that I ever get disrespectful on the court,” he said. “I guess when he saw a guy my size walking quickly towards the umpire, maybe he thought I was ready to throw hands or something,” he joked. “I definitely wasn't.”

“It probably looked more tense than it was, the whole holding back or staying in front of me,” he said.

At the 2024 tournament, Leylah Fernandez of Canada and Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark were locked at 3-3 in the third set on Court 12 when their match was halted for light. They resumed, an hour later, under the roof and lights of No. 1 Court, and Wozniacki won the match. On Thursday night in London, the All England Club's two courts with roofs and lights, Centre Court and No. 1, sat empty, though the lengthy shut down process, which involves covering the courts, had begun much earlier.

The decision to stop Shelton's match came three nights after Taylor Fritz was told to halt his match at 10:20 p.m., rather than immediately heading into a decisive fifth set. He protested, arguing that the pace of the match suggested they could finish before Wimbledon's 11 p.m. curfew, but officials — and his opponent, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard — disagreed.

Shelton will play Márton Fucsovics in the fourth round, a lucky loser who also had his match held overnight. Fucsovics beat Gaël Monfils in five sets, with the fifth played Friday.

To say the least, Ben Shelton wasn't too pleased with the chair umpire.

The American tennis player was just one game away from defeating Rinky Hijikata and moving on to the third round of Wimbledon, before the match was suspended due to darkness.

Shelton was serving for the match when the decision was made to suspend the action until Friday as the 9:30pm curfew for outside courts came into effect.

Shelton was leading 6-2, 7-5, 5-4 when officials put pause on the match. It was taking place on No.2 Court, which does not have a roof or artificial lights.

When the officials announced the decision, Shelton was furious as he marched over to the chair umpire.

Another rules official had to quickly come to Shelton's side and explain the ruling, while gently holding him back.

Shelton seemed to vehemently disagree with the ruling.

And the American star had every right to be given he required all of 65 seconds to wrap up the third set.

Three aces and a service winner from Shelton completed the third set 6-4 as he sealed his spot in the third round.

Shelton's quick victory gave plenty of credence to the stunned reaction from the ESPN broadcasting crew upon the match being postponed on Thursday.

""Oh my goodness.""

""This is unbelievable,"" a stunned booth let out.

Shelton wasted no time in taking to social media to vent his anger following the postponement in a 14-word post on Thursday, as he said: ""They ain't wanna see anything else from me tonight, but I'll see yall tomorrow.""

Fans were equally as shocked and couldn't believe the curfew rule.

One X user commented: ""Yo @Wimbledon that's just embarrassing. You spend 30 mins talking about whether or not to keep playing. You ultimately start the third set.

""And you let them play all the way until 5-4, and right when Ben Shelton is about to serve for the match, that's when you call it. Pathetic.

""Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE they're suspending Ben Shelton / Rinky Hijikata. For a major not to be able to continue beyond 9:30 is absolutely insane. This is beyond comprehension right now,"" another added.

""Ben Shelton has every right to be livid. After all this, you suspend the match right before Shelton is about to serve for it?? Absolute ridiculous decision yet again by tournament officials,"" one more added.

The 22-year-old is looking for his first career Grand Slam victory, and will now have to come back on Friday and try to capture the momentum once again, if he wants to do so.

Last year at Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round, a career best at the All England Club.

He has made it to the semifinals of a Grand Slam twice, once at the 2023 U.S. Open and most recently at the 2025 Australian Open.

American tennis star Ben Shelton needed just 70 seconds to finish off his second round clash at Wimbledon after being left infuriated by on an overnight delay. 

On Thursday evening, at 9:30pm local time, Shelton's match against Rinky Hijikata was suspended due to darkness - despite Wimbledon's 11pm curfew.

A frustrated Shelton, 22, remonstrated with the umpire over the matter, given the fact that he was just one game away from winning and was serving for the match.

Despite his pleas, the match was in fact suspended until Friday morning, where Shelton needed just 70 seconds to seal the win and reach the third round. 

The 22-year-old wrapped up a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 victory on No. 2 Court and, straight after, admitted it was 'difficult' to come to terms with the umpire's decision. 

Speaking to Sports Center, Shelton said: 'It was difficult. At that point, we knew that we were playing in conditions that weren't ideal for tennis. For me, it was like, what's one more game at that point?

'I understand the tournament has got to make whatever decisions they make and the players have to live with that. For me, I lived with it. I came out here and did what I do. I hadn't gotten broken the whole match. 

'I haven't gotten broken since the first set in the first round and I felt confident coming out here with one service game to finish it. Yeah, I really enjoyed the way I served it out.'

Shelton was also asked about his thoughts on his third round match against Marton Fucsovics - who beat French star Gael Monfils to book a match-up with Shelton.

The American said: 'I think that's a tough match. That's another guy who's battle tested. He's a warrior and in great physical shape and he wins a lot of five-set matches. 

'That was a blockbuster, I'm sure that they're happy with that win. He's got to be feeling confident to take out Gael in five sets'. 

Prior to his win over Hijikata, footage of Shelton went viral after fans spotted US Soccer star Trinity Rodman lovingly gazing at tennis star boyfriend.

Last month, Rodman was also in attendance at the French Open, watching her man make a run to the Round of 16, departing the field after a loss to Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros before his all-time classic against Jannik Sinner.

Jack Draper's Wimbledon run came to an abrupt halt following his defeat to Marin Cilic.

The 23-year-old gave British fans plenty of optimism for success at the All-England club due to his seeding of number four.

This meant he avoided facing Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner before the semi-finals, but Draper's path to the last four was a very difficult one.

Facing a dangerous opponent such as Marin Cilic early in a Grand Slam is a huge obstacle for any player, but it is one Draper was unable to overcome.

Jack Draper is trying to become the first British man since Andy Murray to win a Grand Slam title.

But his wait continues after being knocked out of the Wimbledon Championships by Cilic, the 2014 US Open champion.

Speaking of the New York-based Grand Slam, 22-time doubles Grand Slam winner Todd Woodbridge thinks Draper is more likely to lift the title at Flushing Meadows than his home Slam of Wimbledon.

“There is a possibility [that the US Open is more likely]. A lot of that comes with that you don't have to deal with all of this, where we break his game down. He can go to that tournament and be a little bit more relaxed,” Woodbridge told BBC about Draper, who reached the 2024 US Open semi-finals.

“He can wander around Manhattan every day and nobody knows who he is. Here we watch him fill up his tank with petrol and there is so much focus. I think he handles that really well actually and he will continue to handle that well.

“I think at the end of the day there is still work to be done. You get to four in the world and there is still so much you can improve. I think he can go well here. It wasn't a great draw in the end.

“You look at the draw and see that Cilic is experienced, a Grand Slam champion, someone who is on the comeback and has played a lot of matches this year. It's disappointing but he can hold his head high.”

Draper is now carrying the mantle left by Murray, as the next big thing in British tennis.

2025 marked the first time he entered Wimbledon with plenty of hope and expectation on having a deep run or even becoming the champion.

Despite Draper's comfortable first round win, he was ultimately unable to deliver on the buzz and hype around him at SW19, with the fourth seed even admitting that he lost to the better player on the day.

“It makes me think that Andy's achievement of what he did, winning here twice, was just unbelievable,” Draper said.

“I wasn't going out there thinking I was under so much pressure. I just didn't play good enough today. I lost to a better player. I wasn't able to find the level I wanted.”","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

LONDON (AP) — This most unpredictable of Wimbledons delivered yet another surprise Friday when reigning Australian Open champion Madison Keys, the No. 6 seed, was a lopsided loser in the third round, eliminated 6-3, 6-3 by 104th-ranked Laura Siegemund of Germany.

Keys' exit left just one of the top six women in the bracket before the end of Week 1: No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who was scheduled to face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu later in the day.

No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 4 Jasmine Paolini and No. 5 Zheng Qinwen already were out. The men's field also has seen its share of surprises, including a Wimbledon-record 13 seeds gone in the first round.

“At times, it wasn't the best quality, let's say. But I managed, and in the end, it's just important to find solutions and I did that well. Kept my nerves in the end,"" Siegemund said, then added with a laugh: ""There are always nerves. If you don't have nerves in this moment, you're probably dead.”

Wimbledon might be the only Grand Slam event where Keys hasn't reached at least the semifinals, but she has participated in the quarterfinals there twice and is enjoying a breakthrough 2025, including her title at Melbourne Park in January.

Keys' power vs. Siegemund's spins and slices offered quite a contrast in styles, and this outcome was surprisingly one-way traffic on a windy afternoon at No. 2 Court. The key statistic, undoubtedly, was this: Keys made 31 unforced errors, 20 more than Siegemund.



When it ended with one last backhand return from Keys that sailed wide, Siegemund smiled broadly, raised her arms and jumped up and down repeatedly.

“You can't not be happy when you beat a great player like Madison,” Siegemund said.

How unexpected is this for Siegemund? Before this year, her career record at the All England Club was 2-5, and she'd never made it past the second round. Taking into account all four Grand Slam tournaments, she had reached the third round only once in 28 previous appearances, getting to the quarterfinals at the 2020 French Open.

“There is technically no pressure for me,” said Siegemund, at 37 the oldest woman remaining in the tournament. “I try to remember that I only play for myself. I don't feel like I need to prove anything anymore. My boyfriend often tells me that.”

On Sunday, the German faces another unexpected participant at this stage of the grass-court major: 101st-ranked Solana Sierra of Argentina, who lost in qualifying and made it into the main draw when another player withdrew.

Ben Shelton played for all of four points and about a minute, wrapping up his second-round match against Rinky Hijikata that was suspended Thursday night. Four-time major title winner Naomi Osaka's Wimbledon ended in the third round for the third time, eliminated by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. And No. 13 Amanda Anisimova of the U.S. advanced to the fourth round.

Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek will take on Danielle Collins at Centre Court — who could forget their testy exchange at the Paris Olympics? — while No. 1 Jannik Sinner and 24-time major champ Novak Djokovic also are involved in matches at the main stadium. Two American women will be in action at No. 1 Court: Hailey Baptiste faces No. 7 Mirra Andreeva of Russia, and No. 10 Emma Navarro plays defending champion Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic.

Naomi Osaka might be more comfortable on grass courts these days but she will once again leave Wimbledon in the third round after a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 loss to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Friday.

Osaka said afterward that she was upset by the result because she “actually thought I could play well, like, in general” and “make a deep run here.”

“I wanted to do better than I did before,” she said. “Also, I felt like I was trying so hard.”

Asked what positives she can take away from the grass-court portion of the season, Osaka replied: “I'm just going to be a negative human being today. I'm so sorry. I have nothing positive to say about myself, which is something I'm working on.”

She is a former No. 1 now ranked 50th and a four-time Grand Slam champion, all on hard courts — she won the U.S. Open and Australian Open twice apiece.

Osaka arrived at the All England Club this year having lost three of her last four matches at the place and with a career record of 5-4 there. Her best showing was getting to the third round in 2017 and 2018; she missed the tournament in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

After a victory earlier this week, she spoke about how she played with fear on grass for years because of a knee injury she got by slipping on the surface nearly a decade ago, but was feeling better about it lately.

“With age, fear kind of crept along and, I guess, paralyzed me, in a way,” she said. “Now I'm kind of just getting over that and trying to spread my wings on grass. I think it is working, and I think I am moving pretty well.”

But from 4-all in the third set Friday, Pavlyuchenkova grabbed eight of the match's last 10 points, holding at love, then breaking in the final game with the help of a trio of forehand unforced errors by Osaka.

“A majority of you were cheering for Naomi, but that's OK,” Pavlyuchenkova, who turned 34 on Thursday, told the crowd at Court No. 2. “I'm mentally tough, so that didn't bother me at all. The opposite: It gave me energy.”

Pavlyuchenkova, who is ranked 53rd, was the 2021 runner-up at the French Open, and Friday's victory moved her into the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time since she was a quarterfinalist nine years ago.

Osaka, meanwhile, already was looking ahead to the next part of the season — on the North American hard courts leading into the U.S. Open, which begins on Aug. 24.

“I'm glad to be done with this,” she said, “and I'm looking forward to the hard courts.”

Sonay Kartal is into the fourth round of Wimbledon; Follow scores, reports and our dedicated live blog from the All England Club over the next fortnight; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Friday 4 July 2025 16:56, UK

One of Sonay Kartal's 14 tattoos reads ""the show must go on"", and it could not be more fitting for her current Wimbledon run.

The British No 3 is into uncharted territory, reaching the fourth round for the first time at a Grand Slam after beating Diane Parry 6-4 6-2 in the Wimbledon third round on Friday.

The 23-year-old, who lives in Brighton and was born in Sidcup, overcame a nervy start to advance on No 1 Court, 12 months on from losing to Coco Gauff on the same stage.

""I was pretty nervous walking out there,"" Kartal said. ""It's a big court with a match that has a lot of meaning to me. Obviously last year, that was also in the back of my mind, losing to Coco on the same court in the same round.""

And with the number of Brits dwindling in the singles, the spotlight is firmly on Kartal. ""I think it's an honour,"" she added.

""Obviously you've got a lot of attention on you, it means you're doing good things. I'm pretty calm and collected. I don't think it's going to affect me too much. I'm still pretty young. It's my first fourth round.""

Now a place in the quarter-finals is within her grasp, and the world No 51 could grace Centre Court for the first time in her round-of-16 match on Sunday.

Kartal admits her ""the show must go on"" tattoo, one of 14 she has inked, does not particularly relate to any moment in her career.

""I'd like to say it did, but honestly, on that one I just liked the design. My tattoos all started with meaning. Then I guess the more I got, the kind of more spontaneous and braver I got,"" she said.

She boasts a paw print on her left arm in tribute to her late golden retriever - ""My bed hogger and my best pal,"" she said in 2023 - and also has a symbol for bravery on her wrist.

""I lost a lot of matches from playing too safe,"" she said last year. ""I kind of had enough of losing and was like, I need to change something. If I have it on my wrist, I can see it. It's a little reminder at change of ends.""

So is it time for tattoo No 15? On Monday, after her terrific opening-round win over Jelena Ostapenko, Kartal said she would get a new one if she reached the second week of Wimbledon.

That moment has arrived. The round of 16 is technically the second week, even if she is playing on Middle Sunday, and she welcomed suggestions on-court when asked after her win over Parry.

""I've got a few that are in the line-up,"" she also said on Monday, but dismissed the idea of a strawberry. ""I wouldn't get something that obvious. I would get something that people are connected to Wimbledon and understand Wimbledon, they would understand.""

Okay, back to tennis…

Twelve months ago, Kartal broke her Wimbledon duck, winning her first match here at her third Championships when ranked 298th in the world.

She advanced to the third round, and though she came unstuck against Gauff 6-4 6-4, the run propelled Kartal into the top 200.

Then it got even better. Kartal clinched her maiden WTA title in September, winning the Jasmine Open when beating Rebecca Sramkova in straight sets in Tunisia.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



The victory saw Kartal become the 21st British woman to break into the WTA top 100 since 1975, and the ninth in the last 10 years.

Going into 2025, the highlight of her season before Wimbledon was a run to the Indian Wells round of 16, and that combined with a first-ever win at the French Open saw her rise into the top 50.

She has only narrowly dropped out since, currently 51st, but her Wimbledon run means she will reach a career-high ranking once the tournament is over, and is projected to be inside the top 45 as things stand.

Away from the court, Kartal admits to being a lover of animals and a big fan of '90s music, although not necessarily of Oasis.

""I like a few of their songs. I wouldn't say I'm a hardcore Oasis fan,"" she said. ""I like a lot of '90s music, old school, 2000s. I'm pretty versatile, to be honest with you.

""I have never really had one artist that I really like. I've never had an artist release an album that I love every single song. I kind of flicker between different songs. I have a bad habit of playing one song, like, 50 times and then absolutely hating it for the rest of the year. I'd say maybe '90s music is probably my favourite.""

And her go-to karaoke song? Dolly Parton's ""Islands in the Stream"".

So can Kartal keep the run going? On Sunday she faces Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, a meeting that may well see the Briton grace Centre Court for the very first time.

With a quarter-final place on the line, Kartal will be wary of the experienced Pavlyuchenkova, the 34-year-old who reached the French Open final in 2021 and made the quarter-finals at SW19 in 2016.

Pavlyuchenkova beat Naomi Osaka in the third round on Friday, battling back from a set down to beat the four-time Grand Slam champion 3-6 6-4 6-4.

Pavlyuchenkova is ranked one place above Kartal in 50th, and has 12 career singles titles, also winning Olympic gold in the mixed doubles at Tokyo 2020.

Nick Kyrgios is facing backlash over a comment made about reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.

The Spaniard is through to the third round of Wimbledon and competes on Friday against Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.

Weeks after the tournament concludes, Alcaraz will compete in the US Open mixed doubles tournament alongside Emma Raducanu.

Nine of the top 10 men's players, including Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic, have all entered.

Advert

And nine of the top 10 women's players, including Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Jasmine Paolini, are also involved.

Despite his inactivity in recent years due to various injuries, Kyrgios has also entered in the competition and will partner with four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka.

Despite missing out on Wimbledon - and a spot on the BBC's punditry team for the tournament - Kyrgios has been seen in SW19.

Advert

On Wednesday, he was spotted watching Osaka during her second round win over Katerina Siniakova on Wednesday - something the Japanese women's star joked was a 'little bit embarrassing' upon finding out, as she hadn't seen him.

Elsewhere, Kyrgios has been known for his controversial comments in the past, and he has made another one when comparing men's world number one Sinner and second-ranked Alcaraz.

In an interview with tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou, the Australian was asked which of the duo he believes will have a stronger overall career.

And his answer surprised fans.

Advert

""I choose Sinner, because Alcaraz loves girls,"" he replied. ""He could get distracted, he might party too much. 

""That's my only thing. Sinner will stay more locked in I think.""

Mouratgolou added: ""If you look at this season, Alcaraz is losing so many more matches than Sinner. And you're thinking, he should not. Why? Because he's not always there."" 

The comment, however, did not go down well among fans.

Advert

One asked: ""Wtf are these people talking about?""

A second wrote: ""Such an unprofessional take but right on brand for Kyrgios.""

such a weirdass & unprofessional take but right on brand for Kyrgios.

A third asked: ""Where is this 'Alcaraz loves girls' even coming from?""

Advert

And a fourth wrote: ""Someone is desperate for attention.""

Alcaraz's upcoming mixed doubles partnership with Raducanu has led to rumours of a relationship between the pair - which have been repeatedly shut down by both players, who have been friends for several years.

The Wimbledon ballot may have closed for another year, but it's not too late to buy advance tickets if you know where to look.

If you don't mind splashing out on the experience, Seat Unique has the option to book ‘VIP Debenture Behind The Server' and ‘VIP Debenture Front 5 Rows' tickets.

These tickets offer 'unparalleled views' of the court, so you won't miss out on any of the action.

Australian Open champion Madison Keys has been eliminated from Wimbledon, with the American sixth seed suffering a surprising 6-3, 6-3 loss to Germany's world number 104, Laura Siegemund, in the third round on Friday.

The 30-year-old Keys is now the fifth player among the top six women's seeds to exit the tournament unexpectedly. 

Earlier upsets included Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, and Zheng Qinwen, though world number one Aryna Sabalenka remains in contention.

Keys, who defeated Sabalenka for her first Grand Slam title in Melbourne earlier this year, has consistently struggled at Wimbledon, never advancing past the quarter-finals in 11 attempts. Her performance against Siegemund was marred by 31 unforced errors.

For Siegemund, 37, this marks her first-ever trip to the Wimbledon last 16. She is currently the oldest player remaining in the women's draw, with her previous best Grand Slam singles result being a quarterfinal appearance at the 2020 French Open. 

“When you beat a great player like Madison, you have to be happy,” Siegemund said, adding, “I managed to keep my nerve in the end. If you don't have nerves in this moment, you are probably dead.”

Australian Open winner Madison Keys is upset by Laura Siegemund in straight sets in the third round of Wimbledon. (0:38)

Madison Keys became the latest top-seeded player to suffer an early loss at Wimbledon, while Naomi Osaka once again exited in the third round.

Keys, the No. 6 seed, was taken out in straight sets with a 6-3, 6-3 loss to Laura Siegemund on Friday, and Osaka fell in a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 loss to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Keys' exit leaves just one of the top six women in the bracket before the end of Week 1: No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who was set to face 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu later in the day. The men's field also has seen its share of surprises, including a Wimbledon-record 13 seeds gone in the first round.

Keys racked up unforced errors, 31 in total, and wayward serves on a sun-drenched Court 2. After an early trade of breaks, Siegemund went 4-2 up on Keys' serve with a drop shot before seeing out the first set.

Siegemund picked up a pair of breaks in the second set. Keys saved three match points but could not stop Siegemund from serving out the win.

Ranked 104th in the world, Siegemund, 37, becomes the oldest woman in the Open era (since 1968) at the time of her first round-of-16 appearance at Wimbledon.

""I only play for myself. I don't feel like I need to prove anything anymore,"" Siegemund said on court. ""It's important to remember the core of why you are doing this. ... I'm playing for me, and I don't feel pressure this way.""

Her next opponent is Solana Sierra, who became the first lucky loser to reach the fourth round in the women's singles at Wimbledon in the Open era by beating Spain's Cristina Bucsa 7-5, 1-6, 6-1. Sierra is the seventh women's lucky loser to reach the fourth round at any major in the Open era, a list that includes Eva Lys at this year's Australian Open.

Osaka said she was upset by her result because she ""actually thought I could play well, like, in general"" and ""make a deep run here.""

""I wanted to do better than I did before,"" she said. ""Also, I felt like I was trying so hard.""

Osaka arrived at the All England Club this year having lost three of her past four matches at the place and with a career record of 5-4. Her best showing was getting to the third round in 2017 and 2018; she missed the tournament in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

From 4-all in the third set, Pavlyuchenkova grabbed eight of the match's last 10 points, holding at love then breaking in the final game with the help of a trio of unforced forehand errors by Osaka.

Osaka dropped to 0-6 in three-set matches at Wimbledon or the French Open.

""A majority of you were cheering for Naomi, but that's OK,"" Pavlyuchenkova, 34, told the crowd at Court No. 2. ""I'm mentally tough, so that didn't bother me at all. The opposite: It gave me energy.""

Pavlyuchenkova will next face Britain's Sonay Kartal, who fought back from 4-1 down in the first set to beat qualifier Diane Parry 6-4, 6-2 and reach the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time.

Osaka, 27, is a former No. 1 now ranked 50th and a four-time Grand Slam champion, all on hard courts, winning the US Open and Australian Open twice apiece. She said she was already looking forward to the hard-court season.

Asked what positives she can take away from the grass-court portion of the season, Osaka replied: ""I'm just going to be a negative human being today. I'm so sorry. I have nothing positive to say about myself, which is something I'm working on.""

Pavlyuchenkova, who is ranked 53rd, was the 2021 runner-up at the French Open, and Friday's victory moved her into the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time since she was a quarterfinalist nine years ago.

Former Wimbledon quarterfinalist and American 13th seed Amanda Anisimova beat Dalma Galfi 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 to reach the fourth round.

There was a small but notable ripple of interest when Marin Cilic won the Nottingham Challenger title on grass in mid June.

Here was a player with incredible grasscourt credentials, and a former world No.3, finding form at just the right time ahead of Wimbledon, where he was a finalist in 2017.

There were caveats: the title was a step below tour level and Cilic, now 36, had been ranked outside the top 100 after lengthy injury battles.

Still, it was not to be overlooked, and when the Croatian beat Raphael Collignon in Wimbledon's first round, suddenly he was on a six-match winning streak and lining up against hometown hero Jack Draper.

Draper entered the championships as the world No.4 and with a spotlight on him more intense than he had experienced before.

It was an unfamiliar position for the Brit and it didn't help he was facing an opponent much more experienced on this stage, contesting his 46th main-draw Wimbledon match compared to Draper's seventh.

Cilic blasted 53 winners past him – Draper managed only 29 – to win 6-4 6-3 1-6 6-4 on No.1 Court.

“I don't play many people on the tour that I feel like they completely bully me and take the racquet out of my hand,” said a shellshocked Draper. “I know it's a grass court. I'm not sure what his stats were, but I'm sure he had an amazing match from the winners to unforced errors count.”



Indeed, Cilic committed only 34 unforced errors alongside his hefty winner tally, describing his level of play as “fantastic”.

Barely inside the top 200 at the beginning of the season, he is now 74th in the ATP live rankings.

“I didn't have many Grand Slam victories in last couple of years, so was great to play great level from my side,” said Cilic, also a finalist at Australian Open 2018.

“I think I executed extremely well. So just enjoying this part that I'm playing well now last few weeks. Looking forward to continue to play well.”

Ahead of the match the ITF reported that “if he is to stop Draper, Cilic must win a grasscourt match against a top-five player for the first time. The 2014 US Open champion has lost all nine of his previous grasscourt matches against top-five players, six of which have come at Wimbledon”.

This seemed a statistical absurdity, given Cilic's prowess on grass and the fact he'd been a top-five player himself.

EXPERT PICKS: Who will be the Wimbledon champions in 2025?

He reached three consecutive Wimbledon quarterfinals from 2014 to 2016, then the final in 2017, where he lost to Roger Federer. From 2012 to 2018 he also appeared in four Queen's finals, winning two.

He possesses one of the best grasscourt records among active players; prior to facing Draper he was 87-33 lifetime on the surface – a winning rate of 72.5 per cent – and had seven grasscourt finals to his name.

Yet Cilic was a long way removed from his peak years, making this triumph over Draper all the more stunning.

Less than a year ago he was ranked outside the top 1000, limited to just two singles matches in 2023 after sustaining a knee injury that January in Pune. He managed four singles matches in early 2024, before another six-month stint on the sidelines.

In September 2024 he entered the ATP tournament in Hangzhou, China as a 777th-ranked wildcard and won the title – setting him back on course toward the upper reaches of the game.

Part of that comeback journey saw him drop back to Challenger level in 2025, where he won the Girona title and reached the Madrid final – both on clay – before his most recent success in Nottingham.

“[This is special] considering everything that happened in last two, three years. If even I look at situation where I was, how my knee was like this in February '23, lots of rehab, lots of unknowns. Even coming back, the knee wasn't good. What to do then? New surgery, all these details,” he explained.

“All the time there was this spark of desire and feeling that my level is still there. Let me give myself another opportunity.

“Thank God obviously now last eight, nine months I'm playing pain-free and progressing nicely, which is great.”

With his three children watching on No.1 Court, Cilic won through to the third round at SW19 for just the second time since that 2017 final, and first time in four years.

There he will face unseeded Spaniard Jaume Munar, who eliminated Halle champion Alexander Bublik in round one before his latest triumph over Fabian Marozsan.

“[As] the season started, I was extremely pleased with the level of my game,” said Cilic, who had won 19 of his 29 matches in 2025 prior to Wimbledon.

“Of course, experience helps in those kind of situations where you see some things in the matches. Okay, let me put that into the puzzle, let me add this. So that was a great part to it.

“It's not overwhelming for me at the moment. Obviously it's a huge result [beating Draper], but I'm feeling quite confident in the game, that the level is there.

“If I can do some things better, I feel I can. So obviously it's a challenge for me to keep progressing.”

Sabalenka has had trouble dealing with high-pressure situations before. How will she handle a ""road match"" against a red-hot Raducanu?ByZachary CohenPublished Jul 04, 2025 copy_link

When we first got a glimpse at the Wimbledon draw, it looked like Aryna Sabalenka was going to be in some trouble early. Many thought the Belarusian was heading towards a third-round meeting with Marketa Vondrousova, who beat her in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4, in the semifinals in Berlin a few weeks ago. Considering Vondrousova's grass-court prowess, that could have been a tough matchup for the world No. 1.But you know what? Playing an in-form Emma Raducanu, with the crowd in her corner, might not be much easier. That's why I'm backing the Brit to win a set, but I'm also going to sprinkle the moneyline.These two met for the first time in last year's BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, where Sabalenka earned a 6-3, 7-5 win in a hard-fought match. However, Raducanu is peaking coming into this one; she has won 15 of her last 22 matches. The Brit also happens to be playing on her favorite surface, and she should have sky-high confidence after having earned a 6-3, 6-3 win over Vondrousova last round. That was arguably the best match Raducanu has played since winning the US Open.

When Raducanu is hitting the ball cleanly, she can make anybody uncomfortable. Sabalenka isn't an exception. Sure, the Belarusian can put a little more on her groundstrokes, but Raducanu has plenty of punch herself. She's also a little better at defending the court. Against Vondrousova, her ability to steal points was out of this world.I also have some serious concerns over how Sabalenka is going to manage a pro-Raducanu crowd. I do think it's hard for British players to play well at Wimbledon (just ask Jack Draper), but with nobody expecting a Raducanu win, she should be able to go out there and play freely. And in this specific situation, the crowd should give her a lift. That said, if Raducanu doesn't fall apart as a server, or spray unforced errors, I think she'll be in this match.Pick: Raducanu +1.5 Sets (+106)

Gasly frustrated after 'a very difficult Friday' at Silverstone

2025 British GP FP2: Sainz almost collides with Hamilton

British youngster Arvid Lindblad will take to the track in Red Bull's RB21 for Free Practice 1 at Silverstone.

Arvid Lindblad will join a very exclusive club on Friday when he takes to the track in the RB21 for Free Practice 1 with Red Bull. He will become just the second driver under 18 years old to participate in a Grand Prix weekend.

The only other driver who can say that? Max Verstappen.

Lindblad will be across the garage from the four-time World Champion for his F1 weekend bow, a prospect he is very much looking forward to after a journey with Red Bull that started five years ago.

“It's a very special moment, having it here at home in Silverstone and doing it in the Red Bull as well,” Lindblad says. “I joined the programme at the end of 2020, and this is my fifth year with Red Bull.

“I've really grown, risen through the ranks and become the driver I am because of Red Bull. They've helped develop me into who I am today, and to have the opportunity to share that opportunity with them is something I'm really looking forward to. Hopefully, it's the start of a new chapter.”

That new chapter is just the latest in a story going back to his years in karting. The Briton joined the Junior Team in full capacity at just 14 years of age, and has enjoyed a rapid ascent through the junior categories ever since.

Lindblad has been earmarked by Red Bull for some time, and his ascent up the ranks and FP1 appearance is a vote of confidence in his talent from a team renowned for putting young drivers into Formula 1.

“I'm developing massively there,"" the Briton adds. ""I'm very fortunate to work with Dr [Helmut] Marko, who's known for his ability in spotting talent with the likes of World Champions in Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen.

“Also, ‘Rocky' [Guillaume Rocquelin] as well, who was Sebastian's race engineer, he's been really involved in the programme over the last couple of years. Being a World Champion engineer himself, he knows what it takes to be the best, and working with him, having him push me to become better all the time, has been a massive aid to my development.

“So, I'm extremely grateful to Red Bull. I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for them, and to have this moment is going to be very special.”

Whether the moment will truly sink in on the day or not, Lindblad can't say. But the occasion has certainly been surreal, as he gears up to compete with the F1 team and share the track with drivers he's grown up idolising.

“We'll see when it all happens, but Lewis [Hamilton] was somewhat of an idol growing up, so to share the track with him tomorrow will be something very special.

“Then obviously all the engineers that you see on the pit wall and Christian [Horner] and everyone that you see on the TV, and you're going to be talking and working with them, it's really cool.

“But I will try to just stay in the moment and take it in my stride and just stay focused on the job at hand.”

While the 17-year-old will be in the cockpit for the first time for Red Bull, he is no stranger to how the team goes about their work, having sat in on multiple debriefs in the past.

Going from a passive role to being the driver providing the feedback and actively involved in the Grand Prix weekend is another step in the learning curve, and a challenge he feels more than prepared for.

“Red Bull have helped my development,"" he continues. ""I have sat in quite a few debriefs. I've been working with the engineers, and they've helped mould me in a way you could say, so I know exactly what sort of feedback they want, what is good feedback to them.

“I try to carry that into F2 as well, and in everything I do. But having worked with them, seen it as a sort of fly on the wall, it's taught me what's required.

“I think now I'm subconsciously doing what they want. I know what's required of me on the feedback side, and I'm looking forward to driving the car and then being the one sitting in the debrief talking and not just listening in the background.”

Ahead of his Silverstone F1 bow, clips have circulated on social media of Lindblad approaching Lando Norris for an autograph, and claiming he'll be seeing the British driver in five years' time.

Four years on from that, he's now set to share the Silverstone circuit with the McLaren driver. While he's targeting a more permanent seat in the future, the Red Bull junior says being ahead of schedule is hardly a bad thing.

With future opportunities potentially on the table, he's under no illusions that his performance this weekend could go some way in aiding his chances of a future F1 drive in 2026 and beyond.

“I'm a bit ahead of that timeline, but I'm not a Formula 1 driver yet!” he laughs. “When I started this journey when I was five, I was the same. When I was 14, that day, it was like an innocent thing, but I'm very determined to stick to the timeline. I've risen through the ranks very quickly, and I'm on that path at the moment.

“We'll just see what happens. Things also depend on the run plan, so it's hard to judge the performance from the timesheets. But it was impressive what Alex Dunne did last week [taking P4 in his maiden FP1 for McLaren in Austria], and I'm looking forward to driving the car. I want to perform well, to do a good job in everything and be fast.

“From my point of view, when I started this journey, I wanted to become Formula 1 World Champion, and I'm just very proud and excited to make the next step towards that.

“I'm not a Formula 1 driver yet, but it's a step in that direction. Going from watching on the sofa when I was four or five years old wanting to be there one day, to being in one of those sessions, it's a very special moment.”

Gasly frustrated after 'a very difficult Friday' at Silverstone

2025 British GP FP2: Sainz almost collides with Hamilton

Take a look at all of the odds for this weekend's British Grand Prix, from polesitters to race winners and everything in between.

Formula 1 moves on from Spielberg to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, with title challenger Lando Norris one of several home drivers targeting success. But what do the odds tell us about the weekend ahead? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

The McLaren drivers are back on top of the podium in this category. Norris redeemed himself after his mishap in Montreal to take the chequered flag at the Red Bull Ring and close the gap on his team mate in the championship.

Norris is yet to stand on top of the podium at his home Grand Prix, but he has come close in the last two editions, with a runner-up and top-three return.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri finished fourth on his last visit to Silverstone, but has matured significantly over the past 12 months, registering nine podiums this campaign, including five victories.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen suffered his first DNF of the season in Austria, after being taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the opening lap, and is back at a venue where he has only taken the spoils on two occasions.

Mercedes' drivers are always worth considering at Silverstone, considering their impressive record of nine victories in the last 13 races in England. However, their top dog George Russell has faced some struggles at this venue, producing a best return of fifth, despite growing up only two hours from the track.

The top three drivers in the standings are heavily favoured to snatch a podium this weekend. These individuals have accumulated 23 podiums between them this campaign, but Verstappen lines up after registering his maiden DNF of 2025.

Charles Leclerc is spraying champagne regularly at the moment, entering the top three in three of his previous four starts. The Monegasque's recent consistency results in an average finish of 3.8, highlighting his threat to the rostrum.

Lewis Hamilton returns home with an astounding record of 12 consecutive podiums at this track. The seven-time World Champion is the defending champion in the United Kingdom, and despite his wobbly form this year, remains a contender.

Hamilton is still hunting his maiden Sunday podium with Ferrari, and he has a great chance to do it here.

The papaya duo boast the most top sixes in the championship, with 10 apiece. Piastri has been inside that threshold in every start since Shanghai, while a DNF in Montreal is Norris' only blemish.

Rookie Antonelli is a six-time top-six finisher this term, including a maiden F1 top three in Canada. However, he's proven erratic in recent rounds, failing to finish three of his last five starts on Sunday and ending 18th in Monaco.

Alex Albon blasted into 2025 with three top-six outings in his first seven starts, before his campaign was doused and brought back to reality. The Thai-British driver has earned a DNF next to his name in the previous three races, but he was only culpable in Spain, when he collided with Liam Lawson.

Albon's vehicle let him down in Montreal and Austria, and brought about a bigger discussion about what's going on at Williams. His team mate Carlos Sainz couldn't even start the showdown at Spielberg after his brakes overheated and burst into flames after the formation lap.

Besides the aforementioned event winner, podium, and top six favourites, we turn our focus to two veterans to lead the charge for a top 10.

Fernando Alonso is starting to develop consistency in his Aston Martin, with three consecutive top 10s, including back-to-back seventh places in Canada and Austria. The other seasoned campaigner is Nico Hulkenberg, who is also on a run of three races inside the top 10.

Haas' senior driver, Esteban Ocon, continues to compete for a spot in the first 10. The Frenchman has registered the feat five times in 2025, three in his previous four races.

Racing Bulls pilot Lawson appears to have set aside the drama from earlier in the season, claiming top 10s in 50% of his last four races. The New Zealander starts after a career-best sixth place at the Red Bull Ring.

Credit must also go to another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto, who fought hard for his maiden F1 top 10 in the last round.

The MCL39 continues to outclass its rivals over one lap this season. Norris recorded the team's seventh pole position in the previous round, taking his tally to three.

Norris has started at the front of the grid in two of his past four races, while his Aussie team mate has qualified fastest in four rounds this year.
Meanwhile, Verstappen is a three-time fastest qualifier after 11 rounds, but enters after lining up in seventh in the Styrian Alps.

The Dutchman's fierce rival, Russell, is the only other driver to start on pole this season, proving consistent by qualifying among the fastest three in five rounds. The Briton's starting grid average sits at 4.45 this year, slightly below Verstappen's at 3.18.

Leclerc started in second in Austria, the third such grid position for the Monegasque this season. The previous round also marked the best Qualifying for Ferrari this year, with both drivers ending inside the top five for the first time.

German drivers and cars have won nine of the last 13 British Grands Prix.

Hamilton was the latest victor for Mercedes, but will now defend his title in a red Italian car. Verstappen, Sainz, and Sebastian Vettel are the only non-Mercedes drivers to prevail in England since 2013. That leaves Red Bull and Ferrari with two triumphs apiece in the last 12 years.

McLaren last won the Silverstone showcase in 2008, when a young Hamilton was on their payroll. The Woking-based outfit may have struggled on home soil for 16 years, but they are the team to beat this time around. After 11 rounds, the papayas have won 72.73% of the Teams' trophies on offer, including three in their last four outings.

Gasly frustrated after 'a very difficult Friday' at Silverstone

2025 British GP FP2: Sainz almost collides with Hamilton

Despite another tough outing in Austria, Yuki Tsunoda has insisted that he feels plenty of support from the Red Bull team.

Yuki Tsunoda has insisted that he feels support from Red Bull boss Christian Horner and team advisor Helmut Marko “more than ever”, despite his tough run for the squad continuing last time out in Austria.

A tough Saturday at Spielberg saw Tsunoda exit Qualifying in Q1, resulting in the Japanese driver lining up in P18 on the grid. The troubles continued on Sunday, with Tsunoda picking up a 10-second time penalty following a collision with Alpine's Franco Colapinto before ending the race down in 16th and last place.

Pushed on whether he understood the issues that affected him at the Red Bull Ring ahead of the weekend's upcoming British Grand Prix, Tsunoda took the blame for his tough outing as he explained: “The issue in the race was me.

“Trying to overtake [Colapinto], I could have just waited one more lap probably. It was a bit unnecessary to push flat out that much in that situation. The race craft wasn't ideal from myself. The pace itself after that, [having] changed the front wing and everything, it's not really probably the best reference I'll get.

“But it's still the session I'm working on really hard so far, especially the long run is the stint I'm normally struggling at. We worked so hard the last couple of days coming into here, what we can do better or not, and we've got to try a couple of [things].

“I'm looking forward to it, I'm feeling strong, and I think in the short run hopefully it will come soon in terms of the confidence that level I want.”

When quizzed on whether he still feels full support from the Red Bull team, Tsunoda responded: “Definitely, yeah. I feel support more than ever, from Christian and Helmut. I went to the south of the UK with a physio in Red Bull Racing to kind of reset myself, and that was coming from them.

“They just wanted [me] to have the fresh air and everything, so that helps a lot for me to build up in a way with my rhythm, and also we're going to try a couple of things.”

Tsunoda acknowledged that having Marko's support – amid the advisor recently suggesting that another driver change is not immediately on the cards at Red Bull – is helpful going forward.

“Yes, rather than him saying I'm going to switch in two races or whatever!” the 25-year-old joked. “Yeah, for sure. Him and Christian are very supportive. He was obviously not happy with my race in Austria, but at the same time he's still willing to continuously help and support me.

“He still trusts my talent and the speed, I just have to prove at the track that I can do it. Helmut is just a direct guy, some races if [I] do bad he'll tell me what was wrong or what was right.

“It's the kind of pressure that he gives me, to really be at the level that I never think about or extract from me some performance. It's just the way that he works from when I was a junior, and I appreciate from how much support I'm getting.”

Tsunoda is not the first driver to struggle to match Max Verstappen's performance in the Red Bull and, when asked if he believes that it can take almost a full season or longer for anyone other than Verstappen to adapt to the car, the Japanese racer said: “I don't know, it depends on the driver.

“I didn't see yet a driver that got used to it in that car straight away, so that's probably a fact but at the same time I feel I'm in the right direction, at least in the short run. I missed out in Q1 in Austria, but at the same time the gap was pretty small.

“Also in terms of the whole package, I know there is something to come as well into this year compared to Max. Once I get the full package, I still have good confidence that I can be in the level that they want, and also that's what I'm working hard on.

“In terms of long run, it's exactly the place that I'm still probably struggling at, but I'll find a way. I saw a couple of driving styles I can try, that I never tried in my career in Formula 1, so it's just learning stuff.”

Lando Norris finished fastest in Free Practice 2 for the British Grand Prix.

Lando Norris finished fastest in Free Practice 2 for the British Grand Prix, the McLaren driver besting the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

The Briton, who won last time out in Austria, posted a 1m 25.816s that left him 0.222s clear of Leclerc, and three-tenths faster than Hamilton, who had topped FP1 earlier in the day.

With wind speed high and impacting aerodynamic performance through the high speed turns at Silverstone, teams battled to find the optimum set-up in the changeable conditions.

Hamilton immediately continued his impressive Friday form, moving to the top of the times with his first flying lap on Pirelli's medium tyre with a 1m 27.280s, as traffic became an issue for Norris and Liam Lawson.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri, who earlier had a radio message about the ""gusty"" conditions, moved to the top of the leaderboard after the opening 10 minutes, only to be immediately usurped by Hamilton and Isack Hadjar.

While Ollie Bearman complained of oversteer in his Haas, reigning World Champion Max Verstappen was also left frustrated, proclaiming over the radio: ""Have you seen my front tyres in the high speed? They just don't respond.""

Carlos Sainz soon suffered a harmless spin coming out of Luffield, with Williams Team Principal James Vowles stating ""the gusts are definitely catching us out"" during the session.

The second Ferrari of Leclerc took over from his team mate at the top of the times briefly but Hamilton, who has a record nine F1 wins at Silverstone, stamped his authority to go 0.295s clear on a 1m 26.592s after 20 minutes.

George Russell became the first driver to use a set of Pirelli's soft tyre, the red-walled compound launching him up to first before Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli went 0.140s faster.

It left the benchmark at a 1m 26.383s, half a second faster than Hamilton's best from FP1, approaching the halfway point of the one-hour session.

Times began to tumble as drivers performed Qualifying simulations, with Leclerc and then Norris going fastest, the former complaining of something wrong with the front-left tyre, stating there was ""so much lap time in it"".

Hamilton abandoned his first flying lap on the softs, before moving up to P2 with his second effort, while Verstappen could only manage eighth, eight tenths in arrears on Norris' 1m 25.816s, improving to fifth on his next run.

The McLaren driver's time stood as the benchmark for the remainder of the session, making him the only driver to dip below the 1m 26s barrier as focus switched to long runs for teams.

As Leclerc and Hamilton completed the top three, Piastri sat in fourth, almost half a second behind his team mate but ahead of Verstappen and Antonelli.

The Aston Martin of Lance Stroll, Mercedes of Russell and the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Lawson completed the top 10.

Alex Albon (P11) was the highest-placed of the Williams drivers, from Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Gabriel Bortoleto, the Brazilian back in his Kick Sauber after the seat was taken by Paul Aron in FP1.

Esteban Ocon finished 14th, ahead of Yuki Tsunoda, who had also missed FP1 with Arvid Lindblad taking his seat, with Sainz 16th and under investigation following his rejoin after his earlier spin.

Nico Hulkenberg, who had to avoid Sainz's recovery, finished P17, as the Alpine's of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto finished either side of Bearman in P19.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen remained tight-lipped about his Formula 1 future ahead of the British Grand Prix this weekend.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen remained tight-lipped about his Formula 1 future ahead of the British Grand Prix this weekend, as he faced further questions about the possibility of joining Mercedes for 2026.

The four-time World Champion has been linked with a move to the Silver Arrows after George Russell said in Austria that Mercedes were having “conversations” with the Dutchman amid his own contract discussions – the Briton's current deal expires at the end of this season.

However, when quizzed himself on the reports at Silverstone, Russell remained confident he will race with Mercedes next season, though no confirmation was given in Thursday's press conference that a deal had been signed.

The ongoing saga means further speculation has built around a move for Verstappen, something the Dutchman refused to comment further on during media day ahead of the British Grand Prix.

""I have nothing to add,"" he said. ""What I said last week. Other people write stuff, that's great but it's not for me.""

He added: ""You can always say the grass is always greener on the other side, that's what they say right? I think you always have to just stay calm, enjoy also what you're doing because I think up until now I've had a lot of success and of course this season is maybe not what we wanted as a team but that can happen as well.

""Sometimes you just have to try and accept that as well. Other people make up more stories but that's not for me. I know what I have, I know what I can do and that's fine.""

Verstappen has remained part of the Red Bull family since making his F1 debut in 2015 with junior team Toro Rosso, before graduating to the senior outfit the following season.

After winning on his Red Bull debut in the Spanish Grand Prix, Verstappen has clinched four Drivers' titles on the bounce between 2021-2024.

Despite taking two wins this campaign, a retirement after being hit by Kimi Antonelli in Austria last time out means he trails championship leader Oscar Piastri by 61 points approaching the halfway point of the season.

While a new set of regulations for 2026 means a change in the pecking order is possible, Verstappen warned that there was no guarantee a move would place him in the quickest car on the grid.

""It's difficult in F1 to always be in the fastest car because then you have to look into the future,"" said Verstappen. ""Who would have known that two years ago this would be the case.

""That is also something I don't spend a lot of focus [on]. I think the only focus that I have at the moment is just trying to improve the situation.

""At the same time we are not where we want to be I think that's quite clear but at the same time, next year a lot can change again. So even if you try to chase the fastest car, it might not be the fastest car next year and that's exactly what F1 is about.""

Lewis Hamilton has kicked off his home event by leading the way in Free Practice 1 at the British Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton has topped the timesheets during Friday's first practice session at the British Grand Prix, the seven-time World Champion leading the way from fellow Briton Lando Norris at his home event.

There were two new names joining the action for FP1 at Silverstone; 17-year-old Arvid Lindblad had stepped in to Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull for his F1 weekend debut, while Alpine Reserve Driver Paul Aron was at the wheel of Nico Hulkenberg's Kick Sauber, the rival teams having come to an agreement to share the 21-year-old's driving services.

Haas' Esteban Ocon led the pack out in a busy start to the session, the majority of the field running the medium tyres while the Aston Martin and Williams cars had bolted on the hard compound.

Liam Lawson, meanwhile, made an early complaint about traffic, the Racing Bulls man – whose car is running a special livery this weekend – saying “guy needs to check his mirrors” after encountering Lindblad on track.

The opening segment of FP1 saw several home favourites top the timesheets, with Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris each going fastest before George Russell set the quickest time to head the timesheets.

Practice 1 results

Pierre Gasly, meanwhile, completed a 360-degree spin at Copse corner. The Alpine driver managed to continue running, albeit with some significant flat spots on his tyres.

Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar had set the pace from Charles Leclerc as the session reached its halfway point, just as others started to switch to the soft tyres for some flying laps. Elsewhere there was trouble for Carlos Sainz, with the Williams up on the stands in the garage as the team seemingly checked the floor.

The order quickly started to evolve as most of the pack started to embark on their soft-shod runs, with the times rapidly tumbling, while traffic increasingly became an issue. Meanwhile Gabriel Bortoleto became the next driver to spin around at Copse, the Kick Sauber briefly triggering the yellow flags before continuing on.

As the session entered into its final 20 minutes, Norris had returned to the top of the order – only for Hamilton to surge through to displace his fellow Briton by two-hundredths, the Ferrari driver setting the pace on a 1m 26.892s.

While more laps went on the board – and Sainz rejoined the pack slightly out of sequence on the hard tyres before later switching to the soft rubber – Hamilton's benchmark ultimately remained unbeaten on a track where the 40-year-old has won a record nine times.

Norris remained in second, with the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri going third quickest while Leclerc placed in fourth. Russell followed in fifth for Mercedes ahead of Hadjar, Williams' Alex Albon, Lawson and the other Silver Arrows car of Kimi Antonelli.

Max Verstappen rounded out the top 10 on a weekend in which the Red Bull driver has continued to face speculation over his future. The Aston Martin duo of Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll claimed P11 and P12 from Lindblad (P13), Sainz (P14) and Ocon (P15).

Meanwhile Alpine's Franco Colapinto, Aron, Haas' Ollie Bearman, Gasly and Bortoleto completed the order from 16th to 20th respectively.

With the first hour of running now complete, the drivers and teams will examine their data and prepare for Friday's second practice session, which is set to get underway at 1600 local time.

A spokesperson for the mixed martial arts promotion confirms that they are planning to host an event there as part of the celebrations for America's 250th anniversary.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The UFC is coming to The White House.


	President Trump, speaking at an event in Iowa on Friday night, said that he was hoping to host a mixed martial arts promotion event on the grounds of the White House, as part of the plans to celebrate America's 250th anniversary.




	A spokesperson for the UFC confirmed the plan to The Hollywood Reporter, with UFC CEO Dana White expected to reveal more on the event soon.


	“All of our national park battlefields and historic sites are going to have special events in honor of America 250 and I even think we're going to have a UFC fight,” Trump told the crowd. “Does anybody watch UFC the great Dana White? We're going to have a UFC fight, think of this, on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there.”

	He added that it will be “a championship fight, full fight, like 20, 25,000 people.”

	It isn't clear where on the grounds the fight will take place, or what type of structure will be built to host it. In the past, the UFC has held multiple events in Washington, D.C., at the Capitol One Arena.


	Trump, of course, is close to White, who was a vocal and early supporter. The President has also been a frequent guest at UFC fights, including after taking office this year. UFC is part of TKO Group Holdings, which is led by Ari Emanuel and Mark Shapiro, and controlled by Endeavor, the company that also owns the (now-private) talent agency WME.

	











	White is also no stranger to spectacle, turning his fights into cultural events where the location is as much a part of the story as the bouts. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UFC created what it called “Fight Island” in Abu Dhabi where it could safely hold events, and last year it took over the Sphere in Las Vegas, with White telling THR at the time that the company spent north of $20 million to produce the event.


	“If you take what U2 did and multiply it by a million, that's where we are,” he said.


	Still, the grounds of the White House would set a new bar for an event location, one that is unlikely to be replicated by any other sporting venture anytime soon.


	White also recently joined the board of directors of Meta, invited by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has become a fan of MMA.


	Trump also announced another event as part of the America 250 celebration, a “nationally televised” competition called the “Patriot Games” that will pit youth athletes from all 50 states against each other. Trump said that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will lead the Patriot Games, though he did not reveal any more details, including on which platforms the games will air.

Bavaria Media and Beta Film are backing a new period drama from the makers of 'Sisi,' which reframes the Mozart mythos through the untold true story of Maria Anna Mozart, Amadeus' brilliant, forgotten sister. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Bavaria Media and Beta Film have joined forces on Mozart Mozart, a six-hour drama that reimagines the legacy of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his (real-life) sister, Maria Anna Mozart. 


	The series, from the creators of German costume drama hit Sisi, has received a first-season commission from German public broadcaster ARD and Austria's ORF. 




	Set in the late 18th century, the series centers on Amadeus' sister, Maria Anna Mozart, portrayed by Havana Joy (Love Sucks), who steps into her brother's shoes after his dismissal from the Salzburg court threatens the family's future. When Wolfgang, played by Eren M. Güvercin (Druck, Eldorado), proves too volatile to secure favor at the court of Emperor Joseph II, Maria Anna disguises herself as her brother, captivating Vienna's elite and drawing the envy of Mozart's rival, Antonio Salieri. Her deception grows increasingly complex as she attempts to maintain the ruse, protect her family's reputation and navigate her relationship with Salieri.

	The series stands apart from the upcoming English-language series Amadeus, which Sky has commissioned in the U.K., and will see White Lotus actor Will Sharpe play Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. That drama is a reimagining of Peter Shaffer's 1979 stage play Amadeus, which inspired Milos Forman's 1984 Oscar-winning adaptation.

	“What we definitely didn't want to do was a remake of Amadeus,” Mozart Mozart showrunner Andreas Gutzeit, who created the series and co-wrote it with Swantje Oppermann (Dignity), tells The Hollywood Reporter. “The desire is to tell a new story for a younger audience, and to tell the forgotten story of Maria Anna, who was a musical genius of her own, perhaps as talented, or more so, than her superstar brother.”


	“Mozart's sister isn't a secret, but we don't know much about her life, other than she was also a child prodigy and that she and Amadeus toured together to every royal court in Europe at the time,” notes Clara Zoë My-Linh von Arnim, who is directing the series. “But she had the misfortune of being a woman and then, when she turned a marriageable age, she was dragged off the stage, in the truest sense of the word. There is a lot of speculation on how big her influence was on Amadeus' music, on his compositions, over the years.”


	Jessica De Rooij, who composed the award-winning music for Sisi, is back for Mozart Mozart, giving Mozart's iconic compositions a contemporary edge for the show.  Gutzeit and Jens Freels (Dignity) serve as executive producers, with Simona Weber producing.


	The ensemble cast includes Eidin Jalali (The Swarm, Maxton Hall), Verena Altenberger (Wild Republic), Peter Kurth (Babylon Berlin), Philipp Hochmair (Freud), Sonja Weisser (Maxton Hall), Lisa Vicari (Next Level) and Annabelle Mandeng (Vikings: Valhalla).


	Produced by Gutzeit's Story House Pictures in co-production with ARD, ORF and The Dreaming Sheep Company, Mozart Mozart is being sold internationally by Bavaria Media and Beta Film.

Elly Jackson, playing this year's Karlovy Vary Film Festival opening concert, discusses her upcoming album, interest in creating a soundtrack, Tilda Swinton, sexism, ‘Bulletproof,' and her development as an artist.

	If you are attending the Friday opening night of the 59th edition of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, get ready for stars, fireworks and “Tropical Chancer,” “I'm Not Your Toy” and “Bulletproof” courtesy of La Roux.The festival, kicking off the European summer holiday season, has a track record of free opening night concerts that get the Czech spa town grooving. Two years ago, Russell Crowe rocked the crowd, and electronic band Morcheeba got folks moving. Last year, Kosheen was in the house – well, actually in the square outside the Hotel Thermal.


	This year, another big British name is ready to bring the party to Karlovy Vary, which runs through July 12: Grammy-winning synthpop act La Roux. And is tradition, the fireworks on stage will be followed by a fireworks display.

	La Roux's self-titled debut album in 2009 was a critical and commercial success and won numerous awards. It produced such hits as the ones mentioned above. It was the creation of singer Elly Jackson, known for reddish hair that also inspired the band name, and record producer Ben Langmaid, who later left the duo.


	Jackson followed up the debut album with 2014's Trouble in Paradise, followed by 2020's Supervision.


	Ahead of the Karlovy Vary performance, Jackson, born in London to actors Trudie Goodwin and Kit Jackson, talked to THR about how her music has changed, her next album, why she deserves more credit, and how female music creators must often still fight to get it.


How do you feel about how your music and your style have evolved and changed over time and how much you have developed as an artist? 












	I feel that probably the biggest difference is that, as time has gone on, I've learned how to be more authentically myself in my work, whilst creating stylized worlds. When I first started, thinking about it from a psychological perspective, maybe there was some kind of covering up of who I really am, but under the guise of creating characters. Although I'm really proud of that time and I wouldn't change it for anything, and I love all the visuals I did, it's nice to be able to take the shell off a little bit as you get older and learn to be who you are, but still in an artistic landscape. That's been a nice process, a kind of unmasking, but hopefully not in a really boring way.


Where did the name La Roux come from? Basically, I just didn't want it to be my name, because I think that's really boring. Generally, names as a kind of artist name are quite dull nowadays anyway. And I also wanted it to be a name that meant that I could do lots of different things throughout my career. I felt there was an ability within that to have a bigger musical scope. I wanted my name to be able to encapsulate different things and feelings, and that's when I decided to come up with a project name.The guy that I did the artwork with on the first album is Alex Brown. We're friends and we met when he was still at uni. I told him, “I've given myself this week to come up with a name for the project, and if it goes on any longer than that, it's going to get silly.” When I went round to his house, he said, “I just found this '80s baby name book in a skip outside – maybe you'll find a name in here.” 


	The first page I opened said Laroux,” and I'd wanted the name to encapsulate my red hair. I also wanted to have the letter X in it, because my music was electronic, and when I was a teenager, those things went together. And I also wanted it to be a bit French, because I have some French heritage in my background. And weirdly, that is exactly what those words mean. La Roux means red-haired one in French. But even more handily, it's the male version of that. So it's actually, kind of by accident, a very androgynous name as well.


A friend once said: “La Roux reminds me a bit of an actress…”


	Tilda Swinton?

	











Exactly! Have you met her? Or was she an inspiration for you?


	Weirdly, I didn't actually know who she was when I was younger. My mom is an actress in the U.K., and she knew who she was, of course. And obviously, I know who Tilda Swinton is now, but I didn't then. I was very young. My mum was like: “There's some similarity between you and Tilda Swinton. And I said: I don't even know who she is, so it can't be intentional.” 


	Anything that I had been like had probably come more from listening to Annie Lennox my whole life. I just happened to be ginger, and I had short hair, and I like '80s music, so the things are going to get combined.


	So no, it wasn't intentional at all. But then I met her, and we had a couple of pictures together, and she's very sweet. So, it was a brilliant moment. 


With your family background and your talents, have you done any acting or have you created any film or TV music? 


	One of the biggest frustrations of my career is that people never asked me to produce anything when I produced my last three albums, and I play all the parts, and I arrange and compose every record. It's always been really shocking to me that no one has asked me to do a soundtrack. No one's ever asked me to write anything on commission or produce anything. I find it very strange that it makes me feel like we must still live in a sexist world that I hope we don't live in, but we do. I would love to do that, but I've never been asked. 


	I did get asked to audition for a film role once or twice, but weirdly, being on stage in front of 50,000 people wouldn't scare me, but doing that scares the living daylights out of me. I really like doing little bits of silly sort of acting in music videos. I really enjoy that. And I don't think I'd be a terrible actress, but the setting would have to be very right. And I'm not the kind of be-it-all, do-it-all kind of artist. I like music.


Friends of mine in Central and Eastern Europe all know your music. It seems like you have a fan base there…but have you played a film festival before?












	I can't remember exactly where “Bulletproof” was a number one, but I remember it being big in that part of the world. I've played all over Germany. I've played in Poland. And I have played a fashion show or two. But I don't think I've done a festival before. 


How important was or is “Bulletproof” to you personally and your career? 


	Actually, “Bulletproof” came at the end of the first record. It was the last thing we wrote for the record. And it wasn't intentional. What happened was: Ben was on the phone, and I was in the living room on the keyboard, and I started playing the main sounds, an arpeggiated part. And he just came in and said, “Record that!” And then we just wrote the song. I was pissed off at the time because I'd been trying to date somebody, and they'd been dicking me around. I'd been listening to a lot of Yazoo, and that was a big reference on the day.


	Why “Bulletproof” is weird for me is that it was throwaway when I wrote it, and it still feels really throwaway to me. It's like it's not for me, even though I wrote every single part in it and co-wrote the lyrics with Ben. It doesn't represent who I am as an artist or a person at all. For me, I would say it's outside of the catalog, which is probably also why it's successful. But I feel that track just has a completely different feeling from anything else, which is also why it's big.


	We'd already written the album. We were already getting signed to Polydor. We were in a very relaxed, confident space, and I think for both of us, that day was just easy, because it just flowed. And we knew we'd written a really good song, but neither of us knew we'd written something that was going to essentially pay us for the rest of our lives. It is crazy when you think about what an afternoon can do. 


Which one of your tracks is, or are, a good representation of who you are as an artist and person?












	I would say “Tropical Chancer,” “Sexotheque,” “Cruel Sexuality” [on album 2, Trouble in Paradise]. “Colourless Colour” [from the first album] was very me at that time, probably the most me track on that album at the time. And “Quicksand” was a big one for me back then, too. And then later, “Otherside” is my favorite track from Supervision and is the most me. “Automatic Driver” and “Gullible Fool” as well.


Since these days, it seems like everything is political, any political or social issues you'd like to share?Just: Free Palestine.


What's next for La Roux?


	I have a new record that is written and finished, and it's on its way. I'm also working on other music. I've gotten back into my flow now.


Anything you can share about this fourth studio album you just mentioned? Is it different in any way?












	It's a La Roux record. It's not like I've gone down some wild [path] or anything, but at the same time, I would say that it's a lot warmer. It's got R&B references, but I wouldn't say that it's an R&B record. It has R&B moments, but it's a pop record. It's got my own slant on an R&B flavor, shall we say? 


Before I let you get back to work, anything else you'd like to highlight or follow up on?


	The only thing at the moment is that I've really realized how frustrating I find it that I don't get recognized in the same way as my male counterparts for my production work. That's something I want to talk about. I kind of just ignored it in the past and was just like, “Whatever, it is what it is.” But it's something that I recently found I actually really need to speak up about, because otherwise it's just going to continue. I am doing three years of work at a computer by myself, and then people ask: “Which guy did this?” It's beyond frustrating, as I'm sure you can imagine.


	So, I'm now always trying to remind people that, when you listen to my music, I wrote and performed all of it, unless it's a saxophone or the odd bass part that's difficult. Maybe three parts across an entire album are performed by somebody else. Sometimes, I get a percussionist in at the end who specializes in percussion. Or if I want the piano to be really grandiose and old-school, then I would get a pianist in. But I would have written the basic part already. That happens maybe three times across an entire album, and still, I don't get the credit for the other 90 percent or 80 percent that I did. It's just very frustrating.


	It's not just men who do it. Women do it as well. We're just brought up in a way where we categorize certain tasks into genders, and we don't know exactly where it starts or how we do it. It happens to all of us, and you can't really blame people for just what they've absorbed throughout their lives. But we can try and change it moving forward. It's just about women communicating, unfortunately, slightly louder than men have to, which is also annoying. Maybe we just have to find ways of talking about it and making sure people do know, because otherwise, why would I bother sitting there all day trying to get better at something if no one even knows I'm getting better at it or recognizes that I even did it in the first place.

""I cannot express clearly enough that I wanted Bob Vylan to perform at our festival,"" RADAR Festival organizer Catherine Jackson-Smith shared.

	Manchester's Radar Festival says it was left with no choice but to pull Bob Vylan from its 2025 lineup, following the punk-rap duo's controversial set at Glastonbury Festival.

	The pair sparked headlines during their performance on Glastonbury's West Holts Stage, leading chants of “Death to the IDF” while also calling out the BBC, the US and UK governments, and more. Frontman Bobby Vylan told the crowd, “We are the violent punks, because sometimes you gotta get your message across with violence because that is the only language some people speak, unfortunately.”

	The backlash was swift. Glastonbury organizers issued a statement condemning the chants, saying they “very much crossed a line” and that there is “no place at Glastonbury for anti-Semitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Radar initially confirmed Bob Vylan's removal with a brief statement on July 2: “Bob Vylan will not be appearing at RADAR Festival this weekend.” But in a new interview on the Two Promoters One Pod podcast, organizer Catherine Jackson-Smith shared that the festival did not want to cancel the group's headline set.


	“It was categorically one of the most horrendous professional discussions I've ever had,” she said. “I cannot express clearly enough that I wanted Bob Vylan to perform at our festival. But this was not our decision.”

	











	According to Jackson-Smith, Radar was caught between behind-the-scenes conversations involving the venue, its co-owners AMG and Live Nation, and local authorities. The decision to drop Bob Vylan was presented as an ultimatum: either cancel the band's appearance or risk losing the entire Saturday program.


	“There was not an option for Bob Vylan to step on stage on Saturday; that became apparent at the beginning of the week,” Jackson-Smith explained. “If we continued with Bob Vylan as our headliner, we wouldn't have the festival happening on Saturday.”


	The festival, which runs July 4-6 at Manchester's O2 Victoria Warehouse, is independently operated by Jackson-Smith and co-founder Joe James. Canceling the band prevented what she described as a “precarious situation” that could have impacted 41 other acts and the viability of the event itself.


	Adding to the complexity, Bob Vylan's agency dropped the band in the wake of the Glastonbury controversy, forcing Jackson-Smith to have a direct conversation with the group about their removal.


	“It was horrific as a conversation,” she said. “Bob Vylan knew that we didn't want to pull them.”


	In response, Bob Vylan posted on social media: “Silence is not an option. We will be fine, the people of Palestine are hurting. Manchester, we will be back.”


	The Glastonbury performance continues to ripple across the industry. Alongside being dropped from Radar, Bob Vylan has reportedly been removed from the Kave Festival in France and a Gogol Bordello support slot in Cologne. Their US visas have also been revoked, and they are under criminal investigation in connection to the remarks.

	











	Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy criticized the BBC for airing the performance, calling it “a problem of leadership,” while US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described Bob Vylan's remarks as “a hateful tirade.”


	In a follow-up statement, Bob Vylan said they are “not for the death of Jews or Arabs or any other race or group” and called for “the dismantling of a violent military machine.”


	Radar Festival has yet to announce a replacement headliner for Saturday. Jackson-Smith confirmed efforts are underway but acknowledged the difficulty of securing a last-minute act. “We might end up with someone that has no discernible political opinion at this point because if they're free and they can play on Saturday, maybe that's the only criteria,” she said.


	Radar Festival told Billboard they will be making no further comment on the matter. The festival runs July 4-6 at Manchester's O2 Victoria Warehouse.

	Usher has scrapped plans for his long-awaited return to Australia, with all dates on his Past Present Future tour now officially canceled.


	The R&B superstar was due to play 12 shows across Melbourne and Sydney in November and December, marking his first Australian tour in nearly 14 years. Tickets for the trek went on sale in May, with strong demand leading promoters to add four extra dates after the initial announcement.


	Live Nation confirmed the news Friday (July 4), sharing a brief statement via Ticketek's website: “The promoter of Usher's Australian tour regrets to advise that the scheduled shows to take place in November/December will no longer be proceeding.” No reason was given for the cancellation.

	The Grammy winner first announced the Australian leg of the Past Present Future tour back in March, telling fans he was “bringing the A to the AUS” on Instagram. The trek, which has already seen Usher perform in the U.S. and Europe, was set to kick off Nov. 19 at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena before moving to Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena on Dec. 1.


	Ticket prices for the shows ranged from approximately AUD $220 for standard seats to AUD $2,792 for the Ultimate Meet and Greet VIP Lounge Experience, sparking debate among fans about the high cost of entry.

The executive will succeed the Swedish entertainment company's current CEO, Per Sundin, who's set to assume a new role at Pophouse after Koravos assumes the position in January.


													By
												

	Katie Bain



Swedish entertainment company Pophouse has named a new CEO, Jessica Koravos, who will take over leadership of the company in January 2026.


	A statement from Pophouse says that Koravos will “lead the company's ambitious next phase of global expansion and its journey to become a world leader in music IP investment and development.” 


	Koravos was previously president of Oak View Group International, president of Andrew Lloyd Webber‘s The Really Useful Group and a board member for ABBA Voyage, the ABBA hologram show developed by Pophouse that debuted in London in 2022. (Pophouse was co-founded by ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus.)


	Pophouse's current CEO, Per Sundin, will remain in his current role until Koravos joins as CEO in January. The statement says Sundin will “support a smooth and orderly process, before assuming a new role” within the company. This new role “will be defined around his experience in and knowledge of the entertainment industry together with [Koravos].”


	“I am truly delighted to be joining Pophouse at this exciting time,” Koravos says in a statement. “Having seen Pophouse's tremendous growth — driven by their compelling strategy, powerful partnerships with global artists, inspiring board and excellent team. I look forward to driving the future expansion and success of the business.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The company's chair, Lennart Blecher, adds that “this leadership transition represents a pivotal moment in Pophouse's evolution and underscores the company's mission to redefine the entertainment landscape. Jessica brings a proven track record of driving sustained growth across entertainment and live production ventures on a global scale, and her leadership in securing international licensing partnerships and delivering iconic IPs to audiences throughout Europe, Asia and the U.S. aligns perfectly with our ambitious expansion goals — for example Mamma Mia! The Party and the upcoming KISS avatar show. I am truly thrilled to welcome Jessica to Pophouse.”


	Blecher adds, “I would like to thank Per for all he has contributed to put Pophouse firmly on the map. We are delighted that Per will continue to be a vital part of the team and we all at Pophouse look forward to continuing our collaboration.”


	In March, Pophouse announced that it raised $1.3 billion to invest in catalog acquisitions and develop entertainment experiences around those music rights. It simultaneously revealed that roughly 30% of this fund has already been deployed in partnerships related to the acquisition of rights to songs by KISS, Cyndi Lauper, Avicii and Swedish House Mafia.


	In an interview with Billboard in May, Sundin said that the company hopes “to announce at least one catalog we're buying by summer. But we don't just want to buy it and put it on the shelf. We create a road map for five to 10 years, and then we execute that road map. From the beginning, we told our investors that we want to buy eight to 10 catalogs. We have four. That leaves six to buy. The record companies have thousands of catalogs.”


	Pophouse's current track record includes the aforementioned ABBA Voyage, The Avicii Experience tribute museum in Stockholm, Mamma Mia! The Party, an interactive dinner party in a London theater designed like a taverna in the Greek islands and ABBA The Museum, which opened in 2013. KISS also sold its name and likeness rights to Pophouse and has said that a virtual performance of its songs could launch in Las Vegas in 2027.

	The accident reportedly occurred in the early hours of Thursday morning as Jota was traveling from Portugal to Santander, where he planned to take a ferry back to England for pre-season training. He had been advised not to fly following minor surgery.

	His younger brother, Andre Silva, also a professional footballer in Portugal, was killed in the crash at age 25. According to CNN, Spain's Guardia Civil said the accident was likely caused by a “burst tire while overtaking.”

	











	Plant's connection to Jota goes beyond music fandom. The rock icon has been a vice president at Wolves since 2009 and has attended countless matches at Molineux over the years. Jota's time at Wolves was a pivotal chapter in his career; after arriving on loan in 2017, he helped secure the club's promotion to the Premier League and stayed on to establish himself as a standout forward.


	Tributes poured in from across the football and entertainment worlds following the news. Cristiano Ronaldo shared an emotional message: “It doesn't make sense. Just now we were together in the national team, you had just got married. Rest in peace, Diogo e Andre. We will miss you.” Former Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp described Jota as “not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father.”


	Jota's sudden passing comes just 11 days after he married his long-time partner, Rute Cardoso. He is survived by Cardoso and their three young children.

	“I am very happy that the 82nd Venice International Film Festival will open with the new and highly anticipated film by Paolo Sorrentino,” Venice head Alberto Barbera said in a statement, adding that Sorrentino's career began at Venice in 2001 with first feature One Man Up. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“The relationship with the Venice Film Festival became consolidated over the years with the presentation out of competition of the first episodes in the series The Young Pope (seasons one and two) and, above all, with The Hand of God which, in 2021, won the Silver Lion-Grand Jury Prize,” Barbera added. “Paolo Sorrentino's return in competition comes with a film destined to leave its mark for its great originality and powerful relevance to the present time, which the audiences of the Venice Film Festival will have the pleasure of discovering on opening night.”


	Born in Naples in 1970, Sorrentino's credits include The Consequences of Love and The Family Friend, which both competed for the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while his film Il Divo won the Jury Prize in 2008. He returned In Competition at Cannes in 2011 with This Must Be the Place and two years later with The Great Beauty, which won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA award for Best Foreign Language Film as well as three European Film Awards. His last feature Parthenope debuted at Cannes in 2024.

Sophia Hutchins, Caitlyn Jenner‘s friend and manager who appeared in I Am Cait, has died. She was 29.


	The former CEO and director of the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning in Malibu, following an ATV accident with a moving vehicle that sent her crashing 350 feet down a ravine near Jenner's home, where she lived.


	According to the TMZ, Hutchins was pronounced dead on the scene. No one else was injured.


	Hutchins, who is also transgender, met Jenner amid her gender transition in 2015, appearing in multiple episodes of her E! reality series I Am Cait as the former Olympian's manager.

	Born April 1, 1996 in Bellevue, Washington, Hutchins graduated from Pepperdine University in 2019 with a degree in economics and finance. She also served as founder and CEO of health technology company LUMASOL.


	In 2020, Hutchins shared her favorite life lesson with Medium. “Don't be afraid of the word no,” she said. “Successful people, entrepreneurs, and women more than anyone else are told no all the time. If we allowed ‘no' to deter us we wouldn't be where we are today.


	“I'm ready to continue to grow and surround myself with positive uplifting people that believe in me, my ability to execute, and my vision for the future,” added Hutchins.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	Someone's playing fast and loose with the real numbers, and, for once, it may not be Donald Trump — at least when it comes to POTUS' recent multi-million dollar lawsuit settlement with CBS.


	Never one to let anyone else have the last word or reluctant to craft reality to his own connivence, Trump on Wednesday claimed that his arm twisting and threats with the outlet garnered a much bigger reward than the $16 million parent company Paramount Global wants to admit to.


	“We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million, or maybe more than that in advertising,” Trump told reporters upon Air Force One of the settlement with Paramount Global. “So, it's a combination of 16 plus 16 plus,” Trump said, per the White House pool report. Trump was traveling back to Washington after giving a rally-like MAGA speech at Des Moines' Iowa State Fairgrounds.

					What Donald Trump's ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" Does, And Does Not Do, For Hollywood		
			








	“So, it's like $32, maybe $35 million,” Trump added of the long expected bow from CBS in response to his original $20 billion suit filed late last year over an interview with rival Kamala Harris that ran on 60 Minutes. Then in the heat of the 2024 election, Trump has long insisted  the sit-down was intentionally edited to make the then-VP look better and give the Democrat an electoral leg-up.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The still Shari Redstone-run Paramount Global announced the settlement figure as $16 million, the same amount  that Disney reached in December to resolve a Trump defamation lawsuit against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos. Just like the CBS matter, that money from Disney went to the future Trump library and attorneys fees.


	Paramount Global and its executives, however, have denied that the settlement is anything more than the $16 million, after Fox Business' Charles Gasparino reported on Wednesday that the sum was closer to Trump's figure and included an agreement to run public service announcements on topics like antisemitism.

	











	For what it's worth, there is some debate behind the scenes whether or not it was the desperate Paramount who made the deal for the millions in ads with the Trump team. Was the additional $16 million a “side deal” handshake agreement with would-be owner and Trump UFC seat mate David Ellison to grease the regulatory wheels?


	“Contrary to some news reports or media speculation, Paramount's settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs,” a Paramount Global spokesperson said. “Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties.”


	So, as at this point, is Redstone's Paramount Global essentially calling Donald Trump a liar or simply pleading ignorance?


	The company is hoping their publicly disclosed $16 million payout to the former Celebrity Apprentice host will unlock long stymied F.C.C. regulatory approval for its $8 billion merger with Ellison's Skydance, and a new dispute is not where Paramount Global wants to find itself in this holiday weekend.


	In a court filing on Wednesday, Trump and Paramount Global officially informed the judge in the case that they have agreed to a settlement, but said that they are working on a final agreement and the plaintiffs' notice of dismissal.


	There are two other outstanding issues before the Trump administration: The FCC approval of the Paramount-Skydance transaction, and a conservative group's complaint over the 60 Minutes broadcast.


	With 60 Minutes and CBS News having lost the likes of producer Bill Owens and president Wendy McMahon, current co-CEO George Cheeks has tried to frame the settlement as just business as usual.  “Look, companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial as well as reputational damage and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,” Cheeks said at the company's annual shareholder meeting on July 2, noting that in the settlement Trump didn't get the apology he had long sought.


	As Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) talks of putting forth a bill ASAP to  “rein in corruption” related to presidential library donations, she “calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.” John Dickerson, co-anchor of the CBS Evening News, addressed the situation at the end of Wednesday's broadcast/ 


	“The Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle,” he said. “Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you've traded away that trust? The audience will decide that. Our job is to show up, to honor what we witness on behalf of the people we witness it for.”

We are living in bizarro world now.

You can't spell Trump without Corruption.

A profoundly corrupt and deeply illegal bribe from a corporation to a sitting President. Ellison and Redstone clearly have no scruples or shame, but they will be judged by history. All those who capitulated to this criminal organization will own it for life, along with those who ignorantly returned Trump to power.

Jesus he can't take ANY sort of news that makes him seem small.  16 million is not “bigly” enough and he has to double it.  Sad, orange, man

That was clear. Once he gets what he wants, he demands more and more. You don't make deals with someone like that, because he never lets up.

	For the first time in the country's 250-year history, the White House could host a cage match, serving as the UFC‘s next venue.


	On Thursday, Donald Trump announced plans to host a mixed martial arts competition on the White House grounds as part of his year-long celebration for the United States' 250th birthday, kicking off this July 4, during which he's expected to sign his controversial One Big Beautiful Bill into law.


	“So every one of our national parks, battlefields and historic sites are going to have special events in honor of America 250,” said Trump in his speech in Des Moines, Iowa. “And I even think we're going to have a UFC fight.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump envisions a “full fight” with 20,000 to 25,000 people in attendance. “Think of this on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there,” he said.


	The twice-impeached president celebrated his re-election in November with a victory lap at UFC 309 at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

A post shared by UFC (@ufc)


	“My relationship with Trump is a 20-year relationship,” UFC CEO Dana White previously said last February. “I've been friends with this guy for 20 years, and when he shows up to the fights… The guy is a fight fan. He's been a fight fan.”


	White credited Trump for letting the UFC use the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City when he took over as CEO, noting, “Venues didn't want us.”


	Trump's big US birthday celebration comes after he sparked nationwide “No Kings” protests in opposition to his military parade, held on his 79th birthday under the guise of celebrating the Army's 250th birthday.

Idiocracy is a documentary.

Musk thinks he's tough; put Musk in the ring with a UFC fighter and let him fight for his immigration status and business subsidies.

Why am I not surprised?

Keepin' it klassy, Donald.

Trash entertainment for a trash president. Very on brand.

Are our tax dollars going to be paying for it? If he makes admission charges will he pocket the money.(probably)

If he wants to provide entertainment venue  on his dollar he should be having it at Mar A Lago.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	Once upon a time in Hollywood, the charismatic heavy with smarts and a heart was a familiar archetype in mainstream cinema — think Robert Mitchum, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, or James Coburn — but the recent passing of Michael Madsen, at the age of 67, could well mark the end of that particular chapter in movie history. Though he made his breakthrough as the psychotic, ear-slicing Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's 1992 debut Reservoir Dogs, Madsen was capable of much, much more, although it's fair to say that only his work with Tarantino ever made the most of that soulful talent. Which other tough guy could have delivered the line, as he did so memorably in Kill Bill Vol. 2, “That woman deserves her revenge, and we deserve to die” and sound like they meant it?

					Michael Madsen Dies: Prolific 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Kill Bill' & 'Donnie Brasco' Actor Was 67		
			








	The following interview took place 10 years ago in February, high in the mountains of Telluride during the shoot of The Hateful Eight, Tarantino's wintry Western with a whodunit twist, in which he played the mysterious Joe Gage. The director had chosen the town in Colorado for its predicted snowfall, but, for quite some time, none came, keeping the crew on their toes. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	I met Madsen during a lull in production; though the talk was ostensibly about the film at hand, the actor couldn't help but digress, at one point welling up behind his rockstar shades as he recalled his early days as an actor, pumping gas for the likes of Warren Beatty, his odd-couple friendship with Sergio Leone, and, after getting a bit too cozy with Tarantino's laser-like auteur specificity, his fractious interaction with the mainstream film industry.


	Parts of this interview have appeared elsewhere, but this is the full exchange, and it's very revealing, even today. How much of what he says is actually true is hard to prove, and he certainly had his own particular style of self-mythologizing. But then, to quote John Ford's 1962 movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” It's a reference Madsen would have dug; indeed, just yesterday, he passed into legend himself.

	











DEADLINE: How did you get involved with The Hateful Eight?


MICHAEL MADSEN: Well, first, I just wanna remember one thing.


DEADLINE: What's that?


MADSEN: You know, when Budd pulls his sword out [in Kill Bill Vol. 2] it says, “To my brother Budd, the only man that I ever loved.” And I would just like to start by saying that I have that sword. And I would say to Quentin that there should be one that says [the same thing]: “From me to Quentin — the only man I ever loved.” I wanna go on record by saying that.


DEADLINE: This is the third time you've worked with Quentin…


	Well, it's actually the fourth. I'd like to say it's the fourth time, 'cause he cut Hell Ride. You know, Hell Ride wasn't releasable when they finished that thing. 'Cause various people had had their hands on it. And he took it, and he put it back together like a jigsaw puzzle. And he fixed it. And it's a much better movie. And I like it a lot. But the reason it's good is 'cause he cut it.


DEADLINE: Is that the 2008 Larry Bishop movie?


MADSEN: Yeah. So, I think Hateful Eight's the fourth one, really. To be honest.


DEADLINE: When did you first hear about it?


MADSEN: Well, you know, I was actually sitting with a couple of cops. I was in my house and a handyman that we had had absconded with some things from the house — my wife's watch and some jewelry. And I when I found out, I basically told the guy that I was going to cause him…


DEADLINE: Discomfort?


MADSEN: Yes, sir. And so, his father ended up getting in touch with me saying that he had a checkered past and I should forgive him. But I should file charges on him so that he would take it seriously. So, I did. And I had a couple of cops at my house. I was sitting in the kitchen with these policemen, and I was talking about this fella, and my cell phone rang. I hardly ever answer the f*cking thing. I always wanna see who it is first. And I never answer it. And for some reason, I don't know why, I answered it. I said hello. It was, “Hey, Mike, it's Quentin.” And I hadn't spoken to him since the time I was gonna do Django. He was trying to find a part for me in Django.


DEADLINE: What part did he offer you in Django?


MADSEN: The only part that I wanted was Leo's part. I wanted to play Calvin. I thought it was the best role in the film. But he wanted me in a smaller role, and it wasn't working out somehow, so it didn't happen. But I hadn't heard from him since before that. You know, there's all these stupid vicious things on the internet, like, “Madsen owes Quentin $1 million,” and, “Madsen will never work with Quentin again” — all this stupid sh*t, you know? And I go, “Hey, man, what's up?” And he goes, “Ah, I just wrote this Western. And I want you to be in it.” I said, “Really?” And he goes, “Yeah.” And I go, “Oh, well, OK.” So he goes, “Why don't you come over?” We used to do that all the time. That happened for Kill Bill. 'Cause he wanted me to play a character named Mister Barrel in Kill Bill.


DEADLINE: Who was that?


MADSEN: Mister Barrel was a guy who had a mask on a stick. It was a Lone Ranger mask, and he'd whip it up and hold it in front of his face when he was about to kill somebody. He was part of Uma Thurman's bodyguard team. So, one day he rang me up and he said, “Listen, I don't want you to play Mister Barrel any more. I want you to be Budd. Come over.” So, I went over. My sons were swimming in his pool, he had a bottle of tequila, and we drank some tequila. He said, “You wanna play Budd?” I said, “Yeah, man.” And he goes, “Well, I already gave the part to another actor. So, I'm gonna have to tell the other actor that he doesn't have the part. So, you gotta give me a couple days to work that out. But I want you to be Budd.' And I said, “OK.” Then he goes, “But I want you to read it right here in my house.” Which I did. I sat there and I read the whole script in his house while he walked around doing things.

	











	So, it was the same thing with Hateful Eight. He said, “Will you come over?” And I said, “Now?” He was like, “Well…” And I said, “OK, can I come tomorrow?” He said, “Yeah, come tomorrow.” I said OK. Now, I know his gate code. And I said, “Did you change your gate code?” And he goes no. So, the next day I went over to his house, and it was as if we hadn't only seen each other the day before. He has so much great stuff in his house. I mean, I don't know if you've ever been in there…


	He's got so much great stuff in there, man. He's just got the coolest sh*t in there. Y'know, me and him, we both love movies so much. And he has so many things that are so cool. Like, memorabilia stuff. And he gave me Hateful Eight. And I said, “Holy sh*t, man!” And he goes, “Well, y'know, read it.” I'm like, “Right now?” And he goes, “Well turn to page…” whatever. So, I did it. He says, “Just a couple lines.” So, I read, like, four lines. He goes, “OK, OK. That's great, that's great.” He gave it to me, and I took it home. I read it and I realized it was probably the greatest part he's ever wrote for me, you know?


DEADLINE: What happened then?


MADSEN: I left, like, three days later to go to Italy, 'cause I was shooting a picture in Rome. About a week later I was in an elevator with somebody, and the guy he was with, he was looking at his cell phone. And he goes, “Oh sh*t. Holy sh*t.” I go, “What?” He goes, “Tarantino's not gonna make Hateful Eight.” I say, “Oh no, why?” He says, “Somebody leaked the script. Somebody gave the screenplay to someone.” I went, “Oh my God.” And on the internet, it said, “I've only given the script to three people — Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern. And I know for sure it wasn't Tim.” And I'm like, “Why would I do that?” I mean, he had inadvertently fingered me, right? So, I called him up from the lobby of the hotel at the Valadier in Rome. And I said, “Quentin, in the name of God, would you please make a public statement that I didn't leak your script?” And he started laughing on the phone. And he thought it was so funny. And I go, “Well, I didn't obviously do it, so please tell someone.” Meanwhile, on my Facebook, I'm getting messages from people, saying, “You traitor. You ignorant f*cker — you've ruined our life.” And I'm like, “I didn't do it!!!” It was so funny. Even my own son, he was like, “Dad, why did you do that?” I was like, “I didn't do it!!!” Somebody actually put on the internet a picture of me. They'd Photoshopped a picture of me and Edward Snowden, and I'm giving Edward Snowden the Hateful Eight script. It was really an uncomfortable time.


DEADLINE: Did Quentin do anything?


MADSEN: No, and I kept saying, “Please, please, do something. Do something, please.” And so, the genius that he is, instead of publicly, like, falling down in front of everybody, he decides to stage a live reading at the Mary Pickford Theater, for f*ck's sake. Right? And I heard that he was gonna do this publicly. And I was thinking, OK, does he think that I'm the one? And so, I called him. And he never answers his f*cking telephone ever. And he answered his phone. Which was astounding to me. And I said, “I see you're gonna do this thing over at the Pickford Theater,” and he goes, “Yeah.” I go, “Well, I'm Joe Gage.” And he goes, “Yeah.” And I said, “So I'm gonna be in it?” He goes, “Yeah.” And I go, “OK.”

	











DEADLINE: So, you had to ask him to find out?


MADSEN: That's kind what Quentin is like. Here's a funny story. You know when Uma Thurman is buried [in Kill Bill], when I bury Uma? She's in the box. And she gets a razor out of her boot, and she cuts the ropes on her boot. That razor is the exact same razor that I used as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs.


DEADLINE: How do you know that?


MADSEN: We were in London at the premiere of Kill Bill. We're walking outside. And Quentin goes, “So, how'd you like the movie? “I go, “Oh, it was pretty good.” And he goes, “No, no, no — how'd you like it? How'd you like that scene when she's buried?” And I go, “It was great, man. It's pretty good.” And he goes, “OK, so… what about the razor?” And I go, “The razor?” And he goes, “Michael, that was Mr. Blonde's razor. I gave it to her to use in the movie.” And I go, “Oh my God. Why didn't you tell me?” And he goes, “I was waiting for you to ask me.” 


DEADLINE: The live reading sounded amazing. What kind of rehearsal time did you have?


MADSEN: Well, you know, I'm no theater actor, that's for sure. I really am not. The whole theater thing to me is kind of pointless. I just don't get it. But we read through it for about two weeks to get ready to do it. Then we all sat in chairs, and we had like, you know, those metal things, those orchestra stands, to put the scripts on. We all sat there and then Quentin came out. He had a big cowboy hat on, and he kind of officiated over the whole thing. Y'know, there were a lot of people there. They were all dressed up. I remember everybody was all dressed up. And it was quite an affair. Fancy clothes.


DEADLINE: Were you nervous?


MADSEN: I feel very uncomfortable on stage. I'm a motion picture actor, you know? I need to be in motion. I'm very uncomfortable just sitting. And so, for me, it was academic. I mean, we'd read it so many times that I already knew it. So, I didn't really have to, you know, study. But it was interesting because the energy in the theater was so big. It was just big. And afterwards Quentin said, “Wow, that really went well.” He goes, “I didn't think it would go that well.” And we were like, “Yeah, it did, man.” The Weinsteins were there — Bob and Harvey were walking around — and it seems to me like that's when he made the decision to make the movie. 'Cause he had said he wasn't gonna do it. But he told the whole audience, he said, “You know what? I rewrote the middle, and I rewrote the ending. So, what you guys just saw ain't gonna happen. And you won't know what's gonna happen till you see the movie, 'cause I rewrote it. So, f*ck everybody, right?” He gave everybody a punch. And the rewrite is so stunningly, insanely good. But I don't know where it comes from. I really don't.


DEADLINE: I've read the script, it's fantastic.


MADSEN: Oh, it's more than fantastic. That's just another reason why I love him. 'Cause let's face it; I wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for him. I would have been dead and buried long ago if it wasn't for Quentin. My life would have taken a bad turn. But… He's a f*cking genius, man. I have so much fun with him… [Pauses] When I was a little boy, I really didn't know what to do with myself. I was in trouble quite a bit. And I loved motion pictures. I don't know why, but it seemed like there was something noble about it. About storytelling. Sometimes when we're hanging out, he knows about those moments in films that I remember from being a little boy. And we share a knowledge with each other about movies that I've never had with any other director I've ever worked with — I never had it with any other director I've ever worked with. And I've been with some pretty good cats, man. I made some good sh*t, man, y'know? Donnie Brasco and The Getaway and all that. It was all pretty good stuff. But with him, there's this weird kind of symbiotic notion we have with each other that I'm so blessed to have. We've had it from the beginning. And he's sort of a film historian. I mean, there's like nothing about any movie that I've ever known in my life that he doesn't already know about. And it's pretty bizarre. It's… Can you ask me a question, so I don't just keep rambling?

	











DEADLINE: Tell me about Joe Gage. What was it about the character?


MADSEN: Well, first of all, I will tell you the best story of all about me and him. And it kind of sums it up. It really does. It kind of sums up the whole thing. When Quentin asked me to do Kill Bill, I was making a Western in Mexico. I had gone through Durango on my way back into California, and I bought that white hat. That f*cking Stetson, right? So, we started to do the read-throughs in Culver City for Kill Bill, and I started showing up at the read-throughs with that f*cking white hat on. I'm just working on trying to figure out who Budd was, what my character was gonna be, and all that. And I kept going in that white hat. And Quentin he comes up to me and he goes, “You're not gonna wear that hat.” And I go, “What?” He goes, “In the movie. When we shoot the movie, you're not gonna wear that hat.” And I go, “I'm not?” He goes no. And I go, “Look, Budd lives in a trailer. He's a bouncer in a strip club. His swordplay's over. He's a bum, he's an idiot. He's done. I wanna make a kind of like a cool character out of him.” And Quentin goes, “No, no, no. I want you to cut your hair too.” I go, “Really?” He says, “Yeah. I want it all cut it off and you're not wearing that f*cking hat.” I was like, “Well, all right.” But I didn't cut my hair, and I kept going to rehearsal in that f*cking hat.


DEADLINE: How come you wear it in the movie?


MADSEN: One day that we were doing the props — I was getting propped up — and Quentin comes walking up behind me and he goes, “OK, OK. Michael, Michael. Y'know, the thing is, now I can't picture you without the hat. Because you keep wearing that goddamn thing, and so, y'know, now I get it. OK, fine.” I'm like, “Oh, I can wear the hat?” He goes, “You can wear the hat.” The first stuff that we shoot is the stuff at the graveyard where I have to bury Uma. I gotta pull her out of the truck, throw her down, make this offer to her of a flashlight, and I got a can of mace that I'm gonna spray it in her eyeball. And I didn't wanna start with that scene. I didn't want that to be the first stuff we shot. 'Cause I didn't know what to do with Budd, right?


	But we did it. It was like 3am in the morning. There I am in my hat, right? And so he shoots it. And we're all like, “Yeah, OK, cool, right, right.” So, then we go out to Barstow to shoot the strip club scenes. And, you know, the truck pulls up. I get out of the truck, I smoke a cigarette, I got my hat, I'm all cool. I walk across the parking lot. Boom, boom, boom — here comes Budd. We shot all that. Then I'm in my trailer and all of a sudden there's a knock at my door. It's Quentin. And he gives me some handwritten pages. He goes, “This is what we're gonna do today.” And it's the scene where f*cking Larry [Bishop] is telling me take off that f*cking hat. That “sh*t-kicker” f*cking hat. And, y'know, I'm not that good of an actor.


	See, when I take that hat off, I'm really Michael Madsen. I didn't wanna take my hat off. It had become an integral thing with me. And I didn't wanna do it. But I had to do it. 'Cause he wrote it. 'Cause he wrote a scene where I have to take it off. It was so demeaning. It was so demoralizing. And I took the f*cking thing off, and I watched that scene many, many times. And it's funny, 'cause, you know, it's a defining moment for Budd. Because for some reason it gives Budd pathos. It gives him… He suddenly becomes a man. He becomes a person with a conscience. And he becomes an interesting guy, and you go “Wow, man, Budd's not such a bad guy, is he? But the genius of him thinking to do that to him as an actor, that's insanity. I mean, that's George Stevens. That's John Ford. That's Hitchcock. That's a story that I've not told many times, but he knew, psychologically, that it was gonna come off that way on the screen. And I think it gave Budd a morality in the piece when not many other characters have that.

	











DEADLINE: Well, talking about morality, The Hateful Eight is a very interesting film in terms of morality. Everybody has a dark side.


MADSEN: Yeah, when I first read it, I wanted to be John Ruth. And I remember thinking, “Quentin, hey, no, I'm John Ruth, man. Who's this Joe Gage person? I don't wanna be the cowboy fellow, man. I wanna be John Ruth, man.” But then when I get to the part where he's f*cking throwing up blood on the floor, I go, “Oh well, maybe not…” [Laughs] And he, then I realize Joe Gage is probably the best role in the film.


DEADLINE: Why do you say that?


MADSEN: Well, because, first of all, he wrote it for me. And, you see, I was a big Steve McQueen fan. And I know that Steve, he didn't like to do explanation. He didn't wanna explain plot. He didn't wanna be the guy who says, “Well, see, the reason that buckboard's coming up the road is because… blah, blah, blah.” Steve's not gonna do that. He's just gonna be the guy that sits there. And you wonder what the f*ck is on that guy's mind, y'know? And I'm much better that way. I don't wanna have a lot to say. And so, Joe Gage, he's there through the whole goddamn story. But he doesn't really have a whole lot to say. And you don't really find out why he's even there until it rolls back and you find out who he's with and what they're doing. And that appeals to me greatly. I don't wanna be all over the place with ten different monologues. There's a lot of talking in that movie. I mean, Sam and Walt have a lot of dialogue, man. You know, I don't wanna be that guy. I'm happy to just sit there and when the time comes… When the guns come out, that's the fun part for me.


DEADLINE: It's interesting that your character writes a lot.


MADSEN: Well, I wrote four books. I've written four books of short stories and poems and things. Stories about my life when I was a little kid. And Quentin knows it. 'Cause I've given them to him. And it's funny, because every time I've ever given him a book, he's never went, “Oh, Michael, wow, your books are great.” He never said a f*cking word. But now here I am, Joe Gage, and he goes, “So you know why I made Joe do that?” I'm like, “No, I don't know why.” He goes, “Because you're a writer, Michael. So, I wrote that in the part for you.” See so it's like a personal compliment, that he allowed me to have my guy do that. Even though he's a f*cking butcher, let's face it.


So how has it the shoot been? First of all, what's it been like with the 70mm camera?


MADSEN: Well, I'm fascinated by it. I mean, I hate the digital sh*t. I hate the hi-def sh*t. The first time I heard somebody on The Hateful Eight set say, “Check the gate,” it was like I almost got a f*cking hard-on. I was like, “Oh my God, man.” My balls started to tingle. I was like, “Oh my God, check the gate. Check the gate. Check the gate.” It was such a wonderful thing to hear.


DEADLINE: When was the last time you'd heard that?


MADSEN: Probably been about eight or nine years maybe since I've heard that. Because it's all this stupid digital sh*t. And I don't like it at all. And it's like crucifying what a movie's supposed to be, a movie, man. And to be on the set, you know, to see that great big, f*cking Panavision mag box, man. You see that big machine, you know? It's like, wow, man, wow. Wow, we're making a movie here, you know? There's lenses that they're using that they last used on Ben-Hur for f*ck's sake. Did you know that?

	











DEADLINE: Yeah.


MADSEN: I mean, I'm sitting there the other day, I'm sitting in front of the camera and Bob Richardson is, like, the greatest. I mean, it's not just Quentin, you have Bob shooting you. There's a lot of anxiety that doesn't exist. 'Cause you know he's gonna get you. And you know he's gonna get you good, you know? And I was looking at him, and I had heard the thing about the Ben-Hur thing. And he's all casual, Bob, and he's just sitting there, doing his thing. And I said, “Is this one of the ones that they used on Ben-Hur?” And he goes, “Yeah. And I go, “Right.”


MADSEN: Y'know, who gets to do that? You know what I mean? Cinemascope, Super Cinerama, that's what created movies, y'know. And for Quentin to be the guy who's bringing that back is such a wonderful, amazing thing. And he wants everybody to be cold. He likes it that we're here in the cold. He wants us to actually be cold. And we f*cking are. You know what I'm saying? The elements are what they are. We're actually in the elements; we're not pretending to be cold. We are f*cking cold. You know what I'm saying? And who else is gonna get away with that except Quentin Tarantino? He told us, “You guys. Listen, you're gonna be cold. We're not putting any heaters in Minnie's, OK?” And everyone's like, “OK, Quentin.” But it is f*cking freezing in there.


DEADLINE: It looked quite warm in the dailies.


MADSEN: Well, you get used to it. But you don't have to act like you're cold just 'cause you are f*cking cold. Outside the windows they're blowing this fake snow, but they only do that when it's not really snowing, just to keep it going. But it takes me an hour to get dressed. 'Cause I got a lot of sh*t on. And by the time you get your f*cking pants on, and your gun, and your vest, and your sh*t, you start to actually realize how tough it would be, or how tough it was, to actually live in that day and time and to be one of those guys. Y'know, I said the other day, when we were sitting in the coach, “Can you imagine what it would be like to travel 50 miles in this f*cking thing? It's no wonder everybody's killing each other.” I mean, no wonder they were all killing each other. You realize what a tough, hard life it really must have been. And I think Quentin's into the realism of it — I mean, he wants it to really happen more so than just to pretend it's happening. And he's been that way since Reservoir Dogs.


DEADLINE: Well, this script reminded me a lot of Reservoir Dogs…


MADSEN: I think, in a really weird way, it's an homage to Reservoir Dogs. First of all, Tim and I are in it. I'm Mr. Blonde and he's f*cking Mr. Orange, y'know? There's a lot of bloodshed. It's like a weird spaghetti western version of Reservoir Dogs. Zoe Bell was Uma's stunt double in Kill Bill. There's a scene in Kill Bill when Budd's in his trailer, and The Bride's creeping around outside. She's got her sword; she flings open the door and she's gonna come in and get me. I'm standing there with a shotgun — BLAM! — and I shoot her. That was Zoe Bell who took the ratchet and went up into the air. And now she's in the f*cking Hateful Eight playing Six-Horse Judy. And I'm gonna shoot her again. So, you see, there's this weird continuity. Quentin has this insanely wonderful way of making sure everything is connected to something else.


	Y'know, he's seen films of mine that I've never even seen myself. And he knows dialogue that I've said that I don't even remember saying. He'll bring it up out of nowhere in the middle of the day sometimes: “'Member that time, 'member when you said that one line?” I'm like, “You saw that?” “Oh yeah, I did, yeah.” Like, how the f*ck…? I did a TV series called Vengeance Unlimited. And he's seen every episode. He's even put in lines that he's heard me say in some other obscure f*cking thing. 'Cause he loves it.  

	











DEADLINE: Going back to Reservoir Dogs — how did you get involved with that?


MADSEN: See, I don't really know. I did a movie called Kill Me Again with Val Kilmer. And there's a scene in the movie where I have a guy tied up in a chair. And I'm hitting him with a baseball bat, then I go around behind him, and I cut his throat in slow motion and his chair falls over. I have a memory of him telling me that he saw that, and that that's why he considered me for Mr. Blonde. But then a couple years later, I went on a talk show, and someone was asking me how I got Mr. Blonde. I told that story — I said, “Well, Quentin saw me in this thing, Kill Me Again.” And then when I saw Quentin at his house, he goes, “Why the f*ck did you say that?” I go, “Well, you told me that.” He goes, “No, I didn't. That's not why I cast you in the film. I never even saw that f*cking movie.”


	So, I don't know. But I know that I was at an agency, one of the bigger agencies, and they sent me the script. I read it and I thought it was really incredible. I said, “Hey, man, I really love this.” I had done Thelma and Louise with Harvey Keitel. All of my scenes with Harvey, unfortunately, were cut out of the movie. Not all of them, but me and Harvey had done a few scenes together that were not in the film, whether for plot reason or timing or whatever. But I was really sad that it was cut out, because I love Harvey. He's Godfather to my son Max. But when I heard that Harvey was gonna play Mr. White, I was like, “Oh my God, I have to do this.” And my agents, believe it or not, they were like, “You know, nobody knows this guy, Quentin. He's got no money. Nobody's gonna get paid. You might wanna take a pass.” And I was like, “No. Not only am I not gonna take a pass, I'm gonna fire you f*ckers. So, f*ck you, OK? 'Cause Harvey Keitel is Mr. White. And I'm gonna go shoot with Harvey Keitel.” But I wanted to play Mr. Pink.


DEADLINE: Really? Why was that?


MADSEN: Because Mr. Pink had so many more scenes with Harvey. More interaction. And I so very much wanted to have that with Harvey. I hadn't even met Quentin at this point. One of the producers called me up and he goes, “Hey, man, what the f*ck is wrong with you?” I'm like, “What do you mean?” They go, “You have this role, Mr. Blonde. We're offering you this role. What is your problem?” And I go, “Well, you know, I kind of wanna play Mr. Pink. And they were like, “Oh my God. No, man, you're not playing Mr. Pink. And I pushed it. In my naiveté! And finally they called me, they said, “OK. Quentin's at 20th Century Fox. Harvey Keitel's in town. They'll meet you in the bungalow in the back of Fox lot. And Quentin says that you can come in and you can read for Mr. Pink.” So, I actually went in, and I auditioned for Mr. Pink. Even though Mr. Blonde was on the table.


	I went in there and that was the first time I met Quentin. He was standing there. Harvey was sitting there. I remember Harvey had bare feet for some reason. I don't know why. I remember that. But Harvey was sitting there, and he was like, “Hey, Mike.” And I go, “Hey, man.” We hugged each other, 'cause we hadn't seen each other since Thelma and Louise. And Quentin's like, “OK, let's see what you got. Go ahead.” I had memorized all of Mr. Pink's stuff, right? And I was like, “Yeah, OK, watch this sh*t.” Harvey did it with me, and I thought I was really getting there. I thought I really got it. At the end, Quentin looks at me and he goes, “Nope, you're not Mr. Pink.” And I go, “Oh man. Oh man. Oh f*ck.” And then he goes, “I already have Mr. Pink.” I go, “Who is it?” He goes, “Well, it's an actor in New York I met, his name is Steve Buscemi.” And I said, “Who the f*ck is Steve Buscemi?” He goes, “Well, nobody knows him now, but they will. And he's gonna be Mr. Pink.” And then he goes, “Here's the thing, you're not Mr. Pink, you're Mr. Blonde. And if you're not Mr. Blonde, you're not in the movie.”

	











DEADLINE: So, you took that surprise well!


MADSEN: Reluctantly, I took the role, which ended up, like, changing my life. I mean, it literally gave me a career in motion pictures. It really did. I mean, I've done some 160 films. And the only ones that anybody ever wants to talk about are the ones that I made with Quentin. Especially Dogs.


DEADLINE: It's been said that you were quite uncomfortable with the violence in that film.


MADSEN: No, it wasn't that I was uncomfortable with it, it was I didn't really understand what the big deal was. 'Cause I didn't really see it as being so violent. I didn't really understand what the big to-do was.


 DEADLINE: And it's been said that you had trouble getting into character.


MADSEN: Oh no, there was only one part where… [Pauses] See, Quentin allows me to improv. And he doesn't do that with everybody. Really. He really doesn't. For some reason he lets me do stuff that isn't scripted. And if he doesn't like it, he'll say, “Michael, no, you're not gonna do that.” But there are things that I've done in Kill Bill and in Dogs [that he kept]. Like when I was speaking in the [severed] ear. That was not in the script. I did that on the spur of the moment, because I was nervous. I cut the ear off, and I walked into frame with it, and I honestly didn't know what to do. Quentin was off-camera, and he was going, “Throw it. Toss it. Toss it. Throw it. Michael, throw it.” And I just didn't really wanna throw it. I'd just cut this f*cking guy's ear off. You know, why have I done this horrible thing? So, I started talking in the ear. And then I threw it.


	Three days later, Quentin comes up to me and he goes, “Ah, remember when you were talking to the ear?” I go, “Yeah.” And he goes, “We're gonna keep it in the movie.” So, y'know, he's smart that way. But when we were rehearsing the scene with Kirk Baltz [who plays the policeman], Kirk started going off on one, saying, “Don't burn me, I'm a father, I have children, oh God, I have little children, don't burn me up…” I said, “Y'know, Quentin, I've played villains and I'll be a bad guy, but I gotta draw the line somewhere. I'm not gonna kill any children. I'm not gonna kill any women. That ain't my thing, man. And if he's gonna say that, if he's gonna start talking about being a father and having kids, there is no f*cking way that I'm gonna drop that Zippo. I'm not gonna light him on fire. As a man. As an actor. Even as Mr. f*cking Blonde. Somewhere, the man has to have a conscience of some kind. And if he says that, man, I'm not gonna f*cking burn him up.” Then Quentin goes, “Well, actually, you don't anyway, because Tim shoots you. And I go, “OK, that's true.”  


DEADLINE: So, you didn't end up having to play it…


MADSEN: I didn't have to do it. For me, it was like a James Cagney thing. Because if you watch Angels with Dirty Faces, Jimmy Cagney, he plays Rocky Sullivan, and the Bowery Boys are in it. He's a gangster and he's, like, the big hero to all the juvenile delinquent kids. And at the end of the movie, he goes to the electric chair. Pat O'Brien comes to him and says, “Rocky, listen, I want you to turn chicken. I want you to be yellow. I want you to be scared when they throw the switch. Be scared. You know, do it for the boys. 'Cause they think you're supercool and they're gonna grow up like you. Don't do it. Go out like a f*cking rat.” And he goes, “Ah, f*ck you, Father,” and he punches the guard. “F*ck you, man!”

	











	They put him in the chair and there's this wonderful, wonderful shot where you don't see him, but there's a shadow on the wall. And all of a sudden, man, you realize it's about to happen. All of a sudden, Cagney starts this mournful sound: “I don't wanna die. Please don't kill me.” It's so incredible. Oh my God. And then it leaves you with that question in your mind — was he really afraid to die? Or did he do that for the boys, 'cause he knew what he was, and he didn't want them to grow up and face that same fate? Now, I had read Cagney's biography, and in his biography the person writing it, the ghostwriter, whatever that is, asked him what did. He asked, “Did your character do that for the boys or was he f*cking scared to die?” And Cagney goes, “That's a question that I will never answer.” And it's the same for me, with Dogs. You can hear Kirk faintly say something about having children and being a father. And then I get shot. So, for me, it's like, “OK, when Mr. Blond heard that, would he have set the cop on fire? Would I set him on fire?” That was my little Cagney moment. I got that from Quentin, see. The beauty of that kind of unanswerable question.


DEADLINE: He's very fond of that.


MADSEN: Huh?


DEADLINE: The suitcase in Pulp Fiction, for instance.


MADSEN: Oh, of course. He wrote Vincent for me. I was supposed to do Pulp Fiction. But what happened is. Promise me that you'll write this, just for the f*cking record, man.


DEADLINE: OK.


MADSEN: You know what, I was shooting a movie called The Getaway. I had four days off during that movie. I really wanted to see my son, Christian. And it was Father's Day. I wanted to go to LA, and I wanted to see my son for Father's Day. I left Phoenix, Arizona, I went to LA, I saw my son. Had a wonderful, nice afternoon. It was a great, wonderful Father Day. And my agent said, “Oh, you're in LA.” I go, “Yeah, man. And he goes Larry Kasdan wants to see you.” And I said, “For what?” And he goes, “He's making Wyatt Earp.” And I go, “Wow. Well, f*ck, man, I wanna be Doc Holliday.” Man, I wanted to be Doc Holliday. Because of Kirk Douglas. Kirk Douglas in Gunfight at the OK Corral is the greatest f*cking Doc Holliday that anybody's ever played and nobody will ever do it any better. Part of me was like, “Come on, man. You can't touch it.” But I wanted to do it. I wanted to try it. That was my boyhood dream — to be Doc Holliday, man. I thought, man, “I can smoke this f*cker, man. I'll be so good. I know what to do.” So, I went to see Larry. I sat in his office, and I said, “Hey, man, I said, I gotta go back to Arizona, I'm shooting this f*cking movie called The Getaway. And, you know, I wanna play Doc Holliday.


	He started laughing, and he leans forward, he goes, “Now, well, Michael, I already have another actor to be Doc Holliday, and y'know, it's not gonna happen.” I go, “Well who is it?” He goes, “Oh it's Dennis Quaid.” I started to get up and he goes, “How about Virgil? What do you think about Virgil?” Then I realized, well, Virgil, he walks down the OK Corral, doesn't he? So, in my mind I'm thinking, wow, man, I am gonna walk down the OK Corral. I'm gonna repeat Western history, man. I did Reservoir Dogs, and I did The Getaway and I'm playing all these savages. Now I'm gonna be Virgil Earp, man. And I'm gonna walk down the OK f*cking Corral. And I said, “Yeah, Larry, absolutely I'll do it.” Right then and there I said, yes, I'd do it.

	











	The next day, I was at CAA. They wrote up my contracts and signed me up to play Virgil Earp in Wyatt Earp. I went back to Arizona; I finished The Getaway. I went to New York to do publicity for The Getaway. And Quentin rang me up and asked me if I'd read a script. I was at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan, and the f*cking script was at the concierge. I read it and I thought, Holy sh*t, y'know? It was pretty goddamn good. So, I called my agent, and I said, “Hey, man, I got this thing from Quentin.” And he said, “Well, you might as well forget it.” I was like, “Well, why is that?” “'Cause you're doing Wyatt Earp.” I couldn't get out of it. Larry wanted two and a half weeks of rehearsal before shooting the movie. Which in my mind was a complete and total waste of time. And if they would have let me out of the rehearsal time, I could have done both movies. But he wouldn't do it. Larry wouldn't do it.


	Y'know, if Wyatt Earp had turned out to be some big Academy Award-winning movie, I would have been genius, right, 'cause I didn't do the gangster picture. But then again, if I had done it, whatever would have happened to John Travolta? 'Cause he was doing movies about babies talking. He was over. You know what I'm saying? So, you know, I just had this conversation with Quentin in Cannes last year. We were driving in a car, me and him. And he was saying, “What if you had been Vincent?” And I go, “Well, y'know, I thought about it a lot of times.” He goes, “Michael, the thing is it would have been a different movie.” I said, “It would. But Quentin, honestly — would it have been the big thing that it was without Travolta?” Wasn't that part of the whole thing, that John came out of obscurity? He had the long hair. It was this huge thing. And honestly people started taking a much bigger look at Reservoir Dogs because of Pulp Fiction. So, originally, it was Larry Fishburne and me. Larry Fishburne turned it down. And that's when he went to [Travolta and] Sam [Jackson]. But I couldn't do it because I was under contract for Wyatt Earp. And all these years, man, it's this thing. This lingering thing. No, man, I didn't turn it down. And if I had done it, it would have been a different thing. I wouldn't have played it that way. I wouldn't have done it like that. It would have been a different thing. And it would have been a different movie.


DEADLINE: It's interesting, it looks like an even more different film now because neither Travolta nor Bruce Willis are as famous as they were back then. It looks even more like a character piece.


MADSEN: Yeah. I saw it on the beach in Cannes at an outdoor screening.


DEADLINE: I was there; I saw it.


MADSEN: OK, I mean, it was pretty mind-boggling. And frame by frame… I can't help it. Quentin told me the same thing, he goes, “I've always imagined you in all those scenes.” And I watch the movie and I kind of I realize what I would have done that would have been a bit different. I think it would have been a little more edgy.


DEADLINE: Travolta plays him as quite dopey…


MADSEN: Yeah, yeah. I had never met John until Cannes of last year. I was at an outside cocktail thing. I walked in and I was looking around and someone said, “Oh, hey, Quentin's over there.” So, I walked around the corner and there's Quentin, but he's sitting with John. And I had never met John before. It was so awkward. I was like, “Oh f*ck, man.” But I wasn't gonna stop and turn around. So, I went right up to the table. And John stood up. He stood up, and as I walked over, he hugged me. It was such an odd moment. It was very strange. You know, it had become a turning point in both of our lives. It was so bizarre. 'Cause Quentin, for years, has been threatening to make this movie called The Vega Brothers with me and John. In fact, I asked him the other day, “I go, Quentin, let me just ask you flat out, are we ever going to really make The Vega Brothers?” And he goes, “Well, not unless someone invents a time machine. But I definitely wanna do something with you guys. There's something about you two guys together that I noticed that day when you met. There's something there. And it's in my brain.” I went, “Well, OK.”

	











DEADLINE: You started out with Quentin when nobody knew who he was. Is he more confident now, or has he always been confident?


MADSEN: He's exactly the same as he was in Reservoir Dogs, he just has a lot bigger toys. He's got a much bigger stage to play on. But he's exactly the same. His energy to me is amazing. He's so excited, and he loves making movies. It's so good to be around that kind of energy. If you work on a film, usually you go in and you're kind of like, “Well, y'know, man, I don't know — this thing might not be so good.” But when you're working with Quentin you already know that it's gonna be good. All the anxiety is gone. 'Cause you know it's gonna be something: this is probably gonna be good. And it's because of him. Y'know, he has this boyish masculinity. He loves what he does, man. He loves every minute of it. And he laughs at his own material. Which makes me laugh, 'cause he's laughing at something that he actually wrote.


	To me that's really funny. It's like we crack up together a lot. He has this crazy kind of drive to really make things real and make it work. And he's the only guy who's successfully been able to join together horrendous violence with a strange, strange undertone of humor. Everybody's been trying to copy him for 20 f*cking years, and nobody can do it. They can't get there. They'll never be able to do it. If you watch television, any day you watch TV, they'll be some people walking in slow motion in a f*cking toothpaste commercial. Or they'll use some jingle from Kill Bill or some sports thing or something. His movies have been injected into the human psyche. And people think they can copy it, y'know. And they can't for some reason. You know, Sally Menke, who unfortunately died?


DEADLINE: I met Sally, yes.


MADSEN: Well, you know, it's a cause of big sadness in my life that I never really got to know Sally that well. Back in the day, I was a pretty… I was kind of… I was… I don't know what the word for it is, but I was…


DEADLINE: Exacting?


MADSEN: Huh?


DEADLINE: Exacting? Demanding?


MADSEN: No, I was just… I was very impatient. I got it from my dad. I was an impatient cat. And I just didn't really have a lot of time for anything. And I just was incredibly cynical. And I never really got to know Sally. But she was Quentin's goddess of editing. I mean, the two of them together were such a force. They knew how to cut me. I remember her saying to me once, “Michael, you have all kind of things that you do. When we watch your stuff, we try to grab certain things that you do and put them in there.” And because she had known me, over time, she was probably responsible for getting certain things. I was so sad when she I heard that she passed away. That's just blew me down. It was so f*cking sad. I know for Quentin, it must have been really sad too 'cause he lost one of his key players. And everybody was like, whoa, what's gonna happen to Quentin? But obviously he's persevering.


DEADLINE: Yeah.


MADSEN: He's got Bob [Richardson] now. You know, Andrzej Sekula did Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. But now he's with Bob and, between the two of them, they have five Academy Awards. Holy sh*t, man. That's pretty good. Maybe I'll get one of those. I think it's time for me to get a little trophy.


DEADLINE: Quentin likes to have an adventure with his productions. He went to Santa Barbara for Death Proof, Germany for Inglourious Basterds, Japan for Kill Bill. You didn't travel to Japan, did you?












MADSEN: I was gonna go to Beijing 'cause I was gonna play Mister Barrel. But he swapped me out for Budd, so I didn't end up going.


But even so, you're in a very deserted setting. Where does Budd live?


MADSEN: In Barstow.


DEADLINE: Yeah. It's away from the city, is what I'm saying.


MADSEN: Yeah, the desert. Yeah.


DEADLINE: Yeah. I just wonder if that's interesting for you as an actor…


MADSEN: Oh yeah, it's a part of the whole adventure. I mean, look at this, man. I'm from Chicago. I'm a f*cking blue-collar kid from Chicago. I was an auto mechanic, man, y'know? I mean, what the f*ck am I doing in Telluride? Y'know, with ski people, Making a movie. It's part of the whole thing. It's tremendous, and he knows it. Quentin does this stuff on purpose. He knows that the environment creates a reality. Like, I'm Joe Gage, all right? And when I go on the set, let's just say that I would have a drawer. If I open that f*cking drawer, there's gonna be stuff in there that Joe Gage would have. That you may never, ever see on screen. It might never be in the movie. But it's there. It's there 'cause Quentin put it there. 'Cause he wanted it to be there. He creates this when we were doing wardrobe — when you go in for your fitting, he has mannequins with the other characters' wardrobe on. So, when I'm getting dressed in my sh*t, I'm in the room with my gang. With the outlaws. They're right there with me. On mannequins, but they're there, you know what I'm saying?


	It's crazy. It's insanity. But how wonderful it is, right? He had this little doll called Johnny West. Or at least I think he was called Johnny West. That's a plastic doll that he had called Johnny West. And goddamn it, he was like, “This is Michael Madsen.” He gave it to wardrobe, saying, “This is Michael Madsen. And they made my clothes exactly like this f*cking doll.


DEADLINE: What sort of doll was it?


MADSEN: Like, a GI Joe-size cowboy character. Did you know that in his house he actually has the video store that he worked in? He bought the entire contents of the store. The inventory, the shelves, the f*cking calendar, the f*cking cash register. And he put it in a room in his house. So, when you go in his f*cking house, he'll take you right upstairs, you go in it and you're in the video store that he worked in. 'Cause he bought all the sh*t. He has all the VHSes and the f*cking Beta tapes… Oh my God. He has the bar from Kill Bill. Remember the bar where Gogo stabs that guy in the belly?


DEADLINE: Yeah.


MADSEN: OK. He has that bar in the basement of his house. He had it dismantled and shipped from f*cking China to his house. And rebuilt it down in his f*cking basement. I mean, he has a game room where he has all games and lunchboxes. All this crazy memorabilia from Kung Fu and from The Rifleman and from Bonanza and just the most obscure sh*t you ever imagined. Whoever even knew they made a board game for some of these shows, y'know? And my character is this incredible combination of characters like The Virginian. We talked about The Virginian. And I brought up Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster. I wanted my hat to be like Burt Lancaster's hat in Vera Cruz, and that's exactly the f*cking hat that I have. I really liked The Virginian, 'cause he always had that super-cool black vest. And also Nick Barkley, who was played by Peter Breck in The Big Valley. I wanted to do some Nick Barkley. I wanted to do some Virginian. I wanted to do some Burt Lancaster — these are the characters that were put together for Michael Madsen to be Joe Gage.

	











	Who else does that? I mean, what a wonderful thing, to have all that going for you. You know, to be in a cowboy movie, paying homage to the guys that you watched — the guys that were in your memory as characters. And even the character's name. My other character name [in The Hateful Eight] besides Joe Gage is Grouch Douglas. Quentin knows I love Kirk [Douglas], right? I said, “You named me f*cking Grouch Douglas because you know I like Kirk, don't you?” He said, “Oh yeah, of course.” So, you know, I even got that. It's a wonderful thing, man. It's a gift that you get. My little son is here [in Telluride]. My wife and my son are here, and I feel like the hand of God is like on my shoulder, y'know? Like, “I gotcha, Mike,” you know what I mean?


DEADLINE: Is it true you started in theater?


MADSEN: Huh?


DEADLINE: You started with theatre, didn't you?


MADSEN: Well, you know, that whole thing kind of got blown out of proportion. I mean, I did maybe about two months with Steppenwolf in Chicago. I did some scene-study classes. But that's all.


DEADLINE: So it wasn't a big deal?


MADSEN: Nah, it wasn't what it was made out to be on the internet. There's so much bullsh*t on the internet. It's all bullsh*t. Everything they say about me on there is all a crock of f*cking bullsh*t. I went there for about two months. I was very, very impatient. I wanted to get on with sh*t, OK? I wanted to go to New York. I went to New York, and I met Sergio Leone. Like, Sergio Leone walked around his house in a robe with a giant pot of pasta. Eating it out of the pot with a fork. Speaking in Italian. Telling me I should be an actor — I should be an actor. He told me that I reminded him of Henry Fonda. I mean, what a compliment from him, right? He wanted to put me in a movie.


	I stayed at his house in his brownstone, and he lived right next door to Katharine Hepburn. One day he calls me upstairs. I go upstairs. He looks over the edge, and I look over the edge. He didn't speak a lot of English, so he had an interpreter named Brian. Brian would tell me what he said. I look over and I see this old woman with this big hat, and she's gardening. And he goes, “Hepburn, Hepburn, Hepburn.” I looked at Brian and he goes, “Yeah, man, that's her. That's Katharine Hepburn.” He lived right next door to Katharine Hepburn. F*cking living in New York, right? It was so amazing. I go, “What is she doing?” And in Italian he said, “Oh, she's picking up sticks.” And she was — she was picking up all these tiny little twigs out of the garden, for some reason. And he told me, “Michael, you should be an actor.” In Italian. I was a very young man. I didn't know what the f*ck I was doing. I was fixing cars at Joe Jacobs' Chevrolet [in Illinois].


DEADLINE: So how did you meet Leone?


MADSEN: Well, this really weird thing happened. It was my sister Virginia, who, y'know, got nominated for f*cking Sideways.


DEADLINE: Oh yeah.


MADSEN: She had an agent, 'cause she was doing singing telegrams. And she was doing theater. I had went with a buddy of mine, I was going to school to be a paramedic, 'cause I thought maybe I would make more money than fixing cars. My father was a firefighter, and my dad really wanted me to be a cop or a firefighter. So, I figured I'd be a paramedic. Y'know, I thought it'd be cool riding in an ambulance and saving people — that kind of thing. But this kid that I went to school with was an actor. His name is Chip. And he asked me to go with him to this audition, 'cause we used to ride the train together to go to school. So, I said, “OK, man.” I went with him to this thing. And there was like 50 guys in this big auditorium. There were people from LA.

	











	They were casting a movie called WarGames. I watched these guys go down one by one and they'd sit down at the table, and they'd read. Then, 10 seconds later, the people doing the auditions are like, “That's great. See you later.” And these guys would walk out all sad. Chip went down there, he said two words, and they were like, “Thank you very much. Thank you.” I thought it was so funny. When he'd finished, I got up to go, 'cause we were leaving together. We're walking out the door. And this guy was sitting there ± Marty Brest is who it was. Who later did Scent of a Woman and all this other stuff. He was sitting there, and he goes, “Hey, where are you going?” In front of all these people. And I go, “We're leaving.” And he goes, “Why?” I said, “What do you mean, why?” He goes, “Why didn't you read?” And I go, man, I didn't come here for that, man. And he goes, “Are you an actor?” And I go, “No, man.” He goes, “Oh, is this your buddy?” I go, “Yeah, man. And he goes, “Do you wanna read?” I go, “Well I don't know. Not really. I'm sure I'm not gonna sit down at that f*cking table, I'll tell you that.” And he goes, “Well, we'll do it over here. Let's go over here and do it over here away from everybody.” And I was like, “Wow, OK.”


	Meanwhile Chip wants to kill me. Y'know, I know now why, but I didn't understand why he was mad then. He was like, “You f*cking asshole. You're gonna do it, aren't you?” And I go, “Well yeah, man.” So, I went over, we set these metal chairs, and we sat down, and he gave me two pages to read. He goes, “OK, I'm this guy and you're that guy.” And I read it with him. He says, you know, “Have you ever thought about being an actor?” And I said, “No, man. I mean, I like Humphrey Bogart and I really like Robert Mitchum, and I get what they're doing. I understand it.” He goes, “You know, if you went to LA or New York, you would get work as an actor.” I said, “You think so?” And he goes, “Yeah.” I said, “Well, buddy, you know what, man? I got about $400 to my name, so the chances of that happening are f*cking non-existent, OK? It ain't gonna happen.” He goes, “You know what an agent is?” I go, “Yeah, yeah, my sister has an agent.” He goes “Oh what's her name? And I told him. He goes, “I know her.” I go, “Oh you do?” He goes, “Oh yeah.” And he goes, “So if I wanted to reach you, I could reach you through her?” I went, “Yeah, sure.” 


	And, like, a week later, my sister comes in the house — my sister who had been doing theater all through high school, and singing telegrams, and having voice lessons, with Marilyn Monroe posters in her room, while there's me stealing cars and, y'know, just doin' bad stuff. She comes in the house, and she goes, “Did you meet some people from LA?” And I go yeah. And she goes, “Well my agent wants to talk to you.”


	I was like, “Really?” She goes, “Yeah.” So, I took the f*cking train down there. I went in her office, and she goes, “You know these people from California, they wanna give you a part in a movie?” And I said, “What, are you insane?” She goes, “No, no. It's a small scene that takes place in the beginning of the film. You're a soldier in a missile silo. You and your buddy have to simultaneously turn keys to launch a ballistic missile. And your partner chickens out and he can't do it.” John Spencer was the other actor. She goes, “Do you wanna do it?” I go, “F*ck. In front of a camera? Oh my God. Oh, my sh*t, man.” She goes. “They'll fly you to LA, they'll put you up in a hotel, and they're gonna give you $900. And I was like, “Holy f*ck, man. Holy sh*t, man.” Then she goes, “But there's one thing they want you to do.” I go, “Oh my God, what's that?” And she had one of those f*cking camcorders. Remember those goddamn things where you put the VHS tape in it, right?

	











DEADLINE: Yeah.


MADSEN: And she gets it out and she puts it on the table. She points it at me, and she goes, “Just tell a story.” I go, “Tell a story about what?” And she goes, “Michael, I don't know. Just make something up. I don't care. I'm gonna start it and I want you to just talk.”


DEADLINE: What did you do?


MADSEN: About a week before that, I had been in this little diner. And this guy sitting next to me was being a real asshole to the waitress. Just being a dick, man. I just let it go on for a while, while I was eating, but I was getting angry. She was kind of cute, y'know. So finally, I took the mustard pot and I went [he makes a whooshing sound] I shot it right in his face. And I told the story of doing that. And she sent that f*cking tape to Cis Corman who was Sergio Leone's casting director. I don't know why she did that or why that happened, you know. But shortly thereafter, they flew me to New York.


	They f*cking put me on a plane and… I'd never been out of Chicago. I went to New York City. Sergio Leone wanted to meet me. And I stayed at his goddamn house, man. He told me he wanted to put me in film. And then, unfortunately, he died. And then I went to California and did this stupid f*cking thing — WarGames. I didn't wanna go back to Chicago. No f*cking way. So, I got a newspaper, and I looked in the want ads in the newspaper, 'cause I knew that I could get a job at a gas station anywhere on the planet Earth. And there was a full-service gas station attendant needed in Beverly Hills. At the Union 76. At Crescent Drive and little Santa Monica Boulevard. And the second day I was in California, I f*cking went there and I applied for the job, and I got hired. I went to MGM Studios, and I shot WarGames. They still had the big neon lion up on top, y'know, with the big numbers on the soundstages. And the first time I… [Madsen chokes up.]


DEADLINE: Are you OK?


MADSEN: Yeah, no, I'm fine. It was raining. It was raining the first day I got there. I'll never forget it. I had to take a taxi. And I got out of the cab, and it was raining so hard. I couldn't believe it was happening.  


DEADLINE: So, you kind of caught the tail end of old Hollywood…


MADSEN: Oh sure, Schwab's was still there. Schwab's was at the corner of Laurel Canyon and Sunset. I used to go in Schwab's every day and have lunch in there. I went to Bartels' Harley-Davidson when they were on Washington Boulevard, and I got my first motorcycle. I got my first Harley, my '74 Sportster. And I had a job at the gas station. So, by the time I got done with WarGames, I made enough money on that thing to rent a little apartment. I had an apartment up by Griffith Park up on Western and Franklin. I had my f*cking motorbike, and I would drive every day to Beverly Hills to go pumping gas. I drove a tow truck. And I changed flat tires.


DEADLINE: Did you pursue movies at the same time?


MADSEN: Well, I didn't know what to do. See, a lot of people used to come in there. Warren Beatty would come in there. Jack Lemmon would come in there. Jack Lemmon would roll up in his f*cking MG and I'd give him gas in his f*cking car. Warren Beatty would come in really late at night and he would always use the payphone inside. Nobody had cell phones back then, so he'd go in and he'd put change in the f*cking phone, and he'd be on the phone. He'd come back out and he'd stare at me, you know. And he asked me one time, “Are you an actor?” And I go, “Yeah, well I've done a little,” and he goes, “Really?” And I go, “Oh yeah.” He goes, “Do you have any headshots?” And I go, “Nah, I don't.” And he goes, “Well you should, you gotta get some of those.” I go, “OK, man.” And he goes, “You know, if you ever do that, send one over to my office.” I go, “OK, Warren Beatty, where is your goddamn office? “And he goes, “Oh, it's at Paramount…”

	











	Don Knotts used to come in there. Cicely Tyson would come in there. Peter Falk would come in there. All these people I had seen in movies my whole life would come in there; I'm pumping gas in their f*cking cars. I was wiping their goddamn f*cking windshields, you know? There was one particular girl — we became fond of each other. And she would come in and, y'know, she usually had a little short skirt on. I was happy to wash that window! I started staying at her house now and again, and she introduced me to an agent. And it was Andy Friedman, with the Smith and Friedman Agency, and they started submitting me for episodic television. I did St. Elsewhere, I did Miami Vice and Tour of Duty, Jake and the Fatman. And Cagney and Lacey. The episode of Cagney and Lacey I did, Tyne Daly won an Emmy for. Didn't even mention my name when she got her Emmy. And I was so… I remember feeling so kind of like… Wow. It wasn't about the ego or the fame, I just thought, “Wow.” The whole episode was about me and her. And she won an Emmy for the f*cking thing, and she didn't even say anything about me. And that was my first realization about Hollywood, right? The insidiousness of the whole f*cking thing.


DEADLINE: But you seemed to get through it…


MADSEN: Well, I kept pumping gas. I remember when I got Thelma and Louise. I told my boss, I go, “Hey, man, look I got this movie and I'm gonna go do it.” And he goes, “Y'know, why didn't you tell us you were an actor when we hired you? Goddamn it.” I was like, “Well I didn't really think I was, man.” And he goes, “We need you around here, Michael. Make up your f*cking mind. The chances of you making it any further are a billion to one. You got these stupid TV shows you keep taking time off to do and now you're gonna go and do a f*cking movie, is that it?” I was like, “Yeah.” And he goes, “Well goddamn it, you're fired.” I was like, “Oh man. You give me two dollars and 50 cents an hour and I got my little motorbike over there. And I live up on Western and Franklin. I think I'll take my shot. I'll take my chance, right?”


DEADLINE: So, what keeps you in the business?


MADSEN: LA is a festering wound. It's a festering wound that has gangrene. Y'know, LA is all about crucifying. Building people up and then crucifying them. They find out something negative about you and they fry you on the f*cking griddle, man. And they love it, y'know. But I don't give a sh*t, 'cause I've always stayed employed and I've always kept working. I have five sons. I've been married three times. I could have done without that, but my wife and my sons are everything to me, and I've been able to give them a great life because of what I do. I've been all over the f*cking world. Who gets to go all around the world? Who gets to do that? Just some dumbass, f*cking juvenile delinquent from Chicago. I've been everywhere. I've been all over the f*cking planet making movies. Rumors of my demise are greatly exaggerated.


DEADLINE: Do you have any regrets?


MADSEN: I don't regret not doing Pulp Fiction. But I do regret making Wyatt Earp. Because I can't say anything nice about Wyatt Earp, y'know? It's boring. It's long. It's stupid and boring. It's a giant close-up of Kevin for three f*cking hours. I remember I got the quote of the day one time. I got the quote of the day on the call sheet: “There's a rumor that Wyatt had some brothers.” Y'know, I wish I could say something good about it, because the only f*cking reason I did it is ‘cause I wanted to walk down that goddamn street to the OK Corral. If I had known how long it was gonna take to walk down there, man… We did it, like, 10 times. And if I knew that the movie was gonna be that f*cking boring and stupid, I would rather have rode the horses down there — taken a f*cking taxicab or something else.

	











	But no, Quentin's pictures are… there's something very individualistic about each one of them, everyone that he's done. I happen to feel like I've been in the best of his work. I've been very lucky to be in the best ones that he's made. Kill Bill is ridiculously great. It's better than anybody even gives it credit for. Django — I wanted to play Calvin in Django. I wanted Leo DiCaprio's part. To me that would have been the greatest part in the film. Obviously, that didn't happen. But, you know, Dogs was his first shot, man, and to be in that was a pretty goddamn, pretty cool thing, and over time it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. And now in The Hateful Eight, I've really come full circle with him. Richard Gladstein was the producer of Reservoir Dogs and Quentin got him back for Hateful Eight. Now that's pretty cool, right. I mean, it's a nice, nice package. It's a wonderful blessing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Murderbot proves that it really shouldn't try to be an action thriller","https://www.avclub.com/murderbot-recap-season-1-episode-9-all-systems-red","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

I suppose I should feel grateful that Murderbot's struggle to keep its characters acting as smart as they're supposed to be applies to its bad guys, too. It simply wouldn't be fair were the GrayCris mercenaries trying to kill the hapless Preservation Alliance not also given to being implausibly, almost idiotically easy to fool when, say, their opponents' surprisingly durable SecUnit walks up to them in the middle of a clandestine meeting, declares itself a rogue agent looking to make a deal for itself, and then rattles off a mixture of hard-ass one-liners and inane small talk to very obviously keep them off their game. If our heroes are going to be inconsistently savvy, it's only fair for the baddies to suffer from it, too.

Which is all to say that “All Systems Red,” the penultimate episode of Murderbot's first season, isn't necessarily going to go down as one of the show's more thoughtful or heartfelt installments. That's partly because a decent chunk of its early attempts at drama hinge on believing our favorite construct might actually be trying to sell out the PresAux team to save its own synthetic skin, an idea so implausible that the episode itself seems to be mildly embarrassed by it, rushing to get it disposed of instead of fully embracing the paranoia. (There's a meatier moment when Gurathin and then Mensah realize that MB is actually hiding its true plans because they involve killing the entire bad-guy team, running in strong contravention to Preservation Alliance's principles, but it mostly gets shoved into the background.) But just as much, it's because so much of what goes on here is just kind of melodramatic and goofy: Murderbot dopily improvising its way through a plan while the GrayCris folks just go “Huh, weird,” various heroic sacrifices being planned with what's clearly going to be very little payoff, and a moment that had me genuinely rolling my eyes when the script decided the original plan needed to be taken down by a giant Flintstones bird.

The pleasures here are all going to be smaller scale then, in little moments like Gurathin and Bharadwaj cottoning on to what MB is actually doing, Mensah's wry little smile when the GrayCris leader asks what the leader of a whole planet is doing on this backwater shithole, or, of course, much of what we get from Alexander Skarsgård—at least when he's not being forced to spackle over an overstuffed plot with line after line of creaky exposition. When not rattling off “We all get that this is what we're doing right now, right?” dialogue, though, Skarsgård does his usual excellent job of holding this show's various tones together, selling Murderbot's desperation, its smug and dickish side (“I notice you have an issue with eye contact”), and even its doofy attempts at small talk with the hired killers it's trying to con. Even in an episode that mostly keeps him trapped in the helmet, he keeps Murderbot itself compelling.

These grace notes tend to get drowned out by that steady drumbeat of plot, though. You wouldn't think a TV show that took 10 episodes to adapt 160 pages of a single novella could fall prey to feeling rushed, but here we are, as the show forces itself to coordinate Gurathan and Pin-Lee's efforts to launch the GrayCris beacon, Mensah's secondary scheming, and MB's confrontation with Team Bad Guy in the span of a scant half hour. A slightly extended runtime (by Murderbot standards, at least) helps a little, but this is still a sprint that barely gives itself room to enjoy those smaller moments, like MB distracting the GrayCris SecUnit busy killing it by filling its brain with a blast of Sanctuary Moon, or the little freakout Pin-Lee has when they kill a GrayCris guard with a big, heavy wrench. No, we've got to rush forward to the next minor twist, as the plot ties itself up in knots to get to the moment where Murderbot sacrifices itself to keep Mensah alive after the beacon finally detonates. (Don't worry, she's fine; the SecUnit “twisted its body the right way” to leave her photogenically bruised, but otherwise unharmed, after they fall off a cliff together.)

The fact is, plot has never been this show's strong suit, and focusing “All Systems Red” almost entirely on wrapping up said plot doesn't make that any less true. It's an episode where almost every character seems moved to say exactly what they're going to do before they do it, then has someone else ask them what they did just to make sure everybody in the audience is following along. It works best as comedy, as when one of the GrayCris guys (David Reale) keeps almost noticing that Murderbot is cribbing its lines from Sanctuary Moon, or MB desperately invites him to “Clasp hands?” in solidarity over their stated hatred of the planet. But those are small-scale, in-the-moment pleasures and sketch-comedy-style laughs. The episode has none of the emotional punch that powers this show's best episodes, because it simply doesn't give itself time to luxuriate in the feelings that produce those great scenes. I'm hopeful that next week's finale, having dispensed with all these moving pieces, will have more time to actually focus on what the show is good at instead of just racing its way through the pages of Martha Wells' first Murderbot book. For now, though, we're left with a disappointing climax to the action of a show that was never all that interested in action in the first place.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","And Just Like That… has no idea what it's doing","https://www.avclub.com/and-just-like-that-recap-season-3-episode-6","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 02:45:00 GMT","

What are we doing here? We're halfway through the third season of And Just Like That…, but it does not feel like we are in the middle of a strong narrative arc. Or any narrative arc. Episode to episode, these women flit and flail about with either the dumbest problems imaginable (Will my new girlfriend like my 20-year-old son who no longer lives with me? Can I find replacement antique glass that creates the same rainbow effect?) or serious problems (cancer of a partner, a parent dying) that aren't given the emotional heft to make a viewer feel anything. 

It even seems like the hate-watch value is slipping, doesn't it? I know we all hated Che Diaz in previous seasons, but at least we could make jokes. Now I'm just bored.

But let's start with Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), as her narcissism demands. She and Duncan (Jonathan Cake) are buddy-buddy now, talking shop over his horribly prepared mutton dinner and glasses of Malbec. He asks her to read his first chapter of the Margaret Thatcher biography, saying, “I never show my work in progress to anyone. But with her, I need an outside female eye.” And you're asking Carrie? Given the novel voiceovers we're now subjected to, I'm not convinced this is a great idea. She agrees, if he'll read the first chapter of her novel too.

But Aidan (John Corbett) is coming into town this episode because Wyatt has decided to attend a weeklong wilderness program in Wyoming. Aidan is so excited about this that you know it's going to go horribly wrong—and boy, does it ever. When he shows up, he tosses pebbles at her window—an homage to their Sex And The City days—but accidentally shatters one of the window panes. Carrie is beside herself about this, making remarks about how these doors have survived Hurricane Sandy and the Civil War but get shattered by a pebble from him. I am not an expert on windows, but don't they need to be replaced more frequently than every few hundred years? What's her heating bill like?

If Carrie is weird about the glass, Aidan is even more so. He keeps saying he broke it, so he has to fix it, which means driving to Pennsylvania to buy four antique doors hoping it's the same kind of glass that creates the rainbow effect Carrie likes. None of them do, and Aidan is distraught. Carrie asks him why he's being so weird about the glass, and he admits that when Wyatt had a hard time getting on the plane to wilderness camp, it was very upsetting and he slept with Kathy. He slept with Kathy? He slept with Kathy!

Carrie is stunned for a minute as Aidan blathers on about how it was such a mistake and he's so sorry he betrayed her, and for a second I thought I was going to have to pull up the infidelity receipts in the long history between these two. But Carrie clearly remembers that for me, because she says she understands how something like this could happen, and it wasn't a betrayal because they're not really in a relationship. And here's where my brain started to melt a little bit: Aidan freaks out because he says he violated their agreement to not sleep with anyone else for five years, and Carrie says she never agreed to that—only to be waiting for him when he could finally be with her. And she asks, “Why have we not had this discussion until now?” You guys!!! (In my notes: “OMG I HATE THIS SHOW.”)

The kicker is they still do not have the conversation. She just says she still wants to be with him, and they have sex. No! Sit down and map it out! Establish boundaries and expectations! This isn't working for anyone, least of all me!

The other big development this week is the death of Lisa's (Nicole Ari Parker) father. Though he was almost 90, this was a shock to her because the doctors said he was in great health, and she put her phone in silent mode while working with her hot editor and missed Herbert's (Chris Jackson) calls to come say goodbye once he had a stroke. 

This had the potential to be a moving storyline. When Lisa calls Charlotte (Kristen Davis) to tell her, she laments missing out on the moment for work. “Work he raised you to do,” Charlotte reminds her empathetically. But instead of letting Lisa wrestle with this work-versus-home question in a meaningful way, the show introduces a bizarre fight for control of his funeral arrangements with the woman who ran his theater company. We've never met this woman! Who cares? 

Of course, the reminder of death rattles Charlotte, who still isn't allowed to tell anyone about Harry's (Evan Handler) cancer diagnosis. She's determined to be positive when he chooses surgery over radiation, but then her anxiety spikes when faced with the reality that sometimes doctors are wrong. She finally gets to tell someone when Carrie finds her buying adult diapers for Harry in Walgreens, and it's actually a very lovely moment between the two. I couldn't help but wonder…why is Carrie a better friend to Charlotte than she is to Miranda (Cynthia Nixon)?

And finally, Seema (Sarita Choudhury) is on the hunt for a perfect apartment for Miranda, who turns up her nose at the idea of paying $150K over asking on a place she loves. The only alternative Seema finds for her has a no-pet policy, which makes Miranda pause because of Joy's (Dolly Wells) two dogs. Things are getting serious because Miranda asks her to meet Brady, and while Joy is nervous about that, she is won over immediately when Brady asks to pet her dogs. Glad we solved that problem immediately with nothing interesting happening at all! Miranda goes for the more expensive, pro-dog apartment. 

It's a fairly toothless ending for an episode that had brushes with infidelity and death. But we've got Carrie's review of the Margaret Thatcher biography to look forward to, so at least there's that.

[Note: This article contains spoilers for Jurassic World Rebirth.] 

Gareth Edwards' new Jurassic World movie, Rebirth, is getting some credit for injecting a little horror back into the concept of dinosaurs run amuck, up to and including occasionally feinting toward treating its characters with a bit of genuine savagery. But it could have gone so much further, had Edwards—and star Mahershala Ali—not been overruled by the studio.

This is per a new Variety interview with Edwards, who talks about the tension of trying to convince audiences who've shelled out to see your PG-13 crowd-pleaser that you might actually let a dinosaur eat a child in front of them. “It's tricky because you want people to think you're going to do it. You've walked into a family adventure movie with lots of families and their kids. So, can they and will they do this?” But while chomping down on the kids (like Audrina Miranda's Isabella, who gets one eye-catching scene) was probably a non-starter from the jump, another character was genuinely on the chopping block: Heroic paramilitary leader Duncan, played by Ali. Who apparently only had one question about his character when he read the script and came aboard the project: “Can we kill him?”

Edwards was on board, for sure, noting that in the original draft of the script, Duncan was slated to die—and only spared when the film's casting scored Ali's Oscar-winning talents. “I joined Team Mahershala and we both pushed to have him killed; the script changed back to him dying.” But although Edwards shot the film's ending with the intention of giving the character a heroic sacrifice, execs at Universal asked if he wouldn't, maybe, just possibly mind shooting a version where the character lived. Edwards could read the writing on the wall: “I know how this works; whatever we film will be in the movie, so you've got to be careful. I thought, ‘If we can do this, I want it to be the really classy version that I can live with,' so I started trying to imagine it and to picture some shots. The actors gave this amazing performance for this little section, and I really liked it.” Still, when it was time to send in his director's cut of the movie, Edwards went with the one where Duncan dies. At which point Universal asked, “Hey, can we see the other way, too?”

Anyway, Edwards admits he got his mind changed on the matter when he watched test screenings of the film, and saw audiences break into “massive applause” when the character's non-fatal fate was revealed. “Hats off to the studio… I just didn't want to feel like I was selling out by bringing him back. But if anything, I had to remind myself that there's this film called E.T. where E.T. died, and then when he came back. So I kept reassuring myself: remember that movie you loved did this, it's not a cop-out.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","James Gunn happily compares Nicholas Hoult and David Corenswet's Superman auditions","https://www.avclub.com/james-gunn-compares-hoult-corenswet-superman-auditions","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 03:49:00 GMT","

One of the little running press currents in the lead-up to next week's release of James Gunn's Superman has been the fact that both David Corwenswet (Superman) and Nicholas Hoult (Lex Luthor) auditioned for the title part, and only one of them got it. (Savvy readers may, after a second reading of the previous sentence, work out which one came out on top.) It's a lovely little bit of narrative sauce for the film: All-too-human multi-billionaire Lex Luthor, in many of his incarnations, is implied, or outright stated, to be driven by his deep jealousy of the Man Of Steel; having Corenswet beat Hoult before they'd even shot a frame of the movie can't help but play into the narrative.

Now, though, director James Gunn has happily weighed in on the two's auditions, and explained exactly why he picked Corenswet instead of Hoult. (This is one of the nice things about Gunn functionally being his own boss in his DC Studios gig; his natural inclinations to talk frankly about movie-making can get a full and only lightly-filtered workout.) Gunn was talking to Jake's Takes this week (as part of the same junket that produced info that test screenings nixed a moment when the film's baddies punched Superman's dog), when he was asked to talk about various actors' Superman auditions. Gunn stated that he didn't think his choices ultimately came down to who's the better actor—noting, with odd candor, that “[Hoult]'s a great actor; some may say he's better than David in certain ways”—but that he didn't fit Gunn's mental conception of the character.

“He's more controlled,” Gunn said of Hoult's style, contrasting him with the more “loose” Corenswet. Interestingly, it also came down to the Loises: Hoult apparently tested well with an actress who had a less restrained style for the character of Clark Kent's love interest/professional rival, while Corenswet played well off the more (again) “controlled” Rachel Brosnahan. (Which is sort of an interesting way to think about the characters as Supes' two oddly similar primary foils.)

Oh, also, Gunn was, once again, forced to weigh in on the conversation about whether Superman should wear trunks or not; when asked why people obsess over this particular comic book costuming detail, Gunn was humorously blunt: “Because people are foolish.”

As a site focused on pop culture and the media, The A.V. Club is not necessarily equipped to grapple, meaningfully, with many of the clearly shitty things that happen in the American political landscape on what feels like it's now a second-by-second basis. (Have you considered reading our sister site Splinter? They actually get paid to think and write about this unending torrent of bile.) But while we can't weigh in intelligently on most of the very depressing ways this country is choosing to celebrate its various milestones, we can say this: Holding UFC fights at the White House feels pretty fucking on the nose, even for a narrative as lost in satire as our current, barely shared reality.

This is per CNN, reporting on comments made tonight by President Donald Trump, suggesting that he intends to bring his old buddy, Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White, in to hold a cage match at the White House. (And while we normally do not spend a lot of time thinking “thank you” toward White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, we do have to be grateful that she later confirmed to press that Trump was “deadly serious” about scheduling the bout, because the increasingly absurd nature of American life has really begun to make some of this stuff kind of blurry.)

White and Trump have been friends for years, with the UFC CEO representing one of the hydra-esque heads of the testosterone-huffing, supplement-slinging male insecurity industry that Trump tapped to some success in the 2024 election. (Among other things, White introduced Trump at the Republican National Convention last year, and Trump has lent the dignity of his office to several of the company's fights in recent months.) UFC has confirmed that it's looking into setting up a UFC bout at the White House some time in 2026, although no one has yet specified where on the grounds it might end up being set up. (We assume outside, but fuck it, why not directly in the Oval Office? Get a little blood-mixed-with-body-spray splashed on the ol' Resolute desk.)

(By the way: If your job doesn't involve looking up which of the six extant Oval Office desks Trump uses so you can make that joke, your job is not as weird as ours.)

Trump announced his modern gladiatorial game during a speech in Des Moines on Thursday night, pitching it as part of his planned “America 250” events celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country's founding next year. God knows what it ramps up to from here; given how Trump's treated his old friends at the WWE, we should count ourselves lucky if White hasn't been named as Secretary Of Labor by the time the year is out.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Duster ends its strong debut season with an intense finale","https://www.avclub.com/duster-season-1-finale-recap","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

When Duster began, I was concerned there might be a fundamental power imbalance to its dual-lead setup. The show's Arizona world seemed so anchored around getaway driver Jim Ellis that I was worried FBI Agent Nina Hayes would always feel like a more tangential character—off in her own world rather than truly central to the series. So I was delighted to find that it's actually Nina who sits at the center of so much of this first-season finale. She's the one that Billy and Saxton are focused on interrogating; that Awan, Jessica-Lorraine, and Jim are looking to save; and that Agent Chad Grant is trying to kill. We even open on a flashback that foregrounds her relationship with her father in 1954 Philly. 

Nina may have arrived in Phoenix as a bit of a loner, but she's made an impressive amount of both friends and enemies during her short time in the Grand Canyon State. Where Duster started with the vibe of “starring Lost's Josh Holloway and introducing Rachel Hilson,” it's ending as a true two-hander. The show no longer sees Jim and Nina as protagonists of parallel stories but as partners who are willing to risk their lives for one another. As far as season-long arcs go, that's an unquestionable win. 

The rest of this episode is a bit more of a mixed bag—exciting and unexpectedly emotional, but also a tiny bit hindered by where and how Duster wants to leave itself open for a potential second season. Given how episodic this series has been, I expected this finale would wrap up the briefcase/Xavier mystery while leaving most of the character dynamics intact for the future. Instead, it does the opposite. The briefcase and Xavier twist now seem like they could become series-long through-lines, while Saxton's (seeming, I'll get into it) death leaves the core cast with a Keith David-sized hole at its center. 

If this is Saxton's swan song, it's fitting he goes out in an episode about parents and children. In the opening flashback, Nina remembers her father as a loving man who wanted to protect his community and his family from an exploitative criminal. Saxton, however, remembers him as a backstabbing police informant who turned against the longtime friend who helped save his drug store. Perhaps both realities are true. 

Regardless, it's a relief when Nina and Saxton finally have an honest face-to-face conversation—if only because it stops Billy from doing any further waterboarding in the warehouse where he's kidnapped her (a truly harrowing scene). Saxton doesn't deny killing Nina's father, but he does try to get her to see that he's not just a one-note villain. Nina, meanwhile, tries to convince him that she's not out for revenge but real justice. A lot of the emotional tension of the episode comes from whether or not they'll be able to prove those things to each other. 

The other big emotional driver of this finale is how much Jim and Nina have truly come to care for one another. They started the season as reluctant partners who could barely have a minute-long parking-lot conversation without driving each other crazy. Yet here he willing turns himself over to Saxton to save Nina's life. True, he's got a bigger plan in play (Wade is secretly holding Genesis hostage in her bar and will kill her if Jim doesn't call by 5 p.m.), but it's still incredibly sweet to watch Jim and Nina wind up handcuffed together. “Come on, Baltimore, you know I couldn't just leave you hanging,” Jim tells Nina. “You didn't have to help me,” she chastises him. “But I'm glad you did.” You really feel the weight of the great chemistry that Holloway and Hilson have built this season. 

That weight is important because unlike in the Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid-homage episode, Nina and Jim are once again separated here. Though Wade tells Saxton he'll do anything for his kid, Saxton wagers that he's bluffing on the “66 Reno split” and calls Cowboy to have Agent Chad Grant come murder Nina. (He doesn't want the death of a fed connected to his crew.) Meanwhile, he plans to trade Jim to Greek Sal in exchange for the smoking-gun briefcase Howard Hughes lost last week. 

The former setup lets Nina have her own action-heroine moment of the week—a tense, desert-set thriller setpiece that showcases her ingenuity. It's an exciting sequence, although I do think Agent Chad has been one of the weaker elements of the season. The show telegraphed his villainy so early that I was half waiting for him to be revealed as a secret good guy. The tense final shootout might have been more effective if Agent Chad had been a faux ally to Nina and Awan all season only to turn out to be a baddie here. As is, he got a lot of screen time but never much depth. (What's his motivation anyway? Just a paycheck from Cowboy?) At least we get the expected but still satisfying moment Awan shows up to take him down—reaffirming the season-long partnership he's been building with Nina.

As Jim did earlier, Nina rushes back into danger to save her other partner in crime. Although what ultimately changes Saxton's mind is another act of parenthood. As they're walking to make the exchange, Jim reveals that Luna is his daughter—not so much as a way to beg for his life but simply as a way to explain that he understands what it's like to be a parent. Wade may love Genesis as a family friend, but he'll still kill her if he thinks Saxton has murdered both of his sons. And Saxton won't be able to live with himself if he knows he got his own child killed. 

Though it's a bit of a bummer that we don't get one final splashy car chase to end the season, Saxton's moment of moral clarity at least unfolds with the dignity of an old-fashioned Western. Roy Orbison's “Crying” plays as Saxton turns his gun on Greek Sal. What follows is a truly brutal shootout in which Nina gets to save Saxton's life and prove she was telling the truth about wanting justice. Saxton, meanwhile, takes a bullet for Royce and proves he's not just the simple villain Nina thinks he is but a man who really does love his family. 

It's more complex, character-centric storytelling than I was expecting from this fun-first series. Although it's somewhat hampered by the show's unwillingness to give us a moment to process everything we just saw happen. The Saxtons have been such a big part of the season that we could've used one final button to wrap up that corner of the show's universe—like Royce and Genesis squaring off over who gets to inherit Snowbird or just the ensemble mourning the loss of a complicated man. But I do think the show is ever so slightly leaving the door ajar to bring back Keith David next season if it wants to. While Nina tells a distraught Royce “he's gone,” Jim doesn't actually explicitly tell Genesis that he's dead. (He just says, “It's your pop.”) And why would Royce still be at the hospital if Saxton died onsite at the shootout? 

Indeed, the final few minutes of this episode are more interested in keeping doors open than wrapping up thematic loose ends—a choice the showrunners potentially made last minute. In what feels more like a retcon than a well-built twist, Nina's boss reveals that he's part of a task force that's been aware of an in-office conspiracy for more than a year but he was forbidden from telling her about it until now. And there's clearly been some heavy tweaking to the sunset overlook scene where both clumsy green screen and ADR help Nina reveal that (gasp!) Xavier is actually Jim's brother Joey, who faked his own death with Saxton's help. Talk about a lot to process! 

While the Xavier/Joey twist is an intriguing surprise, I think ending things with a greater sense of finality might've actually been a more effective tease for a second season. If the show had resolved all the Nixon/Cowboy/Xavier stuff here, it would've told a complete story on both an episodic and season-long level. As is, it runs the risk of becoming another never-ending mystery-box J.J. Abrams show. Ironically, “we actually know how to end things” is a better season two pitch than “what will Mad Raoul do with the smoking-gun tape?”  

Still, those are small qualms with a show that's really proven itself over the course of this first season. Duster started as a fun throwback series that's only gotten stronger as the season went along. And, to its credit, this twisty finale even finds a good excuse for Jim and Nina to remain partners—everyone who knew she was a fed got killed in the shootout (R.I.P. Billy); Nina's got her important new role in the task force; and Izzy reveals she has cancer and needs Jim to stick around town for her and Luna. 

Despite the occasional misstep, I love these characters and this world enough that I hope the show gets several more seasons to keep delivering the '70s fun. And as far as partnerships go, Holloway, Hilson, Abrams, and LaToya Morgan have proven to be quite a groovy match.

A spectacular three-day wedding celebration in Venice has taken an unusual turn after reports emerged that one of Lauren Sánchez's wedding outfits has disappeared without explanation. The 55-year-old bride, who recently married Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, had an impressive collection of 27 different dresses available for her lavish nuptials, but one of these designer pieces has now gone missing, according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, as reported by the Daily Mail.

The missing garment disappeared sometime during the weekend festivities, though the specific designer brand and style of the dress remain undisclosed. What makes the situation particularly intriguing is how the dress may have gone missing through the actions of an uninvited guest who managed to slip past security measures.

According to reports from the Daily Mail, an elegantly dressed woman allegedly bypassed security guards without an invitation during the celebration. While she was eventually discovered and “kindly escorted out” by security personnel, her personal information was not recorded before her departure. This mysterious guest is now suspected of taking the missing dress during her brief presence at the exclusive event.

The theft wasn't the only unexpected incident during the wedding weekend. Reports also indicate that one of Sánchez's Dolce & Gabbana gowns caught fire at some point during the festivities, although fortunately, this was not the dress she wore during the actual ceremony, including the exchange of vows.

Despite these behind-the-scenes dramas, Sánchez's main wedding ensemble took center stage during the ceremony itself. She chose a stunning Dolce & Gabbana creation that perfectly captured her vision for the momentous occasion. Designers crafted the high-neck, corseted gown from hand-appliquéd Italian lace, featuring a mermaid silhouette that created an ethereal appearance.

The dress drew inspiration from Sophia Loren's iconic look in the 1989 film “Houseboat,” a detail that reflected Sánchez's desire to connect with classic Hollywood glamour. The bodice showcased 180 silk chiffon-covered priest buttons, while a tulle-and-lace veil completed the timeless ensemble.

“It went from ‘I want a simple, sexy modern dress' to ‘I want something that evokes a moment,' and where I am right now. I am a different person than I was five years ago,” Sánchez explained to Vogue about her dress selection process.

She further elaborated on her inspiration: “I researched pictures of brides in the 1950s. I wanted to reflect back, and I saw Sophia Loren and her hands were like this and she was in high lace, up to the neck, and I said, ‘That's it. That's the dress.'”

The bride acknowledged that her choice represented a break with expectations: “It is a departure from what people expect, from what I expect – but it's very much me. I mean, it's so elegant, it's timeless.”

A post shared by Lauren Sánchez Bezos (@laurensanchezbezos)

The wedding celebration proved to be a true fashion showcase, with Sánchez changing outfits multiple times throughout the three-day event. Beyond her ceremony gown, she wore a sweetheart neck, corseted dress inspired by Rita Hayworth's film “Gilda” for the wedding dinner.

For the after-party festivities, she selected an Oscar de la Renta cocktail dress that featured 600 yards of hand-sewn chain work and 175,000 crystals, which embellished the garment.

The fashion marathon began even before the main ceremony, with Sánchez choosing a Schiaparelli dress from their spring 2025 couture collection for the welcome dinner. The gold garment, designed by Daniel Roseberry, featured a corseted bodice embellished with gold beads and an off-the-shoulder neckline adorned with hand-embroidered green flowers.

Domenico Dolce shared insights into creating Sánchez's main wedding gown, telling Vogue: “At the very beginning, with every wedding dress, I ask the lady, ‘Tell me what you dream,' because I want it to be right, and she's very fast, very dynamico. She was about to go to the moon, to space. Much was happening. It's a very important day for the lady and the dress helps in this language.”

The couple exchanged vows on Friday, June 27, on the private island of San Giorgio in a ceremony held within a private church nestled in the island's renowned gardens, away from public view. The exclusive guest list included numerous high-profile attendees who witnessed the union of two prominent figures from the worlds of media and technology.

Gellar, best known for best known for her roles in iconic series like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” and “Gossip Girl,” kept fans entertained with her sizzling swimwear and clever wordplay. 

The playful photo dump was just one of several updates from her European getaway. In another post, she posed aboard a boat in a vibrant orange swimsuit, cheekily captioning it, “Felt cute. Might go seas the day.”

Gellar's Italian fans were thrilled to welcome the “Cruel Intentions” star, with one fan page, @sarah_michelle_gellar_italia, writing, “🌊☀️ Sardinia is pure magic and you shine right along with it! So lovely to see you soaking up the beauty of this incredible place. Enjoy every moment, Sarah! 💙🇮🇹”

Despite carving out time for some much-needed R&R, the trip wasn't all play. During appearances at the Filming Italy Festival, Gellar traded her swimwear for high fashion, donning a chic Dolce & Gabbana dress for a cocktail party and a striking Antonio Marras gown on the red carpet. Her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., and their children, Charlotte and Rocky, were noticeably absent from the snapshots.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Erin Cahill's Husband, Musician Welsh Wolf, Vulnerably Asks Fans for Help With Huge Goal","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/erin-cahill-husband-welsh-wolf-needs-votes/","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 02:15:37 GMT","

Longtime Hallmark Channel star Erin Cahill is her husband Paul Freeman's biggest fan. But on July 3, 2025, she needs her fans — and music fans everywhere — to get behind the indie musician, who goes by the stage name and musical alter ego Welsh Wolf, and help him reach the final round of Global Citizen's “America's Next Top Hitmaker” Contest. 

Cahill shared a video from her husband via her Instagram Stories, urging people to watch his urgent request, in which he said, “I'm feeling really vulnerable, actually, saying this but I really need your help.” 

Voting ends on July 3 at 9 p.m. Eastern time. At the time of publication, Welsh Wolf was in third place. While supporters can cast one vote for free by logging into Facebook, they can cast more votes by making a small donation toward Global Citizen's mission of ending extreme poverty — a cause close to Cahill and Freeman's hearts. 

In his July 2 Instagram post, Freeman told his fans, “It's scary to ask for help but those who know me know I love a good charity gig and we are ALL global citizens!! Thank you a billion to everyone who's voted so far you are amazing, let's see if we can get this over the line and raise some money while we do!!”

Cahill and Freeman have built five schools in third-world countries with the nonprofit organization BuildOn, including in Senegal in early 2025. So they love that by rallying support for Welsh Wolf through Global Citizen's contest, they're also raising funds for families in need around the world. 

The winner of the “America's Next Top Hitmaker” competition will receive $50,000, appear in Rolling Stone magazine, and get to perform at the Global Citizen Festival in New York City. 

Freeman told the organization that if he wins, “My wife and I are currently raising money for another school so my first thought would be to make a large donation towards that project. After that, I would invest some of it into the development of myself and another Artist I work with. I feel so grateful to be involved with the community work that I do and to be able to do it because of music is such an incredible gift.”

A post shared by Erin Cahill (@theerincahill)

Cahill, who grew up in Virginia, and Freeman, who is from Wales, U.K., have been married since September 2016 and now split their time between Los Angeles and Nashville. 

Freeman told Nashville Voyager that he left home as a teen, moved to London, started and a band and was signed to Boy George's record label. After releasing a couple of albums, he wound up in Los Angeles when he signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music, writing for multiple artists, and eventually signed a deal with legendary producer Clive Davis. 

But after that deal expired and Freeman began longing to spread his wings creatively, he came up with the idea for his musical alter ego, Welsh Wolf, he told the outlet. 

“It's not for the faint of heart,” he said. “To sing your own music is probably the most vulnerable of art forms as it truly comes from within you. To stand on a stage and bare your soul like that can leave you very open and not everyone can do it.”

Welsh Wolf's six-track debut album, “A Voyeur's Dream,” was released on June 6. Cahill has enthusiastically promoted its release, as well as the launch party they held in LA and other performances, always happy to cheer on her hubby. 

In April 2024, to celebrate Freeman's birthday, she wrote in a sweet Instagram post that he was “the love of all my lifetimes,” adding, “Every day with you is a gift. We have grown so much together and individually, and being on this journey with you has been better than I could've dreamt.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Most Bitter ‘Big Brother' Juries of All Time","https://entertainmentnow.com/big-brother/big-brother-bitter-jury-moments/","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 02:15:37 GMT","

“Big Brother” is a show filled with as many competitions as blow ups. There are hundreds of hours of proof the show can be both engaging to watch yet hard to stomach. One of the most attractive aspects of the show is how a dozen or so houseguests can coalesce for three months in a confined space. 

One by one, they're picked off because they didn't have the right alliance or they ended up on the wrong side of the house. At the end of the season, the houseguests who are voted off are ultimately the ones who get the honor of choosing their friend (or enemy) as the winner. 

It's during the latter third of mid-season where the show gets to be at the apex of interesting though. The Jury House is introduced and the ones who are sequestered there get to provide commentary on the game up until that point. 

Moments in the second house can be tense as houseguests get a chance to confront newly evicted members like how Da'Vonne did with Paulie in BB18. That season, among others, ended with what competition reality fans dub “bitter juries” – or jurors who voted based on past digressions rather than the skill seen in the show. The way one player treats others can ultimately affect the outcome, no matter how well they played.

Below are a few of the bitterest juries in “Big Brother” history.

The early seasons are somewhat of unicorns when it comes to how the jury used to be handled. Houseguests on the jury were sent home as opposed to being held on a different set. This allowed for them to become players turned viewers as they watched one of the final two's – Danielle – Diary Room confessionals, where she essentially trashed them. 

She bragged about how she lied and deceived everyone in order to get them evicted. The viewer consensus is she was the better player. The jury consensus says otherwise. Danielle would end up losing to Lisa. The rules regarding evicted houseguests watching the remaining season would change after this.

Season four saw a reduction in the number of jurors to seven in order to avoid the chances of a tie. It's also the first season to see jurors be sequestered to a house rather than sent home. 

This season also saw a truly disliked winner and runner-up in Jun and Alison respectively. The tension in the room can be seen in the questioning segment of the finale episode. Jun and Alison are forced to cover every track of their gameplay. It's a tough watch.

Another new rule was introduced in season 11. If a houseguest who was supposed to be on the jury quits or is sent home by Big Brother, then that person's jury vote doesn't just go away. Viewers would step in to cast a jury vote as a group. In the end, 24 million votes were cast during the season – with over 11 million as the seventh jury vote. 

As for the bitter jury aspect, Jeff was the houseguest who caused the most friction. He was unliked in the house but seemed to be okay with being sent to jury. Michelle, on the other hand, openly admits to being bitter due to getting evicted. Fans and houseguests weren't as big of fans of either finalist Jordan and Natalie in the end.

Season 14 saw another jury vote for what fans saw as the player who didn't deserve to win. Many feel as though Dan was the one who played a better game over winner Ian. During the section of the finale where the jury asks gameplay questions of the final two, Dan and Ian started pointing fingers. 

Dan was given the harshest questioning of the two, which caused the jury to vote 6-1 in favor of Ian. Years later, jury members admit they should've voted for Dan.

If Da'Vonne and Paulie getting into it doesn't make this one of the most bitter juries in the show's history, then there are no bitter juries. Paulie entered the jury house feeling as though everyone hated him. It didn't help that he used sexist comments to cement that. Season 18 is also one of the modern seasons with nine jurors instead of seven. 

Finalist Paul would end up losing to Nicole after jury mismanagement. During the roundtable, the evicted houseguests seemed to turn on Paul's personal convictions outside of his gameplay. That seemed to seal the deal of his runner-up status.

Paul returned the following season, finally cementing himself as the winner. The jury referred to the runner-up, Josh, as something along the lines of a psychopath. 

They didn't respect him and admitted as much during the roundtable. Jurors also didn't have many nice things to say about Paul who would do a lot of talking behind other player's backs whereas Josh would confront everyone. 

Season 20 saw a gameplay device dubbed the “Jury Battleback” where evicted houseguests could fight for another chance to stay in the house. Scottie ultimately returned but it didn't matter. Tyler lost to Kaycee and some say it was a fair decision by the jury. 

Everyone except for Haleigh voted for Kaycee because they perceived her as to have played a better game. What's also important to note is that the players were also seen as clueless by viewers like how Scottie and FOUTTE/The Hive unraveled fairly quickly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘It's Always Sunny' Star Reveals He Wanted to Leave the Show","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-leave/","Fri, 04 Jul 2025 00:36:22 GMT","

“It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” has the distinction of being the longest-running American live-action sitcom. The show began in 2005, and many agree it's as funny as ever. However, Glenn Howerton, who plays Dennis in “It's Always Sunny,” recently opened up about wanting to quit the hit FXX series. 

According to Entertainment Weekly, Glenn Howerton was recently on a panel to celebrate the long-running series for its 20th anniversary. While reflecting on the show, Glenn said, “I was worried that maybe we had sort of peaked or something.”

He continued discussing “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” saying, “And I just was like, you know, we've been doing this for a long time, and I think I was also anxious. I had not figured out yet how to stretch myself and be able to do other things that I wanted to do with my career outside of the show.”

The actor continued, “I was aching to do other things, and so I was starting to feel a little boxed in, frankly.” Still, Glenn says he “never lost any appreciation for the show.” He went on, “I just thought like maybe we should, and then they were like, ‘We don't want to end it,' and I was like, ‘Oh, well I can't stop you.'”

“It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” is still one of the most talked-about shows on the air. Luckily for fans, Dennis and the rest of the characters from “It's Always Sunny” will return for a 17th season.

The show is scheduled to premiere on July 9th. According to IMDb, like most of the recent installments, the season will consist of eight episodes. Notably, the first episode will be the second part of the much-talked-about “Abbot Elementary” crossover. 

Fans will also be happy to know that the show has been renewed for an 18th season. 

“It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” is a staple of comedy television. However, the cast has also done an excellent job of branching out. Regarding Glenn Howerton, he received rave reviews for his role in the 2023 movie “Blackberry” as well as his starring tenure in A.P. Bio, which ran from 2018 to 2021. 

Additionally, Kaitlin Olson has been in multiple television series. She has a recurring role in “Hacks” and also stars in the hit ABC show “High Potential.” Regarding Charlie Day, he played Luigi in “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” in 2023. Rob McElhenney starred in Apple's “Mythic Quest” from 2020 until 2025. 

Of course, Danny DeVito was an icon long before “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”

Rich Kidz's bright melodies and boy band vibe. Yung L.A.'s slurred whisper-sing and questionable mohawk. Young Dro's country club fashion and way of describing his whips and jewelry with the clarity of a picture book: “Chevy look like Almond Joy,” “Wrist pinker than Miss Piggy.” Travis Porter's easy-t0-memorize turn up anthems. J Money's vision of the future where he fought UFO-flying martians from stealing his swag. Bubbly, digitized synths and sputtering trap drums. DJ tags and button-mashing sound effects out of the ass. It was Atlanta's futuristic era, a generation of flashy goofball rappers who peaked in the late 2000s and early 2010s and made their days of cars, clothes, girls, strip clubs, drugs, and crime sound like a fantasy that took place at shopping malls on the moon.

Truthfully, a lot of the mixtapes were hit-or-miss studio session dumps with half-assed themes. (I've come around to Young Dro's skits on Black Boy Swag, White Boy Tags where he sounds like he's doing a Bill & Ted impression.) And you really had to comb through to find the gems, but they were more about the upbeat mood, the lingo (Kwony Cash used “peons” like it was the kind of insult you could never recover from), and music that hit better at a party where everyone knew the words. Earlier this year, I met up with SahBabii in Brooklyn for an interview for this column, and, for most of our conversation, he was friendly yet stoic and tight. His mood shifted, though, when we spoke about Atlanta's futuristic era, and suddenly he sank comfortably into his chair and had a twinkle in his eye. The memories that flooded back to him had more to do with the communal energy than individual songs: “If you were there, you could just feel it. I was at Metro Skates. I was on Cleveland Ave. I went to Sylvan Hills Middle School and Booker T. Washington High School. I miss those times. It was free. Nobody anywhere else was doing it like that. In Atlanta, all the kids were making music together.”

But don't get it twisted: the songs themselves still kick it all off. Proof: Pluto and YKNiece's “Whim Whamiee,” one of the biggest and most inescapable viral rap hits of the year, feels like it's bringing that feel-good era of Atlanta rap back. Is it because the beat is a flip of Gutta and OJ da Juiceman's Zaytoven-produced “Wham Bam”? Not really; that original track is meaner and muddier than a lot of the futuristic stuff, even if Zaytoven's funk sparkles like sunlight reflecting off the ocean. Instead, it's really due to how silly, sloppy, and organic Pluto and YKNiece's connection seems to be, like they just happened to be together one night with plenty of bottles and stumbled into a recording booth. The background noise, full of muffled singing along and way too loud ad-libs, makes the whole thing sound like it was done in one wild-ass take.

Sure, I'm drawn to the nostalgia of it all, but “Whim Whamiee” is good as hell because it's more about them being the realest, coolest girls in Atlanta. A timeless message. Their raunchy verses are fun and catchy, too. Every YKNiece bar and ad-lib could be its own catchphrase—“Hit the door, ho!” and “I'm talkin' 'bout innit!” already are. She's the better of the two, with the kind of voice you might hear over the loudspeaker at the DMV first thing in the morning: unhurried and full of attitude. Her lines linger in the air long after she says them like the scent of burgers on the grill. Pluto is the energy, with a voice that screeches like burning rubber. She makes everyday Atlanta activities like riding the MARTA with her girls and throwing on an outfit to hit the streets sound larger than life. She's got some great lines, too, most importably when she repurposes white suburban fashion into the flyest shit: “He want me bad, heard he a duck, can't get no coochie out the queen, put some Lulu on this butt (Lululemon).” Young Dro is somewhere smiling like a dad whose kid just hit a walk-off double.

It's too bad that since “Whim Whamiee” blew up a few months ago, Pluto and YKNiece have gone their separate ways, now describing each other as “business partners.” That doesn't ruin the song—though I prefer to imagine good rap duos as being damn-near in love like Thug and Quan in 2014—but they need each other because everything else they've put out so far is forgettable. A few weeks ago, Pluto dropped her debut album, Both Ways, a tonally confused project caught between Atlanta drill and lighter tracks about wearing expensive clothes and running up the credit cards of tricks. As for YKNiece, I'll reserve my judgment for her eventual debut tape, but “Yams,” her new wannabe twerk anthem with Bhad Bhabie, might as well be a Sexyy Red song made by A.I., and the BunnaB team-up “Innit,” which spins off her ad-lib on “Whim Whamiee” into its own song, seems to exist for no other reason than to go viral.

But the futuristic revival isn't dead on arrival, because, speaking of BunnaB, her recent solo mixtape Bunna Summa (Ice Cream Summer Deluxe) captures the frothy yet cranked up spirit even more than “Whim Whamiee.” It's not groundbreaking, but it doesn't have to be. She has the sticky bubblegum hooks (“Mad Again”) and a decent selection of computerized summertime beats (“It's Me”) to go along with a buzzy hit in “Bunna Summa” that makes getting drunk on an Atlanta street corner in True Religion jeans sound like the true American dream. (It probably is.) Jacking old Gucci and Rich Kidz flows, she lays the nostalgia on a little thick, but I don't mind because she's funny and has an imagination. For example, “Staddy,” a sort of unofficial coming-out anthem, is kind of nuts, as she balances the fears of dating men around the way with a fantasy of what life would be like if she was smashing “studs” instead. “I like this girl, she like me/Was holding it so long most people didn't agree/Can use the same bathroom when we gotta' pee,” she sing-raps, dragging out the final syllable of each line like how Rich Kidz do their hook on “Wassup.” It's a good time.

And Atlanta rap could use a spirit boost. For a while, it's been hard to write about the scene without death or jail coming to mind. Rich Homie Quan. Takeoff. Young Scooter. Rico Wade. Lil Keed. The YSL trial. Just when the dark cloud shifts, it comes right back again. That could be why the nods to the bright synths and fantasy of the futuristic era of Atlanta are hitting so hard at the moment, whether that be Carti's Rich Kidz–sampling “Like Weezy” or BunnaB's filthy taunts on what sound like Nard & B type beats. It's a lighter return to the city's swaggy moment of 15 years ago, music to just rap along to with your friends until the summer ends, where not much matters other than copping a fresh Ralph Lauren rugby or Lululemon matching set.

							By 

	Michael Embrich



	A woman is lured to a public building. As she waits with her military veteran husband for some politburo-like agent to give her a time to come back to get her papers in order, she decides to breastfeed their infant child. Just then, armed agents storm the couple, tear the baby from the mother, and place her under arrest. She is then put in a queue for deportation, exactly what the couple was trying to avoid when they voluntarily showed up at their local government office. 


	This is not some dystopian novel or narrative about times in the Soviet Republic or Nazi Germany? Nope — this was in Louisiana a few weeks back. This is Donald Trump's America. 


	President Trump and his administration are carrying out the cruelest and most sweeping mass deportation program in modern U.S. history. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, acting at Trump's direction, have detained and deported veterans, their children, their spouses — even those who served alongside us on the battlefield. This is being done under the guise of “making America safe again,” when statistically America has never been safer. In fact, the administration is destroying the families who actually do keep us safe. 

	











	Trump's efforts to deport veterans and their families are not simply part of his broader immigration crackdown — they are a deliberate attack on service members and our veterans. In a February 2025 memo, the administration announced it will “no longer exempt” active duty military personnel, veterans, and their families from deportation while they pursue legal status — a complete reversal of prior U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) policy. 

	











	For active-duty families, this is especially devastating. Many service members meet their spouses overseas and are frequently relocated, making it extremely difficult to access a local USCIS office and begin the immigration process.


	Take Sae Joon Park, a Purple Heart recipient and Army combat veteran who came to the U.S. as a child. He served honorably in Operation Just Cause and was wounded twice; one was a gunshot wound to his back, temporarily paralyzing him. Like too many veterans, Park returned home with PTSD. Struggling with addiction, he was convicted of a drug offense over 15 years ago. Park served his time. He stayed in compliance with immigration authorities. He built a life, raised a son, and tried to move forward. But, just days before Independence Day, Trump's ICE told him to leave or be jailed. He self-deported to South Korea — exiled from the nation he bled and nearly died for.

	Park is at least the second Purple Heart recipient whom Trump has attempted to remove from this country in his second term. 


	Veterans across the country are watching as their parents, spouses, and children are swept up in raids. A father of three U.S. Marines was tackled at a landscaping job and arrested. And Jermaine Thomas — a man born on a U.S. Army base in Germany to a citizen father who died — was deported to Jamaica, a country he had never set foot in. Had Sen. John McCain or Bruce Willis been held to the same standard, we wouldn't even know who they are. 


	It's not only veterans and their families getting the shaft for Independence Day. There's Sayed Naser Noori, an Afghan interpreter who spent a decade supporting U.S. troops. His brother was murdered by the Taliban because of that loyalty. He fled to the U.S. legally, through a port of entry, under humanitarian parole. But this month, at a routine court appearance, ICE agents arrested him. Now, Trump's administration is fast-tracking his deportation — even as his asylum case remains unresolved. A fine reward for someone who lost his own brother to protect our brothers and sisters in arms.

	What do these stories say about America as we prepare to honor those English citizens who betrayed their nation to become men, women, and children with no nation — just an idea about a better one. An idea about a place where any person, from any nation, could come to and make their home, make it better, make it stronger.


	Our diversity is what makes us strong. But Trump knows that he is a master at a divide-and-conquer method of governing — so much so that he has much of the nation cheering the sick and reprehensible things he is doing to our veterans, allies, and their families this Fourth of July.

	John F. Kennedy once said, “As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.” 


	The silence of so many, in both words and actions, while our veterans and their families are being deported, is deafening.

	Masturbation remains a constant, but the way we approach it (or, come to it) is changing. Namely, sex toys are becoming more popular, both for men and women. The U.S. sex toy market has been steadily growing for years, especially thanks to a boost during the COVID lockdowns.


	Koichi Matsumoto, the founder of Japanese sex toy giant Tenga, has been an active player in this change for over 20 years. “I did research before founding Tenga in 2005, and found that only 1% of men had experienced sex toys,” he tells Rolling Stone, through a translator. “I took another survey a couple of years ago, and found that 39.4% of males had tried Tenga toys specifically.”


	Although men masturbate more frequently than women, sex toy use is higher among women. Matsumoto says that men's aversion to toys, especially when he started Tenga, is largely due to sex toy design. “The majority of sex toys [for men] were like an alternative to women. They were basically imitations of female genitalia, ” he says.  “This is root cause which made using sex toys something to be ashamed of.”




	Matsumoto's solution when founding Tenga was to create sex toys that didn't look like crude reproductions of genitalia, but still felt great. “At Tenga, we convey the message that sex toys are not an alternative to women; they're something that gives you pleasure whenever you want.” In other words, Matsumoto wanted to position sex toys as a masturbation upgrade instead of a sex alternative.




	And he succeeded: The untrained eye might never guess the pleasurable purpose of a Tenga sex toy. All of this works towards Matsumoto's goal of reducing stigma around masturbation and sexuality in general. “I want to provide the belief that sexuality should be enjoyed just like eating is enjoyed,” he says.


	If you're looking to upgrade your alone time with a discreet, elegant toy, Tenga's hugely popular inventions are a great place to start. Below is a rundown of some of the brand's most popular offerings.






	$9.99




	The Vacuum Cup was Tenga's first invention, and it remains one of the brand's best. The simple, single-use masturbator is slightly flexible, allowing you to squeeze the soft interior tighter. But the best feature is an air hole at the top that lets you create a sucking sensation inside. It's meant to be tossed after use; no cleanup required.




	$25.99




	Matsumoto tells us that the Spinner is Tenga's most popular product in the U.S. market. The reusable sleeve is very approachable and elegantly designed with an internal coil that spins the material as you stroke up and down. It also comes with a built-in drying stand to use after you rinse the sleeve out.

Donald Trump used the antisemitic term “Shylocks” while speaking at an event in Iowa Thursday night. The president employed the slur to describe predatory loan lenders while discussing the newly passed domestic tax and spending bill, which he has dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill.”


	“Think of that: no death tax, no estate tax, no going to the banks and borrowings from in some cases a fine banker. And in some cases, Shylocks and bad people,” Trump said.


	The term “Shylock” comes from a fictional character in William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. The character is a Venetian Jewish moneylender and the central villain of the play.

	By early Friday morning, Trump had feigned ignorance when asked about the word. “I've never heard it that way. To me, Shylock is somebody that's a money lender at high rates,” CNN reports that he said after deplaning Air Force One. “I've never heard it that way, you view it differently than me. I've never heard that.”

	











	Despite his claim, Jewish organizations have condemned the president's use of the word. In a statement via X, the Anti-Defamation League wrote: “The term ‘Shylock' evokes a centuries-old antisemitic trope about Jews and greed that is extremely offensive and dangerous. President Trump's use of the term is very troubling and irresponsible. It underscores how lies and conspiracies about Jews remain deeply entrenched in our country. Words from our leaders matter and we expect more from the President of the United States.”

	Amy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs also shared her thoughts on X: “Shylock is among the most quintessential antisemitic stereotypes,” she said, adding, “This is not an accident. It follows years in which Trump has normalized antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories — and it's deeply dangerous.”


This story was updated at 12:28 a.m. on July 4 to include the origin of the term “Shylock.”

	Following the commercial success of the Brad Pitt-starring F1, Pitt revealed that he and fellow Hollywood star Tom Cruise almost featured in another racing drama.


	During an interview with The National, Pitt shared that the pair were slated to feature on Ford v Ferrari, but ran into a major speed bump along the way. “Tom and I, for a while there, were on Ford v Ferrari with Joe [to direct],” said Pitt. “This was about 10 years before the guys who actually made it – and made it a great movie.”


	He continued, “What it came down to is that we both wanted to drive, and he wanted to play Shelby, and I wanted to play Ken Miles. And when Tom realized that Carroll Shelby would not be driving much in the movie, it didn't come through.”


	The roles of driver Ken Miles and car designer Carroll Shelby would later go to Christian Bale and Matt Damon, respectively, with James Mangold directing.

	It's been over 30 years since Pitt and Cruise appeared in 1994's Interview With the Vampire, based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel, and the idea of the two reuniting on the racetrack has piqued Pitt's interest. The actor also addressed rumors of a potential sequel. 

	











	“I would want to drive again, selfishly speaking,” Pitt said, but given the film's ending wondered how his character would make sense. “Where does Sonny fit in? I'm not sure. Sonny's probably out on the Bonneville Salt Flats, setting speed records or something like that. So I'm not sure beyond that, just yet.”

	After 29 months, six distinct legs, and 130 concerts across practically every corner of Europe and North America, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band finally wrapped up their world tour Thursday evening at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan, Italy.


	The setlist was largely standard for this final leg of the tour until the very end when Springsteen strapped his guitar back on after typical show closer “Chimes of Freedom,” and called out, “Key of B, boys. Key of B.” He was instructing them to break into John Fogerty's 1975 rock anthem “Rockin' All Over The World,” which is known to most European audiences thanks to Status Quo's 1977 cover.


	“Rockin' All Over The World” has been in Springsteen's live repertoire with the E Street Band going all the way back to the 1981 River tour, which also regularly featured Creedence Clearwater Revival covers like “Run Through The Jungle” and “Who'll Stop The Rain.” In recent years, it's became a standard last song at tour finales.

	











	The tradition began in Buffalo, New York, on November 22, 2009, on the last stop of the Working on a Dream tour, which was also the last time Springsteen performed in public with Clarence Clemons. It continued in 2012 on the last show of the European Wrecking Ball tour, and in 2016 at the final U.S show of the River tour.

	For the first time in a very long time, Springsteen now has a blank concert calendar. There will certainly be future tours, but don't expect anything on the same grand scale of this last one. “Rather than do a 130-show stretch,” he recently told Rolling Stone, “which we did this time because we had been off for six years, so I had to get back in touch with my audience, and it was fun playing with the band … in the future, I think we'll probably play more often and less dates.”

	Springsteen has a massive audience in Australia, but he hasn't toured the continent since 2017. “I'm doing my best as we speak to get down there, hopefully next year sometime,” he told Rolling Stone. “And I feel bad. I apologize to my Australian fans for not getting down on this stretch, but I want them to know that we are planning to get down there as soon as feasible, probably in the next year sometime.”


	The end of the Springsteen tour is the start of an historic three-day run for European stadium concerts. It continues Friday night at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, where Oasis will play their first concert since 2008. And it'll wrap up Saturday at Villa Park in Birmingham, England, where the original Black Sabbath lineup will play their first show in 20 years. They'll be joined by Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Steven Tyler, Sammy Hagar, and many other hard rock and heavy metal icons. For those of you who can't make it out to Birmingham, it's streaming online for $29.99.

Lana Del Rey invited Addison Rae to the stage during her U.K. and Ireland stadium tour on Thursday. The pair sang Rae's nostalgic “Diet Pepsi,” her first official release last year on Columbia Records.


	The duo also sang “57.5,” the Spotify-featuring and unreleased song Del Rey debuted at Stagecoach in April. Rae is also set to join the Honeymoon headliner during the second night of her stop at London‘s Wembley Stadium on Friday. 


	Trio London Grammar and Banks previously joined Del Rey earlier on her tour, with London Grammar helping the star launch the run on June 23 at Cardiff's Principality Stadium and Banks joining Del Rey in in Glasgow, Liverpool, and Dublin.

	Although the tour had been hinted as in support of previously-titled album, Lasso, Del Rey later announced that it would be renamed The Right Person Will Stay. After the singer said it would release May 21, she shared with fans earlier this year that the LP will not “come on time” and would get another name change.

	Meanwhile, Rae is bringing her debut album on the road and announced in June that the Addison tour will make stops across North America, Europe, and Australia as the her first headlining run set to begin in Dublin on Aug. 26.

Reporter

Orbs that glow in the night sky. A young girl reading minds. Reports of communing with non-human intelligence. UFOs shutting down nuclear missiles. Can all of this be real? 

These are just some of the phenomena explored by more than 2,300 attendees at Contact in the Desert — the world's largest UFO conference held from May 29 to June 2 at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort & Spa in Indian Wells.

Over the next few weeks, this reporter will serve as your guide into these paradigm-shifting concepts, where we'll ponder profound questions about our place in the universe. 

A blanket of stars covers the desert, a Mars-like environment so hot it nearly kills all life unwilling to adjust. 

Air conditioners break on the long drives up, while spinning windmills guard the entrance to Palm Springs — flashing red with warning, or mimicking a landing strip. Still, everyone persists on a spiritual quest for truth, toward this Mecca of madness in the desert.  

They all arrive at Contact in the Desert, the world's largest UFO and psi-phenomena conference held annually at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort in Indian Wells.

Some 2,300 people attend the five-day retreat, where more than 100 paradigm-shifting lectures and workshops explore the relationship between UFOs and nukes, AI and consciousness, possible underground bases, firsthand accounts of abductions by non-human intelligence and so much more.

But in between these mind-bending lectures, film screenings, live podcasts and demonstrations are even more ontologically shattering conversations with attendees willing to share their own personal and shocking experiences.

Outside of this open-minded group, it might be easy to dismiss these stories: communicating with the dead to help solve murders, transcending reality via DMT, near-death experiences leading to the Akashic Records, abductions resulting in implants that Stanford scientists are studying, remote viewing for the government, channeling non-human intelligence through family-member vessels, and — most grounded in reality but equally terrifying — credible death threats for researching these highly guarded secrets.

But as everyone rushes to the seven different lecture halls to explore these ideas, there is no judgment, no outright dismissal or ego-driven skepticism. Instead, every conversation is a thought experiment, exploring the far-reaches of what might be possible in our limited understanding of the universe.

There is a silent agreement upon entering the resort to wipe your shoes of sand and your minds of predetermined worldviews. This is a sacred space, where a belief in the unbelievable is the key to witnessing the phenomena firsthand, including demonstrations of telepathy, and communion with unknown objects from the sky.

It is all contained at the Esmeralda Resort, a name derived from the spiritual stone of emeralds, which in the book of Revelation, serves as a foundation for New Jerusalem, an eternal city — God's dwelling place — that comes right out of the heavens.

Journalist and documentarian Jeremy Corbell speaks as a surprise guest during a workshop titled “Are We on the Verge of Disclosure?” held on Sunday, June 1, at Contact in the Desert. 

 

Guests drop off their Teslas with a valet or park their Winnebagos in the lot. 

Speakers and experiencers sneak in through the back door of the resort, while attendees approach the front desk nervously, the last barrier of normalcy before the five-day retreat.

Since the conference started in 2013 as a small, outdoor gathering in Joshua Tree, the attendees' attire has upgraded alongside the venue. 

“This year, it feels a lot more serious,” my friend Dan mentions.

Instead of tinfoil hats, shamanic sherpas, or a blend of Star Wars, Star Trek and Stargate shirts, most wear tailored suits or sport coats despite the heat, or casual slacks with button-ups and dress shoes.

There are still bedazzled sequined shirts and silver hair styled like psychedelic chandeliers serving as spiritual antennas, but most look more like professors, donning glasses and turtlenecks, with pens peeking from pockets.

Attendees are evenly split between young and old — for every pair of gauges, a hearing aid, for every tattoo, a sunspot.

Amid the weird aunts and uncles are a former Harvard Medical School professor, retired military intelligence officials, journalists, and top-of-their-field researchers in cutting-edge areas of psychology, sociology, biology, technology, AI research, and religion.

They arrive from Canada, Australia, famous UFO hotspots like the Pacific Northwest and Sedona, but some from right here in Ojai.

There's retired U.S. Air Force Capt. Robert Salas of Ojai, a missile-propulsion engineer who experienced a UFO disabling 10 nuclear warheads at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana in 1967.

There's Mark Sims of Ojai, a Harvard Business School graduate whose 13-day encounter with a being named Tezjbar in 2012 resulted in a new understanding of consciousness evolution.

Then there's Jeremy Corbell, the subject of Ojai Magazine's Winter 2024 cover story, whose work as a journalist alongside George Knapp has led to new whistleblower testimony, congressional hearings, and the release of some of the most well-documented, military-filmed UFO footage to date.

Each attendee and speaker has a specialty, ranging from ancient histories to personal testimonies, from near-death experiences to abductions, from telepathy among nonverbal autists to remote viewing and other “downloads” of information from unknown, non-human intelligence.

In trying to decipher all this information during late nights at the bar or in all-night hotel-room roundtables, a through-line emerges called consciousness.

This is the word of the conference, mumbled by attendees in hallways and spoken into microphones by experts — a word used interchangeably by scientists and skeptics alike — blending the religious with the materialists.

But what is it? Where does it come from? And how does it serve as a potential skeleton key for unlocking all these phenomenological secrets?

Consciousness means something different to everyone.

Adam Curry, an inventor and tech entrepreneur speaking at the conference, describes it as the nature of the first-person perspective, the subjective world of what it means to be you.

This includes things you like, experiences you've had, ideas that come to you. In other words: information.

He uses the metaphor of a television. If you're only looking at the screen, you assume the programming is produced by the pixels and the TV itself. Instead, information is being sent via invisible signals through the sky, and those signals don't just disappear if a TV breaks. 

But consciousness is controversial because it sets up a new understanding of the universe, one that claims the base of our existence is information instead of physical material.

It challenges the materialist understanding of our world, which has been the dominant philosophy in academia since the 20th century. 

Materialists assert that the physical universe is all there is, so if a phenomenon cannot be explained by our tangible understanding of the world, then it is only an illusion.

It implies our minds and consciousness — and all that we subjectively experience, such as memories, emotions, goals, and spiritual epiphanies — can be reduced to electrical and chemical processes occurring in the brain, a basic interaction between physical elements, signals and synapses firing and connecting.

If this is true, it implies our consciousness and personality vanish when we die.

But emerging science in the quantum realm is challenging this paradigm. 

In quantum physics, conscious observations appear to collapse wave functions and alter outcomes, understood as the Copenhagen interpretation, which remains a scientific hot-button debate.

Author and broadcaster Anthony Peake, lecturing on near-death experiences, discusses verifiable perceptions that occur during cardiac arrest, suggesting consciousness may continue independent of brain activity.

So how does this tie back to UFOs?

Whitley Strieber is an abductee who links alien contact and UFO observations with changes in human psychic capacity and understanding.

In his popular book, “Communion,” Strieber writes that his contact with “the visitors” led to a dissolving of a sense of self and of time, where telepathic communication was exchanged and where out-of-body experiences resulted.  

Other examples include new abilities, or even “downloads” of information, like the star map drawn by Betty Hill, whose alien-abduction experience in 1961 is the first to be widely reported in the United States.

During the conference, News Nation's investigative journalist Ross Coulthart recalls a conversation he had in Washington, D.C. several years ago with a member of the intelligence community, who told him, “It's all about consciousness.” 

“I remember thinking, what the flaming heck is he talking about? This is about aliens, it's nothing to do with consciousness,” Coulthart says. “For years, I've racked my brain to try and understand why there's any connection between consciousness, the afterlife, spiritual ideas, and UFOs, but I have to admit, increasingly, I think that ‘Event Horizon' is more to do with consciousness, than it's anything to do with aliens.” Event Horizon — the theme for this year's conference — is a threshold point of no return.

All to say, perception and observation might play an important role in understanding the phenomenon. And among a crowd of several thousand all wanting to believe, that power of perception is impossible to ignore. When everyone wants to believe, you'll start believing and experiencing things yourself, skeptic or not.

Synchronicities are common over the long weekend, like bumping into people you were just thinking about, thinking of words and then having them spoken aloud by someone else, finding what you thought you were missing at the next lecture hall, or meeting people exploring similar ideas, as if the universe is bringing it all together as part of a cosmic blanket woven in real time.

You can't help but succumb to the feeling.

So instead of trying to prove to you one way or the other what happened at Contact in the Desert, I'll share some of my experiences, and the way I perceived them.

The burden of belief will be up to you. 

Next week: Orbs in the sky

BERLIN, Md. – A new attraction has opened in Berlin, offering community members a chance to explore local paranormal activity.

Ivy Wells, Berlin's economic and community development director, said the new space will foster greater community engagement.

“We're so excited the ghost museum is here. It's a spirited addition to downtown Berlin, where many entrepreneurs want to open businesses, but space is limited. So, we're taking underutilized spaces and being innovative with them,” Wells said.

Founded in 2024, the Ghost Museum brings history to the community. Jessica Ader, a staff member at the museum, explains that the museum aims to both educate and entertain.

“Our goal for the museum is to take visitors through the history of ghost folklore and how spiritualism has developed since the advent of the daguerreotype in photography,” Ader said.

The museum is located at 11 Pitts Street in Berlin. Visitors can access the space by climbing a staircase and passing through ominous curtains. The museum follows a rule: “No phones; no elevators.”

When the museum opened in late June, there were days when 200 people visited, according to Ader.

“Our sister business is a mermaid attraction located at the corner of Jefferson and Main streets, so we were hoping those visitors would come here, and we were met with great success,” Ader said.

Wells believes the museum will be a lasting attraction.

“We hope the ghost museum lasts a very long time here and continues to haunt Berlin for generations to come,” she said.

With fifteen seasons and multiple spin-off attempts, Supernatural had three different endings, but one works far better than the other two. Created by Eric Kripke, Supernatural followed brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester as they traveled around the country hunting monsters. Although Kripke initially planned the story to span only three seasons, he later expanded that to include five seasons. Supernatural ended up running for 15 seasons, continuing even after Kripke departed the show after season 5.

With its unique blend of horror, humor, and heart, Supernatural developed a cult following that remains strong even today. Supernatural began as a story of two brothers searching for their father and hunting down the yellow-eyed demon that killed their mother. As the show progressed, however, it developed a complex mythology involving angels and demons, as Sam and Dean Winchester stood against both the Devil and God. Supernatural's first major story arc came to a close at the end of its fifth season, while the show's official series finale did not come until the end of season 15.

After a few seasons following Sam and Dean's monster hunts, the angel Castiel (Misha Collins) made his debut at the start of Supernatural's fourth season and changed the trajectory of the show. Although Sam and Dean were meant to be pawns in the apocalyptic war between Heaven and Hell, they fought to save the world and hold onto their free will. This epic saga concluded in the breathtaking season 5 finale ""Swan Song,"" which saw Sam sacrifice himself by jumping into Hell, leaving Dean to live out some semblance of a normal life.

On a June 2025 episode of the Supernatural rewatch podcast, Supernatural Then and Now, Eric Kripke revealed that his original plans for the ending implied that Dean's daughter, Samantha, would end up as a hunter just like her father.

While most fans will agree that ""Swan Song"" is one of the show's best episodes, the Supernatural season 15 finale ""Carry On"" proved to be significantly more divisive. After defeating God himself in the previous episode, Sam and Dean embark on a seemingly routine vampire hunt. However, Dean is impaled on a spike during the fight and ultimately dies from his wounds, bringing a lackluster ending to a character who had sacrificed so much. In this finale, it's Sam who gets to live out the rest of his life in relative normalcy before eventually joining his brother in Heaven.

Dean Winchester was killed in the controversial Supernatural series finale, but the franchise gave him a more fitting epilogue two years later.

After Dean's unfortunate ending (and Sam's unfortunate wig) in ""Carry On,"" the Supernatural spin-off, The Winchesters added an epilogue of sorts to Dean's story. The Winchesters was initially billed as a prequel detailing the story of Sam and Dean's parents, Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) and John Winchester (Drake Rodger). However, Dean Winchester himself popped up in The Winchesters series finale, visiting from Heaven and revealing that the events of the show actually occurred in an alternate universe. This ending added another layer to Dean's story, proving that he's still saving the universe even after his own death.

 Thanks to episodes like season 6's ""The French Mistake"" and season 11's ""Baby,"" among others, I'm ultimately glad Supernatural continued beyond season 5. Still, ""Swan Song"" would have been Supernatural's perfect ending. Sam and Dean both ended the episode as heroes, having saved the world and prevented the apocalypse. They successfully stood up against some of the biggest forces in the universe, refusing to be used as pawns, and won.

It would have been tragic to end with Sam suffering in Hell, but perhaps the ending of ""Swan Song"" could have been altered to show him being raised to Heaven in light of his sacrifice.

If Supernatural had ended here, it would have been a fitting finale for the Winchester saga. It's tragic and emotional, but also represents a victory for humanity against the forces of evil. After Sam's sacrificial death in ""Swan Song,"" Dean would have eventually learned to let go of his brother and finally find a life beyond hunting. ""Swan Song"" truly is a brilliant episode of television and a satisfying ending to Supernatural's first chapter.

Most of The Winchesters' story focused on Mary, John, and their friends, and the show ultimately lacked the spark that made Supernatural such a success. Dean Winchester's return in The Winchesters made his Supernatural death a little less tragic, but it's an odd place to end the Winchester saga. While it's nice to imagine Dean traveling the multiverse, still saving people and hunting things, his appearance in The Winchesters didn't feel like an ending.

In The Winchesters finale, Dean revealed that he had been searching for a universe in which his family got a happy ending, when he discovered the Akrida and their threat to the multiverse. With some help from Jack (Alexander Calvert) and Bobby (Jim Beaver), Dean helped save the day yet again, setting this version of his parents up for success. Still, it remains unknown what Dean did next or how exactly his detour fits in with Supernatural's finale. Thankfully, the door remains open for more Supernatural, and I hope Dean Winchester's story, in particular, eventually gets another chapter or two.

Love supernatural. My favorite show 

Supernatural season 16 is discussed by cast and crew a whole lot with no sign of starting, and Jensen Ackles has revealed why that may be.

EXCLUSIVE: Jessica Green discusses her role as Charlie Cornwall in The Librarians: The Next Chapter and Christian Kane's return as Jacob Stone.

The Wild West was one of The Far Side's most recognizable settings; these cartoons are some of the wildest cowboy jokes Gary Larson ever produced.

From network television to streaming, TV shows can get canceled for a number of reasons, even when they are actually great from start to finish.

I'm even more excited for Stranger Things season 5's new director after seeing his recent sci-fi horror masterpiece with a 95% Rotten Tomatoes score.

A brand-new Resident Evil game titled Resident Evil Survival Unit, will be officially revealed next week during a livestream event.

Squid Game season 3 included the show's most controversial death, but it made complete sense - the series couldn't have ended any other way.","{'href': 'https://screenrant.com', 'title': 'Screen Rant'}","other"

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reportedly suggested that supernatural forces might have been responsible for the technical issues during President Donald Trump's recent call with faith leaders.

 She commented, “There is spiritual warfare as we all know. It tried to break up our call today, as the president even alluded to.” 

According to liberal group Meidas Touch, Leavitt made these comments during the same call.

Prior to that, White House Faith Director Jenny Korn had expressed frustration with the situation, saying they were “waiting for AT&T to get its act together,” pointing to the service provider as the cause.

On Monday, Trump appeared to seek technical support in a social media post, stating that a conference call with American faith leaders had experienced difficulties, which he attributed to the telecommunications company AT&T.

He called on the company's ""boss, whoever that may be"" to step in and address the issue. Trump also mentioned that his team might switch to a different carrier for future calls.

""I'm doing a major Conference Call with Faith Leaders from all over the Country, and AT&T is totally unable to make their equipment work properly. This is the second time it's happened. If the Boss of AT&T, whoever that may be, could get involved — It would be good. There are tens of thousands of people on the line!"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Monday afternoon.

Reporter

Orbs that glow in the night sky. A young girl reading minds. Reports of communing with non-human intelligence. UFOs shutting down nuclear missiles. Can all of this be real? 

These are just some of the phenomena explored by more than 2,300 attendees at Contact in the Desert — the world's largest UFO conference held from May 29 to June 2 at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort & Spa in Indian Wells.

Over the next few weeks, this reporter will serve as your guide into these paradigm-shifting concepts, where we'll ponder profound questions about our place in the universe. 

A blanket of stars covers the desert, a Mars-like environment so hot it nearly kills all life unwilling to adjust. 

Air conditioners break on the long drives up, while spinning windmills guard the entrance to Palm Springs — flashing red with warning, or mimicking a landing strip. Still, everyone persists on a spiritual quest for truth, toward this Mecca of madness in the desert.  

They all arrive at Contact in the Desert, the world's largest UFO and psi-phenomena conference held annually at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort in Indian Wells.

Some 2,300 people attend the five-day retreat, where more than 100 paradigm-shifting lectures and workshops explore the relationship between UFOs and nukes, AI and consciousness, possible underground bases, firsthand accounts of abductions by non-human intelligence and so much more.

But in between these mind-bending lectures, film screenings, live podcasts and demonstrations are even more ontologically shattering conversations with attendees willing to share their own personal and shocking experiences.

Outside of this open-minded group, it might be easy to dismiss these stories: communicating with the dead to help solve murders, transcending reality via DMT, near-death experiences leading to the Akashic Records, abductions resulting in implants that Stanford scientists are studying, remote viewing for the government, channeling non-human intelligence through family-member vessels, and — most grounded in reality but equally terrifying — credible death threats for researching these highly guarded secrets.

But as everyone rushes to the seven different lecture halls to explore these ideas, there is no judgment, no outright dismissal or ego-driven skepticism. Instead, every conversation is a thought experiment, exploring the far-reaches of what might be possible in our limited understanding of the universe.

There is a silent agreement upon entering the resort to wipe your shoes of sand and your minds of predetermined worldviews. This is a sacred space, where a belief in the unbelievable is the key to witnessing the phenomena firsthand, including demonstrations of telepathy, and communion with unknown objects from the sky.

It is all contained at the Esmeralda Resort, a name derived from the spiritual stone of emeralds, which in the book of Revelation, serves as a foundation for New Jerusalem, an eternal city — God's dwelling place — that comes right out of the heavens.

Journalist and documentarian Jeremy Corbell speaks as a surprise guest during a workshop titled “Are We on the Verge of Disclosure?” held on Sunday, June 1, at Contact in the Desert. 

 

Guests drop off their Teslas with a valet or park their Winnebagos in the lot. 

Speakers and experiencers sneak in through the back door of the resort, while attendees approach the front desk nervously, the last barrier of normalcy before the five-day retreat.

Since the conference started in 2013 as a small, outdoor gathering in Joshua Tree, the attendees' attire has upgraded alongside the venue. 

“This year, it feels a lot more serious,” my friend Dan mentions.

Instead of tinfoil hats, shamanic sherpas, or a blend of Star Wars, Star Trek and Stargate shirts, most wear tailored suits or sport coats despite the heat, or casual slacks with button-ups and dress shoes.

There are still bedazzled sequined shirts and silver hair styled like psychedelic chandeliers serving as spiritual antennas, but most look more like professors, donning glasses and turtlenecks, with pens peeking from pockets.

Attendees are evenly split between young and old — for every pair of gauges, a hearing aid, for every tattoo, a sunspot.

Amid the weird aunts and uncles are a former Harvard Medical School professor, retired military intelligence officials, journalists, and top-of-their-field researchers in cutting-edge areas of psychology, sociology, biology, technology, AI research, and religion.

They arrive from Canada, Australia, famous UFO hotspots like the Pacific Northwest and Sedona, but some from right here in Ojai.

There's retired U.S. Air Force Capt. Robert Salas of Ojai, a missile-propulsion engineer who experienced a UFO disabling 10 nuclear warheads at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana in 1967.

There's Mark Sims of Ojai, a Harvard Business School graduate whose 13-day encounter with a being named Tezjbar in 2012 resulted in a new understanding of consciousness evolution.

Then there's Jeremy Corbell, the subject of Ojai Magazine's Winter 2024 cover story, whose work as a journalist alongside George Knapp has led to new whistleblower testimony, congressional hearings, and the release of some of the most well-documented, military-filmed UFO footage to date.

Each attendee and speaker has a specialty, ranging from ancient histories to personal testimonies, from near-death experiences to abductions, from telepathy among nonverbal autists to remote viewing and other “downloads” of information from unknown, non-human intelligence.

In trying to decipher all this information during late nights at the bar or in all-night hotel-room roundtables, a through-line emerges called consciousness.

This is the word of the conference, mumbled by attendees in hallways and spoken into microphones by experts — a word used interchangeably by scientists and skeptics alike — blending the religious with the materialists.

But what is it? Where does it come from? And how does it serve as a potential skeleton key for unlocking all these phenomenological secrets?

Consciousness means something different to everyone.

Adam Curry, an inventor and tech entrepreneur speaking at the conference, describes it as the nature of the first-person perspective, the subjective world of what it means to be you.

This includes things you like, experiences you've had, ideas that come to you. In other words: information.

He uses the metaphor of a television. If you're only looking at the screen, you assume the programming is produced by the pixels and the TV itself. Instead, information is being sent via invisible signals through the sky, and those signals don't just disappear if a TV breaks. 

But consciousness is controversial because it sets up a new understanding of the universe, one that claims the base of our existence is information instead of physical material.

It challenges the materialist understanding of our world, which has been the dominant philosophy in academia since the 20th century. 

Materialists assert that the physical universe is all there is, so if a phenomenon cannot be explained by our tangible understanding of the world, then it is only an illusion.

It implies our minds and consciousness — and all that we subjectively experience, such as memories, emotions, goals, and spiritual epiphanies — can be reduced to electrical and chemical processes occurring in the brain, a basic interaction between physical elements, signals and synapses firing and connecting.

If this is true, it implies our consciousness and personality vanish when we die.

But emerging science in the quantum realm is challenging this paradigm. 

In quantum physics, conscious observations appear to collapse wave functions and alter outcomes, understood as the Copenhagen interpretation, which remains a scientific hot-button debate.

Author and broadcaster Anthony Peake, lecturing on near-death experiences, discusses verifiable perceptions that occur during cardiac arrest, suggesting consciousness may continue independent of brain activity.

So how does this tie back to UFOs?

Whitley Strieber is an abductee who links alien contact and UFO observations with changes in human psychic capacity and understanding.

In his popular book, “Communion,” Strieber writes that his contact with “the visitors” led to a dissolving of a sense of self and of time, where telepathic communication was exchanged and where out-of-body experiences resulted.  

Other examples include new abilities, or even “downloads” of information, like the star map drawn by Betty Hill, whose alien-abduction experience in 1961 is the first to be widely reported in the United States.

During the conference, News Nation's investigative journalist Ross Coulthart recalls a conversation he had in Washington, D.C. several years ago with a member of the intelligence community, who told him, “It's all about consciousness.” 

“I remember thinking, what the flaming heck is he talking about? This is about aliens, it's nothing to do with consciousness,” Coulthart says. “For years, I've racked my brain to try and understand why there's any connection between consciousness, the afterlife, spiritual ideas, and UFOs, but I have to admit, increasingly, I think that ‘Event Horizon' is more to do with consciousness, than it's anything to do with aliens.” Event Horizon — the theme for this year's conference — is a threshold point of no return.

All to say, perception and observation might play an important role in understanding the phenomenon. And among a crowd of several thousand all wanting to believe, that power of perception is impossible to ignore. When everyone wants to believe, you'll start believing and experiencing things yourself, skeptic or not.

Synchronicities are common over the long weekend, like bumping into people you were just thinking about, thinking of words and then having them spoken aloud by someone else, finding what you thought you were missing at the next lecture hall, or meeting people exploring similar ideas, as if the universe is bringing it all together as part of a cosmic blanket woven in real time.

You can't help but succumb to the feeling.

So instead of trying to prove to you one way or the other what happened at Contact in the Desert, I'll share some of my experiences, and the way I perceived them.

The burden of belief will be up to you.

Laura Day is a longtime best friend of Demi Moore, bestselling author, intuitive advisor and consultant to billion-dollar corporations. 

She has quietly helped some of the world's most powerful people make their biggest decisions - from CEOs and studio heads to top-tier creatives and celebrities.

Now, among her teachings in a new book The Prism, Day distills three core principles she believes can transform anyone's life: focus on intuition, focus on healing and focus on human connection. 

She believes these aren't abstract ideas, rather they're learnable skills grounded in decades of personal experience, scientific inquiry and client success.

Speaking with the Daily Mail, Day breaks down these principles to help readers get a better understanding of her work and what they can do to shift their lives. 

Before she gained international recognition, Day was a young girl left to manage chaos in a New York apartment, relying on instinct to navigate her mother's mental health crises and the demands of raising her younger siblings.

'I think I developed my intuition as a survival skill, both to predict my mother's suicide attempts and just to know how to deal with emergencies,' she said.

Intuitive advisor Laura Day has helped celebrities and CEOs tap into their instincts for decades - with a no-nonsense, science-backed approach

Laura Day (left) and her best friend, actress Demi Moore (right), have supported each other through career highs and personal challenges for over 30 years 

Raised largely without supervision, Day developed a heightened sensitivity to her environment. Two of her siblings would later die by suicide. 'I really am, in a sense, the survivor - and not just surviving, thriving,' she told the Daily Mail.

That survival instinct blossomed into something much more: an intuitive brain uniquely tapped in to the unseen.

In the early 1980s, Day became a subject in military and university experiments on extrasensory perception, or ESP. 

'I got passed around to a bunch of different researchers, which was fun for me, because I wanted to understand how my brain worked,' she said. One televised segment led to an instant following.

Unlike many self-proclaimed psychics, Day didn't enter the field through mysticism. With a lineage of doctors - her father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all physicians - her approach to intuition has always been grounded in science and verifiable results.

'Intuition is not a belief, it's a tool - it gives data. You can prove or disprove data,' she said.

That pragmatic view is the foundation of her new book, The Prism: Seven Steps to Heal Your Past and Transform Your Future - a step-by-step guide to rewiring the ego, reshaping behavior, and creating the life you want through small, external shifts.

'The Prism is really about the reality that we are, in a sense, mechanical beings in a mechanical world,' she explained. 'There are tiny changes that we can make, that change everything. But they don't happen from within us.'

Day argues that conventional self-help has it backward. 

'There's this big thing of ""look for your trauma, search within,""' she said. 'If the answer were within, you wouldn't be asking the question. And reliving your trauma? That just re-traumatizes.'

Instead, her method is action-based, built around the simple premise that change happens externally first.

'Everyone says, ""change yourself to change your life"" - but you are the box, you can't think outside of it,' she said. 'Sometimes, making a tiny change and getting exactly what you want is the greatest healing - because then you have to adapt to it.'

Day calls the ego 'the Prism' because it refracts experience into form. 

'The Prism is the structure through which a human being takes the energy we share and creates in the external world,' she said. 

Whether it's building a relationship, forming a habit or navigating a crisis, she believes the key is not mystical alignment but mechanical redirection. 

'Celebrating my wise, inspiring friend @lauradayintuit and the launch of her spectacular new book 'The Prism'' said Moore in an Instagram post dedicated to her longtime intuit friend

Day's new book, The Prism, offers a step-by-step guide to creating real-life change through small, intentional shifts

'Energy does nothing until you channel it - into a chair, a job, a body, a relationship.'

She trains people to identify patterns formed before the age of seven, which she believes lock us into repetitive cycles unless disrupted. 

'You don't see what you don't see,' she said. 'We repeat our patterns over and over again, just dressed up a little differently.'

Her solution? Interrupt the cycle. 

'Pick that one suggestion you think is ridiculous, that makes you roll your eyes. Practice it for a day. Notice what changes. If something changes and you like it, then you're on the right road.'

Despite her mainstream appeal, Day doesn't shy away from challenging woo-woo thinking. 

'Spirituality that isn't practical is called fantasy,' she said. 'Positive thinking - if a bullet's coming at you and you don't move, it's going to hit you; I don't care how positively you're thinking.'

Instead, she embraces what she calls 'empowered, realistic thinking.' In her words, 'I can't do this yet; I don't have this yet; that's scary information - but let me find empowered solutions.'

She's tested her theories on thousands of students and clients over decades. 

'I have two companies I've worked with for over 30 years,' she said. 'I don't want to be fringe. I work with doctors. I work with scientists. I'm not interested in making people believe - I'm interested in what works.'

Her clientele includes celebrities, though she declines to name names. One of her closest public friendships is with actress Demi Moore, who has credited Day with helping her navigate personal upheaval and life transitions. 

'They come to me with the same concerns everyone else does,' Day said of her famous clients. 'Should I take this job? Who should I hire? And just like everyone else, they don't listen to what they don't want to hear.'

Still, she understands their unique pressures. 

'Celebrities are just like us, but under a microscope. I love my life because I get all the privilege of celebrity and none of the risk. I can go to the bathroom in peace.'

Day says people need to tap in to the people they have around them to achieve success. 

'Know that you don't have the answer - it's not inside of you. You know, do something that's safe but doesn't resonate with you at all at the suggestion of someone who you usually disagree with, because that will challenge your old structure. 

'Also have at least one goal. Because goals contextualize all the experience that comes to you. It also contextualizes everything you see around you. It is a formatting system, and we tend to have worries and fears and fantasies, but not goals. Goals are really important.'

She gave an example of someone who is looking for love and advised them to 'Find a group, a person, a situation of people who already have it. 

'If you're looking for love, don't go to a singles event. Go to dinner with five happily married friends. Absorb that energy.

'It's really, really important also to not make it a solitary process. I mean, one thing intuition teaches us is we're never alone.'

Her work also addresses the tension between spiritual aspiration and real-world implementation. 

Corporations worth billions have turned to Day for insight - though she insists, 'I'm not interested in belief. I'm interested in what works'. Laura has appeared on The Jennifer Hudson Show to speak about her book

'What is more spiritual than being in love, than creating a company that employs people, than creating a body that interacts with your environment?' she said. 'Spiritual tools that don't produce real-world results? That's fantasy. Fantasy tools give you fantasy results.'

Day applies this philosophy to her own life. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer following the suicides of her sister and brother, she held a public healing service just before her surgery. 

'I asked the audience for their healing energy - and I expected it to work,' she said. 

Her tumor shrank by a third. 

'But I still had the surgery. I wanted to do everything. And by the way, I got the t*ts of a 20-year-old because I insisted on a double mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy.'

For Day, even success demands adaptation. 'The real work isn't getting what you want. The real work is becoming the person who can live with it.'

And that, ultimately, is the core of The Prism: not self-improvement for its own sake, but transformation through action. 

'Creating what you want in the world is your job,' she said. 'And once you've done that, your next job is to help others create it too.'

The Prism: Seven Steps to Heal Your Past and Transform Your Future by Laura Day is out now published by Penguin Publishing Group.

Georgia remains a key target for Moscow's hybrid operations. Combining some direct physical actions with influence campaigns, the Kremlin aims to convince the country that its presence and power are a natural state of affairs.

Psychological operations (psyops) are planned activities designed to influence the emotions, motives, reasoning and behaviour of individuals, groups or societies to achieve strategic objectives. This is often achieved through the use of information, symbols and actions. In military and geopolitical contexts, psyops aim to weaken an adversary's resolve, sow confusion, or shape perceptions to align with the operator's goals. Unlike propaganda, which primarily focuses on disseminating information – often biased or misleading – to shape public opinion through mass media, psyops encompass a broader range of tactics. For example, they can involve physical actions, psychological manipulation and targeted messaging, often with a specific strategic intent. While propaganda seeks to persuade through widespread narratives, psyops are more calculated, often covert, and may involve direct interventions like troop movements or staged events to create psychological effects.

Since the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Moscow has employed a sophisticated array of psychological operations aimed at weakening Georgia's sovereignty, eroding societal resilience, and reinforcing its dominance in the South Caucasus. These operations, often orchestrated with the involvement of Russian military intelligence (GRU), exploit Georgia's historical traumas, geopolitical vulnerabilities, and aspirations for western integration. This article explores three key psychological operations Russia has conducted in Georgia since 2013: the creeping annexation and kidnappings along the Administrative Boundary Line (ABL); the persistent threat of war to instil fear; and the propagation of narratives that demoralize Georgian society while promoting the myth of an invincible Russia with a legitimate claim to regional dominance.

Creeping annexation and kidnappings: eroding sovereignty and societal resolve

One of Russia's most visible psychological operations in Georgia is the strategy of a “creeping annexation” along the Administrative Boundary Line (ABL) separating Georgia from the Russian-occupied regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Since 2013, Russian and separatist forces have incrementally advanced the ABL deeper into Georgian territory, often under the cover of night, by moving border markers, installing barbed wire fences, and erecting “State Border” signs. This process, known as “borderization”, has resulted in the loss of farmland, homes and livelihoods for Georgian villagers, who sometimes wake up to find their properties suddenly within occupied territory. For instance, in the village of Tamarasheni, South Ossetian troops and their Russian allies shifted border poles overnight, forcing farmers to harvest crops under a 72-hour ultimatum before being expelled. Unlike propaganda, which might amplify these actions through media, this psyop relies on the physical act of borderization to instil fear and helplessness directly in affected communities.

The psychological impact of this operation is profound. By repeatedly violating Georgia's territorial integrity in small, incremental steps, Russia tests the resilience of Georgian society and its government. The constant threat of losing more land creates a pervasive sense of insecurity. Villagers living near the ABL face the daily risk of arbitrary detention or kidnapping by Russian-controlled forces, with over 126 Georgians illegally detained in 2017 alone for “illegal border crossing”. These detentions, sometimes involving minors or elderly individuals, are rarely investigated by the de facto authorities, fostering a climate of impunity that further demoralizes local communities. The deliberate use of kidnappings as a psyop tactic, rather than mere propaganda, targets specific communities to create a direct psychological effect, amplifying fear beyond what media narratives alone could achieve.

This strategy is designed to exhaust Georgian resistance over time. By 2013, the initial outrage over borderization began to wane as communities grew fatigued by the unrelenting pressure. The lack of a robust international response – beyond statements from the EU and US – has amplified this fatigue, as Georgians perceive their plight as being ignored by the global community. The psychological toll is evident in the stagnation of villages near the ABL, where economic activity has plummeted, and residents live in fear of straying too far from home. The message Russia sends is clear: Georgia's sovereignty is fragile, and resistance is futile against a determined occupier.

The threat of war: exploiting Georgia's traumatic past

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, another psychological operation has gained prominence: the deliberate amplification of war rhetoric to scare Georgians into submission. Georgia's traumatic history with Russia, particularly the devastating 2008 war that resulted in the loss of 20 per cent of its territory, makes its population highly susceptible to fears of renewed conflict. Russian psyops exploit this trauma by perpetuating narratives that warn of imminent war unless Georgia aligns with Moscow's interests. This operation intensified in 2022, as Russia's actions in Ukraine served as a stark reminder of its willingness to use military force against perceived adversaries.

The Kremlin has promoted the idea that pursuing NATO or EU membership will provoke Russia into another devastating war. For example, in 2024, political campaigns in Georgia featured billboards contrasting peaceful Georgian cities with devastated Ukrainian ones, implying that resistance to Russia risks a similar fate. This messaging taps into the collective memory of the 2008 war, where Russian forces overwhelmed Georgia in just five days, displacing thousands and leaving lasting scars. By framing Russia as a guarantor of peace, the Kremlin seeks to deter Georgia from pursuing its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. While propaganda might spread these narratives through media, the psyop incorporates real-world actions, such as Russian troop movements near the ABL, to heighten the perceived threat.

Russian military intelligence has played a key role in amplifying these threats. The GRU has been linked to disinformation campaigns, including statements from Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) accusing the West of plotting a “Tbilisi Maidan” to destabilize Georgia. These claims, disseminated through Russian media, aim to sow fear of western-induced chaos and position Russia as a stabilizing force. The psychological effect is to paralyze Georgian society, making alignment with Moscow seem like the only path to avoid catastrophic conflict.

Demoralization and the myth of invincible Russia

Perhaps the most insidious psychological operation is Russia's effort to demoralize Georgian society by promoting the narrative that resistance is pointless and that Moscow is an invincible force with a legitimate right to dominate the South Caucasus. This operation, which gained momentum in 2024, seeks to erode Georgia's national morale and undermine its democratic aspirations. By portraying Russia as an unstoppable power, the Kremlin aims to instil a sense of futility, convincing Georgians that no matter their efforts – whether political, economic or military – Russia will ultimately prevail. Unlike propaganda, which might rely solely on media to spread this narrative, this psyop includes tangible actions like asset transfers to reinforce Russia's dominance.

This narrative is propagated through a combination of disinformation and economic coercion. Russian-backed media and organizations in Georgia, reportedly numbering in the dozens, spread anti-western messages, downplay Russia's occupation of Georgian territories, and whitewash its aggression. For instance, in 2024, statements emerged claiming that Russia's actions in Georgia and Ukraine were defensive responses to western provocation. Such narratives aim to shift blame from Moscow and erode trust in western institutions.

The myth of Russia's invincibility is further reinforced through symbolic actions, such as the transfer of strategic assets like the Bichvinta Dacha in Abkhazia to Russian control in 2024. This move, framed as a legitimate assertion of Russian influence, signals to Georgians that Moscow can act with impunity in their territory. The GRU's involvement in these operations is evident in the sophisticated coordination of propaganda, which often portrays Russia as the natural hegemon of the South Caucasus, entitled to dictate Georgia's foreign policy.

Economic interdependence is another tool in this psychological arsenal. Russia's trade with Georgia reached 2.39 billion US dollars in 2023, a 47 per cent increase from 2021. This fostered a dependency that undermines Georgia's ability to resist Russian influence. By controlling key economic levers, Russia reinforces the perception that Georgia cannot thrive without Moscow's approval. This economic coercion, combined with disinformation, creates a demoralizing narrative: Georgia's efforts to align with the West are doomed to fail, and submission to Russia is inevitable.

The role of Russian military intelligence

Russian military intelligence, particularly the GRU, has been instrumental in orchestrating these psychological operations. The GRU's expertise in hybrid warfare – combining disinformation, cyber operations and proxy activities – has enabled Russia to wage a relentless campaign against Georgia's national psyche. From coordinating borderization efforts to disseminating propaganda through various channels, the GRU ensures that these operations are executed with precision and maximum psychological impact. The 2008 war itself was a precursor to these tactics, with Russian forces rehearsing operations in the Caucasus 2008 exercise and deploying proxies like the Vostok Battalion to sow chaos.

A battle for Georgia's soul

Russia's psychological operations in Georgia since 2013 represent a calculated effort to undermine the country's sovereignty and demoralize its people. Creeping annexation and kidnappings erode territorial control and societal resilience; the threat of war exploits historical traumas to deter western alignment; and the myth of Russia's invincibility fosters despair and submission. These operations, driven by Russian military intelligence, have pushed Georgia to a crossroads, where it must choose between succumbing to Moscow's influence or rallying international support to preserve its democratic aspirations.

Trump, Putin and the future of Ukraine

Yesterday's (un)forgotten co-existence



The consequences of Russia's invasion are visible not only in Ukraine. The Kremlin has set off or exploited a series of crises that face most European countries.

New thinking is needed in policies towards Russia, in whatever form it will take after the war. 

Ukraine's suffering goes well beyond the front line.

With Russia's invasion of Ukraine we now see our western values under siege, whether we consciously recognise it or not. 

The invasion by Russian forces of Ukraine from the north, south and east – with the initial aim to take the capital Kyiv – has changed our region, and indeed our world, forever. 

The situation with Russian threats towards Ukraine once again illustrates the high level of instability in our region.

Only a year ago we witnessed the second Nagorno-Karabakh war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It took at least 5,000 lives and significantly shifted the geopolitics in the South Caucuses.

This special issue aims to honour the plight of Belarusians whose democratic choice made in August 2020 was shamelessly snubbed by Alyaksandr Lukashenka.

From the social, economic and political points of view, a lot of work still remains for this country. And this is why Ukraine's story is incomplete.

30 years after the fall of the Soviet Union

And what lies ahead for our region...

Our societies are more polarised than ever before, which makes them more susceptible to disinformation, untruth and conspiracy theories. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed limitations and weaknesses in nearly all countries around the world.

The case of Georgia

Its costs, challenges and the commitment to peace.

Uncertainty, volatility and the relationship between Russia and the West.

A true makeover or cosmetic change?

The Black Sea region is quickly becoming a geopolitical battleground which is gaining the interest of major powers, regional players and smaller countries – and the stakes are only getting higher.

This issue is dedicated to the 10 year anniversary of the European Union's Eastern Partnership as well as the 30 years since the 1989 revolutions in Central Europe.

The consequences of the emerging multipolar world.

This issue takes a special look at the role and responsibility of the public intellectual in Central and Eastern Europe today.

In the eastern parts of the European continent, 1918 is remembered not only as the end of the First World War, but also saw the emergence of newly-independent states and the rise of geopolitical struggles which are felt until this day.

It often seems, at least from the outside, that Belarus remains isolated from the West and very static in its transformation. Yet, despite its relative isolation, Belarus is indeed changing.

A state senator from Pennsylvania has raised concerns in the scientific community with new, conspiracy-peddling legislation opposing solar geoengineering, The Daily Climate reported. 

Sen. Doug Mastriano cited several baseless conspiracy theories to support his proposed legislation, which would outlaw several burgeoning technologies and potential climate interventions that could potentially help Pennsylvanians. 

The Republican representing Franklin and Adams counties mostly spoke of the debunked ""chemtrail"" conspiracies, which theorize that high-flying aircraft are polluting the atmosphere with toxic chemicals, and he attempted to persuade legislators that this false rumor is linked with geoengineering. However, as several scientists explained to The Daily Climate, this is false on several levels. 

Geoengineering is a blanket term for a host of conceptual strategies that would look to combat atmospheric warming directly, in order to supplement ongoing, yet slow-moving, efforts to lower emissions in other ways. 

One of these potential geoengineering methods, solar radiation modification, would use strategic aerosol particles at upper levels of the atmosphere in order to reflect some sunlight back into space.

""The science remains mostly theoretical, and no government has authorized deployment,"" The Daily Climate explained. ""Yet false claims linking the field to harmful 'chemtrail' plots have gained traction in some political circles.""

The Pennsylvania Capital-Star, reporting on the story, spoke with Joshua Horton, a project manager at the Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program. He explained that modeling evidence for solar geoengineering ""suggests it would cause little harm, and the small amount of outdoor field research already conducted has not harmed the environment."" But most importantly, he clarified, the potential technology is far from widespread use — or any use at all.

""To be clear, there is no geoengineering going on,"" he stated. ""There's no solar radiation modification going on. So to the extent that this bill is premised on the belief that it's happening, it's just factually incorrect.""

Not only does the deliberate spreading of mis- and disinformation confuse communities, but it can put them at increased risk of danger. For example, in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, baseless conspiracy theories led to death threats and a loss of trust in meteorologists, putting both rescue and research efforts at risk.

The Capital-Star also spoke with Michael Thompson, managing director at the nonprofit Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Engineering, who expressed his disappointment in the legislation.

""Lawmakers know better than this and should do minimal homework before bringing bills to their legislative bodies,"" he said. ""We are concerned generally that legislation aimed at governing or banning non-existent activities, such as non-existent chemtrails, disempowers and distracts, rather than enabling citizens to engage with decisions being made now that will impact them in the future.""

The bill is currently awaiting consideration in the Senate Agriculture and Rural Affairs Committee.

A NASA astronaut has captured an electrifying image of Earth from space, featuring a gigantic, jellyfish-shaped ""sprite"" of red lightning shooting upwards above a thunderstorm in North America. The rare phenomenon is still poorly understood, despite being studied for more than 30 years.

Nichole Ayers, the pilot of SpaceX's Crew-10 mission and member of International Space Station (ISS) expeditions 72 and 73, snapped the striking photo on Thursday (July 3) as the space station passed above a large thunderstorm hanging over parts of Mexico and the southern U.S., including California and Texas.

""Just. Wow. As we went over Mexico and the U.S. this morning, I caught this sprite,"" Ayers wrote on the social platform X. ""Sprites are TLEs or Transient Luminous Events, that happen above the clouds and are triggered by intense electrical activity in the thunderstorms below,"" she added.

TLEs are a range of visual phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere during thunderstorms, including upward-shooting blue jets and UFO-like rings of light, known as ELVES. However, the most common TLEs are sprites, like the one photographed by Ayers.

Sprites are sometimes referred to as jellyfish because they contain multiple branches of light that spread out like tentacles, while others call them ""carrots"" because they can be accompanied by fainter tendrils that trail behind them in the opposite direction like plant roots. They are often associated with large thunderstorms, including those produced by hurricanes.

Sprites can range in size and shape, with the largest reaching up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth's surface. They have a red color because they interact with nitrogen in the upper atmosphere, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

Sprites were first properly observed in the 1950s by airline passengers but were not photographed until 1989. The red jellyfish have also been spotted in the atmosphere of Jupiter, and they are thought to occur on Saturn and Venus, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com.

But despite years of research, researchers are still unsure why some lightning strikes cause sprites and others don't, according to FOX Weather.

Sprites and other TLEs can be photographed from Earth's surface if the conditions are right. However, ISS astronauts are uniquely well-positioned to see TLEs and frequently see the flashes of lightning strikes at the same time, providing useful data to help researchers figure out how these phenomena work.

—What happens if you get struck by lightning… and survive?

—Why does lightning zigzag?

—What's the longest lightning bolt ever recorded?

""We have a great view above the clouds, so scientists can use these types of pictures to better understand the formation, characteristics, and relationship of TLEs to thunderstorms,"" Ayers wrote.

One of the most recent examples of this was in March, when an unnamed ISS astronaut snapped faint red sprites glowing at the end of a ""gigantic jet"" of lightning shooting upward above New Orleans.

Another excellent example was an eerie red jellyfish that seemed to float independently in Earth's atmosphere, high above a flash of lightning in June 2024, Space.com previously reported.

The White House lawn is usually where Donald Trump delivers brutal slapdowns of his political opponents before the world's media.

Next year, it could become the political battleground could be transformed into a ring, with the world's top fighters facing off in an Ultimate Fighting Champion (UFC) championship bout to mark America's 250th birthday.

Mr Trump unveiled the plans at a rally in Iowa on Thursday, telling supporters the event would take place in front of up to 25,000 people.

“We're going to have a UFC fight on the grounds of the White House. We have a lot of land there. Dana is going to do it,” Mr Trump said.

The UFC is yet to officially confirm any details of the event but Mr White, who supported the president during his re-election campaign last November, shared the news on X alongside the caption: “This will be epic”.

The company's Instagram account also shared a video of Mr Trump's announcement, before asking fans who they would like to see fight at the White House.

Conor McGregor, who is credited with making the UFC a global sport, said he would be “honoured” to star in the event.

“Count me in!” he posted on X after wishing Americans a happy 4th of July.

McGregor, who met Mr Trump at the White House on St Patrick's Day, has not fought in the UFC since breaking his leg in 2021, but periodically teases his return to the sport.

Colby Covington, a former interim champion, is also a big Trump supporter, and was frequently pictured wearing a Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat during the election.

Covington, who is from Florida, even blamed campaigning for Mr Trump for his loss to Joaquin Buckley in December.

Sean Strickland, a former Middleweight champion from Anaheim, California, is another vocal Trump supporter.

On Thursday, Strickland posted on X in response to a trans swimmer being stripped of their medals in response to a directive from Mr Trump: “It went from William Thomas to Lia Thomas back to William Thomas...America is finally healing. LFG Trump”.

Neither the White House or the UFC have provided details on where exactly the fight would take place, but there are a few limited options.

One option is the Rose Garden, a smaller, more intimate outdoor space often used for presidential addresses or events. But the administration recently started work on paving over the grass in the Rose Garden, making it less likely.

More likely is a makeshift Octagon on the South Lawn, the largest open area on the White House grounds, covering three acres. It's often used for large events and state ceremonies, meaning it has the capacity to host large crowds.

At the centre of the UFC is White, who rescued the company from bankruptcy in the early 2000s and transformed it into a multi-billion dollar global enterprise.

At the time, Mr Trump was one of the few figures who offered White a platform, allowing events to be hosted at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City when others refused.

The two have been friends and political allies ever since.

White spoke at both the 2016 and 2020 Republican conventions, before appearing alongside Mr Trump's closest friends and family when he retook the White House in November.

Mr Trump is regularly treated as a guest of honour at the UFC, where he walks out alongside White to the roar of thousands of fans.

Over the past decade, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has evolved from a fringe combat league – once denounced by the late Republican senator John McCain as “human cockfighting” – into one of America's most influential cultural platforms. It is a mixed-martial arts promotion in which a series of fights take place around the world, also known as fight nights. It calls itself the “premier organisation in Mixed Marshall Arts (MMA)”.

The UFC is broadcast in over 170 countries, and reaches over 900 million households.

Perched behind Mr Trump in the front row you will often see some of his closest political allies including RFK Jr, the health secretary; Kash Patel, the FBI director; and Elon Musk, who until recently was a key figure in the administration and close friend of the president.

Hollywood stars and musicians are also staples at UFC events, including Chris Pratt, Jared Letto, Matt Damon and French footballer Kylian Mbappe.
