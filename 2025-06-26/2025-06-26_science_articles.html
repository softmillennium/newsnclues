                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, a theoretical physicist hid his time-travel obsession. “He was a stickler about education—he'd give me toys like a gyroscope or radio set, and in order to get my allowance, I had to answer questions from my multiplication tables,” Mallett recalls. “For me, the sun rose and set with him.” In 1955, Mallett's father unexpectedly died at age 33 from a massive heart attack. A year later, Mallett came across a book that would change his life—a Classics Illustrated version of The Time Machine by H.G. “When I read that, it was like the sky opened up,” Mallett recalls. Mallett immediately got to work, building his own makeshift time machine out of old television, radio, and bicycle parts. Naturally, it didn't work, which he says is for the best as it “probably would've burned the house down.” Mallett continued to harbor this dream of time travel until eventually stumbling upon the work of Albert Einstein. Nearly half a century before Mallett began exploring the famous German physicist's work, Einstein mic-dropped some serious physics knowledge in the form of his Theory of General Relativity. Among many details in this science-altering theory, Einstein noted that time wasn't as absolute as Newtonian physics had predicted, but instead was interwoven into the fabric of space (hence space-time). This meant that things like velocity and gravity could impact the “flow” of time. Understanding what Einstein calls “time dilation” is the reason why we have GPS, and why all of us—whether traveling in a plane, driving a car, or just taking the elevator—in our own small and imperceptible ways, become time travelers. Yet all of these ideas leverage forward-moving time travel. Answering this question would consume Ronald Mallett's entire academic life. “Science fiction was not the popular thing it is now—kids who were interested in science fiction were considered a little suspect,” Mallett says. While Einstein's work detailed the inner workings of time dilation as well as time's relationship among gravity, mass, and light, solving some of these field equations seemed to, at least theoretically suggest, that time travel was possible in some extreme circumstances. “It turns out that in Einstein's theory, a rotating black hole … will actually take time and twist it into a loop.” Astrophysicists refer to this phenomenon as a “closed timelike curve,” or CTC, a mathematical explanation that theoretically allows for time travel into the past. These ideas are what eventually led Mallett to construct his eponymous machine, a ring-laser device that theoretically creates what Mallett calls “twists in space.” “Suppose you have a cup of coffee,” Mallett says. “Think of the coffee in the cup as empty space, and think of a spoon as a circulating light beam. This would have the effect of essentially returning to a place in space and time you've already left, though with one big caveat—you could only go back into time to the point that you turned on this hypothetical time machine. Other physicists, such as Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, have similarly stated that things like time travel and wormholes exist in scientific areas that even if theoretically feasible, “the experiment is so challenging that we can't do it with human technology in this century.” A time machine won't be built in our lifetime, and it's unlikelier still that ring lasers will be the aluminum-clad DeLorean of our hopes and dreams. But sometimes it takes unorthodox scientists like Mallett to help us traverse the ever present sci-fi bias in research, creating the freedom to investigate big questions about our universe that many may be too afraid to ask.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flinders University scientists are working on securing a sustainable future for the burrow-dwelling endemic skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis) by assessing their suitability to cooler and slightly greener locations, below their usual range in the state's drier, hotter northern regions. The latest research, outlined in a new article in Biology, compared the ability of three separate pygmy bluetongue lizard populations to withstand different microclimates in South Australia - between the northern Flinders Ranges near Jamestown, Mid North near Burra, and southern-most translocation sites near Tarlee and Kapunda. The study, led by PhD candidate Deanne Trewartha from the College of Science and Engineering, says moving wildlife adapted to a hotter, drier location to another microclimate can mean exposure to different temperatures, water availability and humidity and needs extensive assessment. "We need to understand how this species, which are highly dependent on body temperature, adapt to cooler and often wetter seasons in these new environments," says Ms Trewartha, from the Flinders University Lab of Evolutionary Genetics and Sociality (LEGS) research group. She says the research so far suggests acclimatization to new sites may take longer than two years for all three populations and may vary with latitude of origin. "Despite this acclimatization delay, our results indicate that these lizards may cope with translocation as a mitigation strategy in the longer term. "Further monitoring of the three lineages will continue to see any behavioral variations in wet versus dry seasons and the long-term behavioral acclimatization periods for translocations." "With high biodiversity loss, translocation to 'future-suitable' sites is becoming increasingly urgent for the conservation of numerous reptile species," says Professor Gardner, who leads an Australian Research Council Linkage project to study various pygmy bluetongue groups at different latitudes in South Australia. "So far, these three populations are showing various responses to their new locations, but behavioral variations may not be detrimental in the long term and may potentially aid animals in acclimatizing to changed environments to optimize their chance their survival." From spring 2020 to autumn 2021, monthly monitoring of behaviors found the translocated southern lineage lizards showed significantly less daily activity and were active at lower temperatures and higher humidity than northern lineage lizards. Southern lineage lizards allowed a human observer to approach closer as base-of-burrow humidity increased, while northern lineage lizards were quicker to retreat into burrows, at both source and translocation sites. This project was carried out in accordance with Flinders University ethics approval E453-17, Department of Environment and Water 'Take from the wild' permit 20210331 and research permit G25011.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, all non-Africans are known to have descended from a small group of people that ventured into Eurasia after around 50 thousand years ago. "We assembled a dataset of archaeological sites and environmental information covering the last 120 thousand years in Africa. We used methods developed in ecology to understand changes in human environmental niches, the habitats humans can use and thrive in, during this time," says Dr Emily Hallett of Loyola University Chicago, co-lead author of the study. "Our results showed that the human niche began to expand significantly from 70 thousand years ago, and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts," adds Dr Michela Leonardi of London's Natural History Museum, the study's other lead author. explains Professor Manica, "Previous dispersals seem to have happened during particularly favourable windows of increased rainfall in the Saharo-Arabian desert belt, thus creating 'green corridors' for people to move into Eurasia. However, around 70,000-50,000 years ago, the easiest route out of Africa would have been more challenging than during previous periods, and yet this expansion was sizeable and ultimately successful." Many explanations for the uniquely successful dispersal out of Africa have been made, from technological innovations to immunities granted by admixture with Eurasian hominins. However, no technological innovations have been apparent, and previous admixture events do not appear to have saved older human dispersals out of Africa. "Unlike previous humans dispersing out of Africa, those human groups moving into Eurasia after ~60-50 thousand years ago were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility as a result of coping with climatically challenging habitats," says Prof. Scerri, "This likely provided a key mechanism for the adaptive success of our species beyond their African homeland."

Discovered in 1928, the world's first antibiotic—penicillin–was derived from a simple mold, and since then, fungi have made their way into the ingredient lists of all kinds of immunosuppressants and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Some fungi with psychoactive properties are even being introduced in states across the U.S. as therapeutic tools. However, not all fungi are medicinally helpful, and one of the more cursed members of the kingdom Fungi is Aspergillus flavus. A true microbial villain, this toxic fungus can produce aflatoxins, which can cause a variety of health issues and even death. However, a new study published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology analyzes a wholly different aspect of this fungal villain—it's cancer-fighting properties. When mixed with human leukemia cancer cells, these molecules—described as a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, or RiPPs—were effective at knocking them out of commission. “Fungi gave us penicillin,” Sherry Gao, senior author of the paper from Penn, said in a press statement. “These results show that many more medicines derived from natural products remain to be found.” However, the research team confirmed that these RiPPs were only useful against leukemia cells, and appeared to have no impact on breast, liver, or lung cancer cells. “Cancer cells divide uncontrollably,” Gao said in a press statement. “These compounds block the formation of microtubules, which are essential for cell division." The hope is to soon move testing of these compounds into animal models, and then continue onward to human trials in an effort to develop a new method of treating deadly cancers. “Nature has given us this incredible pharmacy,” Gao said in a press statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Androgenesis may not naturally occur in mammals, but through gene editing, all things are possible. Millions of years of evolution have determined how mammals reproduce, but if something doesn't occur in nature, it is not necessarily impossible. Mammalian reproduction usually needs one sperm and one oocyte (egg) to create a zygote that develops in the womb until it becomes a new organism. Embryogenesis and fetal development in mice and humans are similar, which is why mice are often used as prototypes for human experiments. Also like humans, mice, at least on their own, cannot create a viable zygote out of two eggs or two sperm. Earlier this year, researcher Yanchang Wei at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China succeeded at creating mouse embryos from two sperm cells that were implanted into an egg after its nucleus had been removed. Those two mice have now reproduced successfully, showing that it is possible for at least one kind of mammal with two biological fathers to have healthy offspring of its own. “Every cell in their body contains two sets of chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father. There is no actual change to the genome made in epigenome editing, just a shift in which genes receive chemical signals to activate or inactivate them. Wei and his team used modified CRISPR proteins to turn on genes in the sperm cells that eggs would have normally had turned on. While its does occur among some species of invertebrates, amphibians and fish. This phenomenon can happen when females produce eggs without a nucleus, which are then fertilized by males. In another type of androgenesis, both a sperm and egg form a zygote, but the genome of the female is eliminated. Creating mice from two mothers is easier in comparison. Known as parthenogenesis or “virgin birth,” this phenomenon has been seen in reptiles, amphibians, insects, fish and even California condors. Whether genetically modified androgenesis or parthenogenesis will succeed in humans remains to be seen. In the future, it might be a viable option, and could also be used to save critically endangered species which may only have a few individuals of one sex remaining.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the Andes, the rise of agriculture to replace foraging was not the result of hardship and resource scarcity, but instead a time of economic resilience and innovation, according to a study published June 25, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Luis Flores-Blanco of the University of California Davis and Arizona State University, U.S., and colleagues. The current prevailing view is that this transition was a time of hardship, with communities forced to rely on crops due to growing human populations and dwindling wild food resources. In this study, Flores-Blanco and colleagues examine the diet of people living in the Andes throughout this transitional period. Isotope signatures indicate a high proportion (84%) of plant material in the diet, supplemented by a smaller proportion of meat from large mammals. These proportions are not only consistent throughout this transitional time period at both sites, they are also identical to those of earlier foraging communities and later farming communities. Altogether, these results contradict the image of an agricultural shift driven by hardship, and instead reveal that food resources remained consistent for thousands of years. Wild foods were increasingly managed and domesticated, creating mixed foraging-farming economies. The authors propose that this economic resilience was likely aided by certain cultural advances happening at this time, including expanding trade networks and innovations in ceramic and archery technologies. Ancient Andean peoples relied on their deep knowledge of harvesting wild plants like potatoes and quinoa, as well as hunting camelids. Luisa Hinostroza adds: "This article challenges the traditional idea that the transition to agriculture occurred out of necessity or periods of crisis. Our findings demonstrate, instead, that in the Altiplano, it was a process marked by stability and food sufficiency sustained for thousands of years. These results constitute crucial evidence revealing the capacity of Andean societies to efficiently manage their resources, such as tubers and grains, and maintain long-term stability."

Understanding how well delivery in mice predicts delivery in nonhuman primates (NHPs) could make lipid nanoparticle (LNP) discovery more efficient. Yet, few LNP-mRNA drug candidates are tested in NHPs, in part because the experiments require more animals than is considered ethical. Here, to minimize animal use, we create a pool of sterile barcoded LNPs that are frozen, aliquoted and administered when an end-of-life NHP—an animal that is independently scheduled for euthanasia due to spontaneous disease—becomes available. We then administer this pool of 45 LNP-aVHH mRNAs with different chemistries intravenously to mice and NHPs and observe a higher amount of aVHH expression in NHPs than in mice. We characterize systemic physiological responses to LNP treatment using 47 clinically relevant variables and analyze the transcriptomic response alongside delivery in single cells from three tissues in vivo. These data suggest that multiple lipoprotein receptors may be associated with delivery. Altogether, end-of-life NHPs reduce animal use and may be informative preclinical models. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have delivered RNA in clinical trials and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved products1,2,3,4,5. These data justify efforts to improve LNPs for emerging RNA therapies6. However, LNP design is difficult, in part because it is affected by interconnected variables including the ionizable lipid7, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lipid8,9, cholesterol10,11,12, helper lipid13,14,15,16 and active targeting ligands17,18,19. This often requires the evaluation of many LNPs in cell culture or mice, followed by the evaluation of a much smaller number in rats. Together, these studies are used to select a lead LNP for evaluation in nonhuman primates (NHPs). One challenge with this serial selection is that the predictivity of one model system to another is weak (for example, cell culture to mice20) or understudied (for example, mice to NHPs). As a result, the cumulative predictivity from cell culture to NHPs may be poor. To enable high-throughput studies in vivo, scientists developed DNA barcoding assays21,22,23,24,25,26, including species-agnostic nanoparticle delivery screening24, which quantify functional delivery (that is, mRNA translated into protein) across species. By injecting the same barcoded LNPs in mice engineered with partial NHP or human livers, scientists found evidence of species-dependent delivery24. However, these results relied on immunocompromised mice, making it difficult to study the systemic physiological response. The mice also had one nonmouse cell type, which made it challenging to understand both on- and off-target delivery. While evaluating many LNPs in mice is partially enabling, the translational relevance of a preclinical LNP-mRNA drug candidate is largely determined by its safety and efficacy in NHPs. Yet, very few LNPs are tested in NHPs for two reasons. During the coronavirus disease pandemic, the number of NHPs available for import into the USA decreased, leading to increased animal costs27. These high costs are coupled with long wait times. The second reason is ethical. Quantifying delivery in multiple on- and off-target tissues, which the FDA recently requested ahead of a clinical trial28, requires a terminal experiment. Thus, a hypothetical study evaluating 45 LNPs using 3 animals per group could take several years, cost a large amount of money and lead to the death of 135 animals, excluding control groups. We hypothesized that we could reduce NHP use by testing many LNPs at once with DNA barcodes (Fig. To further reduce animal use, we chose NHPs selected by independent veterinarians for humane euthanasia due to preexisting disease. For example, if an animal was selected for euthanasia on a Tuesday, we administered LNPs on Monday. Using these end-of-life (EoL) NHPs conferred two advantages. First, because they were already scheduled for euthanasia, we would minimize the loss of life. Second, like humans, NHPs suffer from spontaneous heart disease, cancer, diabetes and inflammation; we reasoned that EoL studies could help scientists to understand how disease state affects delivery. However, this approach came with two substantial challenges. First, we did not control when the experiment happened, and second, only one animal was available at a time. As a result, it required barcoded LNPs that could be made sterile at a large scale, prealiquoted, frozen and administered over several weeks. Here, we report such a workflow and the subsequent results of 45 barcoded LNPs administered to EoL NHPs with gastrointestinal inflammation, control NHPs without gastrointestinal inflammation, and mice. a, LNPs are often selected serially in cell culture, mice, rats and then healthy NHPs. One alternative is testing LNPs in NHPs independently selected for humane euthanasia due to spontaneous disease. b,c, Seventy-two chemically distinct LNPs were created by varying three PEG-lipids, three helper lipids (b) and eight molar ratios (c). d, The PDI of all 72 LNPs; 71 passed this quality control. e, The encapsulation efficiency of these 71 remaining LNPs; 50 passed this quality control. f, The PDI of the 50 remaining LNPs after freeze–thaw; 45 passed this quality control. i, A cryo-TEM image of the pool. ALC-0159, methoxypolyethyleneglycoloxy(2000)-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide; DMG-PEG2000, 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000; HL, helper lipid; EE, encapsulation efficiency; TNS, 2-(p-toluidino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. We first created sterile barcoded LNPs that could be frozen, aliquoted and then administered when an animal became available. We formulated LNPs so they carried a unique DNA barcode and an mRNA encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored camelid VHH antibody (anchored VHH, aVHH)29; aVHH is a reporter that can be used to quantify LNP delivery24,25,26. LNP-1 with chemical composition 1 was formulated to carry aVHH mRNA as well as DNA barcode 1, whereas LNP-N with chemical composition N was formulated to carry aVHH mRNA as well as DNA barcode N. By using DNA barcodes designed to be sensitive30, we achieved a 10:1 mass ratio of mRNA:barcode. As all three FDA-approved LNP-RNA drugs use nanoparticles with four components and no targeting ligands1,2,3, we designed 72 chemically distinct LNPs with these criteria (Fig. We used microfluidics to combine the ionizable lipid SM-102 (ref. 31), cholesterol, one of three PEG-lipids, and one of three zwitterionic helper lipids32,33 (Supplementary Fig. We chose to alter the PEG-lipids34,35, helper lipids36,37 and molar ratios38,39 because they play an important role in LNP potency. Specifically, PEG-lipids help to control particle size during manufacturing and prevent both particle aggregation in the vial and opsonization in the blood. Recent studies suggest that helper lipids are the primary component on the surface of LNPs, indicating that modifying this ingredient could enhance interactions with specific cells. In addition, other studies have shown that LNPs consisting of the same four components but in different molar ratios can exhibit differences in potency. The LNP:nucleic acid mass ratio was 20:1, which is similar to FDA-approved formulations1,2,3. Because LNPs must be stable after freeze–thaw, we put all 72 through serial quality-control experiments (Supplementary Fig. We first measured the polydispersity index (PDI) after formulation; 71 of the LNPs had a PDI below 0.4 (Fig. We then measured the encapsulation efficiency of these 71 LNPs; 50 had an encapsulation efficiency above 85% (Fig. LNPs formulated with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) tended to have lower encapsulation efficiency than other LNPs. As a third step, we measured the PDI and hydrodynamic diameter of these 50 LNPs after they were mixed with 10% sucrose, frozen and thawed. Forty-five formulations formed monodisperse LNPs with a hydrodynamic diameter between 50 nm and 150 nm and a PDI below 0.3 (Fig. We combined these 45 LNPs and performed a second series of control experiments, this time on the pool. We thawed the LNP pool, then compared the zeta potential (Fig. 1g), hydrodynamic diameter and PDI (Fig. We then imaged the pool using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and found LNPs with distinct morphologies as expected (Fig. The pool pKa was 6.8, which is similar to the pKa reported for SM-102-based LNPs31 (Fig. Finally, we measured endotoxin levels and found them to be low enough for NHP use (Supplementary Fig. These data led us to conclude that barcoded LNPs could be frozen and thawed. Understanding the extent to which delivery in mice predicts delivery in NHPs could make LNP discovery more efficient. We therefore administered aliquots from the same LNP pool to mice, EoL NHPs with gastrointestinal inflammation and control NHPs. Control NHPs allowed us to evaluate whether EoL NHPs with spontaneous disease had overtly different responses to the LNP pool than NHPs without disease. As a negative control, we included three barcodes that were not formulated in LNPs, because unencapsulated DNA enters cells inefficiently24,25,26. In all three animal models, we intravenously injected the LNPs at a 0.5 mg kg−1 nucleic acid dose (that is, 0.011 mg kg−1 per LNP, on average, for the 45 LNPs; Supplementary Fig. Twenty-four hours later, we isolated liver, spleen, bone marrow and blood, then digested them into single cells (Fig. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we isolated cells in which aVHH mRNA was translated into aVHH protein (aVHH+ cells) and sequenced them to identify the DNA barcodes within them. This revealed the LNP pool transfection efficiency (aVHH+ percentage) and rank order of all 45 LNPs (normalized barcode reads)24,25,26. a, Control NHPs, EoL NHPs and mice were injected with a pool of thawed 45 LNPs carrying aVHH mRNA and DNA barcodes. Functional delivery was measured in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and blood cells. LNP barcodes in aVHH+ cells were then sequenced to determine the delivery profile of each LNP. Data are presented as mean ± s.d. c, The average normalized delivery of 45 LNPs and 3 unencapsulated barcodes in 4 cell types (liver EC, hepatocyte, liver IC and spleen macrophage). d, Normalized delivery of 45 LNPs in 4 cell types. e–g, Normalized delivery for the top 10 LNPs in mouse liver hepatocytes (CD31−CD45− cells, e), in control NHP hepatocytes (CD31−CD45−ASGPR+ cells, f) and in EoL NHP hepatocytes (CD31−CD45−ASGPR+ cells, g). h–j, Correlation of normalized delivery of 45 LNPs between mouse and control NHP (h), mouse and EoL NHP (i) and control NHP and EoL NHP (j). We measured the percentage of aVHH+ cells in 18 cell types isolated from mice and 22 cell types from both control and EoL NHPs. Compared with untreated mice, we observed significant delivery in 13 of the 18 cell types in mice injected with the LNP pool (Supplementary Fig. Compared with untreated NHP controls, the same LNP pool led to significant delivery in 22 (control) and 19 (EoL) of the 22 cell types, respectively. In EoL NHPs, the 19 cell types with delivery came from the liver, spleen and bone marrow, and the three cell types without significant delivery were in the blood (Supplementary Fig. We then compared the percentage of aVHH+ cells in the 18 cell types isolated from both species. Instead, we observed significantly higher delivery in NHP cells in 15 of the 18 cell types (Fig. 2b) and nonsignificantly higher delivery in the remaining three cell types. We complemented these flow cytometry readouts by sequencing all 45 barcodes and quantifying them using normalized delivery40 (Fig. We analyzed the normalized delivery of all three unencapsulated barcodes and found that these negative controls behaved as expected (Fig. In mice, only four cell types had enough aVHH+ cells to be sorted: liver endothelial cells, hepatocytes, liver immune cells and splenic macrophages. When we compared the normalized delivery across species in the four cell types, we found that some LNPs did well in mice and NHPs (Fig. However, we also found false positives (that is, LNPs that performed well in mice but not in NHPs) and false negatives (that is, LNPs that performed well in NHPs but not mice). To evaluate this practically, we considered the fact that top LNPs in mice are selected for NHP studies. We therefore rank ordered the top ten LNPs in mice and evaluated how they performed in NHPs (Fig. The top five mouse LNPs did not have high normalized delivery in either NHP model (Fig. As a control, we rank ordered the top ten LNPs in control NHPs and evaluated how they performed in EoL NHPs and found a strong relationship (Fig. 2f); the same was true when we rank ordered the top LNPs in EoL NHPs and evaluated how they performed in control NHPs (Fig. We also analyzed the relationship between LNP composition and delivery in hepatocytes from mice, control NHPs and EoL NHPs (Supplementary Fig. Meanwhile, there was no difference in delivery between the different PEG-lipids in both control and EoL NHPs. Similarly, in mice, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) outperformed 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). However, DSPC showed significantly higher delivery compared with DOPE in both control and EoL NHPs. We did not find any significant relationship between the eight molar ratios and functional delivery. Finally, we calculated the correlation coefficient for all 45 LNPs in the four cell types we sequenced from mice and NHPs and found it was low between the species (Fig. By contrast, we found higher correlations between control NHPs and EoL NHPs in the same four cell types (Fig. 2j) and high correlations between control NHPs and EoL NHPs in the remaining cell types (Supplementary Fig. Given that mice and NHPs were injected with aliquots from the same LNP pool, these data provide one line of evidence that delivery can vary across species. We hypothesized that the gastrointestinal inflammation would lead to overt, disease-specific physiological responses to LNPs. We therefore measured 47 physiological parameters before LNP treatment and at the time of euthanasia. Among these, 10 were related to blood (Supplementary Fig. 14a), 8 were related to liver (Supplementary Fig. 14b), 4 were related to kidney (Supplementary Fig. 14c), 4 were related to metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 14d) and 21 were serum cytokines (Supplementary Fig. We compared 26 blood chemistry values with normal range values41,42, and found 25 were within normal ranges in EoL and control LNPs. Alkaline phosphatase was outside of the normal range in EoL NHPs and within the normal range for control NHPs. These differences were present before and after LNP treatment, suggesting that they were not driven by exposure to LNPs. We also observed responses that were probably driven by LNPs. Specifically, both control and EoL NHPs had significantly elevated interleukin-1 receptor agonist and interleukin-10 serum concentrations compared with the pretreated values from the same animals. The control NHPs also had statistically elevated MCP-1 and MIP-1β levels relative to their pretreated baseline. Given that LNPs can lead to cytokine elevations at earlier time points in mice, it is possible that our cytokine data were measured after the acute response had resolved. These data suggest that there may be minor differences in LNP response, but they did not support our hypothesis that EoL NHPs with gastrointestinal inflammation exhibit overt, disease-dependent responses to LNPs. LNPs formulated with a neutral helper lipid and without targeting ligands are thought to preferentially transfect hepatocytes. However, it remains difficult to measure on- and off-target delivery with single-cell resolution across multiple tissues in NHPs. We therefore analyzed delivery using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Specifically, we used a DNA tagged anti-aVHH antibody to overlay delivery in the scRNA-seq-defined cells; aVHH-antibody reads were generated if aVHH mRNA was translated into protein (Supplementary Fig. We performed this analysis in 499,792 cells isolated from the liver, spleen and bone marrow (Fig. In all six cases (control NHPs and EoL NHPs, measured in three tissues), we then used unbiased uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)43 and the Harmony algorithm44 to cluster the cells. In the liver, this analysis identified 15 cell types in control and EoL NHPs (Fig. We then quantified delivery in these cell populations (Fig. The highest aVHH expression was in Kupffer cells, cells that phagocytose nanoparticles in mice45. The average aVHH expression in hepatocytes was fifth highest in both EoL and control NHPs; this suggests that LNPs formulated with a neutral helper lipid may not always preferentially transfect hepatocytes in NHPs. a, UMAP clustering of 15 cell types in the livers, with their aVHH protein expression at single-cell resolution, overlaid on the UMAP (78,581 cells from control NHP and 59,082 cells from EoL NHP). b,c, Normalized aVHH expression levels in each cluster from control (b) and EoL (c) livers. d, UMAP clustering of 18 cell types in the spleens, with their aVHH protein expression at single-cell resolution, overlaid on the UMAP (80,893 cells from control NHP and 108,465 cells from EoL NHP). e,f, Normalized aVHH expression levels in each cluster from control (e) and EoL (f) spleens. g, UMAP clustering of 20 cell types in the bone marrow, with their aVHH protein expression at single-cell resolution, overlaid on the UMAP (78,991 cells from control NHP and 93,780 cells from EoL NHP). h,i, Normalized aVHH expression levels in each cluster from control (h) and EoL (i) bone marrow. In the spleen, unbiased clustering revealed 18 cell populations in both control and EoL NHPs (Fig. Consistent with the liver, we observed delivery in many cell types, and the cell type with the highest amount of aVHH per cell was a macrophage, a type of myeloid cell (Fig. Finally, in the bone marrow, unbiased analysis identified 20 cell types in control and EoL NHPs (Fig. Once again, the cell types with the highest transfection were myeloid cells (Fig. We also observed aVHH-positive cells in CD34+ clusters in the bone marrow, which include hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These data are consistent with data suggesting LNPs can transfect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in NHPs26. A related hypothesis in nanomedicine is that LNPs preferentially transfect hepatocytes by interacting with low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Because our data suggested that LNPs interact with multiple cell types across multiple tissues, we reasoned that other receptors might influence LNP tropism. To identify these receptors, we first grouped liver cells into those with no aVHH expression (aVHH−), low aVHH expression (aVHH+) and high aVHH expression (aVHH++). We then performed a differential gene expression analysis, identifying genes that were upregulated (log2 fold change >1.0) and significant (adjusted P value <0.05) in aVHH++ cells relative to aVHH− cells (Fig. In control NHP livers, 111 genes met these criteria. When we analyzed these genes using Gene Ontology (GO), this unbiased approach found several pathways differentially regulated in aVHH++ cells relative to aVHH− cells (Fig. Consistent with our hypothesis, the most significant pathway was import into cell (GO:0098657, adjusted P value 1.2 × 10−5), which includes endocytosis and related transport. Other significant pathways included immune system processes (GO:0002376, adjusted P value 1.5 × 10−5), chemical homeostasis (GO:0048878, adjusted P value 2.0 × 10−4), defense response (GO:0006952, adjusted P value 1.0 × 10−3) and cholesterol storage (GO:0010878, adjusted P value 1.2 × 10−3). When we repeated this analysis in EoL NHPs, we found 124 genes that were upregulated and significant in aVHH++ cells relative to aVHH− cells. When these genes were entered into GO, the same five pathways were significant (adjusted P values 6.4 × 10−11, 4.7 × 10−8, 7.4 × 10−5, 1.8 × 10−5 and 5.8 × 10−5, respectively). a, Cells from control and EoL NHPs were divided into three groups based on their aVHH expression levels: aVHH−, aVHH+ and aVHH++. Then, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their associated GO terms in aVHH++ cells compared with aVHH− cells. b, Upregulated genes (log2 fold change >1.0, adjusted P value <0.05) in aVHH++ cells compared with aVHH− cells from control NHP liver were analyzed for their associated GO terms. Driver terms in the biological process are shown. c, All DEGs in control NHP liver, with LDL-related genes (LRP1, LDLRAD3 and MSR1) highlighted.

Dashed lines indicate the 95% confidence level. ID, identify; Min, minimum; Max, maximum. Among the significantly upregulated genes were three lipoprotein receptor-encoding genes that can interact with LDL: low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)46, low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain-containing 3 (LDLRAD3)47 and scavenger receptor type A1 (MSR1)48 (Fig. To evaluate whether these genes might be associated with higher LNP delivery, we plotted the expression of each gene as well as aVHH protein levels in the NHP livers (Fig. We also plotted an enrichment score for these genes, which we named the LDL composite. In both EoL and control NHPs, aVHH expression showed a positive correlation with a high LDL composite score (Fig. Nonhepatocyte cell types fell within the 95% confidence level in the correlation. Specifically, we performed differential gene expression analysis on aVHH− and aVHH++ cells, identified significantly upregulated genes (log2 fold change >1.5, adjusted P value <0.05) and analyzed significant pathways using GO. Consistent with the liver, this unbiased analysis suggested that import into cell was significant in both control and EoL splenic cells (adjusted P values 4.0 × 10−24 and 2.5 × 10−12, respectively; Supplementary Fig. Once again, genes encoding LRP1, LDLRAD3 and MSR1 were differentially expressed in the aVHH++ cells relative to aVHH− cells (Fig. When we scored their enrichment alongside aVHH in splenic single cells, we again found that cells with a high LDL composite score had high aVHH expression, even when they did not highly express LDLR (Fig. The same analyses in the bone marrow showed that transport (GO:0006810, the parental term for import into cell) or import into cell was significant in control and EoL NHPs (adjusted P values 4.7 × 10−4 and 1.0 × 10−3, respectively; Supplementary Fig. Similar to the liver and spleen, the LDL receptor genes were significantly upregulated (Fig. 4i), and functional delivery had a positive correlation with LDL composite score (Fig. Taken together, the differential gene expression, GO analyses, overlay data and correlations across the three tissues provide interesting but early evidence that these genes may affect LNP delivery. NHPs are a clinically relevant preclinical model for humans, yet it remains difficult to understand how LNP chemistries behave in them. We reasoned that testing many LNPs in EoL NHPs could generate interesting data while minimizing animal use. When mice, control NHPs or EoL NHPs were given aliquots from the same pool of LNPs, we observed higher percentages of aVHH+ cells in NHPs. These data are inconsistent with an established consensus in nanomedicine: that LNP delivery in NHPs is harder than LNP delivery in mice. Until we observed these data, we agreed with that consensus, because many LNPs that excel in mice subsequently fail in NHPs. However, if a group of athletes was drafted for their ability to play basketball and then forced to play football, many would fail, and we might conclude that football is harder than basketball. Our data suggest an alternative hypothesis: LNP delivery in NHPs is different than LNP delivery in mice. It will be important for other laboratories to test this hypothesis using other chemistries. We did not find overt differences in how EoL and control NHPs responded to LNPs. However, other EoL phenotypes may be different. We anticipate that evaluating delivery in EoL animals with different diseases could identify physiological states that affect delivery in patients. In both NHP models, we observed delivery in many cell types across three tissues. We found this interesting for three reasons. First, some NHP datasets estimate Cas9-mediated gene editing using whole liver tissue, assuming that editing occurs exclusively in hepatocytes. Our data suggest that assumption should be reevaluated. Second, delivery across many cell types and tissues suggests that multiple receptors mediate LNP delivery in vivo. Consistent with this, we found early evidence that other lipoprotein-related receptors may affect LNP delivery. Among them, LDLRAD3, LRP1 and MSR1 were upregulated and significant in aVHH++ cells relative to aVHH− cells. However, we also found non-LDL trafficking-related genes that were upregulated and significant (Supplementary Fig. Future studies will be required to understand which genes and pathways truly affect LNP delivery in NHPs, because they could inform clinical trials designed to treat patients with genetically defined dyslipidemias. For example, Verve Therapeutics conjugated GalNAc ligands to LNPs49, because patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia often have loss of function in LDLR50. If non-LDLR receptors enhance LNP delivery, then this approach could be applied to other patient populations. Third, we noted that the LNPs transfected two cell types that may be useful for future mRNA-based therapies. Macrophages and monocytes made to express chimeric antigen receptors have driven cancer immunotherapy51, whereas hematopoietic stem cells edited so they reactivate fetal hemoglobin synthesis may be useful in addressing severe sickle cell disease52. Here, we focused on the average relationship between delivery in mice and delivery in NHPs; this was best addressed using many LNPs at once. However, future EoL NHP studies will probably focus on identifying a lead LNP for detailed preclinical evaluation. Such studies should be used to examine how individual lead LNP formulations compare across multiple species. It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this Article. The first is that we tested only 45 LNPs. We anticipate experiments that evaluate other chemical spaces. For example, an LNP with a distinct chemical composition exhibited different tropism in mouse bone marrow26. However, chemistries that do not freeze and thaw well will not be amenable to EoL studies. Relatedly, to control for the possibility of LNP mixing, it is important to discard LNPs that are not biophysically stable and include unencapsulated barcodes as negative controls. If an individual LNP shows poor biophysical traits, adding it to the pool will increase the risk of barcode exchange or pool destabilization. A second limitation is that species-to-species relationships could change with the target tissue. Optimizing NHP tissue digestion is challenging; over time, we hope to reliably isolate single cells from other organs. A third caveat is that we focused on linear mRNA. Changing the payload to an antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, circular RNA, plasmid DNA or noncircular DNA could alter LNP biophysical traits, tropism and cell response. Another caveat of this work is the reliance on the reporter protein aVHH, which is likely to result in more positive delivery readouts than gene editing53,54. We estimate that a similar study using a gene editing payload would result in editing rates approximately threefold lower than the percentage of aVHH+ cells. We also cannot exclude the possibility that the on- and off-target transfection profile could change with the payload. A final issue with the data is that they assume that NHPs are a good model for human delivery. Current systemic RNA datasets suggest that NHPs can model humans1,4,55,56, but it is possible that NHPs will not always recapitulate delivery in patients. Importantly, these data do not support that scientists skip mouse studies and go straight to NHPs, for several reasons. First, although we found that these LNPs transfected NHP cells better than mouse cells, we anticipate that some chemistries will equally transfect both species, while others will transfect mice better than NHPs. Thus, additional studies comparing distinct chemical spaces in mice and NHPs would be valuable to the field. Second, mice often tolerate nanoparticle-based drugs at higher doses than NHPs. As a result, ensuring that LNP-mRNA drugs are tolerated in mice will reduce preventable toxic outcomes in NHPs. Finally, the use of EoL NHPs requires nanoparticles that are stable after freeze–thaw. Effective nanoparticles, especially in new chemical spaces, may not initially be stable after freeze–thaw but can be optimized for it. By going straight into EoL NHPs, these particles would be prematurely discarded. We believe instead that the data suggest that the most potent LNPs in mice may not be the most potent in NHPs, and structure–activity relationships derived from mouse studies can inform, but should not explicitly drive, LNP design for NHPs. Most importantly, these data suggest that studies in EoL NHPs can generate informative findings while reducing animal use. The template for in vitro transcription (IVT) of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-aVHH was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequences (Supplementary Table 1) were codon-optimized for mouse (primary species) and human (secondary species) using the GenSmart Codon Optimization tool (GenScript). The linear IVT templates were amplified by PCR using forward and T120 extended reverse primers, then purified with the DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research). The MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) was used for IVT for 2 h at 37 °C. During the reaction, mRNA was capped with Cap 1 (BOC Sciences) and all UTPs were modified with N1-methylpseudouridine-5′-triphosphate (N1-MeΨTP, BOC Sciences). After 2 h, DNase I was treated to remove the template DNA for 15 min at 37 °C. The resulting mRNA was purified by lithium chloride precipitation. Purified RNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to ensure purity. LNPs were formulated with aVHH mRNA23,24,25. The lipid components were diluted in 100% ethanol. Seventy-two different compositions are listed in Supplementary Fig. DNA barcodes (Integrated DNA Technologies; sequences listed in Supplementary Table 1) were mixed in the nucleic acid phase at a 1:10 ratio of DNA barcodes to mRNA in 25 mM sodium acetate buffer. The phases were then microfluidically mixed32,33 using Ignite (Precision Nanosystems) at a flow rate of 3:1 (nucleic acid:lipid phases) at a total flow rate of 12 ml min−1. LNPs were diluted 1:42 in sterile 10 mM Tris buffer and dialyzed by centrifugation in 100-kDa ultracentrifuge tubes (Amicon) at 4 °C. Then the LNPs were sterile-filtered with a 0.22-µm filter before administration or downstream analysis. Hydrodynamic diameters and PDIs of LNPs were measured using high-throughput dynamic light scattering (DynaPro Plate Reader II, Wyatt). DYNAMICS software (version 8.3.1.1145, Wyatt) was used for data collection. Endotoxin levels were measured with the Pierce Chromogenic Endotoxin Quant Kit (Thermo Scientific) before administration (Supplementary Fig. The standard range of 0.01–0.1 endotoxin units (EU) ml−1 was used following the manufacturer's protocol. Encapsulated mRNA and encapsulation efficiency were evaluated using Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In brief, an equal volume of 6 ng μl−1 LNP and 1× Tris–EDTA (TE; Thermo Fisher) or 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1× TE were mixed. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, an equal volume of 1:100 of RiboGreen reagent (Thermo Fisher) was added to each well. The fluorescence was quantified using a plate reader (PerkinElmer Victor X4 Microplate Reader) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm. PerkinElmer 2030 Workstation software 4.0 (version 4.00.0.15) was used for data collection. The zeta potential was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano Z. Zetasizer software (version 8.02) was used for data collection. The measurement was done with the refractive index of 1.4, dispersant viscosity of 0.882 cP and refractive index of 1.33. Sucrose (National Formulary, European Pharmacopoeia, Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Chinese Pharmacopoeia, high purity, low endotoxin; Fisher Scientific) was dissolved in a sterile 10 mM Tris buffer at 60% (w/v). LNPs in 10 mM Tris buffer were mixed with 60% (w/v) sucrose solution at 5:1 (v/v LNP:sucrose) for a final concentration of sucrose at 10% (w/v). LNPs were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Hydrodynamic diameter, PDI and encapsulation efficiency were measured before and after freeze–thawing. Frozen LNPs were stored at ≤−120 °C in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. After formulation, LNPs with PDI under 0.4 were selected (71 out of 72 LNPs). Then, LNPs with encapsulation efficiency above 85% were selected (50 out of 71 LNPs). As a third step, we measured the PDI and hydrodynamic diameter of these 50 LNPs after they were mixed with 10% sucrose, frozen and thawed. Forty-five formulations remained monodisperse with a hydrodynamic diameter between 50 nm and 150 nm and a PDI below 0.3. The frozen aliquots of selected 45 LNPs were thawed and pooled to assess the physical characteristics. Hydrodynamic diameter, PDI, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, encapsulated mRNA, endotoxin level and pKa were measured for the LNP pool. The LNP pool was also imaged by cryo-TEM. Before each administration, 1-ml aliquots of those 45 frozen LNPs were thawed at room temperature and pooled. Each time, the hydrodynamic diameter, PDI, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, encapsulated mRNA and endotoxin level were measured. LNP samples were placed on 300-mesh copper grids, with a holey carbon substrate (1.2-µm holes spaced by 1.3 µm; C-flat, Electron Microscopy Sciences). Grids were glow-discharged (negative charge) for 15 s using a GloQube Plus glow discharge system (Quorum Tech). Samples (3 µl) were blotted with filter paper for 1 s at room temperature and 100% humidity and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Scientific). Cryo-EM grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until cryo-TEM data acquisition. Cryo-EM grids were loaded under liquid nitrogen temperatures, using a Gatan 914 cryo-TEM sample holder, into a JEOL JEM-2200FS TEM (JEOL) operating at 200 keV. Micrographs were acquired under low-dose conditions using the Serial EM software (v4.1.6)57 with a DE20 direct electron detector device (Direct Electron), at nominal magnifications of ×40,000 or ×80,000, yielding pixel sizes of 1.4 Å and 0.8 Å per pixel, respectively. A stock solution of 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 140 mM sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared and pH adjusted with hydrogen chloride and sodium hydroxide (pH 3–10). Using four replicates for each pH, 140 μl pH-adjusted buffer was added to a 96-well plate, followed by adding 5 μl of 2-(p-toluidino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (60 μg ml−1). LNPs (5 µl) were added to each well. After 5 min of incubation at 300 rpm, fluorescence (excitation 325 nm, emission 435 nm) was measured using a plate reader. All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the approval of the Emory University School of Medicine's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All animals were housed in the Emory University animal facilities. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All mice were housed in the Emory University animal facilities in conventional cages with a 12:12 h light–dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water. The vivarium was kept at 23 °C with 50% humidity. Mice (N = 3) were injected intravenously with LNP pool (0.5 mg kg−1) in the lateral tail vein. Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation and perfusion with 5 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) through the right atrium. Liver tissues were finely minced and then placed in a digestive enzyme solution including collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich), collagenase XI (Sigma-Aldrich) and hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich). The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C, 550 rpm for 45 min (refs. For bone marrow, both ends of the femur were cut and 5 ml of RPMI1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) per femur was flushed using a 25-gauge needle. Spleens were finely minced and placed in RPMI1640. Cell suspensions were filtered through a 70-µm mesh. Blood was collected from terminal cardiac puncture, then red blood cells were lysed by ACK lysing buffer (Quality Biological) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were stained to identify specific cell populations and sorted using the Cytek Aurora cell sorter. SpectroFlo software (version 1.3.1, Cytek) was used for data collection. LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) was used for live cell gating (dilution 1:5000). Flow cytometry staining panels and gating strategies are shown in Supplementary Figs. Mice injected with 10 mM Tris buffer were used as gating controls. All animal procedures conformed to the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act, and protocols were approved before implementation by Emory University School of Medicine's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The LNPs were thawed, screened (for example, sterility and endotoxin) and then aliquoted for intravenous injection under aseptic conditions in rhesus monkeys (N = 6; 1–17 years of age, 2.3–6 kg; 3 males and 3 females) comparing the two clinical statuses (healthy versus gastrointestinal inflammation); one uninjected control animal (11 years, 7.2 kg, female) and one uninjected EoL animal (17 years, 9 kg, male) were included. Animals were sedated with telazol (5–8 mg kg−1 intramuscularly), a blood sample was collected at time point 0 and a slow intravenous injection of LNPs was performed using the aseptic technique. Animals were pretreated with diphenhydramine, and no adverse reactions were observed. Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry panels were evaluated before and after administration and found to be within normal limits. Animals were sedated 24 h after administration and weighed, their final blood samples were collected (serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and then the animals were euthanized (overdose of pentobarbital). Tissues were collected and weighed including the liver, spleen and bone marrow from all long bones. Liver tissues were cut into 0.5-cm cubes, placed into a digestive enzyme solution containing 12 ml of R5 medium (RPMI1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum) supplemented with 150 µg ml−1 of collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich), and processed using a GentleMACS Octo Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec). The samples were processed using the following protocol: incubation at 37 °C, two sets of clockwise–counterclockwise agitations at 300 rpm for 20 s, two sets of clockwise–counterclockwise agitations at 50 rpm for 40 min and two sets of clockwise–counterclockwise agitations at 300 rpm for 20 s. Spleen tissues were cut into 0.5-cm cubes, placed into 5 ml of R5 medium and processed using a GentleMACS Octo Dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec) using the m_spleen_1 program. Liver and spleen tissues were taken off the GentleMACS, and bone marrow samples were resuspended in 10 ml of R5 medium. All samples were passed through a 70-µm mesh prewet with 1 ml of R5 medium. After centrifugation at 500g for 10 min, all samples were incubated with ACK lysis buffer for 5 min. Single-cell suspensions were then washed twice with PBS. Forty million cells were incubated with Fc receptor binding inhibitor polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were stained to identify specific cell populations and sorted using the Cytek Aurora cell sorter. SpectroFlo software (version 1.3.1, Cytek) was used for data collection. The LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) was used for live cell gating (dilution 1:5,000). Anti-camelid VHH antibody (clone 96A3F5, GenScript) was used for detecting aVHH expression. Flow cytometry staining panels and gating strategies are shown in Supplementary Figs. All remaining cells were aliquoted into 10 million cells and cryopreserved in CryoStor CS10 (StemCell Technologies). In all cases, cryopreserved samples from the respective uninjected control animals were used as gating controls. Rhesus monkey sera were sent to IDEXX BioAnalytics and tested on the Milliplex MAP Non-Human Primate Cytokine Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore, cat. PCYTMG-40K-PX23) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data were collected by xPONENT 4.3 (Luminex), and data analysis was completed using BELYSA 1.1.0 software. The data collected by the instrument software are expressed as median fluorescence intensity. Analyte standards, quality controls and sample median fluorescence intensity values were adjusted for background. Calibrator data were fit to either a five-parameter logistic or four-parameter logistic model depending on best fit to produce accurate standard curves for each analyte. Quality control and sample data were interpolated from the standard curves and then adjusted according to dilution factor to provide calculated final concentrations of each analyte present in the sample. Qualified assay ranges are presented in Supplementary Table 1. For FACS-sorted aVHH+ cells from mice and NHPs, DNA barcodes were isolated by QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The samples were then amplified using KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Roche), following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the results were processed using a custom Python-based tool to extract raw barcode counts for each cell type. These raw counts were then normalized using R before further analysis. Counts for each particle were normalized to the barcoded LNP mixture injected into mice. The BD Rhapsody Single Cell Analysis System was used for single-cell multiomics. Single-cell suspensions were stained with oligo-tagged anti-camelid VHH antibodies (5′-CCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCAAAGTATGCCCTACGABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*A*A-3′ chemically conjugated to MonoRab rabbit anti-camelid VHH antibody, mAb, GenScript; the asterisks denote phosphorothioate bonds). The final concentration was 0.5 mg ml−1 by protein weight. The dilution for staining was 1:2,000. After washing the labeled cells twice with PBS, the cell viability and numbers were recorded for each sample. The cells were then pooled at the same ratio, and a BD Rhapsody cartridge was loaded with 60,000 cells. cDNA libraries were prepared using the BD Rhapsody Whole Transcriptome Analysis Amplification Kit following the BD Rhapsody System mRNA Whole Transcriptome Analysis and Sample Tag Library Preparation protocol (BD Biosciences). The final libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer and sent to Novogene for sequencing. After the assessment of library quality using Bioanalyzer (Agilent), sequencing was performed by Illumina NovaSeq X Plus PE150 at Novogene. The data were processed using STARsolo (v2.7.9a)61 in R (v4.3.1). All samples were mapped to rheMac10, and only exonic regions were counted. All output files were loaded into Seurat (v5.0.1). Global-scaling normalization was used for the aVHH expression assay in a Seurat object. The process normalizes the feature expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a scale factor 10,000 and log-transforms the result. DoubletFinder (v3) was used to identify doublets62. This was followed by principal component analysis dimensional reduction and UMAP clustering. aVHH oligo-tag counts were combined with RNA counts in Seurat and treated similarly to other multimodal datasets such as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq)63. Visualization of gene and aVHH expression levels was performed using R/Seurat commands (FeaturePlot and DotPlot). For the integration of multiple Seurat objects, Harmony algorithm (v.1.2.1) was used. For UMAP representation in Fig. 3a,d,g, cell clusters were manually annotated in Seurat with marker genes listed in Supplementary Figs. A minimum of three biological replicates were analyzed for quantification, except for untreated rhesus monkeys (N = 1). For the representative cryo-TEM image (Fig. 1i), four wide-field images and at least ten high-magnification images (×40,000) were collected from one batch of LNP pool with a representative size distribution. All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation or standard error of mean. Statistical analysis between groups was performed using GraphPad Prism (versions 9.5 and 10). For data with multiple groups, the statistically significant differences were assessed using two-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple-comparison test. For comparisons between two groups, unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests were used. The sample sizes (biological replicates), specific statistical tests and main effects of our statistical analyses for each experiment are detailed in each figure legend. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause permanent loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, with limited therapeutic options available. Low-frequency electric fields with changing polarity have shown promise in promoting axon regeneration and improving outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that a thin-film implant with supercapacitive electrodes placed under the dura mater can safely and effectively deliver electric field treatment in rats with thoracic SCI. Subdural stimulation enhanced hind limb function and touch sensitivity compared to controls, without inducing a neuroinflammatory response in the spinal cord. While axon density around the lesion site remained unchanged after 12 weeks, in vivo monitoring and electrochemical testing of electrodes indicated that treatment was administered throughout the study. These results highlight the promise of electric field treatment as a viable therapeutic strategy for achieving long-term functional recovery in SCI. Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts the communication between the brain and body, with severity varying based on the level and extent of damage. No cure for SCI exists, however, even minor improvements in function would enhance patient's quality of life1. Electrical stimulation as a treatment modality has been translated from basic science to clinical applications2,3. Common modalities for electrical stimulation after SCI are: high-frequency neuromodulation (µs pulses) to bypass the injury2,4,5, and low-frequency electric field (EF) treatment (ms—min pulse widths) to promote axonal regeneration and reconnection across the lesion3,6,7. Notably, these technologies are compatible and complementary, as neuromodulation could provide targeted restoration of motor function while at the same time EF treatment could provide regeneration of injured tracts to form long-lasting neuronal connections. However, despite promising evidence of regeneration and improved outcomes after SCI, EF treatment has encountered challenges due to the increased demands that low-frequency stimulation places on the electrode materials. EF treatment has its origin in early in vitro studies showing that direct current stimulation could direct and promote axonal regeneration towards the cathode8,9. Using sets of electrodes sutured to muscle above the dura mater, this approach was then demonstrated to regenerate axons, to reduce axonal degeneration, and to recover muscle reflexes in transected spinal cords of lamprey fish and Guinea pigs7,10. In a contusion injury model in rats, similar direct current stimulation resulted in higher amplitude of motor-evoked potentials, improved performance on an inclined-plane test, and greater cell counts in motor-related brain regions compared with non-treated controls11,12. A refinement was then made to alternate the polarity of stimulation every 15 mins (~0.5 mHz), which promoted axon outgrowth in both directions while preventing die-back from the anode13. This treatment was deployed in patient dogs implanted with epidural stimulators resulting in significant improvements in superficial and deep pain response below the lesion compared with controls, whereas neurologic scores for ambulation and proprioceptive placing were not significant6,14. Similarly, human SCI patients treated via implanted stimulators had significantly improved light touch and pinprick sensation but in addition also had higher motor scores after EF treatment as well as recovery or improvement of somatosensory-evoked potentials3. However, the metallic electrodes available for these prior studies limited progression of the low-frequency EF treatment paradigm with corrosion hampering their effectiveness and potentially generating toxic concentrations of byproducts such as metal ions, pH changes and reactive oxygen species damaging local tissues14,15,16. Our work heralds a return to this promising approach by leveraging thin-film fabrication, state-of-the-art electrode materials, and subdural positioning to enhance the power, precision and biocompatibility of stimulation. We have previously developed an ultrathin spinal implant for recording that can be safely inserted beneath the dura mater to make direct contact with the pial surface of the spinal cord with no permanent impairment of hind limb function or other welfare issues in non-injured rats17. Although requiring a more invasive surgery, a subdural implant allows for stimulation that does not need to penetrate the dura mater and arachnoid membranes as well as the subarachnoid space filled with motional and highly conductive cerebrospinal fluid18. We expect this to allow subdural electrodes to deliver a stronger stimulation while using an order of magnitude less power input and importantly much greater penetration of the EF within the spinal cord19,20. We have further enhanced the biotolerability of the stimulation using pseudocapacitive materials as electrodes. We have augmented the implant with larger 200 µm diameter dedicated stimulation electrodes enhanced with sputtered iridium oxide films (SIROF). SIROF electrodes are capable of pseudocapacitive charge injection through a mix of reactions where iridium transitions through different valence states, which generate surface-bound reaction products that do not diffuse into local tissue and thereby have a high degree of reversibility when stimulation is charge balanced21,22,23. However, even these revisions would not allow for 15-min pulses of stimulation to be delivered within the safe window of applied charge density. Therefore, we have adopted the use of 250 ms pulse width stimulation (2 Hz), which is still 1000 times longer pulses than the typical neuromodulation. The 2 Hz stimulation has previously been demonstrated to be effective for directing and encouraging axonal growth in vitro. In that study, 3D-cultured rat cortical neurons were exposed to alternating fields ranging from 0.5 Hz to 2 kHz for up to 4 days, and the greatest effect of ~30% axon length increase was achieved with stimulation of 2 Hz24. EF treatment is one of the few therapies shown to regenerate axons tracts and improve functional outcomes after SCI, however, it has to date not been able to be administered safely and effectively due to the demands placed on metal electrodes by low-frequency stimulation and their epidural implantation. Here, we show how this is made possible using an ultrathin subdural implant with SIROF electrodes to administer a daily 2 Hz EF treatment in rats with a thoracic contusion injury. Histological analysis showed that the EF treatment was well tolerated and did not trigger a neuroinflammatory response. We did not observe significant differences in markers related to axon density and axonal regeneration around the injury site. However, rats receiving the treatment showed significant improvement in recovery of hind limb function from week 4 onwards compared with non-treated controls and touch sensitivity significantly improved after one week of treatment and remained consistent throughout the study period. We tested the effectiveness of a 2 Hz biphasic EF treatment (amplitude 5 µA, pulse width 250 ms) by surgically inserting the implant in three groups of rats (Fig. Two of the groups, treated (n = 8) and non-treated (n = 10) received a 175 kilodynes impact injury at the boundary between spinal segments L1/L2 (directly below the T11 spinal process). Beginning the day after surgery, the treated group received 1-h of EF treatment daily for 7–11 days, then on weekdays only (5 days/week) for 12 weeks. Stimulation was delivered via 200 µm ∅ SIROF electrodes positioned on either side of the injury (Fig. The implant also included two reserve electrodes as well as smaller recording electrodes, which were not part of this study (Fig. a Bioelectronic implant with stimulation electrodes. b Implant was inserted below T10–T12 in treated, non-treated, and no-injury rats. c A 175 kilodyne spinal cord impact at T11 showed no difference between groups. d Starting the day after surgery, treated rats received 2 Hz biphasic EF stimulation (1 h/day) via active and counter electrodes flanking the injury. e Treated rats initially recovered slower but surpassed non-treated rats in open-field motor scores from week 4 onward (green asterisks). f Treated rats showed faster hind paw withdrawal to ramping filament force at week 1 and weeks 3–12 compared to non-treated rats (green asterisks) and at week 4 and 9 compared to no-injury rats (blue asterisks). g Treated and non-treated rats showed similar foot misplacements on a 1-m ladder. h Treated rats had more slips on the ladder at weeks 3, 4, and 9 compared to non-treated (green asterisks). Group means are shown by thick lines ± SEM; thin lines represent individual animals from treated and non-treated groups in (e, g, h). Hind-limb function was assessed at post-surgery days 1, 3, 7, and then weekly, using the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) scale (0 = no function, 21 = normal function)25 comparing treated rat´s scores with non-treated and a no-injury control group (n = 10). During the first week after surgery, the treated group showed slower recovery compared to the non-treated group, with a significant difference observed on day 7 (mixed model ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc, p < 0.05; Fig. However, from week 4 onwards, treated rats demonstrated significantly higher scores, indicating greater recovery of hind limb function compared to the non-treated controls (mixed model ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc's, p's < 0.05). Additionally, treated rats continued to show improvement, with significantly higher scores from week 8–12 compared to their week 5 scores (mixed model ANOVA, within-group Tukey's post-hoc's, p's < 0.05). In contrast, non-treated SCI rats plateaued at week 5 and showed no further improvement (mixed model ANOVA, within-group Tukey's post-hoc's, p's > 0.24), which aligns with previous work in our lab using a similar injury model26. By week 12, 100% of the treated rats scored 14 or higher, indicating consistent coordination between the front and hind limbs, compared to only 20% of the non-treated rats, who struggled with smooth motion due to missteps, hind paw lagging, or hopping (see Supplementary Video 1). We assessed the recovery of mechanical sensitivity using an electronic von Frey task, in which a fine metal filament applied a ramping force (2.5 g/s) to the plantar surface of the hind paws. Treated rats withdrew their paws quicker on week 1 and 3–12 compared to the non-treated group indicating a recovery of touch sensitivity (mixed model ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc's, p's < 0.05; Fig. Furthermore, treated rats had faster withdrawal rates than the non-injury controls on week's 4 and 9 (mixed model ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc's, p's < 0.05). This difference may be attributed to the high variability of this task when administered to uninjured rats27, but it could also suggest a degree of hypersensitivity in the paws of treated animals. Animals also performed weekly sessions in which they traversed a 1-m horizontal rung ladder, and the number of hind paw misplacements and slips were scored. This task was only attempted once animals were weight bearing on both hind paws (week 2 or 3). There was no difference in the number of foot misplacements between treated and non-treated control rats (mixed model ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc's, p's>0.17; Fig. Treated rats had a higher number of slips compared to the non-treated rats at week 3, 4, and 9 (mixed model ANOVA, Tukey's post-hoc's, p's<0.05; Fig. At the end of 12 weeks, rats were perfused and sagittal longitudinal sections around the injury were analyzed in both treated and non-treated groups. The size and extent of the lesion were consistent with previous studies using similar injury models26,28 (Supplementary Fig. In a previous work in non-injured rats, our findings suggest that the implant does not elicit a significant immune response17. In the present study, we first examined whether subdural EF treatment resulted in neuroinflammatory changes beneath the electrodes by examining markers related to microglia and astrocytes (Fig. Epidural EF treatment has previously been linked to increases15 and decreases29 in neuroinflammation, whereas a subdural treatment had not yet been evaluated. Since the stimulation current weakens as it flows ventrally due to tissue resistance, the generated EF strength will be higher in dorsal than ventral regions. If EF treatment influences neuroinflammation, larger effects would be expected in dorsal than in ventral regions. Therefore, the dorsal and ventral ROIs shown in Fig. 2c were analyzed across all histological assessments in this study (each 7.1 mm²). We did not detect significant differences in microglia/macrophage activity between the groups with comparable levels of Iba1 expression observed (unpaired t-test, p's > 0.29; Fig. Additionally, there was no evidence of astrogliosis in response to treatment, as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels remained similar between groups (unpaired t-test, p's > 0.23; Fig. Representative sagittal images are shown of immunolabelling of IBA1 and GFAP for a non-treated and b treated rats. c Dorsal and Ventral regions of tissue were analyzed. d There was no significant difference in microglial/macrophage activity between the treated and non-treated groups in the dorsal and ventral regions of the spinal cord. e No difference in astrocyte activity was detected between groups. Data are presented as mean values ± SEM. Immunohistochemistry for β-tubulin III (β-tub) and growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) was performed to assess axon density and signs of recent axonal regeneration, respectively (Fig. Serotonergic expression was also examined around the lesion site (Fig. After 12 weeks, there was no observable change in β-tub expression (unpaired t-test, p's > 0.67; Fig. 3e) or GAP43 expression (unpaired t-test, p's > 0.71; Fig. No significant difference in serotonergic expression was seen in treated animals (unpaired t-test, p's > 0.18; Fig. a Representative sagittal images from the epicenter of the lesion with β-tub and GAP43 immunolabelling from a non-treated and b treated rats. Representative sagittal images from the epicenter of the lesion with 5HT immunolabelling from c non-treated and d treated rats. Similar expression of both e β-tub (overall axon density) and f GAP43 (axonal regeneration) were observed in both groups, either in the dorsal or ventral regions of the spinal cord. g Similar levels of serotonergic (5HT) expression were seen in both treated and non-treated rats. Data are presented as mean values ± SEM. We verified the effectiveness of the stimulation current in generating a therapeutic EF strength by generating a finite element model of the rat's spine, guided by prior literature (Fig. The model was used to estimate EF strength, with variations in white matter size and the volume of the subarachnoid space containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to assess the impact of cord size. Previous studies indicated significant variation in white matter volume at L1, while gray matter remained consistent30. Though no intra-animal data on the size variation of the subarachnoid space was available, we hypothesized that changes in CSF volume, due to its high conductivity, would also affect EF strength. a The generated EF was estimated by applying the finite element method (FEM) to a model of the rat's spinal cord. c For the subdural implant, three different cord sizes were simulated (see dimensions in Table 2). At the midline of the simulated spine (ML) the longitudinal EF plateaus in the range of 0.8 to 1.6 mV/mm depending on the cord size over a distance of 4 mm, while it is weaker at the ventral line (VL, 1 mm ventral from ML) and stronger with peaks at the electrode positions at the dorsal line (DL, 1 mm dorsal from ML). We simulated three cord sizes: small, medium, and large (dimensions in Table 2). Regardless of cord size, the longitudinal EF on the medial yz-plane showed higher magnitude near the electrodes and penetrated deeper ventrally, with uniform distribution between the electrodes (Fig. Longitudinal field distribution along three evaluation lines: the midline (ML), 1 mm dorsal (DL), and 1 mm ventral (VL), was similar across different cord sizes but inversely proportional in magnitude to the cord size (Fig. On average, the EF in the large cord was 60% of that in the small cord, due to greater tissue volume reducing current flow. Epidural placement of the implant, rather than subdural, reduced EF strength by an average of 13% in the medium-sized spinal cord model. To complement the in vivo data, we investigated the stability of SIROF electrodes in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), which mimics the conductivity and composition of CSF31. To verify the appropriateness of our electrode materials for the selected stimulation parameters and long treatment periods, we compared the performance of SIROF-coated electrodes against Pt electrode controls. Pt electrodes have very limited pseudocapacitive charge injection capacity compared to SIROF23, and coating Pt with SIROF greatly improved electrode stability. After 90 h of continuous stimulation in PBS with the same pulsing parameters used in vivo (Fig. 4a), as confirmed by high-resolution imaging, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Voltage transients during stimulation remained within the water window32 (Fig. Post-stimulation CV showed higher peaks than pre-stimulation, likely due to stimulation-induced hydration of the SIROF (Fig. The 90 h continuous stimulation test applied greater electrochemical stress than in vivo conditions, where stimulation totals approximately 60 h over 12 weeks with recovery periods in between. Despite this increased stress, SIROF electrodes maintained their stability. a The stability of Pt and SIROF-coated Pt was assessed during 90 h of continuous stimulation surpassing the total stimulation time in vivo (~60 h). In addition, the stability of the SIROF electrodes was tested by mimicking the in vivo treatment of daily 1-h stimulation for 18 days at 55 °C and for 60 days at 37 °C using the same implant body but different electrodes. While the Pt electrode delaminated and dissolved during 90 h of continuous stimulation (Supplementary Fig. d, e Peaks in the CV and EIS indicate a functional SIROF electrode after 90 h of continuous stimulation (n = 3). f SIROF electrodes do not delaminate during the 1-h daily stimulation in accelerated aging regime and in vivo mimicking conditions. f1–3 Representative images of SIROF electrodes, in pristine condition, and after daily 1-h stimulation for 18 days at 55 °C and for 60 days at 37 °C show that the electrodes remained stable. f4 We observed a carbon layer deposited onto electrodes (Supplementary Fig. g, h CV and EIS recordings of WEs which were stimulated for 60 days at 37 °C. The WEs stimulated consecutively (n = 2) against four shorted CEs remained stable (sample A), while the WE stimulated against two shorted CEs (sample B) remained functional although with carbon deposited at the WE. For long-term in vivo assessment of SIROF electrodes, we applied daily 1-h stimulation to a pair of electrodes on implant sample A under accelerated aging conditions (55 °C for 18 days, equivalent to 62 days at 37 °C33). Following this, a second electrode pair on implant sample A was stimulated under non-accelerated conditions (37 °C for 60 days). In each setup, one electrode served as the working electrode (WE) for 1 h, then the other, with four electrodes shorted as counter electrodes (CEs). 5f), EIS, and CV peaks remained stable (Fig. However, the CEs exhibited surface changes over time, with the typical SIROF fiber-like morphology becoming obscured by a denser material layer (Fig. Importantly, CV and EIS measurements confirmed that the CEs remained functional, though an increased resistive component suggested a new surface layer was deposited (Supplementary Fig. To further investigate this effect, we tested an additional set of electrodes on implant sample B, mimicking the in vivo stimulation by shorting two electrodes as CEs and stimulating one electrode as WE for 1 h daily over 60 days at 37 °C. Chemical analysis revealed that carbon was deposited (Supplementary Fig. This phenomenon was not further investigated in this work, as electrodes with deposited carbon remained functional, and nothing similar was seen on explanted electrodes. To assess electrode functionality in the treated group, impedance spectra were recorded from the two active electrodes rostral to the injury. Measurements were taken before implantation in PBS (in vitro), immediately after surgical implantation, and weekly thereafter. 6a), while the phase shift suggested increased capacitance at higher frequencies (Fig. Despite these changes, the impedance never reached open circuit levels, which would indicate electrode disconnection; instead, the EF treatment would have been achieved at a higher voltage, provided it did not exceed the stimulator's compliance voltage (16 V). Impedance readings from the two reserve (non-stimulated) electrodes on each implant (see Fig. 1a) showed similar trends over time (Fig. The difference between the final in vivo impedance magnitude measurement at 1 kHz for stimulated and reserve electrodes (i.e., electrodes not used for stimulation) was not significantly different from 0 (unpaired t-test, p = 0.16), indicating that stimulation did not contribute to the differences in impedance observed in vivo. Indeed, two devices that were removed intact at 3 and 4 weeks showed impedance returning to pre-implantation levels, after mechanical removal of encapsulating tissue, when tested in PBS (Fig. We were unable to explant any other devices intact at later stages due to progressive tissue regrowth and encapsulation of the implant body. a Impedance magnitude and b phase for active electrodes used for stimulation are shown over 12 weeks, indicated by the color scale, with the dashed red line representing the open circuit level. c Impedance at 1 kHz illustrates a steady increase throughout the 12 weeks for both stimulation and reserve electrodes, remaining below the open circuit level expected for a broken channel or electrode. d, e In vivo and in vitro measurements from two explants that were removed intact at 4 and 3 weeks, respectively. Both explants showed impedance approaching pre-implementation levels after mechanical removal of encapsulating tissue. Although intact implant removal was not achievable at 12 weeks, the polyimide section interfacing with the spinal cord was successfully retrieved. During removal, we observed that some electrode surfaces (recording grounds and stimulation electrodes) delaminated from the polyimide and adhered instead to the spinal cord surface (Supplementary Fig. For further investigation and quantification of this effect, we adapted the electrode status categorization scheme proposed in a previous study34. Using high-resolution images, each stimulation electrode was classified into one of five categories, ranging from Category 1 (pristine condition) to Category 5 (heavy delamination) (Fig. The analysis covered the three groups of stimulation electrodes (all SIROF coated and 200 µm diameter): the electrodes that were stimulated as WE featuring the highest current density, shorted CEs which due to their larger combined area saw half of the current density, and electrodes that were never stimulated, referred to as full, half, and non-stimulated electrodes, respectively. Full, half, and non-stimulated electrodes exhibited similar delamination distributions, with 35%, 33%, and 25% of electrodes assigned to Categories 4 (more than half the area delaminated) and 5 (Fig. b The distribution of electrodes across each status category, based on the current density received. It has been known for more than 40 years that the application of pulsed EF promotes the bidirectional regeneration of axons after SCI. To date, nearly all in vivo studies have used epidural stimulation electrodes16. However, it has been reported previously that epidural electrodes require an order of magnitude higher current and produce significantly reduced EF strength and stimulation precision within the cord compared with subdural electrodes due to the requirement to penetrate through the meninges and CSF19,20. While previous studies have focused on humans, we analyzed the differences in EF strength between subdural and epidural placement in a rat spinal model. We found that this difference in rats is smaller due to their narrower subdural space35, which minimizes the shift needed for an implant to become epidural and reduces its impact on EF strength. In humans, the larger subdural space provides more room for implantation but also increases the risk of complications, such as CSF leakage. It is thus too early to state what the ultimate solution will be for translation to patients. It is nevertheless self-evident that an implant in immediate contact with the spinal cord is more likely to reach efficient EF strength at lower currents, than one positioned epidurally, which only connects indirectly via the dura and the CSF-filled subarachnoid space. Although implanting electrodes in the subarachnoid space requires more invasive surgery, advances in surgical techniques make the benefits of subdural devices a promising prospect for future medicine18. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine whether EF treatment could be safely delivered via subdural electrodes and whether it promotes regeneration and improves functional outcomes in a rat thoracic SCI model. Treated rats showed enhanced coordination, paw position, and toe clearance in an open field from 4 weeks onwards compared to non-treated ones (Fig. The initially attenuated recovery observed in the first weeks may be attributable to a more severe injury caused by mechanical forces exerted during the physical connection of the stimulator, which was applied exclusively to the treated rats. Similar findings of connection-induced tissue damage have been reported in previous studies36. Furthermore, treated rats showed quicker withdrawal from a von Frey filament (Fig. 1f) than SCI controls indicating the recovery of touch sensitivity, which matches previous studies using low-frequency treatment in rats, dogs, and humans3,6,14,37,38. In a recent study, continuous epidural EF treatment (24 h/day) in conjunction with a T9 compression injury resulted in significantly higher BBB scores in treated rats from week 4 onwards compared to non-treated controls37. Additionally, increased protein levels of neurofilament, GAP43, and myelin basic protein were observed at 8 weeks post-injury. Previous work by the same group reported increased white matter preservation and neurofilament density, along with decreased astrocyte density at 4 weeks post injury, despite no improvement in BBB scores29. In contrast with these studies, we did not find evidence of increases in markers indicating neuronal/axonal structural integrity (B-tub) or recent axonal regeneration (GAP43) after 12 weeks. One possibility is that our 12-week endpoint may have exceeded the optimal window for detecting early regenerative changes, as the peak of cellular plasticity and regenerative signaling may have occurred earlier and subsequently diminished. Additionally, the contusion model used in our study generates a large cystic cavity, which presents greater challenges for detecting localized axonal changes compared to the compression injury model, which creates a more focal lesion with minimal tissue loss. These factors may have contributed to a more inhibitory microenvironment at the chronic injury stage, potentially limiting the capacity for axonal regrowth and obscuring measurable treatment effects at this later time point. Another possibility is that EF may facilitate functional recovery through neuroprotective effects or alternative mechanisms that do not directly involve axonal regeneration. For example, another study using continuous epidural EF treatment in a rat T9/T10 contusion model showed improved survival and differentiation of endogenous neural precursor cells after 5 weeks39, and other studies demonstrate that EF treatment in animals can reduce reactive astrocytes and demyelination40. In this work, the estimated EF strength at the lesion was higher than in previous rat studies39,41. We positioned stimulation electrodes 1 mm outside the lesion in healthy tissue, as this separation improved EF uniformity within the lesion42. The model did not include the contusion injury, as the effect on tissue conductivity is uncertain43,44; reduced conductivity would increase EF strength, while increased conductivity would have the opposite effect. Using healthy tissue conductivities is thus a reasonable compromise. Another limitation is the exclusion of the foreign body response, which may lead to inflammation and fibrotic tissue formation around the implant45, however, previous research indicates that this minimally affects therapeutic EF in white and gray matter42. FEM-based analysis showed that, regardless of natural variability in spinal cord size, assuming the size of the untreated lesion, the injured tissue was exposed to a minimum longitudinal EF of 0.6 mV/mm, with regions dorsal to the midline receiving over 1 mV/mm (Fig. The relationship between EF strength and SCI regeneration remains poorly understood, complicating predictions about the impact of variations in cord size, injury, or foreign body response on treatment outcomes. Nonetheless, the simulated EF strengths (0.7–1.6 mV/mm) at the cord center exceed those shown to induce positive biological effects in earlier studies (0.14–0.6 mV/mm)6,14,38,39,41, suggesting that any unmodeled factors would need a significant influence to alter the treatment results. Prior research applying a 0.5 mHz stimulus over longer daily durations estimated EF strengths around 0.4 mV/mm39,41, while other studies did not estimate EF strength29,37. Given the higher EF strength and the first implementation of a subdural thin-film implant for delivering EF treatment, we were especially interested in evaluating if there was a stimulation-induced foreign body response. There were no signs of increased microglia or astrocyte activity in rats treated with EF compared with the non-treated group, suggesting the daily treatment was well tolerated and it may be possible to deploy even higher EF strengths in the future or for much longer periods (Fig. This is an important aspect of the work, as biocompatible stimulation without generation of toxic by-products relies on the fact that current and duration stay below certain thresholds, and we were able to demonstrate that the combination of reduced current and revised electrode materials made this possible. The stimulation electrodes were stable during in vitro tests in PBS when the appropriate electrode materials were used. SIROF electrodes showed no signs of dysfunction or delamination even after continuous stimulation exceeding the total in vivo treatment time, under accelerated aging, and conditions mimicking the in vivo protocol (Fig. One deviation between in vitro and in vivo tests was the deposition of a predominantly carbon conducting layer on some electrodes. Since this was absent in vivo and did not affect electrode function, we did not investigate further (Details in Supplementary Note 1). In comparable studies the implant's functionality was analyzed at the end-point14, additional recording electrodes were implanted29, or no analysis was reported39,41. We here complemented such analysis with an in vivo assessment of the implant in situ using EIS. Our aim was to utilize the recorded impedance spectrum to progressively evaluate foreign body response and the status of the active electrodes46. In vivo impedance of both active and reserve electrodes increased over time but importantly, remained within functional limits. The rise in impedance could be attributed to various factors, including tissue encapsulation, connection line failure, electrode delamination, or insulation issues, potentially in combination. Other studies have shown that similarly thick insulating polyimide sustains similar and longer periods in vivo than tested in this work47,48,49. High-resolution images of implants from the treated group show that connection lines and the polyimide insulation were intact (Supplementary Fig. Due to the inability to remove implants intact at 12 weeks, connection line status could not be evaluated electrically in treated animals. However, implants retrieved at weeks 3 and 4 showed that, following mechanical tissue removal, electrode impedance returned to lower levels, suggesting that increases observed in vivo were partly due to implant encapsulation and biofouling (Fig. For implants after 12 weeks, high-resolution image analysis revealed that approximately one in ten stimulation electrodes showed substantial delamination (category 5), indicating non-functionality (Fig. Since delamination was absent during in vitro testing, it likely resulted from the additional mechanical stress during animal movements or explantation, as electrode material was found adhering to the spinal cord (Supplementary Fig. It should be noted, that residual material from the electrodes in the sheath surrounding the implant were reported for commercial devices and are an acceptable risk50. In a recent study, the delamination pattern of comparable electrodes was investigated, and a similar finding of explantation or mechanical stress-induced delamination was made34. These results suggest that the electrodes effectively delivered stimulation over the treatment period, with some individual variation where it is not possible to fully exclude earlier interruption due to delamination. Future studies should incorporate additional methods (e.g., monitoring the current or testing the threshold to evoke motor function) to assess implant functionality in situ or utilize coatings that reduce encapsulation, facilitating explantation. Delamination may be addressed by implementing additional adhesion layers between polyimide and platinum (e.g., silicon carbide)51. Importantly, a therapy based on the concept presented here would not necessarily require a permanent implant. While it is too early to determine, the ideal scenario would be if stimulation over several months were sufficient to produce lasting beneficial effects. Further research is needed to investigate this possibility. This study has several methodological limitations, which we aim to address in future research. We investigated the feasibility of subdural stimulation but did not include a group with epidural stimulation, which prevents a direct comparison of the efficacy of both methods. While we did not find clear evidence of regeneration, the transient expression patterns of GAP-43 and other regeneration-associated markers, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, may have declined by the 12-week time point. To overcome this limitation, future work will incorporate brain and spinal injections of viral tracers to label specific supraspinal motor and sensory tracts, respectively. Unlike regeneration markers, these tracers provide timeline-independent labeling, allowing for a more direct assessment of axonal extension and connectivity. To address the challenges of thin-section histology with the large lesion cavity in the contusion model, we will combine viral tracers with volumetric imaging of thicker sections or whole spinal cords using confocal and light-sheet microscopy. The von Frey task indicated a quicker withdrawal by treated rats after just one week. While this could reflect an early effect of the EF treatment on the acute stage of injury, it could also be influenced by reduced sample size at this time point due to non-plantar paw positioning. In the future, we will begin this task at week 2. In addition, at several timepoints, treated rats paw withdrawal was quicker than non-injured rats. This may suggest a degree of hypersensitivity associated with recovery, potentially affecting their paw placement accuracy on the error ladder52. However, it remains unclear due to high variability of this task in uninjured rats27. In future, we plan to perform additional thermal and cold sensory tasks as well as place-preference tasks shown to be sensitive to neuropathic pain. We show that subdural insertion of the implant using gelfoam to form a hemostatic seal is tolerated well in rats; we did not observe any motor impairments in the no-injury group. However, a different approach would be necessary in larger mammals to prevent CSF leakage. This study demonstrates that subdural stimulation enhances the recovery of rats after SCI. However, the role of pulse modalities remains unclear. Despite significant differences in treatment protocols, including daily duration, EF strength, and overall length, the resulting locomotion recovery in this study was comparable to previous findings. Thus, further exploration of a wider EF strength space is essential to determine optimal treatment conditions, something that will be enabled by progress in implant technology and where this paper is an important first step. The applied EF strength in cell culture to promote axon growth is usually a magnitude larger than what is considered in vivo. Previously, a minimum required field strength of 5 mV/mm to promote axon regrowth was suggested53. Other studies have concluded that the time-averaged field intensity rather than field strength alone, is the axon growth-promoting factor54,55,56. To this end, we recently developed a version of the implant with larger poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) based electrodes, which will be used to investigate the effect of higher charge delivery per pulse in the future. The implants were fabricated in the cleanroom facility at the University of Freiburg (RSC, ISO 4, according to ISO 14644-1) following similar fabrication steps as in previous works49,57. First, polyimide (U-Varnish-S, UBE Industries Ltd., Japan) was spun onto 4-inch silicon wafers at 4500 rpm to achieve a thickness of 4 µm after annealing. Then, the image reversal photoresist AZ 5214 E [EU] (MicroChemical GmbH, Germany) was used to pattern connection lines and pads. After O2 plasma activation for 30 s (100 W, STS Multiplex ICP, SPTS Technologies, United Kingdom), 100 nm Pt was evaporated (Univex 500 Electron-Beam Evaporator, Leybold GmbH, Germany) followed by a liftoff in acetone. Then, first 100 nm Ir followed by 700 nm IrOx was sputtered (100 W DC, UNIVEX 500, Leybold GmbH, Germany). After liftoff in acetone, the wafers were O2 activated for 30 s and a second layer of polyimide was spin coated at 4500 rpm and cured. The positive resist AZ 10XT (MicroChemical GmbH, Germany) was used as etch mask during reactive ion etching in O2 plasma (100 W). After stripping the resist in acetone, implants were peeled from the silicon wafers using tweezers. The implants were soldered (LFM-65W TM-HP, Almit Ltd., England) onto custom PCBs. The electrodes on the implants were then shorted and 500 activation CV cycles (−0.6 to 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 100 mV/s) in 1× PBS (P3813, Sigma–Aldrich) were performed in a three-electrode setup with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Ag/AgCl, BASI, USA), and a stainless-steel counter electrode (~20 cm2) using an autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT 302 N, Metrohm Autolab B.V., Germany). Each electrode was individually characterized with EIS and CV in the same electrochemical setup to assess functionality. Thirty-three 2–3-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from the University of Auckland animal facility (VJU SBS). All work complied with the University of Auckland Animal Ethics Committee Guidelines (AEC22644) and the New Zealand Animal Welfare Act 1999. Weights ranged from 210 to 290 g at the time of surgery and increased to 236–368 g at the end of the experiment, 12 weeks post operation. Rats were housed in a dedicated colony/behavioral room on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with rat chow and water available ad libitum throughout the experiment. They inhabited large cages (44 by 34, 24 cm high) with sawdust bedding and were given wooden chew sticks and shredded cardboard slivers for nesting. They were group-housed (4–5 per cage) for two weeks prior to surgery during which they were extensively handled and habituated to behavioral tasks (see below). Post-surgery, rats were individually housed in the same type of cages for 12 weeks. Once bladder function was spontaneous, cages were changed once/week. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, temperature monitored and placed on a heating pad and given subcutaneous antibiotics (Baytril 25 mg/mL, 0.04 mL per 100 g) and analgesics (Metacam 5 mg/mL, 0.03 mL per 100 g; buprenorphine 0.3 mg/mL, 0.1 mL per 100 g; bupivicaine injected along incision site 2.5 mg/mL, 0.1 mL per 100 g). A 6–7 cm incision was made and a laminectomy was performed on spinal processes T10, T11, and T12, exposing the spinal cord segments T13, L1, L2 and L3. Small incisions in the dura were made near either end of the exposed spinal cord in either hemisphere using a 27.5 G needle. Guidance catheters (Alzet, 0007741) attached to each arm of the implant via threaded sutures (Polyamide, 7.0) were inserted below dura in either hemisphere at the T13 end and carefully propelled along the surface of the spinal cord58, exiting at the L3 end. An Infinite Horizons impactor was then used to deliver a 175 kilodynes impact injury using a 2.5 mm diameter tip to the border of spinal segment L1/L2 and carefully centered within the laminectomy between the two sets of stimulation electrodes (Supplementary Fig. The impact tip is then raised ~5 mm above the spinal cord and triggered via software (IH Spinal Cord Impactor v5.0) to deliver the impact directly above the subdural thin-film implant; performing the impact injury with the implant in place did not alter the impact mechanics or affect electrode function (Supplementary Fig. A sensor on the impactor measures the force (kDynes) and duration (ms) of each impact (Supplementary Fig. This injury severity provides an intermediate level of recovery allowing sufficient room for treatment effects. A more severe injury was not induced because weight bearing and proper plantar foot placement were essential for the error ladder and von Frey tasks. Additionally, severe injuries are associated with greater health and welfare risks over extended (12 week) recovery periods, and translating a viable treatment is more likely to first target moderate injuries before advancing to more severe injuries. After impaction, the tips of each implant arm were sutured to the nearby T13 spinal process (Polyamide, 7.0). A thin piece of absorbable gelatin sponge (Pfizer Gelfoam) was used to form a hemostatic seal in the space above the exposed spinal cord and the muscle layer above sutured closed using an absorbable suture (ChomicGut, 4.0). At the rostral end, the implant was connected to a small PCB with a 36-channel Omnetics female nano-strip plug housed in a 3D printed backpack (see ref. The base of this backpack consisted of five splayed feet attached via sutures to an oval piece of surgical mesh. Feet and mesh were placed in a subcutaneous pocket and sutured to the deeper muscle through the surgical mesh using non-absorbable nylon suture (Polyamide, 4.0). Over several weeks, the mesh provided a scaffold for tissue regrowth resulting in a strong anchor ensuring minimal risk of the implant or backpack becoming detached. Postoperatively, animals were given analgesics (Metacam 5 mg/mL, 0.03 mL per 100 g; buprenorphine 0.3 mg/mL, 0.1 mL per 100 g) and supplementary fluid (saline, 3 mL) for 3 days. Bladders were voided manually by experimenters if required in the early morning, midday and evening each day. Subcutaneous antibiotics (Baytril 25 mg/mL, 0.04 mL per 100 g) were given daily and cages/bedding were replaced every two days until rats were able to urinate spontaneously. Thirty-three rats were implanted, 23 of which also received a contusion injury with the remaining 10 designated as non-injured group. Five subjects were identified as statistical outliers and were removed from the study on the basis of post-surgical BBB scores that varied more than two standard deviations from their group mean (treated group, n = 2; non-treated group, n = 3); see Supplementary Fig. 1e, f. Two of the outlier rats were perfused in weeks 3 and 4 to examine electrode impedance of the explanted device. One rat in the non-treated group was euthanized after week 8 due to a foot injury followed by infection, and was excluded from behavioral assessments from that point onward. After 12 weeks, the spinal cords from six treated and three non-treated rats were processed for histology. Starting the day after surgery, animals received 1-h pulsed electric field treatment for 7–11 subsequent days, then on weekdays only (5 days/week) for 12 weeks. Each rat had 62 treatment sessions over 84 days. Animals were placed on a comfortable towel-lined platform that sat within a walled bucket (Supplementary Fig. They were gently restrained by an experimenter, while another carefully plugged in (or unplugged) the implant using an overhanging 1.2 m Omnetics cable plugged into a commutator (SenRing, M220A-36). Four such cables and commutators could be simultaneously plugged into four HS32 Headstages connected with an ME2100 electrophysiology system (Multi Channel Systems) and desktop computer (Supplementary Fig. Stimulation was initiated using Multi Channel Systems Experimenter Software; in each headstage, separate green and blue stimulators provided current-controlled pulsed stimulation to an electrode on either arm of the implant. Four stimulation electrodes on the rostral side of the injury were shorted together in the cable to enable biphasic pulses (Supplementary Fig. Shorting four stimulation electrodes and using them as counter electrodes was necessary because the stimulator permits only a single ground pathway. 2d), delivering ~5990 biphasic pulses in each session. We carefully monitored each animal during initial stimulation sessions to ensure there were no unintended motor responses. The safe charge injection capacity for SIROF with alternating current with pulses of durations in the range of 100–500 µs was reported between 4 and 5.8 mC/cm2,59. The safe charge injection limit represents how much charge can be delivered before the onset of water electrolysis, which results in cytotoxic stimulation by-products and pH changes. If we follow the 15 min pulse width used in prior studies and assume previously reported safety windows apply, the 200 µm diameter SIROF electrodes then only allow for a current in the range of nA's, which would generate an insignificant EF. Instead, we aimed to deliver a 250 ms biphasic pulsed EF, which previously showed promising results in vitro24. Using µs pulse-widths mainly takes advantage of capacitive effects which do not elute high concentrations of stimulation by-products into the tissue59. Since the pulse width applied in this work is more than 1000 times longer than what was tested for the safe charge injection limit, faradaic reactions contribute to the charge transfer, which have the potential to generate toxic concentrations of stimulation by-products and to degrade the electrode if not thoughtfully selected. In a previous study, we found that SIROF electrodes stimulated with 10 µA/cm2 reached a plateau in voltage during direct current stimulation after 19 min, indicating that irreversible faradaic reactions dominated the charge transfer beyond this point, with oxygen generation occurring at the anode after 20 min23. The 10 µA/cm2 for 19 min equals a charge density of 11 mC/cm2. In this work, we decided to settle for the current density of 4 mC/cm2 yielding a current amplitude of 5 µA. The BBB locomotor rating scale was used to measure right and left hind-limb motor function. Animals were placed in a circular open field (100 cm diameter white wooden floor with 20 cm Perspex walls) in the colony room. Prior to surgery, rats were placed in the open field with cage-mates for 10 min on two consecutive days; on the third day they went in individually and a baseline session was recorded. Post-surgery, rats were tested on day 1, 3, 7, and then weekly for 12 weeks. Each session, rats were placed in the center of the open field and then allowed to freely move around for 5–8 min depending on the amount of movement exhibited. If the animal stayed in one place for ~30 s they were carefully picked up and placed in the center. BBB scores were determined from videos of the sessions by a single experimenter (BH) blinded to the condition of the rats during scoring; DeepLabCuts was used to blur out labeling on the backpacks that identified the rats as individuals, and video names were replaced with random words. The functionality of each hind limb was scored from 0 (total paralysis) to 21 (normal movement) and the scores for the right and left hind limbs averaged. Segments of each video were found in which the animal moved around the outside or across the middle of the arena at a consistent speed for approximately five or more step cycles. This allowed a more accurate assessment of front-hind limb coordination and ensured animals were moving at a similar relative speed60,61. Examples of open field locomotion are shown in Supplementary Video 1. Mechanical sensitivity of the hind paws was tested weekly using an electronic von Frey Plantar Aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile), which allows automated application of a filament using a ramping force (set at 2.5 g/s, with maximum 50 g after 20 s). Prior to surgery, rats were habituated to the compartments (5–6 rats at a time) for 20 min on two consecutive days. On the second day, rats were habituated to the presence of the movable touch stimulator, which was moved around below the mesh testing grid floor, and on the third day, a testing session was administered. At the start of each session, rats were left alone for 15 min or longer if required for them to adjust to the testing compartment and become settled (15–25 min). The filament was then applied to each hind paw three times each with an inter-trial interval of 3–4 mins, alternating between the left and right paws. At weeks 1 and 2 post injury, hind paws were not always plantar with the mesh floor; additional measures were attempted at the end of the sequence of testing, but if not possible the measures were not attempted. Starting two or three weeks after surgery (when animals are weight bearing during stepping), animals performed at least 3 traversals of a 1-m horizontal ladder once a week. The irregularly spaced steel rungs of the ladder were suspended between a white wooden wall behind and perspex wall in front to create a 10-cm wide corridor. A 45° mirror positioned below the ladder allowed a Hero7 Silver camera (GoPro) to record the animal's foot placement from the side and below. At one end of the ladder there was a perspex start box, and at the other end a black wooden box contained a Perspex ramp leading into a plastic tray with sawdust bedding. Prior to surgery, rats were placed in the apparatus with a different rung patterned ladder and with cage-mates for 10 min on two consecutive days and allowed to freely explore; on the third day they went in individually and a baseline session was recorded. In this baseline session and all subsequent weekly sessions, the same rung configuration was used. We decided that the short weekly exposure would allow minimal learning of the configuration, and this was preferable to changing it, which would make comparison of the weekly sessions (and recovery) problematic. Each session, animals were placed in the start box and allowed to run across to the goal box. Rats were then allowed to traverse the ladder in the other direction, however, if they remained in the goal box for over 30 s, they were picked up and replaced in the start box until they had performed 4–5 traversals of the ladder. Sessions were scored from videos by a single experimenter (CC) blinded to the condition of the rats during scoring; DeepLabCuts was used to blur out labeling on the backpacks that identified the rats as individuals, and video names were replaced with random words. Each paw placement on the ladder (front-right, front-left, hind-right, hind-left) was scored with a 0 for normal placement, 1 for a misplacement, and 2 for a slip resulting in loss of weight bearing. After 12.5 weeks, rats were euthanised with sodium pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg) and intracardially perfused with 0.9% saline (300 mL) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, 300 mL, in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). A 1 cm section of spinal cord, centered around the injury was excised and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by 20% sucrose for 24 h, and stored in 30% sucrose with 0.1% azide. Sections were embedded in OCT and stored at −80 °C before cryosectioning sagittally at 20 µm using a Leica CM3050S. Every other slice (~1000 µm) was mounted on positively charged slides (Supplementary Fig. Sections were blocked with 3% normal donkey serum (NDS), incubated overnight with primary antibodies in 1% NDS/PBS (Supplementary Fig. 8c), followed by secondary antibodies for 2 h (Supplementary Fig. Hoechst 33342 (1:10,000, ab228551) was used as a counterstain. Slides were cover-slipped with ProLong Gold and imaged using a Zeiss Z2 Axioimager with a MetaSystems VSlide scanner operated via MetaFer (V3.12.1) software. Fluorophores used included Alexa Fluor™ 647, 594, 488, and Hoechst 33342, with consistent exposure settings. Images from 3–5 tissue sections per cord were cut into 2500 µm × 2500 µm sections and analyzed in Fiji software. The image processing pipeline is shown in Supplementary Fig. Dorsal and ventral sections were defined from the lesion center and validated manually. Binary images were created for each color channel (B1), and background subtraction (500 pixels) isolated neuronal/axonal structures (B2). Control histograms set thresholds to remove background (B3), creating stain fluorescence masks (B4). Fluorescently labeled areas were normalized against Hoechst-positive cells to control for tissue size variations. The EF distribution was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics® software (version 5.3). The white matter was modeled as an elliptical cylinder. The width and height of the white matter was varied according to the natural spinal cord size variability of L1 in rats reported in previous work30 resulting in three different simulated cord sizes namely small, medium, and large. For the differences in white matter width and height we used the standard deviations at L1 position. At L1 mainly the volume of white and not gray matter varies30. As we have not found reference data based on anatomical measurements for CSF thickness, we adapted and expanded the thickness range from a prior simulation study62. For all models, the dura, and epidural tissue were modeled as layers surrounding the white matter with widths of 0.05, and 0.15, respectively62,63. The surrounding muscle body had a width of 10.65 mm and height of 9.5 mm. Four rectangular electrodes (Pt, two rostral, two caudal, 177 × 177 µm) were positioned in the CSF with 5 mm separation in rostral – caudal and +- 0.55 mm from the midline of the cord. On top of the electrodes an 8 µm thick, 1.8 mm wide polyimide sheet was modeled. 5 µA was applied to each of the rostral electrodes while the caudal electrodes served as ground in a stationary electric current study. The model was validated by comparing the relative field strength at the dorsal, central, and ventral positions to the relative measured field strengths in rodents stimulated with 10 mm separated epidural disk electrodes43. 80% and 60% of the dorsal field strength, respectively. Voltage transients were recorded in three-electrode setup using the autolab potentiostat (Nova 2.1.6). Three stimulation electrodes on three different implants were used for voltage transient recordings. Three types of long-term in vitro stimulation tests were performed in 1× PBS: 90 h continuous stimulation, 18 days 1 h daily stimulation in accelerated aging regime, and 60 days 1 h daily stimulation at in vivo conditions. For all tests, we used an implant design that was similar to the in vivo implants but had additional fenestration, which does not interfere with their electrochemical performance. For the 90 h continuous stimulation, we first tested one implant without SIROF coating. We applied the stimulus to one 200 µm diameter Pt electrode. We then tested the 90 h continues stimulation on one SIROF-coated electrode on three independent implants. Each implant together with a stainless-steel mesh (~21 cm2) serving as counter electrode was mounted into a 50 ml tube (Centrifuge Tube, Conical Bottom, VWR) by drilling a small hole through the lid. The tube was then filled with 1× PBS and sealed with Blue Tack (Bostik, France). After termination of the experiment, the stimulated electrode on each implant was characterized in fresh PBS by EIS (4 points per decade, 100 mV peak to peak amplitude) and CV (−0.6 V to 0.9 V, 100 mV/s) in a three-electrode setup with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a stainless-steel counter electrode (~20 cm2). The implant was again mounted into a 50 ml tube filled with 1xPBS and secured via a 3D printed part (Gray Resin, Form 3B+, Formlabs Inc., United States) at the top of the lid. The hole in the lid was then sealed with silicone (Dow Silicone 734, Dow Chemical Company, United States). The tube was placed inside an oven (FD-S 56, Binder GmbH, Germany). In the first experiment we assessed the stability of the SIROF electrodes in accelerated aging regime at 55 °C for 18 days, which according to the “10-degree rule”33 corresponds to 62 days at 37 °C. Each day, 1 h of stimulation was applied to two electrodes consecutively using the autolab potentiostat. In the second experiment, we aimed to mimic the in vivo conditions. We used two different SIROF electrodes as in the experiment before, but on the same implant body. The oven was then set to 37 °C and the experiment with 1 h daily stimulation was run for 60 days. Also in this experiment, the same four shorted stimulation electrodes on the implant served as counter electrodes (Fig. EIS was recorded in a two-electrode setup with the four shorted stimulation electrodes serving as counter electrode and measured following each daily stimulation. After the termination of the experiment, EIS and CV were recorded in fresh PBS in a three-electrode setup with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a stainless-steel counter electrode (~20 cm2). We replicated the 60 days 37 °C experiment with another implant, using one stimulation electrode as WE and two shorted as CE. In vivo electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded using the autolab potentiostat (Nova 2.1.6) in a 2-electrode arrangement, with CE located on the implant. EIS was recorded in potentiostatic mode, from 1 Hz to 10 kHz, with an applied RMS voltage of 50 mV overlaid on the open circuit potential (OCP). Implants were pictured using scanning electron microscopy (JEOL 7800 F Prime). Samples were sputtered with 6 nm gold prior. The pictured stimulation electrodes were then classified into categories 1 (like pristine), 2 (light crack formation), 3 (crack formation and delamination <1/3 of electrode area), 4 (delamination > ½ of electrode area), or 5 (heavy delamination). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v10). For behavioral data, two-sided mixed-effects model ANOVAs were used with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and Geisser-Greenhouse correction to account for repeated measures and missing data. Time was treated as a repeated measure and treatment group as a fixed factor. Tukey's honestly significant difference test was used for post-hoc comparisons, with correction for multiple testing. All tests were two-sided and conducted without data transformation, outlier removal, or normalization. Unpaired two-sided t-tests were used to compare impactor parameters, histological measures, and impedance values between stimulation and reserve electrodes. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM), except in Supplementary Figs. 1E–F and 12A–B, where they represent standard deviation (SD). 1–3, S1, S12 are derived from individual rats (biological replicate), no experimental replication was conducted within the manuscript.

Reinforcement learning is emerging as a powerful tool for microrobots control, as it enables autonomous navigation in environments where classical control approaches fall short. However, applying reinforcement learning to microrobotics is difficult due to the need for large training datasets, the slow convergence in physical systems and poor generalizability across environments. These challenges are amplified in ultrasound-actuated microrobots, which require rapid, precise adjustments in high-dimensional action space, which are often too complex for human operators. Addressing these challenges requires sample-efficient algorithms that adapt from limited data while managing complex physical interactions. To meet these challenges, we implemented model-based reinforcement learning for autonomous control of an ultrasound-driven microrobot, which learns from recurrent imagined environments. Our non-invasive, AI-controlled microrobot offers precise propulsion and efficiently learns from images in data-scarce environments. On transitioning from a pretrained simulation environment, we achieved sample-efficient collision avoidance and channel navigation, reaching a 90% success rate in target navigation across various channels within an hour of fine-tuning. Moreover, our model initially generalized successfully in 50% of tasks in new environments, improving to over 90% with 30 min of further training. We further demonstrated real-time manipulation of microrobots in complex vasculatures under both static and flow conditions, thus underscoring the potential of AI to revolutionize microrobotics in biomedical applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has substantially advanced capabilities across a variety of fields, including diagnostics1,2, fluid mechanics3,4, medical imaging5,6,7 and segmentation8,9. AI has also played a crucial role in the development of sophisticated drone technology10 and autonomous vehicles11, reshaping our approach to transportation and surveillance. The integration of AI into microrobotics presents a new frontier12,13,14 and introduces distinct challenges for control and functionality. Microrobotic manipulation offers groundbreaking possibilities, from microassembly to surgical tasks by improving localized drug delivery systems through precise manipulation within complex vasculatures under physiological conditions15,16. However, these applications demand high-precision microrobot control, which is complicated by their small size and complex dynamics. The manipulation of microrobots, therefore, presents unique challenges surpassing those of traditional robotics. Although autonomous vehicles can navigate reliably using established technologies like light detection and ranging and global positioning systems11, replicating these sensory capabilities at a microscale is exceptionally challenging. Microrobots often rely on imaging modalities, as most sensors are difficult to scale down or integrate. Furthermore, unlike autonomous vehicles powered by simpler motor controls, microrobots rely on less precise, wirelessly actuated systems such as those using light17,18,19, electricity20, chemistry21,22,23, magnetism24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32 or ultrasound33,34,35,36,37,38,39, complicating control further due to the influence of external forces. The deployment of AI in microrobotics also confronts issues like overfitting, vulnerability to errors in new scenarios and long, often impractical training periods for model optimization. Reinforcement learning (RL)40 has proven to be a powerful tool and can enable robots to learn and adapt directly from their environment. Although RL has the potential to surpass human capabilities in tasks like object manipulation and strategic gameplay41,42, its reliance on extensive interactions for stable training introduces unique challenges for microrobots, as the experimental conditions are highly uncontrolled and variable. Recent studies have explored a variety of AI-driven microrobots. Researchers have engineered light-driven microswimmers using Q-learning to navigate noisy environments and overcome challenges from Brownian motion43. Advances include the use of deep learning to autonomously steer magnetic swarms, which allows these microrobots to adjust their trajectories through channels of various dimensions by modifying their shapes44. Further innovations have seen the manipulation of magnetic microrobots in three dimensions using proximal policy optimization (PPO) following training in simulation environments45. Spiral magnetic microrobots have also been controlled using deep RL46. Ultrasound-driven microrobots47,48,49,50,51, which have emerged as an exciting non-invasive alternative, are capable of generating tunable propulsive forces, enabling deep navigation into tissues. Nevertheless, achieving precise control and manipulation of these microrobots continues to pose substantial challenges, as several piezo-transducers (PZTs) need to be controlled with millisecond resolution for effective steering, a task often too complex for human operators. Recently, ultrasound microrobots have used Q-learning to navigate in a free environment52. However, such approaches lack generalizability, struggle in complex environments and do not account for flow or shapeshifting capabilities. Although adaptive methods have been used to control individual particles53,54, the training time required for manipulation using these algorithms increases exponentially with complexity. Despite this progress, the capabilities for autonomous obstacle avoidance and counter-flow navigation remain largely underexplored. Given the incomplete understanding of ultrasound microrobot behaviour, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a promising strategy for navigating them through complex environments with high precision. To date, no demonstrations of MBRL with ultrasound microrobots have been conducted. In this study, we employed the Dreamer v.3 MBRL55 algorithm to autonomously control an ultrasound-driven microrobot. Our approach integrates an in-house Python code for imaging and dynamic frequency adjustment of PZTs in an artificial vascular channel set-up (Fig. The code interfaces with an electronic circuit designed to allow rapid switching between transducers, a feature critical for navigational steering. Advanced image-processing techniques, such as the segment anything model56, are used to segment images, detect swarms and track them in real time. This approach frames control of the microrobots as an RL task that enhances their performance over time (Fig. To minimize the need for extensive physical experimentation, we implemented Dreamer v.3 to train within an imagined model (Fig. Although model convergence remains a challenge by taking up to 10 days, we developed a Pygame-based simulation environment (Fig. 1e) to accelerate the learning of essential navigation skills, such as path-planning and obstacle avoidance. This knowledge was then applied to enhance the adaptability of the system in physical experimental settings. The system was able to adapt in approximately 2 h. Within the simulation environment, we evaluated the performance of MBRL against state-of-the-art model-free RL algorithms58, which demonstrated the excellence of MBRL in managing complex channel navigations where model-free RL falls short. As previously discussed in research55, the ability of MBRL to imagine and simulate future actions, as shown in Fig. 1f,g, reduces the training time exponentially. a, Left, schematic of the experimental set-up, which has an artificial vascular channel with eight PZTs in an octagonal configuration. b, Guidelines for manipulating microrobots. c, High-level formulation of the RL problem.

At, action, Rt, reward; RNN, recurrent neural network; St, state; ƒ𝑛, A𝑛, frequency and amplitude, respectively, of the 𝑛th US wave. To address potential overfitting due to training on a single channel, we developed a general model trained across diverse channel environments, including vascular structures, racetracks and mazes. This model consistently delivered 90% accuracy across all trained channels. When tested on a new, previously unseen channel, the model initially achieved a 50% success rate, which notably increased to 90% after only 30 min of extra training. We conducted steering tests with microrobots in a stationary flow through several channels containing obstacles to thoroughly assess and demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. These results highlight the potential of MBRL in advancing microrobotics for biomedical applications. To investigate the control of microrobots through MBRL, we designed an experimental set-up that includes an artificial vascular channel encircled by eight PZTs set in an octagonal layout. To precisely control the activation and deactivation of the eight PZTs, we engineered a custom-built electronic circuit, achieving millisecond switching and integrated with a function generator. The artificial vascular channels were fabricated from transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using standard mould replication and soft lithography59. The entire assembly was mounted on an inverted microscope. The experimental results—images and videos—were captured using a digital single-lens reflex camera recording between 6 and 18 frames per second. Image acquisition and processing were handled by in-house Python code. Our microrobots were produced through the self-organization of commercially available, biocompatible microbubbles, each 2–5 µm in diameter, in an ultrasound field. These microbubbles were introduced into the channel by a liquid pump. In their quiescent state without ultrasound stimulation, the microbubbles remain randomly dispersed within the water solution. However, when subjected to an acoustic field, the microbubbles begin to scatter the sound waves. This scattering, coupled with the synchronized phase oscillation of adjacent microbubbles, triggers their self-assembly. For more details about the experimental set-up, refer to Supplementary Note 1. To elucidate the steering mechanism of our microrobots positioned near PZT6 (Fig. Our experimental results show that the microbubbles were highly responsive to ultrasound; even at an excitation voltage of 4 Vpp, velocities in the range of millimetres per second were achieved in a stationary flow. This action redirected the microrobot to align normal to PZT8 and guided it along the intended trajectory towards (x2, y2). We then activated a third transducer, PZT7, which steered the microrobot along a trajectory towards (x3, y3) while concurrently deactivating PZT8. This sequence of precise activations and deactivations of the PZTs enabled sophisticated control over the trajectory of the microrobot and facilitated complex navigational manoeuvres. Achieving precise navigational control over the ultrasound-driven microrobot presents substantial challenges to a human operator, primarily due to the need for fast (milliseconds) and precise adjustment of the amplitude and frequency of the ultrasound signal, as well as the activation of various PZT elements. These adjustments influence the behaviour of the microrobot, which is often unpredictable. For example, proximity to a specific transducer necessitates a lower voltage to initiate motion, whereas a microrobot that is farther away requires a higher voltage to be mobilized. Similarly, smaller microrobots require less power, and larger ones need more. Furthermore, although the velocity of microrobots tends to scale linearly with voltage amplitude52, their response to frequency adjustments exhibits complex characteristics, including Gaussian distributions and several peaks, which indicates a varied response across different operational frequencies. Adding to the complexity, individual PZTs exhibit different frequency outputs, and the operational frequency range differs for each microrobot. This intricate interplay of control parameters underscores the complexity of managing microrobot movements within this advanced experimental framework. The variability in voltage, frequency and switching between PZTs introduces a substantial action space, which complicates the control process and necessitates an extensive amount of experimental data to effectively navigate this expanded action space. This vast action space necessitates the implementation of an MBRL strategy. Our approach begins by feeding the MBRL model an image of the vascular channel following any PZT activation. This image acts as feedback for our MBRL model, enabling it to assess the current state of the microrobot within the experiment. We then apply advanced image-processing techniques to detect and track the movements of the microbot, as shown in Fig. a, The imaging pipeline processes channel images to track microrobot positions. It begins by resizing and cropping the images, followed by segmentation using the segment anything model. Morphological operations and thresholding refine the results. A cluster detection algorithm then identifies relevant clusters, and the CSRT monitors the position of the microbot, providing data on location, area and target information to the world model. It uses an encoder–decoder architecture to reconstruct the images, effectively capturing the latent state (Zt) from the input state (St). The world model simulates future states (St+1, St+2, …) and actions (At, At+1, …) in the latent space, facilitating the prediction of microrobot movements. c, The actor–critic network is iteratively trained within this loop to optimize the policy. This approach reduces the reliance on real-time interactions with the experimental environment. In our experimental set-up, we employed MBRL to address challenges associated with microrobot manipulation in a complex microvasculature environment. The control problem for the microrobot was formulated using an RL framework in which the state space is defined by image data and the action space as either discrete or continuous variations in frequency, amplitude and the number of PZT activations. Each action involves adjustments to the amplitude and frequency of a single, specific PZT at a time. Rewards are calibrated based on the efficacy of the microbot in reaching a target. Details are provided in Methods. To augment the MBRL set-up, we chose the Dreamer v.3 algorithm55, which is known for its adept handling of high-dimensional state spaces and complex dynamical systems. This algorithm integrates three primary components: world model learning, envisioning possible future scenarios (Fig. 2b) and applying RL to these scenarios (Fig. Together, these elements construct a latent (hidden) model of the environment that predicts or simulates future trajectories, which assists in training decision-making networks with these predictions (Methods). This approach is particularly valuable as it reduces the reliance on extensive physical data, which is beneficial in scenarios like microscale operations where data acquisition is challenging. This MBRL set-up not only enhances the precision of microrobot control but also optimizes learning efficiency, making it a quintessential tool for advancing robotic interventions in microvascular environments. We used MBRL to train our model using experimental data over a period of 6 h. Despite this effort, the performance of the model did not improve, which we attributed to uncertainties surrounding the optimal reward function for this set-up. To reduce the need for repeated physical experiments while testing various reward functions, we developed a Pygame60-based simulation environment to model the behaviour of the microrobot. Pygame is a versatile library used to create interactive game environments, which we used to simulate dynamic and interactive environments for our microrobots. This environment focuses primarily on local path-planning and obstacle avoidance, intentionally omitting the complex dynamics of microrobots, such as PZT resonance and microbubble size, which are intended for exploration in future experimental set-ups. The simulation environment is rendered as a 64 × 64 RGB image, structured within a ‘gymnasium.spaces.Box'61 with dimensions of (64, 64, 3). The agent is depicted with a circular red dot, designed to mimic the microbubble clusters observed in physical experimental scenarios. We evaluated the performance of MBRL (Dreamer v.3) against PPO58, a state-of-the-art model-free RL algorithm. Our findings highlight that MBRL exhibited superior efficiency and adaptability within our specific environment, as shown in Fig. Dreamer v.3 (blue) outperformed the hyperparameter-tuned state-of-the-art PPO (green) across simulation steps. Solid lines show smoothed rewards using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA; α = 0.002), and shaded areas represent ±1/3 of the standard deviation around the smoothed data. d, Comparison of the PPO and Dreamer algorithms in reaching targets in different channel types: racetrack, tributary (four-out), circuitous, squares, vascular and maze.

White circles denote the mean. e, Impact of different reward functions on the rate of target achievement. Solid lines represent the centred EWMA of the rate of target achievement (α = 0.1).

Solid lines represent the EWMA of the reward (α = 0.008), with shaded regions indicating ±1/3 of a standard deviation. Figure 3a demonstrates that in a simple multi-output tributary channel, both algorithms reached convergence; however, our model converged ~50 times faster than the hyperparameter-tuned PPO. Figure 3b shows that for a circuitous racetrack, PPO required approximately 25 million steps to converge, whereas MBRL achieved convergence in just 600,000 steps. 3c, MBRL converged after 1 million steps, whereas PPO required around 25 million steps. Overall, our MBRL approach consistently demonstrated faster convergence than the hyperparameter-tuned PPO across all tested environments, including a complex maze (Fig. We experimented with various reward functions, including binary, inverse and logarithmic (Supplementary Note 2). Figure 3e compares these reward functions and highlights that the motivation for using an inverse reward function is to achieve the fastest convergence. This simulated setting enabled us to refine and iterate on our reward functions and control strategies efficiently, without the continuous need for live experimental adjustments (Methods). To effectively train the microrobots, we began by assessing potential combinations of actuator frequencies and amplitudes through experiments, which revealed a large action space with four frequency inputs, four amplitude inputs and four PZT activation units, resulting in 64 distinct combinations. After a thorough analysis of the experimental data, we developed an amplitude predictor designed to tailor the ultrasound field intensity to the size of the microrobot. This allowed us to refine our approach by eliminating four amplitude options, thereby reducing our action space to 16 precise settings (Supplementary Note 2). We further optimized performance by selecting operational frequencies between 2.7 and 2.9 MHz, which align closely with the resonant frequencies of the PZT. To enhance the efficiency of our MBRL model, we implemented frame-skipping41,62 to reduce the computational load and accelerate training without compromising performance. This method notably reduces the number of frames processed by the MBRL agent, allowing the model to focus on noticeable changes and minimize the risk of overfitting. Additionally, we implemented max pooling (selecting the maximum pixel value across the skipped frames) across the last two frames to decrease the temporal resolution while maintaining essential dependencies between skipped frames. This adjustment greatly enhanced training stability, resulting in smoother convergence, faster learning and improved overall task performance. For our experiments, after testing different frame-skipping rates, we opted to skip four frames to achieve faster convergence (Fig. Although higher frame-skipping rates lead to quicker convergence, they also result in overshooting, as detailed in Supplementary Note 9. We also explored a critical parameter known as the ‘training ratio', which is the number of steps trained in the ‘imagination' of the world model versus experimental environment steps. Using higher training ratios (1,000:1) reduced the need for experimental interactions and enhanced learning efficiency by allowing the agent to learn from less costly imagined experiences. Although a lower ratio (1:1) provided more precise feedback, it slowed learning (Fig. To maximize the benefits of high training ratios, we developed a parallel script to run experimental environment interactions in the simulation or in the physical set-up and the world model training on separate threads. We implemented an adaptive training ratio that was dynamically adjusted based on the agent's performance in the real environment. Pretrained models in a simulation environment have been highly effective in our physical experiments, adeptly handling tasks like path-planning and localization. Our main task was to adjust these models to control the frequencies and amplitudes needed to direct the microrobots in the new settings. A model trained solely on experimental images was deployed in a racetrack channel, as shown in Fig. It achieved approximately 70% of our target objectives within 10 days of continuous operation, but it tended to overfit, causing the microrobot to remain within certain sections of the channel (Supplementary Video 1). Forcing the microrobots to navigate to different areas of the channel resulted in decreased performance and a failure to reach the designated targets. This behaviour underscores the need for further model adaptation to minimize overfitting. It also highlights the value of incorporating pretraining in a simulated environment, which can substantially reduce training time and improve the overall adaptability of the model (Supplementary Video 2). a, MBRL plot showing the training of microrobots on 32 actions in an experimental racetrack with a square channel. The y axis indicates the reward function, with positive values signalling successful navigation towards the target and negative values indicating crashes. The reward drops notably at around 300,000 steps due to overfitting to a specific corner of the channel. b, Top, image sequence illustrating the experimental training of microrobots after 100,000 steps. Bottom, image sequence showing that after 350,000 training steps, the microrobots demonstrate improved efficiency, reaching the target faster (in seconds) 75% of the time.

The target position is denoted by a circle with a black plus symbol. c, Plot of RL performance illustrating the transition of a pretrained MBRL model from the simulation environment to the physical environment. The score rapidly increased during the simulation phase (blue), dropped after the transition to experiments (marked by a red vertical dashed line) and then increased as the model adapted to the physical environment (green). d, Micrograph with superimposed images of the navigation steps of microbots within an artificial vasculature. The start and target points are marked by red hollow circles. Arrows in the top left corner indicate all possible movement directions of the microrobots. e–g, Image sequences demonstrating a microrobot navigating an artificial vasculature, starting from the initial position and sequentially reaching three predefined targets: (x1, y1) (e), (x2, y2) (f) and (x3, y3) (g). h, Heat map depicting the relation between speed and position within an artificial vasculature channel. The colour gradient indicates the speed at each position, with darker colours indicating higher speeds and lighter shades denoting slower velocities. Although pretraining on discrete actions initially offered benefits, it was constrained by the limited action space, as we could choose from only four frequencies, with various responses across PZTs. We realized the importance of determining the optimal frequency for each PZT to ensure effective microrobot navigation at each channel point. To overcome these challenges and facilitate precise adjustments in frequency and amplitude, we implemented a continuous action space. This space includes frequency values ranging from 2.7 to 2.9 MHz and amplitudes from 4 to 14 Vpp, selections informed by manual control experiments. Additionally, we incorporated the rapidly exploring random tree star algorithm for path-planning, which ensured optimal navigation paths. By activating the PZT opposite to the desired direction of movement, we were able to focus exclusively on learning the nuances of continuous actions for frequency and amplitude. To ensure that the agent consistently followed the designated paths, we refined the reward function, triggering a reset and initiating a new episode whenever notable deviations from the designed path occurred. During training, we observed a saturation of the reward function, primarily due to repeated frequency adjustments. These adjustments often caused the microrobots to overshoot their targets, resulting in erratic movements. Furthermore, the model frequently opted for higher amplitudes in an attempt to accelerate target acquisition. Although this approach initially seemed advantageous, it typically increased navigation instability, as the microbot further deviated from the target point. The frequent fluctuations in both frequency and amplitude compromised precise control, making it challenging to get a microbot to accurately adhere to the designated paths. Despite these challenges in integrating continuous action with path-planning, we managed to navigate the microrobots, although not perfectly (Extended Data Fig. In response, we incorporated a sweeping action around the resonant frequency of the PZT into each discrete action using our programmable function generator set to steps of 1 ms. This strategy leveraged the resonant frequency characteristics of the PZTs to ensure that microrobots consistently operated at or near their optimal frequencies. By using pretrained simulation environments, we enhanced performance and reduced experimental time (Fig. The implementation of sweeping actions resulted in smoother transitions and more stable movements, thus addressing the overshooting observed during the continuous training phase, as shown in Fig. This refined approach represents a substantial advance in microrobot navigation as it enables more precise and effective control. Figure 4h presents a heat map illustrating the relation between speed and position within an artificial vasculature channel. We have demonstrated that our MBRL model, once trained to navigate in a specific environment, can generalize to diverse environments through fine-tuning. After the transition from a tributary channel configuration (Supplementary Fig. 16) to an unseen vascular environment, ~400,000 training steps were required to achieve over a 90% success rate. To reduce the adaptation time frame and prevent overfitting to any single training scenario, we exposed the model to a variety of environments, including various vascular networks, mazes and racing circuits. Figure 5a illustrates the reward function and the target success score across ten mixed environments. Subsequently, the model was able to adapt to an entirely unknown environment, such as a multi-output tributary channel, within about 50,000 steps or roughly 30 min (Supplementary Video 5). 5b quantitatively illustrates the ability of the model to achieve target objectives across a range of training environments for various numbers of training steps. The success rate improved from 25% to 100% as the model accrued more training across environments, ranging from simple constructs like empty and quadrant channel to more complex configurations such as maze medium and maze hard. Between 3.1 million and 4 million steps, it consistently reached and maintained a success rate above 90% across all environments, demonstrating its ability to effectively converge and adapt to diverse channel dynamics. This confirms that the world model accurately captured the dynamics and demonstrated robust and reliable performance. Furthermore, we introduced two randomized environments alongside the ten environments during training. We dynamically altered the layout of obstacles by converting white pixels to black, thereby generating unpredictable maps. As training progressed, the complexity of these randomized environments was gradually increased. More obstacles were introduced to intensify the training challenge. After 11 million training steps, the model achieved a 70% success rate in completely unseen environments, highlighting its enhanced adaptability (Extended Data Fig. a, Reward progression over number of training steps across ten distinct environments, including empty, four squares, racetrack, vascular and several maze configurations. Each coloured line represents the centred EWMA (α = 0.002) of the reward for each environment, with shaded regions indicating ±0.5 of the rolling standard deviation (window size of 1,000 steps). Convergence was faster in simpler environments, whereas more complex ones required extra training steps. After 4.5 million steps, marked by a vertical dashed red line, the model transitioned from pretraining across the ten simulation environments to adaptation within a new multi-output tributary channel. b, Success rate of targets reached across different environments plotted against number of training steps. Although simpler environments facilitated quicker convergence, our MBRL model consistently attained convergence across all scenarios. Steps are grouped into logarithmic bins from 0 to 4 million steps, and each box summarizes target-reaching rates across a training run within each bin. Boxes indicate the IQR, the horizontal line marks the median, whiskers extend to 1.5 × IQR and outliers are omitted for clarity. Autonomous navigation and manipulation within dynamic flow environments present substantial challenges for microrobotics63,64,65. Initially, our models were trained under no-flow conditions within a vascular channel; however, when these models were subsequently applied to flow conditions, they faced considerable difficulties due to the increased drag forces. First, we adjusted the reward function to impose penalties for microrobots moving into the centre of the channel (Methods and Supplementary Note 5), where drag forces are typically strongest (Fig. We also incorporated a simulated force in our environment that continuously pushes against the microrobots, quantified in pixel values corresponding to the flow rate we aimed to counteract. 6b, more steps are required to achieve convergence in a stronger flow. These adjustments produced a more realistic simulation of the physical challenges encountered by microrobots in flow conditions. Finally, we refined the physical model of microbubble dynamics, focusing particularly on bubble–wall interactions. b, Graph showing reward progression over time for microrobots in normal (blue line) and stronger (green line) flow conditions, highlighting differences in learning and adaptation. In the normal flow, rewards steadily improve and stabilize around 200,000 steps. In the stronger flow, initial difficulties lead to more negative rewards, but the algorithm shows notable improvement by 400,000 steps. d, Image sequence showing a microrobot navigating within a microfluidic channel under flow conditions. The reduced drag forces at the wall facilitated more stable and controlled navigation. In addition to environmental characteristics, the response of microrobots to acoustic actuation—particularly how they react linearly to changes in voltage and cluster size—necessitated adjustments to the amplitude predictor. This differential power strategy led to more efficient navigation and manipulation within complex flow environments (Fig. Finally, for when we lose sight of the microrobots, we implemented a rescue function that accesses their last coordinates and attempts to reverse the recent actions to return the microrobots to our field of view (Supplementary Note 9). Although ultrasound microrobots offer important advantages for biomedical applications, controlling them remains a bottleneck. In this study, we demonstrate steerability of microrobots in complex channels using only ultrasound. We could guide them autonomously against a flow in real time using state-of-the-art MBRL strategies. Moreover, we show that incorporating a simulation environment accelerated this process. After transitioning from a pretrained simulation environment, we achieved sample-efficient collision avoidance and channel navigation, reaching a 90% success rate in target navigation across various channels within an hour of fine-tuning. Additionally, our model initially generalized successfully in 50% of tasks in new unseen environments, improving to over 90% with 30 min of further training. Furthermore, to facilitate motion in a flow environment, we adjusted our simulation set-up based on fluid dynamics by exploiting low-drag regions near the wall and the attractive forces between the microrobots and the wall. This enabled real-time navigation both against and with the flow, underscoring the potential of AI to revolutionize microrobotics in biomedical applications. We envision our work being applied across a range of manipulation strategies within microfluidics. It could enhance single-cell studies and facilitate research on small animal models such as Caenorhabditis elegans33 and zebrafish embryos66. Additionally, our techniques could substantially advance microparticle separation and other precision applications in biotechnology and healthcare. Beyond these uses, the framework could drive innovations in minimally invasive surgical procedures. This includes the use of ultrasound-driven microrobots, such as shape-morphing47 and spiral48 designs, as well as those propelled by streaming forces51, possibly leading to innovative solutions for medical interventions. Preliminary experiments with passive and active dynamic shapeshifting (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video 7) further demonstrate how microrobots can adapt to obstacles in real time, a critical capability for navigating living systems. We also explored how these microrobots adapt and navigate in bifurcated and vascular-like channels using ultrasound. Future efforts will extend our MBRL framework to shape control tasks by either training policies directly on experimental data or leveraging physics-based simulations to pretrain adaptive behaviours under complex acoustic interactions. For the microrobotics community, our image-based model, once initialized with specific actuator settings, can be easily adapted for actuation systems based on light17,18,19, chemistry21,22,23, electricity20 and magnetism30,31,32, thereby enabling autonomous control of diverse microscale objects across various experimental contexts. Looking ahead, we anticipate expanding our work into three-dimensional (3D) manipulation by integrating several cameras and optimizing the imaging pipeline for 3D data acquisition. Initial experiments have already successfully demonstrated 3D microrobot manipulation (Extended Data Fig. However, integrating several microscopes at different angles remains technically challenging due to the micrometric size of the microrobots. Addressing these challenges may allow the application of MBRL to 3D navigation. Building on these foundations, future work will focus on developing fully automated 3D control systems and advancing AI-driven shapeshifting capabilities that dynamically adapt to environmental stimuli. Integrating medical imaging techniques, such as ultrasound67 and two-photon microscopy, may allow us to study microrobot behaviour in animal models more effectively14. Achieving complex manoeuvring and task execution in 3D spaces will require a more sophisticated actuator system. With these technological advances, we aim to streamline the process for in vivo testing by using state-of-the-art segmentation methods in medical applications8,9, starting with animal models like mice68,69 and eventually scaling up to larger mammalian models. Future developments will also focus on reducing the dependency on expert oversight by creating user-friendly software interfaces and further improving the robustness of the model to facilitate its application in clinical settings. The microfluidic channels used in the study were produced through standard soft lithography with PDMS. Each device was fabricated using a master mould and lithographically patterned with an SU-8 negative photoresist on a 4-inch silicon wafer, which was later placed inside a Petri dish. The thermocurable PDMS prepolymer was prepared by mixing the curing agent with the base at a weight ratio of 10:1. PDMS was crosslinked by thermal curing for 2 h at 85 °C. The ports were created by mounting the puncher at an angle of 60°, which prevented fluid from entering the channel at an angle that may cause a break in the plasma treatment bond between the layers of PDMS, which could result in leakage and the malfunctioning of the environment. Another PDMS layer was bonded onto the PDMS channel by plasma treatment for 1 min, followed by curing at 85 °C for 2 h. A PZT was attached to the PDMS channel wall orthogonal to the aneurysm cavity. The channel flow was circulated using a pulsatile or continuous flow pump through tubes attached to the inlet and outlet. The imaging process began with an inverted microscope, which transmitted live images to our processing pipeline (Fig. We segmented the initial image into channels and obstacles using the segment anything model56, chosen for its ability to accurately differentiate complex visual elements. Following segmentation, we refined and cleaned the image with a morphological closing operation and adaptive thresholding to identify microrobots, which appeared black under the microscope. We then applied detection and tracking algorithms to identify the agent (microrobot), calculate the centre of the microrobot, plot a bounding box around it and initialize the channel and spatial reliability tracker (CSRT), which was selected due to its robust tracking capabilities in dynamic and cluttered environments. When tracking was lost, the system quickly re-detected and initiated tracking, thus minimizing computation and enhancing real-time feedback. Positive rewards were assigned when the microrobot progressed towards the target, whereas movement away incurred a negative penalty. This simulated setting enabled us to refine and iterate our reward functions and control strategies efficiently, without the continuous need for live experimental adjustments. This approach streamlines the development process, facilitating more precise and effective advances in microrobot control. The reward function is designed to incentivize the microrobot to efficiently reach designated target points while navigating around obstacles and taking into account various shapes and layouts of the channels. Formally, the reward R at time step t is defined by the following criteria: where α, β and γ are coefficients that weight the importance of each component in the reward function. The term dt denotes the Euclidean distance to the target point at time step t, and f(x) = 1/(d + ε) is a real, monotonic function that translates the distance into a penalty (or reward), where ε is a small positive constant used to avoid division by zero. This function was specifically chosen to inversely relate the reward to the distance, thereby encouraging the microrobot to minimize this distance (Supplementary Note 2). After extensive experimentation, we identified the optimal settings for our system: α = 10, β = 2 and γ = 0.1. Our simulation results confirm that MBRL effectively learns advanced navigation tactics through interactions within the environment. Thereby, it can master complex navigational strategies in intricate settings such as vascular systems, mazes and racetracks. The adapted reward function for the flow environment f(dt, \(\mathbf{X}_t,\mathbf{A}_t\)) is defined as follows: A step penalty λ is applied at each step to encourage the microrobot to reach the target quickly. The inverse distance reward 1/(d + ε) provides a continuous incentive for the microrobot to move closer to the target, with stronger gradients as the distance decreases. These adjustments incentivized the microrobots to navigate closer to the channel walls, where drag forces are substantially reduced due to the no-slip condition. This approach capitalizes on using the world model to simulate numerous hypothetical scenarios, thus reducing the need for extensive physical interactions. The key advantage of a higher training ratio is its potential to enhance the efficiency of the learning process. It enables the agent to learn from imagined experiences, which are both quicker and less costly in terms of imagination than physical interactions. Ideally, using a higher training ratio reduces the number of environmental interactions required to achieve convergence. We experimented with various training ratios to assess their impact on learning efficiency and performance. For example, a training ratio of 10:1 means that for every experimental step, the agent performs ten steps in the dreamed environment. This strategy enables the agent to accumulate more experience and optimize its policy without the time and resource constraints associated with physical training. Conversely, a lower training ratio, such as 1:1, entails that the agent performs an equal number of physical and simulated steps, which slows down the learning process but provides more accurate feedback from the physical environment. Our experiments demonstrated that higher training ratios, such as 1,000:1, dramatically reduced the number of interactions with the physical environment required to achieve convergence. The results indicate that higher ratios led to faster convergence, whereas lower ratios often failed to reach convergence. To maximize the benefits of high training ratios, we developed a parallel script to run physical environment interactions and world model training on separate threads. This resulted in an adaptive training ratio that was dynamically adjusted with the agent's performance in the physical environment. We formalized the problem as a Markov decision process that includes the state space, action space, reward function and transition dynamics. The state, action and reward triplet at time t (St, At, Rt) and the transition dynamics (T) enable the RL agent to learn optimal policies for microrobot control through continuous interaction with the environment. The state space St incorporates visual information captured by cameras, including the current position extracted from the image coordinates \(({x}_{t}^\mathrm{a},{y}_{t}^\mathrm{a})\) and the target location coordinates \(({x}_{t}^\mathrm{t},{y}_{t}^\mathrm{t})\), which represent the spatial location of the desired target position that the microrobot aims to reach: where I encapsulates the processed camera feed at time t. We used a convolutional neural network to extract meaningful features from the images, such as the size, shape and interactions of the microrobots: I = CNN(Imaget). The action space At defines the set of all possible actions the control system can execute at any given time. In our settings, these actions pertain to the settings of the PZTs: The transition dynamics T(St, At) describe how the state of the system changes in response to an action. This function is unknown to the RL algorithm and must be inferred through interactions with the environment. In our settings, the transition dynamics represent the physical changes in the system state resulting from an activated PZT: where Δt is the time step, and dynamics(St, At) is a function modelling the physics of microrobot motion under ultrasound stimulation, which was extracted from the differences in the images (state). The world model processes the state St into a latent state Zt using an encoder–decoder architecture. This model predicts future latent states and rewards based on the current latent state and actions. Encoder–decoder architecture: This architecture compresses high-dimensional observations into a compact latent space for prediction and control. The encoder qϕ maps an observation ot to a latent state Zt, where ϕ is a parameter vector shared between the encoder and all other world model components: Dynamics network: This network predicts the future states of the microrobots based on their current state and actions, following the principle of a recurrent neural network. It preserves a deterministic state ht predicted by the recurrent neural network using the previous actions at−1, ht−1 and the previous embedded state zt−1: Reward predictor: This component predicts the rewards associated with different actions, aiding the agent in optimizing its behaviour. The agent generates future trajectories within the latent space and uses these imagined trajectories to train the policy and value networks. This reduces the need for physical interactions and makes learning more efficient. The main steps are as follows: Trajectory sampling: Generate possible future trajectories by simulating the environment using the transition model (ht = fφ(ht−1 | zt−1, at−1). These trajectories are generated much faster than the environment interaction and are controlled by a parameter called the training ratio. We developed a multi-threaded approach in which the latent model runs continuously on a separate process without a fixed ratio with the physical environment interactions. Policy and value network training: The actor–critic component is trained to maximize the expected imagined reward \(\left(E\left(\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\gamma^{t}{r}_{t}\right)\right)\) with respect to a specific policy. This training loop leverages the predicted latent states and rewards, substantially enhancing sample efficiency by reducing the dependence on real-world interactions and relying on a very compact latent representation.

Nature Biomedical Engineering (2025)Cite this article Immobilizing multiple types of monoclonal antibody (mAb) on nanoparticle surfaces is a promising approach for creating nanomedicines that emulate the functionality of multi-specific antibodies. However, the clinical translation of these multi-specific nano-antibodies (multi-NanoAbs) has been hindered by intricate fabrication procedures, inevitable attenuation in mAb affinity and insufficient carrier biosecurity. Here we develop a versatile nano-adaptor for immobilizing mAbs and construct multi-NanoAbs using a recombinant fusion protein that consists of Fc gamma receptor 1 and serum albumin, along with the biomedical polymer poly(l-lactide). Our findings demonstrate that fusion protein/polymer-based nano-adaptor is facilitated by FcγR1 on its surface to bind mAbs through receptor–ligand interactions rather than complex chemical conjugation and enables convenient and controlled construction of diverse multi-NanoAbs with efficacious therapeutic effects. We achieved large-scale production of humanized fusion protein/polymer-based nano-adaptor and confirmed the antitumour effectiveness of multi-NanoAb in humanized immune system mouse models, highlighting their prospects for clinical translation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hot tubs and saunas can both soothe aching muscles and provide welcome warmth, but hot tubs might offer greater health benefits. That's the takeaway from a new study done by researchers in the Bowerman Sports Science Center at the University of Oregon, which compared the physiological effects of soaking in a hot tub to sitting in a traditional dry heat sauna or a more modern far-infrared sauna. By raising core body temperatures, soaking in hot water can help lower blood pressure, stimulate the immune system and, over time, improve the body's response to heat stress. Moreover, those effects can last beyond the minutes spent directly in heat treatment. "We compared the most commonly utilized modalities of passive heating as they're used in everyday life and studied in scientific research," said study lead author Jessica Atencio, a doctoral student in the lab of Christopher Minson. "We saw that hot water immersion was the most impactful in increasing core body temperature, which is the main stimulus for these subsequent responses," Atencio said. "Increasing body temperature causes an increase in blood flow, and just the force of blood moving across your vessels is beneficial for your vascular health." While the research team took blood samples from subjects after each kind of heat therapy, only hot-water immersion produced an inflammatory response as measured by the levels of inflammatory cytokines, a kind of immune signaling molecule, and immune cell populations. Atencio and her team were not surprised by those results. "When you're submerged in water, the sweat mechanisms aren't efficient." Minson has studied heat therapies for more than two decades. "There's no doubt in my mind that if people are willing to do some heat therapy, it's going to align with improved health, as long as it's done in moderation," Minson said. "If you repeat these stresses over time, our lab and many others have shown that they are consistent with improved health." Regular exercise can provide benefits similar to and even better in some respects than those from heat therapy, he added, but individuals who are unable or unwilling to exercise may find that heat therapy provides an attractive option. "We want people to be smart and safe about it," he added. As a runner herself, Atencio knows people who like to combine heat therapy with exercise. "We always say that exercise is the primary nonpharmacological treatment that people should be doing to promote health, but some people can't or just won't exercise," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from the Cellular Ageing and Senescence laboratory at Queen Mary University of London's Cenfre for Molecular Cell Biology, reveals how caffeine -- the world's most popular neuroactive compound -- might do more than just wake you up. Caffeine has long been linked to potential health benefits, including reduced risk of age-related diseases. In new research published by scientists studying fission yeast -- a single-celled organism surprisingly similar to human cells -- researchers found that caffeine affects ageing by tapping into an ancient cellular energy system. This switch has been controlling energy and stress responses in living things for over 500 million years. But in their latest study, the scientists made a surprising discovery: caffeine doesn't act on this growth switch directly. Instead, it works by activating another important system called AMPK, a cellular fuel gauge that is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and humans. "When your cells are low on energy, AMPK kicks in to help them cope," explains Dr Charalampos (Babis) Rallis, Reader in Genetics, Genomics and Fundamental Cell Biology at Queen Mary University of London, the study's senior author. Interestingly, AMPK is also the target of metformin, a common diabetes drug that's being studied for its potential to extend human lifespan together with rapamycin. Using their yeast model, the researchers showed that caffeine's effect on AMPK influences how cells grow, repair their DNA, and respond to stress -- all of which are tied to ageing and disease. "These findings help explain why caffeine might be beneficial for health and longevity," said Dr John-Patrick Alao the postdoctoral research scientist leading this study. "And they open up exciting possibilities for future research into how we might trigger these effects more directly -- with diet, lifestyle, or new medicines."
