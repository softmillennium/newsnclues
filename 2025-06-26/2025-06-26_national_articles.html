                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum attends her morning press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, April 2, 2025. MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded sharply Thursday to U.S. government sanctions to block transfers from three Mexican financial institutions, saying Washington hasn't shown evidence of its allegations of money laundering. Shortly after, Mexico's banking authority announced that it was temporarily taking over management of two of the institutions, CIBanco and Intercam Banco, to protect creditors. Sheinbaum said during her morning news briefing Thursday that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had showed no evidence proving that the institutions carried out any money laundering, despite repeated requests for such evidence. “The Treasury Department hasn't provided a single piece of evidence to show that any money laundering was taking place,” she said. They have to be able to demonstrate that there was actually money laundering, not with words, but with strong evidence.” Brokerage firm Vector said Wednesday night in a statement that it “categorically rejects any allegation that compromises its institutional integrity” while Intercam said in a statement it denies being involved in any “illegal practice.” Vector is owned by entrepreneur Alfonso Romo, who served as chief of staff to ex-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador early in his presidency. Manuel Somoza, president of strategies of CIBanco, told local press that they only heard about the order the same time it was made public, and claimed that it wasn't a formal legal accusation, but rather an investigation. ”Rumors are clearly damaging, whether they're true or not. So, what we want is for (American authorities) to come and investigate.” The law officials cited states that they can take such actions without publicly presenting clear evidence if there are “reasonable grounds” to believe that the institutions were involved in the money laundering connected to trafficking. They found “administrative infractions,” she said, but nothing close to the accusations being levied by Treasury officials. Despite that, Mexico's National Banking and Securities commission said they were temporarily taking over management of CIBanco and Intercam Banco “in order to protect the interests of public savers and creditors.” In the orders blocking transactions between the three institutions and American banks, the Trump administration alleged that the three companies facilitated millions of dollars in transfers with Chinese companies, which it said were used to buy chemicals to produce fentanyl. The Treasury Department said the institutions had facilitated transfers to U.S. banks, but officials would not name which U.S. institutions were implicated nor provide more details. Sheinbaum countered that their own investigation simply showed that institutions had strong relationships with Chinese clients and banks, which she said was more of an indicator that the two countries share a robust trade relationship. The leader also expressed frustration on Thursday morning, reminding Trump officials that Mexico is a sovereign nation and must be treated as an equal by the U.S. government.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has discussed possibly helping Iran access as much as $30 billion to build a civilian-energy-producing nuclear program, easing sanctions, and freeing up billions of dollars in restricted Iranian funds – all part of an intensifying attempt to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, four sources familiar with the matter said. Those discussions have continued this week after a ceasefire deal was struck, the sources said. Trump administration officials emphasized that several proposals have been floated. They are preliminary and evolving with one consistent non-negotiable: zero Iranian enrichment of uranium, which Iran has consistently said it needs. But at least one preliminary draft proposal, described to CNN by two sources, includes several incentives for Iran. Some details were hashed out in a secret, hours-long meeting between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Gulf partners at the White House last Friday, the day before US military strikes against Iran, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. Among the terms being discussed, which have not been previously reported, is an estimated $20-30 billion investment in a new Iranian non-enrichment nuclear program that would be used for civilian energy purposes, Trump administration officials and sources familiar with the proposal told CNN. Other incentives include potentially removing some sanctions on Iran and allowing Tehran to access the $6 billion currently sitting in foreign bank accounts that it is restricted from freely using, according to the draft described to CNN. “I think it is entirely uncertain what will happen here,” said a separate source familiar with the first five rounds of talks between the US and Iran that occurred before the Israeli and US strikes on Iran's nuclear program. Related article Everything you need to know about Iran's nuclear program Witkoff told CNBC Wednesday that the US is seeking a “comprehensive peace agreement,” and a Trump administration official emphasized that all of the proposals are designed to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. “Now the issue and the conversation with Iran is going to be, how do we rebuild a better civil nuclear program for you that is non-enrichable?” he told CNBC. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the US and Iran would be sitting down next week – though Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said he was not aware of talks next week, and people involved in the planning said that details were still being worked out. Sources familiar with the discussions told CNN that no dates have been set yet. While the president seemed publicly indifferent to hashing out a new deal after clinching a ceasefire agreement, many of his advisers believe the pursuit of a longer-term deal will ensure the ceasefire has longevity. Qatar also played a key role in brokering the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran earlier this week, and will be working very closely with the US to ensure that fighting between them will not resume, one of the sources added. But Iranian experts cite the possible scenario that the Iranian regime may now decide that it needs a nuclear weapon. The US had presented a proposal to Tehran, and Iran was expected to respond during a planned sixth round of negotiations in Oman. Those talks were scuttled by Israel's attacks on Iran. On Saturday, ahead of US strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites, the Trump administration communicated with Iran through intermediaries. Their message was twofold: forthcoming US strikes would be contained, but also that the US terms for a diplomatic deal with Iran were clear and simple: no uranium enrichment, sources said. Trump has been circumspect about the prospects of a deal, telling reporters after announcing talks with Iran next week: “We may sign an agreement, I don't know.” “I could get a statement that they're not going to go nuclear, we're probably going to ask for that,” Trump said at a NATO summit on Wednesday. “The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before,” Trump said, adding that he wants “no nuclear.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also serves as national security adviser, said Wednesday that any such deal would depend on Iran's willingness to negotiate directly with the US, not through intermediaries. “We'd love to have peaceful relations with any country in the world. And so obviously that will depend on Iran's willingness not just to engage in peace, but to negotiate directly with the United States, not through a third-country or fourth-country process,” Rubio said at a press conference alongside Trump in The Hague. Witkoff on Wednesday said there are “signs” that an agreement can be reached. There are multiple interlocutors reaching out to us,” he told CNBC.</p>

Dan Caine speaks at a news conference with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, Thursday, June 26, 2025 in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Pentagon leaders laid out new details Thursday about military tactics and explosives to bolster their argument that U.S. attacks had destroyed key Iranian nuclear facilities, but little more emerged on how far back the bombing had set Tehran's atomic program. In a rare Pentagon news briefing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, worked to shift the debate from whether the nuclear targets were “obliterated,” as President Donald Trump has said, to what they portrayed as the heroism of the strikes as well as the extensive research and preparation that went into carrying them out. Hegseth appeared less confident that the strikes got all of Iran's highly enriched nuclear material. Asked repeatedly whether any of it was moved to other locations before the U.S. attack, Hegseth acknowledged that the Pentagon was “looking at all aspects of intelligence and making sure we have a sense of what was where.” Experts said enriched uranium stocks can be moved in small canisters and are hard to find. “It would be extremely challenging to try and detect locations where Iran may be hiding highly enriched uranium,” said Kelsey Davenport, director of nonproliferation policy at the nonpartisan Arms Control Association. Trump expressed confidence that uranium was not pulled out before the attack. “Nothing was taken out of facility,” he said on social media. U.S. stealth bombers dropped 12 deep penetrator bombs, called bunker busters, on Fordo and two on the Natanz site, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. Hegseth and Caine described 15 years of study and planning going into the bombing mission and they showed video of a test explosion of a “bunker buster” munition, designed to penetrate deep into mountains. Asked if he has been pressured to provide a more optimistic view of the results, Caine said no. “I've never been pressured by the president or the secretary to do anything other than tell them exactly what I'm thinking. And that's exactly what I've done,” he said. Caine also lauded the troops who remained at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar when the Iran launched its counterattack Monday. He said just 44 soldiers stayed to operate the two Patriot missile batteries and protect the entire air base. “You know that you're going to have approximately two minutes, 120 seconds, to either succeed or fail,” Caine said, adding, “They absolutely crushed it.” Hegseth repeated assertions that an early assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency, a part of the Defense Department, was preliminary and that the report acknowledged there was low confidence and gaps in information. Hegseth repeatedly scolded reporters for “breathlessly” focusing on that assessment and said such stories were just attempts to undermine Trump. That report said that while the U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities did significant damage, the sites were not totally destroyed and that Tehran's program was only set back by a few months. Trump appeared buoyed by Hegseth's fierce display of loyalty and his repeated attacks on news organizations during the briefing. The president said on social media that it was “one of the greatest, most professional, and most ‘confirming' News Conferences I have ever seen!” Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Chris Megerian and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.</p>

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was subjected to more than just the typical boos fans expect to hear during draft night. "Dallas was rigged," the fan shouted. Silver, either unaware or interested in the heckle, carried on without a response. Dallas had just a 1.8% chance of securing the No. Duke forward Cooper Flagg celebrates after scoring against Houston during the second half in the national semifinals at the Final Four of the NCAA college basketball tournament on Saturday, April 5, 2025 in San Antonio. News of the Mavs' victory quickly triggered rigging allegations among fans as it followed the shock of the team trading away franchise star Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers just months earlier. "You're talking about goosebumps that were coming off my skin and also what our organization can do with this whole thing, too," Mavericks great and inclusion ambassador Rolando Blackman said of the lottery at the time, via the team website. "What it means is the Mavericks can live again." Cooper Flagg, right, shakes hands with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver after being selected first overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the NBA basketball draft on Wednesday, June 25, 2025 in New York. Blackman's hopes materialized on Wednesday night when Silver announced Flagg's name. He enters the pros having averaged 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds last season while leading Duke to the Final Four.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• New details on US strikes: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine offered new details about the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities but did not provide evidence that its nuclear program was “obliterated,” as President Donald Trump claimed. The US Senate will receive a classified briefing on Iran later today. • Khamenei weighs in: In his first comments since the ceasefire, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory over Israel, despite its killing of senior Iranian military leaders and strikes on nuclear sites. He also claimed the US gained nothing from its attack. ET today, after being rescheduled from earlier in the week. The House is expected to be briefed on Friday. Iran has moved closer to approving a bill that would suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iranian state media IRNA reported on Thursday. The bill is now on its final step before becoming law, having been sent to the country's president for his signature. This follows its approval by Iran's 12-member Guardian Council, which holds the power to vet legislation and oversee elections. The IAEA said on Thursday that it is “aware of these reports.” In a short statement shared with CNN, it added: “As of now, the IAEA has not received an official communication from Iran on this matter.” According to IRNA, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf has said cooperation with IAEA will be suspended until Iran's nuclear facilities are guaranteed security. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Daine shared video of a test of the “bunker buster” bomb used during US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine offered new details on Operation Midnight Hammer. The US strikes under Operation Midnight Hammer appear to have “significantly” set back Iran's nuclear program, a former Biden administration White House Middle East coordinator who has served under Republican and Democratic presidents told CNN on Thursday. Brett McGurk said preliminary Battle Damage Assessments (BDA) show key targets, including the Fordow facility, were successfully hit. Fordow is one of Iran's most important nuclear enrichment facilities, buried deep inside a mountain to guard it from attacks. Phase III zooms out to encompass all available intelligence and assess the overall impact on the system that was targeted — in this case, Iran's nuclear program. McGurk said, given what he knows about the strikes, he's “quite confident” Iran's program suffered a significant setback, even if the full picture will take time to emerge. Asked about Trump's use of the word “obliterate,” McGurk said presidents often speak differently than military or intelligence officials, but added: “We honestly don't know all the details, but I think the mission did go as it was planned. The news I saw in there was those munitions went down those shafts, and that means that Fordow is probably pretty destroyed and unusable. Certainly the centrifuges, if they were there, cannot be spun again.” Some context: The Trump administration is pushing back forcefully against reporting on a preliminary US intelligence assessment that suggested the strike did not obliterate core components of Iran's nuclear program, instead setting it back by a few months. In his first speech since a ceasefire was declared between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei sent a clear message to US President Donald Trump: Tehran will “never surrender.” The leader has not appeared in public since Israel took out most of his military's top brass and some of the country's most prominent nuclear scientists in an unprecedented attack that deeply infiltrated the Islamic Republic. Khamenei predictably declared victory over Israel and the United States in his address, but Trump's call for “unconditional surrender” last week appears to have hit a nerve with Iran's leader. Khamenei is a disciple of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that at its core aimed to preserve Iranian sovereignty against Western influence. The Americans have had a fundamental issue with Islamic Iran since our revolution.” “And it will never happen,” Khamenei said of surrendering. Khamenei also did not say whether his country will partake in talks with the US next week. He attempted to seize on a rare, and possibly brief, moment of national unity among an Iranian population that has spent decades divided over the regime's policies but appeared to coalesce against Israel's attacks. Many Iranians, including opposition figures and even jailed Kurdish activists, were publicly aligned this month in opposition to Israeli and US strikes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's contribution at a Pentagon briefing was melodramatic but failed to offer “irrefutable” evidence that Trump promised. But Dan Caine, the nation's top military officer, offered tantalizing new information about the strike against Iran's Fordow nuclear plant to reinforce the administration's belief that it was severely damaged even if he could not yet prove it was “obliterated” as Trump claims. Caine's apolitical manner contrasted with days of White House spin. Hegseth fulminated at the media for seeking proof of the President's claims that Fordow had been “obliterated” and mispresented their reporting. He also accused outlets of missing Trump's achievement in getting NATO partners to commit to spending 5% of GDP on defense by 2035. He said all the bombs released at Fordow hit their intended speed, targets and functioned as designed. Caine's presentation made it perfectly possible to believe that Fordow sustained a massive blow. Hegseth berated journalists for not giving the administration that time. President Donald Trump said “nothing was taken out” of Iran's nuclear facilities before the US strikes last weekend — as experts have questioned whether Iran was able to move any of its highly enriched uranium stockpiles from the attack zone ahead of time. Would take too long, too dangerous, and very heavy and hard to move,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday morning. The president's post came minutes after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrapped up a news conference at the Pentagon, where he made a similar point. “I'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be — moved or otherwise,” Hegseth said when asked about the enriched uranium stockpiles. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine deflected on a question of what had changed in the US' ability to assess the damage of its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites after the chairman just days ago said a final assessment would take time. “No one's under there able to assess and everyone's using reflections of what they see,” he said of Iran's Fordow nuclear facility. Caine was asked about his own comments from Sunday, when he said, “final battle damage will take some time” and that the battle damage assessment was “still pending, and it would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there.” He was also asked if he would also describe the sites as “obliterated.” I'll refer that to the intelligence community,” Caine said. Pressed again, Caine offered only a few words before deferring to Hegseth. The defense secretary argued that what had changed was “a great deal of irresponsible reporting based on leaks.” He could use defeat, destroyed, assess, all of those things.” Caine again deferred to the intelligence community after Hegseth's lengthy reply. “The IC should be able to help you answer that question. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said Thursday that he has “never been pressured” by President Donald Trump or Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to provide a different intelligence assessment on the US' military operation against Iran's nuclear facilities. And no, I would not,” Caine said when asked if he had been pressured to provide a different intelligence assessment and if he would do so. “A point that I want to make here: the Joint Force does not do [battle damage assessments],” Caine told reporters at a Pentagon press briefing.“By design, we don't grade our own homework. Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the US strikes on Iran and forcefully criticized the media's coverage of early intelligence assessments of the impact of Saturday's bombing run targeting Iranian nuclear facilities in a Pentagon press conference on Thursday. “I hope, with all the ink spilled, all of your outlets find the time to properly recognize this historic change in continental security that other presidents tried to do, other presidents talked about,” Hegseth said. He criticized media reporting of a preliminary US intelligence assessment that suggested the strike did not obliterate core components of Iran's nuclear program but instead set it back by a few months. “Again, it was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike, when it admits itself in writing that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to make such an assessment,” the defense secretary said. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is holding a news conference at the Pentagon, where he is addressing last weekend's US strikes on Iran. US President Donald Trump announced the briefing on social media yesterday. Pete Hegseth, together with Military Representatives, will be holding a Major News Conference tomorrow morning at 8 A.M. EST at The Pentagon, in order to fight for the Dignity of our Great American Pilots,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. “The News Conference will prove both interesting and irrefutable. “Trump showed the truth, made it clear that Americans will only be satisfied with the surrender and defeat of Iran and nothing else,” he said in his remarks, referring to a social media post by President Donald Trump last week demanding the Islamic Republic's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.” “Previous presidents did not say this, because this is unacceptable, it is unacceptable and illogical to tell a nation to surrender.” “Despite all that noise, and with all those claims, the Zionist regime almost collapsed and was crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic,” he was cited as saying by state-run IRNA news agency. “However, the Americans did not gain anything in this war.” This post has been updated with additional remarks from Iran's supreme leader. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to convene a meeting later Thursday to discuss the future of Israel's strategy in Gaza, according to a source familiar with the matter — one day after US President Donald Trump said he was “very close” to striking a deal on the conflict. The source told CNN that a small team of ministers and senior defense officials would attend, and that Israel was still interested in the framework proposed by US envoy Steve Witkoff, which would see a ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages, both alive and dead. Within the government, far-right parties want to continue military operations in Gaza until Hamas is eradicated. Trump said Wednesday he thought US strikes on Iran's nuclear sites could help lead to a breakthrough in Gaza, and that he was “very close” to striking a deal on that conflict. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for the ceasefire between Israel and Iran to be expanded to include Gaza. Fifty hostages remain in captivity in the enclave, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, according to the Israeli government. Established in 1933, the orchestra has survived multiple regimes, coups, revolution and wars, widely seen as a symbol of resilience. Its hardest days came during the term of hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when the orchestra was disbanded due to sanctions, financial difficulties and negligence. Three years later, reformist president Hassan Rouhani revived the orchestra as part of a campaign promise during his presidential bid. Theaters, cinemas and concert halls went dark during the conflict with Israel, but officials have since promoted musical street performances and poetry readings in an apparent attempt to lift public morale. Iran's foreign ministry has declined to confirm whether Iranian and US delegations will meet next week, as was suggested by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday. “We don't have anything to say about the US' contradictory statements about diplomacy and negotiations,” foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said at a news conference in Tehran on Thursday. “We need to ensure the parties are serious or whether this is just another tactic of sowing discord in the region and my country.” Baghaei claimed that there had been many contradictions from US officials. “While they were discussing diplomacy, just two days before our meeting in Muscat, they gave Israel the green light to attack Iran. On Wednesday, Trump told reporters in The Hague that the US will meet with Iran next week about a potential nuclear agreement, though he said repeatedly that he doesn't believe such a deal “is that necessary.” We may sign an agreement, I don't know. To me, I don't think it's that necessary. I don't care if I have an agreement or not,” Trump said during a press conference at the end of the NATO summit. “The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before,” Trump said, adding again that he does not believe such an agreement is necessary due to his insistence that the US successfully destroyed Iran's nuclear capabilities, despite early intelligence assessments suggesting otherwise. “Given the power of these bombs and technical characteristics of the centrifuges, we do know that they are no longer operational, simply because of the vibration, which causes considerable, important physical damage,” Grossi said. In a televised interview Wednesday, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson told Al Jazeera that the country's nuclear installations were “badly damaged” after “repeated attacks” by Israel and the US. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has received no response from Iran yet on resuming inspections of nuclear facilities. “The agency's presence in Iran is not a gesture of generosity, it's an international responsibility, because Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told Radio France Internationale on Thursday. It's a legal obligation that can't be suspended unilaterally.” Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), an agreement designed to monitor and prevent the global spread of nuclear weapons as well as promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology. Any signatories to the treaty without nuclear weapons are prohibited from pursuing them. On Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi suggested that Tehran could rethink its membership of the treaty in the wake of US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear sites. “The attack on our nuclear facilities will certainly have serious and profound repercussions on Iran's future course,” he told Al Araby Al Jadeed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer looks as Job Corps members stand behind her during a House Education and Workforce hearing, Thursday, June 5, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. The injunction bolsters a temporary restraining order U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter issued earlier this month, when he directed the Labor Department to cease removing Job Corps students from housing, terminating jobs or otherwise suspending the nationwide program without congressional approval. Founded in 1964, Job Corps aims to help teenagers and young adults who struggled to finish traditional high school and find jobs. The program provides tuition-free housing at residential centers, training, meals and health care. “Once Congress has passed legislation stating that a program like the Job Corps must exist, and set aside funding for that program, the DOL is not free to do as it pleases; it is required to enforce the law as intended by Congress,” Carter wrote in the ruling. “We remain confident that our actions are consistent with the law,” Britt wrote in an email to The Associated Press. The Labor Department said in late May that it would pause operations at all contractor-operated Job Corps centers by the end of June. It said the publicly funded program yielded poor results for its participants at a high cost to taxpayers, citing low student graduation rates and growing budget deficits. “Secretary DeRemer rightfully paused funding to reassess underperforming programs, operating in a $140 million deficit, with massive safety concerns at Jobs Corps centers,” Taylor Rogers, White House spokesperson, said in an email. The judge rejected the department's claims that it did not need to follow a congressionally mandated protocol for closing down Job Corps centers because it wasn't closing the centers, only pausing their activities. Carter noted that one of the students named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit lives at a center in New York, where he is based. If the Job Corps program is eliminated, she would lose all the progress she's made toward earning a culinary arts certificate and “will immediately be plunged into homelessness,” the judge wrote. That's far from the “minor upheaval” described by government lawyers, he said. The AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department said the decision prevents any Job Corps center closures, job terminations or student removals, pending legislative action. As the centers prepared to close, many students were left floundering. Some moved out of the centers and into shelters that house homeless people. “Many of these young people live in uncertainty, so it takes time to get housing and restore a lot of those supports you need when you've been away from your community for so long,” said Edward DeJesus, CEO of Social Capital Builders, a Maryland-based educational consultancy which provides training on relationship-building at several Job Corps sites. “So the abrupt closure of these sites is really harmful for the welfare of young adults who are trying to make a change in their lives.” Monet Campbell learned about the Job Corps' center in New Haven, Connecticut, while living in a homeless shelter a year ago. But Job Corps really opened my eyes to, ‘I can do this,'” said Campbell, who plans to start studying nursing at Central Connecticut State University in August. The program has been life-changing in other ways, she said. Along with shelter and job training, Campbell received food, mental health counseling, medical treatment and clothing to wear to job interviews. “I hadn't been to the doctor's in a while,” she said. So they really just helped me with that.” Campbell said she and other Job Corps participants in New Haven feel like they're in limbo, given the program's possible closure. They recently had to move out for a week when the federal cuts were initially imposed, and Campbell stayed with a friend.</p>

Rick Pitino joins Colin Cowherd to preview the 2025 NBA Draft, discuss Caitlin Clark leading the WNBA All-Star voting, and Cooper Flagg's potential. NBA fans were introduced to South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball star Chloe Kitts on Wednesday night as she was at the draft to support her boyfriend, Collin Murray-Boyles. Kitts and Murray-Boyles embraced each other in a heartwarming moment and then started to celebrate as his dreams of being a professional basketball player were finally realized. Collin Murray-Boyles reacts after being selected ninth by the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the NBA basketball draft on Wednesday, June 25, 2025 in New York. Kitts later posted a photo of herself on her Instagram Stories wearing a Raptors hat and later showing Murray-Boyles already signing autographs for fans. Kitts' game is nothing to sneeze at. The Washington native was a five-start recruit coming out of high school and committed to Dawn Staley's South Carolina team over the likes of North Carolina, Louisville, Duke and Arizona. She ascended in the Gamecocks' basketball program and helped the team to a national championship in 2024. Her junior season with the Gamecocks was her best at the collegiate level thus far. She averaged 10.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. South Carolina Gamecocks forward Chloe Kitts, #21, talks to media before practice at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, on April 5, 2025. She is considered to be one of the top WNBA Draft prospects next season in a 2026 class that is already stacked with heightened expectations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denis Villeneuve arrives at the 30th Critics Choice Awards on Friday, Feb. 7, 2025, at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File) Daniel Craig appears at the world premiere of “No Time To Die'” in London on Sept. 28, 2021. Producers Barbara Broccoli, left, and Michael G. Wilson appear at the premiere of the film “No Time To Die” in London on Sept. 28, 2021. In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that — but things are speeding up. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007. Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (“Conclave”) and Paul King (“Paddington 2”). Since emerging with 2010's “Incendies,” Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (“Blade Runner 2049,” “Dune”) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (“Sicaro,” “Arrival”). His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third “Dune” film this summer, with a cast including Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem. To me, he's sacred territory,” said Villeneuve. “I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's “Dr. Daniel Craig appears at the world premiere of “No Time To Die'” in London on Sept. 28, 2021. It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand. Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. Producers Barbara Broccoli, left, and Michael G. Wilson appear at the premiere of the film “No Time To Die” in London on Sept. 28, 2021. Since Albert “Cubby” Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control. That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like “Star Wars.” So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.</p>

Lawyers for Salvadorian migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia filed an emergency motion Thursday asking a federal judge to order their client's return to Maryland, and to block ICE officials from deporting him while his criminal case in Tennessee continues to play out. In an emergency filing, lawyers for Abrego Garcia urged U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to order their client's return to the District of Maryland "immediately upon his release from confinement" in the Middle District of Tennessee, and for the judge to order the Trump administration to refrain from moving their client outside the U.S., or the District of Maryland, ahead of his criminal trial in Tennessee. In the filing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers clarified they are not seeking to litigate his Tennessee criminal case — a separate matter from the civil case Xinis handled earlier this year, when she ordered Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador after he was deported in March in what Trump officials called an administrative error. Abrego Garcia's March deportation kicked off a months-long court fight to secure his release and return to U.S. soil, despite both a federal court order and a Supreme Court ruling requiring the administration to "facilitate" his return. The government eventually complied after months of delay and threats from a federal judge in Maryland to pursue potential contempt proceedings. Upon return, he was immediately taken into custody for alleged federal crimes stemming from a 2022 traffic stop — prompting a flurry of questions as to when the investigation and impaneling of a grand jury, which indicted him on May 21, 2025, would have taken place. Demonstrators gather outside the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., to protest the continued detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported to El Salvador in March. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia told Xinis Thursday that their motion "simply seeks to ensure that when Abrego Garcia is released from criminal custody, he returns to, and remains in, this District (other than to travel to Tennessee as needed), until further order from this Court." Their remarks come just days after a federal magistrate judge in Tennessee ordered Abrego Garcia's release pending trial in his criminal case. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said in her Sunday order that the government failed to prove its case during an arraignment hearing earlier this month that Abrego Garcia was a "serious risk" of fleeing or obstructing justice if he were to be released pending trial for the criminal charges. It also comes as part of a months-long court fight over Abrego Garcia's status following his March deportation to El Salvador, and the government's compliance with court orders to return him. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-MD, meets with Kilmar Abrego Garcia at an undisclosed location in El Salvador. Xinis has yet to rule on either motion. Still, his months long court fight in Maryland, and now Tennesee, have become a national flashpoint in the broader fight over President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies in his second White House term. The Trump administration has repeatedly vowed that Abrego Garcia would be taken into ICE detention, should he be released from federal custody in Tennessee. This fact was stressed Thursday by Abrego Garcia's legal team as they urged Xinis Thursday to take urgent action to keep him in the U.S., and in the District of Maryland. "If this Court does not act swiftly, then the Government is likely to whisk Abrego Garcia away to some place far from Maryland," lawyers said in their emergency filing.

'The Story' anchor Martha MacCallum has the latest on the scene in the Iranian parliament after members voted for a bill that could suspend nuclear inspections following 'Operation Midnight Hammer.' Iranians are experiencing internal turmoil as authorities intensify a domestic security crackdown following the 12-day war in which three major nuclear sites were effectively destroyed. There have been reports of mass arrests and executions in the country. Authorities in Iran began the crackdown following Israel's June 13 airstrikes. It started with widespread arrests and an intensified street presence, according to Reuters, which cited activists and officials. The harsh measures have dampened hopes—among some in Israel as well as Iranian dissidents—that the country could see an uprising and regime change. However, no significant demonstrations have taken place yet, Reuters reported. Armed NOPO special police units are on the scene as Iranians take to the streets in the downtown Enghelab (Revolution) Square in Tehran, Iran on June 24, 2025, to celebrate the ceasefire after a 12-day war with Israel. Meanwhile, Israel's Operation Rising Lion has helped the public realize that the Iranian regime is a paper tiger that is weaker than ever," Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Senior Iran and Financial Economics Advisor Saeed Ghasseminejad said in a statement. The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said Monday that 705 individuals had been arrested in Iran on "political or security-related charges." This report was echoed by Islamic Republic-run Fars News Agency, which said that 700 were detained for allegedly working with Israel. A police officer stands guard as demonstrators wave flags and cheer during a gathering to honor Iran's military forces, following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, on June 24, 2025, in Tehran, Iran. In addition to the arrests, there are reports that three people in Iran accused of being Mossad spies were executed, NBC News reported, citing Tasnim, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). According to NBC News, citing Tasnim, the "equipment" was allegedly used in the assassination of a public figure. People move past a large banner featuring portraits of slain leaders from Iran-aligned armed groups, including Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, in central Tehran, Iran, on May 1, 2025. Nonprofit Iran Human Rights (IHR) warned that at least six others on death row for allegedly spying for Israel are at risk of execution. The organization also said that at least nine individuals have been executed this year on similar charges. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Trump border czar Tom Homan discusses the porous border and possibility of Iranian known terrorists being in the United States on Hannity. The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it is establishing an expansive new military buffer zone in Texas aimed at bolstering border security as illegal crossings continue to plummet to record lows. The zone, known as a National Defense Area (NDA), will span 250 miles along the Rio Grande River through Cameron and Hidalgo counties with temporary barriers and signage being set up to secure the area. Members of the Joint Task Force-Southern Border, under the direction of NORTHCOM will operate the zone and they will be responsible for monitoring and carrying out patrols. They will not carry out law enforcement duties but do have the authority to detain border and transfer them to Border Patrol. The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it is establishing an expansive new military buffer zone in Texas aimed at bolstering border security as illegal crossings continue to plummet to record lows. A 100-mile NDA will also be set up in Arizona, according to an ABC News report citing a U.S. official. Despite the NDA's being set up this year, 98 illegal migrants who crossed into the New Mexico zone had their trespassing charges dismissed last month with a judge ruling the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone – and therefore could not be charged, according to court documents. Immigrants line up at a remote U.S. Border Patrol processing center after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in December 2023 in Lukeville, Arizona. The new Texas NDA comes as the Trump administration continues to see record-low levels of illegal crossings. Between June 1 and June 22, there were 5,414 apprehensions at the border, with the busiest sector being El Paso. During that same timeframe, there have been 986 known "gotaways." Both numbers are the lowest ever recorded. In May, there were just under 9,000 apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the border, compared with roughly 118,000 the year prior under the Biden administration by CBP. When President Donald Trump took office in January, the first 11 days saw only 9,086 encounters, and since the numbers have been roughly similar or lower since then. In 2023, there were points when roughly 10,000 migrants were crossing into the U.S. illegally daily, as many people were able to apply for asylum through the CBP One app. Drew Scheffer, assigned to Joint Task Force Southern Border, provides surveillance over the southern border near Santa Teresa, N.M. on April 12. Gotaway numbers are now averaging 46 per day, compared to the average of 1,833 per day at one point under Biden in 2023. Border czar Tom Homan said that zero illegal migrants were released into the U.S. in May. Fox News' Cameron Arcand and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed victory over the United States and Israel Thursday in his first public statement since a Monday ceasefire ended the “12 Day War.” Khamenei had been absent from the public for nearly a week before his Thursday statement, raising alarms that he'd either been killed or overthrown in a coup. He delivered his first video address, broadcast to Iran, since June 19. “The American regime entered into a direct war because it felt that if it did not enter, the Zionist regime would be completely destroyed. But it did not gain anything from this war.” The U.S.'s intervention was unsuccessful apart from apparently saving Israel from destruction, he added, as the U.S. “achieved no gains from this war.” However, Israel and the U.S. reportedly severely damaged Iran's nuclear and missile launching capabilities. “The Islamic Republic was victorious and, in retaliation, delivered a hand slap to America's face,” Khamenei said, likely referring to the launch of 14 missiles against the U.S.'s Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. He added that “such an action can be repeated in the future, too,” as Iran has “access to key U.S. centers in the region and can take action whenever it deems necessary.” “Should any aggression occur, the enemy will definitely pay a heavy price,” Khamenei said, warning against any future U.S. strikes against Iran. President Donald Trump repeatedly thanked Tehran for the restrained response and advanced warning, using it as an off-ramp to strike a ceasefire ending the war. Fearful of assassination after Israel's opening strikes killed the next three most powerful men in the country, along with over a dozen other senior commanders and head nuclear scientists, Khamenei was reportedly sequestered in a bunker, with no access to electronic communications. A host on Iran's state TV asked an official from Khamenei's office where the supreme leader was on Tuesday, noting a flood of concerned messages from citizens. “People are very worried about the supreme leader,” he said. The struggle has led to rare displays of open animus between officials in the authoritarian country, which has long sought to project an image of a united front against Israel and its other adversaries. Who are busy completing the enemy's puzzle with your pens,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's chief of communications, Ali Ahmadnia, said in a social media post responding to conservatives' criticisms of the president and his Cabinet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate parliamentarian ruled against a provision of the GOP megabill that would have prevented Obamacare subsidies for health insurance plans that cover abortion services. The provision in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act would have been a victory for the anti-abortion movement, which has been trying to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood since the late 1970s. Because budget reconciliation bills in the Senate only require a simple 51-vote majority, congressional majorities often use the process to ram through controversial legislation that would not pass the 60-vote majority threshold for normal legislation. Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has canceled various provisions in the Senate version of the big, beautiful reconciliation bill, including several energy provisions and food stamp reform. Cost-sharing reductions are a form of subsidies for certain Obamacare plans. They lower out-of-pocket costs for patients, including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. Still pending is a determination on the more sweeping provision in the Senate Finance section of the legislation that would prohibit Medicaid dollars from going to any family planning clinic that provides abortion services, a measure that would defund Planned Parenthood. That measure was still under review, according to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee. But MacDonough approved similar language to prohibit federal funding for abortion providers in the 2017 reconciliation bill during the first Trump administration that aimed to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said last week in a press conference with Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Alexis McGill Johnson told reporters that he believed the provisions would not survive the Byrd rule review. “Democrats are fighting hard against Republicans' plans to increase out-of-pocket healthcare costs and restrict access to reproductive care,” Merkley said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Worshippers fill St. Nicholas Orthodox Church in Kwethluk, Alaska, on June 19, 2025, for the canonization ceremony of St. Olga, the first female Orthodox saint in North America. Olga of Kwethluk, Matushka of All Alaska,” as she is officially known, was canonized on June 19 as the first female Orthodox saint from North America. Olga Michael was born in 1916 in Kwethluk, where she resided her entire life with her Yup'ik family and neighbors. Like other villagers, her life followed the seasonal rhythms of subsistence living, preparing food at “fish camps” for preservation and making clothing from animal skins. She married Nicolai Michael, who became an Orthodox priest. They had 13 children, five of whom died in childhood, a tragically familiar occurrence at a time when epidemics were common. “Matushka Olga” fulfilled that role of spiritual mother — counseling women who had suffered abuse or griefs such as miscarriage — and she was widely admired for her compassion and piety, often providing other people with food and handmade clothing. Matushka Olga was also a midwife, delivering many children. And when she died of cancer on Nov. 8, 1979, villagers reported that unseasonably warm weather thawed the river ice, enabling people to travel by boat from other villages to her funeral, according to an official church biography. “She was the most prominent adult in my life,” recalled Wiz Ruppert, who was raised in Matushka Olga's home from about three to 13, when her grandmother died. “Without her, I think my life would have been so different.” Like other family members, Ruppert recalls Olga never raising her voice. “If I had a hard time waking up, she would nudge me, and if I didn't wake up, she would gently carry me to a chair where breakfast was ready,” Ruppert recalled. She recalled the fresh bread her grandmother would make, how she patiently taught her how to prepare freshly caught fish, how she would sew fur boots with sealskin soles for others in the community. “Those are really hard to work on,” Ruppert recalled. After her death, devotion to Matushka Olga spread beyond Alaska to Orthodox faithful in distant states and countries. She's often depicted in unofficial icons framed by northern lights, with the words, “God can create great beauty from complete desolation.” Kwethluk, with a population of about 800 and accessible only by boat or small plane, now anticipates receiving pilgrims. The Diocese of Alaska is in the early stages of working with the village on plans and fundraising for a new church, hospitality center and cultural center. “We have gotten some pilgrims already, although not in force yet, but we expect them to come regularly after this summer,” said the Rev. Martin Nicolai, a retired priest attached to St. Nicholas Church. Orthodox have a similar process to Catholics in determining saints. Sainthood becomes official with a service of canonization or glorification. There are multiple Orthodox jurisdictions in the United States and internationally. Several Orthodox monks and martyrs with ties to Alaska are already recognized as saints by the Orthodox Church in America, the now-independent offspring of the Russian Orthodox Church. Most of the state's Orthodox priests, serving about 80 parishes, are Alaska Natives. More than a dozen priests have come from Kwethluk. Eastern Orthodox churches trace their roots to the beginning of Christianity. But many U.S. churches now have members of varied ancestries, and cooperate through the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor Jason Bateman slammed President Donald Trump‘s supporters during a podcast interview with MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, claiming that Republicans, and Trump supporters particularly, keep themselves insulated from the truth. Bateman made the remarks recently on an episode of Wallace's The Best People with Nicolle Wallace podcast. In his criticism of Republican and Trump voters, the Arrested Development star attacked the trustworthiness of Fox News, its viewers, and the aforementioned voters, claiming they comprise a group of people who purposely ignore reality and facts. Bateman also hosts a podcast, Smartless, with Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. “But the truthtellers, or whatever book all the facts sit in from day to day, there is no attempt to hide that from the Republican voters,” Bateman said. The Ozark star continued explaining his curiosity about Trump supporters, desiring to know their motivation for supporting the president. He suggested that those who voted for him might be among the most affected by his policies during his second term. “And I don't want to ignore it. I want to understand it,” Bateman said. “And I know that there's genuine dissatisfaction with their standing in life or the system and whatnot. He then remarked about those voters who might have ulterior motives for supporting Trump. Again, I'm not wishing harm on anyone, but it's tragic.” “I think the people who are least equipped to bear what the Trump administration is going to yield are a lot of the folks that voted for him,” Bateman said. “And that's really frickin' sad, ya know?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi continued to rail against the Islamic Republic of Iran despite its ceasefire with Israel, orchestrated by President Donald Trump. Pahlavi alleged in a Tuesday statement that the Iranian military and government officials are being “watched” by foreign agencies and told them to “stand down” if ordered to “lash out at the people.” To the world — do not save this corrupt, crumbling, terrorist regime,” he wrote. “At this historic moment, stand with the Iranian people. Do not prop up a regime that will, soon again, turn its guns, missiles, and terror toward you. His message ran counter to Trump, who changed course following the strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities earlier this week. “If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? I'd like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to the NATO summit. “Regime change takes chaos, and ideally, we don't want to see so much chaos, so we'll see how it does.” Khamenei's mediocrity isn't an accident — it defines the system,” Pahlavi wrote. It will collapse eventually, at which point Iranians can realize their goals of dignity, freedom and the right to build a future in their own name.” Pahlavi's communications team dismissed the social media policing as “fake news.”</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are two reasons why President Donald Trump needs the world to believe his adamant claims that Iran's nuclear program has been obliterated. First, his entire presidency is set up to reflect glory on his own strongman persona, fueling a narrative of courageous, unique and infallible leadership. Second, any evidence that Iran retains the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons or to restart its program after daring US bombing raids would raise an uncomfortable question: Should the United States use military action again to try to finish the job and meet any future advances in Iran's capabilities with more strikes? This would potentially open a yearslong period of quasi-war with Iran for which Trump has no appetite; raise the risks of a wider conflict; and anger his MAGA base. Trump and his top lieutenants are conjuring amped-up outrage and slamming the media for reporting an initial, “low confidence” assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency that US attacks on three of Iran's facilities failed to destroy the core components of its nuclear program and likely only set it back by months. Trump redoubled his efforts in a news conference at the NATO summit to portray the raid as “very, very successful.” He added, “It was called obliteration. No other military on Earth could have done it.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth launched a theatrical outburst against CNN and The New York Times after they reported on the assessment. The White House highlighted an assessment from Israel's military chief of staff Wednesday that Iran's nuclear program suffered “systemic” damage and was set back years, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that the agency had evidence it had been “severely damaged.” But these statements, while suggesting Iran has suffered a serious blow, do not yet fully support Trump's expansive claims. He is going global with his strategy of creating his own narratives whether or not there is yet evidence to prove them. He showed how successful this could be with his false claims of election fraud in 2020. If the world believes that Iran's nuclear program is destroyed and all sources suggesting otherwise are discredited, Trump has a rationale for taking no further action. Everything that involves intelligence is, by definition, opaque. And lasting judgments, from technical or human sources, on how far the US set back Iran's nuclear program could take months. But its frantic spin was inevitable, since Trump declared while B-2 bombers were still aloft that Saturday's mission was a total, overwhelming success. But the hyper-emotional response to honest questioning over whether Iran's nuclear program has truly been wiped out makes the White House look defensive, raising doubts about its truthfulness. And it is distracting from aspects of the mission for which Trump can claim credit – a flawless round-the-world bombing raid with no US casualties and his effective pressure on Israel and Iran to stop fighting as well as his success in not being pulled into a longer war. Growing controversy over Iran also overshadowed an undeniable achievement by Trump at the summit in the Netherlands in getting a commitment from member states to spend 5% of GDP on defense by 2035. But no other president came close to achieving anything similar. Its failure to inform some top Democrats that the B-2 bombing mission was underway needlessly politicized an issue on which Trump could expect substantial support across the aisle. Trump's intelligence chiefs rushed to bolster his claims on Wednesday. Ratcliffe's statement said the CIA had obtained “a body of credible evidence” that Iran's nuclear program had been “severely damaged.” This included intelligence from a “reliable source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,” Ratcliffe said. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard posted on X that “new intelligence” showed that Iran's nuclear facilities had been “destroyed.” None of the pushback offered evidence that would allow Americans to make up their own minds. It did nothing to back up Trump's claim in the Hague Wednesday that Iran had not moved any of its stock of enriched uranium before the raids. And it's about whether Trump is truly fulfilling his duties as president if he ignores any evidence the objectives were not fully met. This corrosive trend has been disastrous to US national security in the past. Such behavior is a major concern with huge national security implications under a president who has trashed the US intelligence community and appointed officials to lead it who share his politicized views. Future intelligence reports – which could take months to conduct – might well conclude that Iran's nuclear program has been destroyed or set back far from the point of approaching a weapon. If they don't, Trump has a huge political and diplomatic problem. Now that the United States has taken military action alongside Israel in an attempt to eradicate Iran's nuclear program, he has created a standard for himself. If credible evidence emerges that Iran has salvaged aspects of its program, either centrifuges or stocks of enriched uranium, as has been reported, the president – or Israel –will come under pressure to take new action to stop it. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said it's possible that Iran moved uranium, which is easily portable, before US and Israeli raids. Future US action against Iran could create the conditions for the prolonged war or deeper low-level conflict in the Middle East that Trump has sworn to avoid, and that would threaten to create a new fracture in his “Make America Great Again” political base. There is a precedent for such prolonged and expensive engagements. Uncertainty over the fate of Iran's nuclear program could also complicate efforts to reach a diplomatic solution with the Islamic Republic. Trump said at the NATO summit on Wednesday that US and Iranian negotiators would meet next week. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNBC on Wednesday that his boss was looking for a “comprehensive peace agreement” with Iran that would go beyond the nuclear question. It would be an extraordinary breakthrough after 45 years of antagonism. If Trump could end the US estrangement with the Islamic Republic – perhaps after breaking the foundation of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's power with military action – he could rightfully claim a major legacy achievement. Yet such hopes are dependent on developments in the opaque Iranian system;  political forces that the US cannot control; and extremist elements, including in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, that have a lot to lose in terms of prestige and economic power if the regime changes or falls. Trump, however, played down expectations for a lasting agreement with Iran on Wednesday. To me, I don't think it's that necessary. He implied that a statement by Iran not to seek nuclear weapons would undercut his own claim that their program was obliterated. The complete truth may not be known for months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the Trump administration is claiming that it's unpatriotic to do so. Several days after the US conducted airstrikes in Iran, as the public awaits a clearer picture of the strikes' impact, President Trump is attacking CNN for reporting on an early US intel assessment that undercut his claims about Iran's nuclear enrichment sites being “totally obliterated.” The New York Times is also being targeted by Trump because it matched CNN's reporting. CNN and The Times have not demeaned any pilots. But the administration is casting “any questioning of the success of an incredibly difficult military operation as fake, as unappreciative, and as disrespectful to servicemembers,” CNN's Jake Tapper said on “The Lead” Wednesday evening. Tapper cited past examples of government deception and said, “history has taught us that the most pro-servicemember action we can take is to ask questions of our leaders, especially in times of war. That, for journalists, is the height of patriotism.” One headline at the time stated, “Biden's botched Afghan exit is a disaster at home and abroad long in the making.” When lives are on the line, government officials often have an incentive to hide or obscure the truth — and reporters have a duty to uncover it. “The truth, which literally hurts, is that every administration lies about war, particularly (though not only) about its reasons for initiating deadly force,” Matt Welch wrote for Reason magazine in 2020. Welch warned that “too many people turn off their brains once the battle bugle calls” when the opposite response is actually needed. At a NATO summit press conference on Wednesday, Trump asserted that the B-2 pilots were “devastated” by Tuesday's reports about the early intel assessment. “You should be proud of those pilots and you shouldn't be trying to demean them,” Trump said in response to a question from NBC's Kelly O'Donnell. “There's a difference, sir, between asking about an assessment” and doubting the pilots, O'Donnell responded, although she was barely audible over the president's mic. “No one is questioning whether this was a heroic and valiant effort on behalf of the United States,” Tapper said Wednesday evening.

But he and his entire national security team subsequently confirmed that the Defense Intelligence Agency did in fact produce the preliminary assessment described in a report by The Times and others. So their statement was fake, not The Times's reporting.” CNN also issued a statement after Trump called for Natasha Bertrand, one of three correspondents who broke the initial story, to be fired. We have extensively covered President Trump's own deep skepticism about it.” “However,” CNN said, “we do not believe it is reasonable to criticize CNN reporters for accurately reporting the existence of the assessment and accurately characterizing its findings, which are in the public interest.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals, ratcheting up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Donald Trump's executive powers. The remarkable action lays bare the administration's determination to exert its will over immigration enforcement as well as a growing exasperation with federal judges who have time and again turned aside executive branch actions they see as lawless and without legal merit. “It's extraordinary,” Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said of the Justice Department's lawsuit. At issue is an order signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III and filed in May blocking the administration from immediately removing from the US any immigrants who file paperwork with the Maryland district court seeking a review of their detention. The Trump administration has been locked for weeks in a growing showdown with the federal judiciary amid a barrage of legal challenges to the president's efforts to carry out key priorities around immigration and other matters. “President Trump's executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement Wednesday. “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.” A spokesman for the Maryland district court declined to comment. Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland slammed the lawsuit, writing in a post on X, “This is absurd and an unprecedented attack on the federal judiciary in Maryland. Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings, and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around. That led to an extraordinary statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said, “Impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” Related article Kilmar Abrego Garcia remains in custody for now amid questions over what happens if he's released In an amended order, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” On one hand, he said, the Justice Department has a point that injunctions should be considered extraordinary relief; it's unusual for them to be granted automatically in an entire class of cases. “The judges here didn't ask to be put in this unenviable position,” Sample said. “Faced with imperfect options, they have made an entirely reasonable, cautious choice to modestly check an executive branch that is determined to circumvent any semblance of impartial process.”</p>
