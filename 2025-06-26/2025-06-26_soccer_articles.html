"He must prepare well, and he has the time to do that," the Italian said in an interview with the South American football federation on Thursday.

"He's a very important player for us regarding the World Cup," Ancelotti added.

Neymar, 33, extended his contract with Brazilian side Santos to the end of the year this week.

Neymar's career has been dogged by injury, and he has only played 12 matches in five months for Santos, scoring three goals.

Brazil's top scorer with 79 goals was missing from Ancelotti's first squad at the end of May.

With Neymar absent, five-time world champions Brazil qualified for next year's World Cup with a 1-0 win over Paraguay this month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just under a year to go until kick-off at the FIFA World Cup, set to be held in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, Mauricio Pochettino is keeping a close eye on the play of 2023 MLS MVP Lucho Acosta. The 31-year-old Argentine is working towards gaining American citizenship, potentially allowing him to play for Pochettino's U.S. Men's National Team. That evening, Pochettino shared a photo of himself and Dallas President Dan Clark holding up a team jersey together with “Pochettino 5” on the back. Acosta was ultimately unable to inspire Dallas to a win on another humid night in Texas, with head coach Eric Quill's side going down to nine men late in the game en route to a 4-2 loss. Currently 10th in the Western Conference, Dallas has endured a mixed season thus far, going 5-6-7 in the MLS, with just one win in their last eight games across all competitions. As for Acosta, who joined from FC Cincinnati in February for $5 million, he has continued to produce despite the tricky circumstances, scoring seven goals in 19 games. Whether or not his performances will prove enough to convince Pochettino to give him a shot with the USMNT remains to be seen, although the two have previously spoken, as per Tom Bogert. Discussing the possibility of playing for Pochettino back in September, Acosta said, via Pro Soccer Wire, “The truth is I'm really excited. Pochettino's tenure with the USMNT has been varied to date, leading his side to an 8-0-5 record since his first game in charge in October. This included an abysmal title defense at the CONCACAF Nations League in March, during which they lost to both Panama and Canada. Looking to rebound ahead of the currently ongoing Gold Cup, the USMNT went on to lose to both Turkey and Switzerland in home friendlies in June. Thankfully for Pochettino and Co. they have since been able to quickly turn around their fortunes, winning all three group games at the Gold Cup en route to a quarter-final berth on Sunday against Costa Rica.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dimers.com can exclusively reveal the United States Men's National Soccer Team will host fellow 2026 World Cup participants Australia in an international friendly this fall. In a blockbuster soccer World Cup tune-up, Dimers.com can exclusively reveal the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) will host fellow 2026 World Cup participants Australia in an international friendly this fall. The match is scheduled for Tuesday, October 14, 2025, and will be played at either Dick's Sporting Goods Stadium in Colorado, home of MLS's Rapids, or Empower Field at Mile High, home of the NFL's Denver Broncos. This fixture is another significant step in the USMNT's build-up toward the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which they will co-host with Canada and Mexico. Their preparations began in earnest, kicking off their 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign in style with a commanding 5-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago, followed by wins against Saudi Arabia (1-0) and Haiti (2-1) to book their place in the Quarter Finals. Australia, meanwhile, had to battle their way through the grueling Asian qualification process. Finishing second in their group behind Japan, the Socceroos clinched qualification with their own hardfought win over Saudi Arabia (2-1) in the Middle East. This October encounter is part of a deliberate effort by the U.S. Soccer Federation and Football Australia to test their national teams against top-tier, globally diverse opponents. The USMNT's match against Australia will follow the previously announced high-profile friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September, setting the stage for a valuable series of tactical tests against fellow World Cup-bound nations. “The decision to add Australia to the USMNT's pre-World Cup schedule - following confirmation of fixtures against fellow Asian Football Confederation teams Japan and South Korea - is no accident,” a source close to the USMNT shared. “It speaks volumes about Mauricio Pochettino's respect for AFC opposition and his desire to test the squad against some of the world's most underrated nations.” RELATED: Josh Sargent's World Cup Hopes Could Hinge on Summer Transfer The United States Men's National Team and Australia's Socceroos have only met three times in their history, making this upcoming friendly in Denver a rare but intriguing matchup. This latest USMNT friendly pits two high-profile managers head-to-head, both of whom have only recently taken over their national squads. Mauricio Pochettino, the former Tottenham and Chelsea manager, continues his evolution as USMNT head coach, bringing European tactical sophistication and an aggressive, modern playing style to the American squad. On the opposite bench will be Tony Popovic, the Asian Champions League winning coach led the Socceroos through a challenging AFC qualification campaign, culminating in a clutch 2-1 away win over Saudi Arabia to seal their place at next year's World Cup. With both coaches looking to shape their squads ahead of next summer's global spectacle, this matchup offers a critical opportunity for tactical experimentation and player assessment. While it's “just” a friendly on paper, the implications are far-reaching. Stay tuned to Dimers.com for more exclusive soccer World Cup updates, squad announcements, and matchday previews as the October 14th clash in Denver approaches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article was written by friend of the site Maya VanVleet. Maya provided all the photos shown in this article as well. Commerce City, CO – The United States Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has brought in 25 players to a multi-day training camp to the Mile High City. The camp opened this week under threatening skies that ultimately turned brilliant. The caucus of talented players is scheduled to close Thursday evening following a friendly match with The Republic of Ireland at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park. They will close out with training and play in Washington D.C. against Team Canada on July 2. Regrettably for many U.S. fans, three Colorado natives, Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson, and Lindsey Heaps are not featured on Hayes' roster. Wilson and Swanson recently announced they were pregnant, in March and May, while Heaps has elected to use the summer international window to rest after her European play with OL Lyonnes in France. This decision gives most of the international club team players time to recover from their seasons. Six roster members have played at a world championship at the senior level: Croix Bethune, Yazeem Ryan, Lynn Biyednolo, Emily Sonnett, Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, and Girma. After about six and a half months of recovering from ankle surgery, team veteran Rose Lavelle returns to the U.S. roster. Olivia Moultrie, one of the younger players on the senior roster, made her professional debut at age 13, and signed with Portland Thorns FC at 15 years old. She made her first appearance on the U.S. Senior team in October 2023 at age 18. “On this roster, we have players with a varied amount of experience, and my priority is to deepen the exposures required for international soccer. These are three challenging matches and as always, we want to win, but also to make sure we are ready for the next steps.” Twenty-four players have been called up are training along side the senior team, and are also participating in all educational sessions at the team's hotel. There are two Coloradans who were called up to play on the U23 team: Quincy McMahon and Heather Gilchrist. She then went on to play four years at the University of California, Los Angeles. She played for the Colorado Rapids WPSL where she was All-Conference Defender, First Team ECNL All-Conference, and played in the ECNL Selection Game in 2021. Ahead of the back-to-back series with the U.S., The Football Association of Ireland announced in a media release, “A number of players were unavailable for selection, including Aoife Mannion, Heather Payne, Tara O'Hanlon, Katie McCabe, Jamie Finn, Lily Agg, Jess Ziu and Leanne Kiernan.” While the team is without these senior players, it allows for others to step up. “When these games were first proposed to us we knew that we would be without certain players, but that opens the door for others to step up,” Ireland's head coach Carla Ward said. “We are building, camp by camp, so we are looking forward to getting together again and putting in some extra work that will stand to us moving forward.” Ward is embarking on her first year as Ireland's head coach. Forwards: Lynn Viyendolo, Michelle Cooper, Yazeem Ryan, Emma Sears, Ally Sentnor, Alyssa Thompson Defenders: Jessie Stapleton, Anna Patten, Caitlin Hayes, Hayley Nolan, Chloe Mustaki, Megan Campbell Midfielders: Denise O'Sullivan, Megan Connolly, Tyler Toland, Ruesha Littlejohn, Marissa Sheva, Ellen Molloy Forwards: Kyra Carusa, Abbie Larkin, Amber Barrett, Luzy Quinn, Emily Murphy, Saoirse Noonan, Erin Healy, Izzy Atkinson ET on TBS, truTV and Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It may not feel like it just yet, but there's a party like never before happening next year. Except this bash is being compared to having "104 Super Bowls in one month." Having covered soccer for two decades and at five World Cups across the globe, I've seen some of soccer's biggest moments — from Lionel Messi's glory in 2022 (and his years of agony before that) to Tim Howard's record 15-save performance for the U.S. men's national team at the 2014 edition in Brazil. Lionel Messi won his first World Cup at Qatar 2022. Could he win his second in the United States next summer? (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) It all culminates in 2026, when the most popular spectacle in sports comes back to the United States as a 48-team behemoth, a 50-percent increase in size from any previous edition that will see the tournament span across our borders into Canada and Mexico as well. But to pull it off, it'll take expertise from the people from behind the scenes, most of whom aren't household names. As a proud son of Augusta, Georgia, U.S. Soccer CEO JT Batson knows exactly how to explain to folks back in his home state just how enormous the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be when the planet's most popular event lands in Atlanta and 15 other North American cities starting next June 11. "Depending on where you are, you try to contextualize so it's something people can wrap their head around," Batson told me earlier this month at an event with the governors of New York and New Jersey marking the one-year countdown to the World Cup. "So when I'm down south it's like, Atlanta is going to host a bigger version of eight straight SEC championships. "The Super Bowl, which is fantastic, has what, 120-130 million viewers? The World Cup has six billion," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in an interview with FOX Sports in April. "A World Cup is 104 Super Bowls in one month." FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani took things even further. "I'll disagree with my FIFA president on one thing," Montagliani said in a phone interview. Most Americans now know that the World Cup is a colossus and has been for more than half a century, when the advent of live television turned it into the most watched sporting event on earth. The 2022 final, in which Lionel Messi led Argentina past Kylian Mbappé and France, drew 1.42 billion viewers globally, the most-ever, including 26 million stateside on an NFL Sunday. Entire counties come to a standstill when their national teams play. In 2018, Mexican fans celebrating El Tri's upset of defending champion Germany triggered a small artificial earthquake caused by mass jumping during Mexico's goal in the World Cup. The signature quadrennial event will grow even larger for 2026 World Cup, which will be the first to involve 48 teams — a 50-percent increase from Qatar 2022 — as well as the first to be staged in three host nations. This World Cup, in other words, will be the granddaddy of them all. "When all is said and done, this has the potential to be the biggest event in history," added Alexi Lalas, Donovan's fellow USMNT great turned FOX Sports analyst. In this age of immediacy, the 2026 World Cup still seems distant even to die-hard soccer fans 12 months out. But when it lands on these shores next June, the US public won't know what hit them. "We love big events in this country," FOX Sports Tom Rinaldi told me. "Millions of Americans watch one football game the entire year. The World Cup absolutely fits that same shape. The closest any World Cup since got to those figures was Brazil 2014, which hosted 3.43 million ticket buyers across 14 more matches, or 53,592 on average. "Nobody really knows what's coming and how big this is going to be — even among those in the business I would call football people," Montagliani said. Consider where the sport was in America three decades ago, when top-level soccer was a curiosity at best and, at worst, downright hated by millions of mainstream Americans. "There was no respect for the game at all," Peter Vermes, who captained the USMNT at the 1990 World Cup, its first appearance following a 40-year absence, once said of that time. Lionel Messi, the greatest player of all time, is in his third season with Inter Miami. Three decades ago, there was next to no soccer on television or other media. In the New York City borough of Queens, basketball courts that stood for generations have been replaced by futsal ones that, on evenings and weekends, are packed. Hosting the World Cup will only speed up that progress. "I'd be shocked if we don't get pretty close to, or even north of, five million," Montagliani told me when asked about how many tickets could be sold for 2026. Make no mistake: Stadiums will be sold out from coast to coast here and north and south of the border. In the U.S. alone, the 2026 World Cup is projected to drive almost $50 billion in economic activity, including more than $8 billion in social benefits and the creation of nearly 824,000 full-time equivalent jobs globally, according to FIFA. It's only the third time that's happened for a sporting event and the first for a World Cup; President Clinton had a task force ahead of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, as his successor, George W. Bush, did for the Salt Lake City games six years later. Lalas, who attended a task force event in Washington, D.C. last month, said visitors will be made to feel more than welcome. "We're going to get a lot of international visitors," said Monica Paul, executive director of the Dallas Sports Commission. AT&T Stadium in suburban Arlington will host nine matches next summer, more than any other venue. "But then there are locals as well, and so many people who may not even have a ticket or have the opportunity to see a World Cup game, but they just want to be a part of the action." Paul's group will also organize a fan fest through the competition, as will all the other host cities plus many, like Chicago and Washington, that don't have any matches at all. She's expecting up to 100,000 people per day in Arlington. "Not only are we looking at fans," Paul said. Additionally, the 48 teams will choose from more than 60 locations that have been identified by FIFA as potential base camps. There are 84 training sites and 178 practice fields in all. Add it up, and the next World Cup's footprint will stretch across most of the continent, leaving a legacy in its wake. "When it comes to scale, the hype is real," Rinaldi said. "This event is going to captivate the country in a way that will vastly exceed hardcore soccer fans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid continue their FIFA Club World Cup campaign as they face Austrian side RB Salzburg in their third and final group game, and Xabi Alonso will have tough choices to make regarding his starting lineup. After collecting four points from their opening two matches, Los Blancos now lead Group H following a 3-1 win over Pachuca. Despite making his return to team training this week after missing Madrid's first two games through illness, Kylian Mbappé is still unavailable for his coach, while Raul Asencio who received a red card against Pachuca is suspended. Here is Real Madrid's predicted lineup for the match against Austrian side RB Salzburg. CB: Antonio Rudiger - The German defender is set to start at center-back against Salzburg following Raul Asencio's red card in the last game. LB: Fran Garcia - With no other options at his position, Fran Garcia is set to start once again at the left-back position. CDM: Aurélien Tchouaméni - His role in midfield is very important for his side and he should be positioned as the anchor of Los Blancos' midfield. CM: Federico Valverde - The Uruguay international perfectly bounced back from his missed penalty against Al-Hilal as he delivered a top performance and scored in his side's win over Pachuca. CM: Jude Bellingham - After a tough performance in their opening game, the England star had a top performance against Pachuca and should start against RB Salzburg. Though, Rodrygo could also be a good option to start. ST: Gonzalez Garcia - Gonzalez Garcia has shown a lot of promise in his last two outings and while Kylian Mbappé is unavailable he should earn another starting berth from his coach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States is currently hosting the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, with games taking place in Miami and Orlando. Here's what to know about the global soccer tournament, including where it's taking place and how to secure tickets. The FIFA World Cup is an international soccer (or football, according to most of the world) tournament contested by senior men's national teams from various countries. The first tournament, held in 1930, featured only 13 teams; it has now grown to 48 for 2026. According to sports news site SofaScore, the quadrennial tournament features national teams, and these countries compete for world dominance in the sport. "This difference makes the World Cup resort to patriotism and national heritage," SofaScore writes. "In contrast, the Club World Cup displays the best in club investment, planning and player nurturing worldwide." For those looking to attend the FIFA Club World Cup, you can find tickets on FIFA's website. "After falling to a shock defeat to Saudi Arabia in their opening game, (former Argentina soccer player Lionel Messi) sparked Argentina's tournament into life with a fabulous goal in their next match, a 2-0 victory over Mexico," FIFA wrote on its blog. "He continued to deliver inspirational performances as Argentina advanced all the way to the final, where they faced reigning champions France." It will be a 104-game tournament featuring 48 teams across 16 host cities in three countries: Canada, Mexico and the United States. Miami is one of the US host cities alongside Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City, Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia and East Rutherford, New Jersey. The 2026 World Cup will run from June 11, 2026, to July 19, 2026. Miami is set to host seven matches at the Hard Rock Stadium. As of June 2025, tickets for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 are not on sale. A FIFA spokesperson told the New York Times last year that sales are expected to begin no earlier than late 2025. In the meantime, fans can register online to receive updates on ticket sales. While individual tickets have yet to go on sale, there are some estimates of how much they could cost based on the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. USA TODAY also reported in March that FIFA has begun offering luxury ticket experiences for fans. The ticket package options include a venue option that allows you to watch every match (six to nine matches) hosted at a single location, a four-match option for any World Cup location, and a Follow My Team option for most teams. The venue and four-match options offer four different seat locations — FIFA Pavilion (not at every location), Champions Club, VIP and Pitchside Lounge — in a standard or plus tier option with more benefits. NBCUniversal will air the Spanish-language rights, and Bell Media will broadcast the games in Canada. You'll have to wait an additional year. Brazil will host the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027, running from June 24 to July 25. Contributing: Safid Deen, Lionel Messi Reporter for USA TODAY</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Increasingly, fans and pundits alike are disillusioned with the Club World Cup and asking the question: how is it that there are so many vacant seats in the stadium and tickets available for out-of-this-world prices? The statistics bear it out: Chelsea's stadium was a mere 32% full when it played its first game against LAFC, and other stadiums have experienced similarly half-filled matches. It wasn't all doom and gloom, though. The stadium was less than 38% full, yet there was none of the patches of emptiness that empty seats sow.”. For one writer, it was “the utopia Infantino clearly envisioned” that remains to be seen. It is also half of the problem with ticket prices being elitist. As the article continues to say, “others likely weren't aware that this event was taking place.” Others have also claimed low turnout to be the reason behind stringent security and poor culture for American club football. The combination of all these in one package has made the tournament difficult to achieve such popularity and television view like other high-profile football tournaments. It would have been pre-season for North America's headliner with the 2026 World Cup looming. It has posted comparatively good has had problems that must be ironed out if FIFA is to receive the ticket money and passion of fans it requires. Poor results of the tournament have also cast doubts about the presence of the club competition on this planet, and if yes, then whether it must be revamped as a way of making it interesting. These are voices, reforms are a triple package: made ticket prices lower, further domestic promotion, and hosting games more conveniently closer domestic fans. More in-home supported communities are linked with family traditions, which can be seen in the attendance increases. Surviving will compel hosts of tournaments to come up with means of making games affordable, accessible, and fan-friendly at home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And with a team of mostly MLS players and fringe starters from elsewhere, the U.S. men's national team is perfect through three matches. It has scored eight goals and conceded just one. With 48 teams qualifying for next summer's tournament, these are all World Cup-quality opponents. So, what might we learn over the next week? Here are five questions that we should get some answers to between now and the end of the Gold Cup. But then Patrick Schulte and Zack Steffen pulled out of the Gold Cup because of injuries, and coach Mauricio Pochettino gave Freese his first cap in a pre-tournament friendly against Turkey. Matt Turner then started the final pre-tournament friendly against Switzerland, and we all expected him to keep starting from there once the Gold Cup began. But then Turner conceded four goals to Switzerland in the first half, and Freese has played every minute so far at the Gold Cup. Now, he also made an error that led to Haiti's opening goal, but defender Tim Ream gave him a terrible, bouncing back-pass, and the goal still required a fantastic finish from a really tight angle. I don't think these four games are enough to really judge Freese in either direction. Just look at those shots: He hasn't even had to save anything on the left side of the goal yet. Does Pochettino give Freese a chance to stand up against stiffer competition? Does Turner become the starter now that games are toughening up? This was supposed to be a big summer for the 23-year-old defensive midfielder. Oh, and Atletico Madrid wanted to sign him. You know, the club that's competitive in the UEFA Champions League every season and won LaLiga four short years ago? If you had to bet on these things not panning out for Cardoso, presumably what you would've cast doubt on is the Atletico move. Plus, reported transfer moves fall apart every day, for any number of reasons. Atletico Madrid just spent north of €30 million in transfer fees to acquire Cardoso, who at the same time seems to have fallen behind Luca de la Torre and Sebastian Berhalter on the USMNT depth chart. On "The Football Reporters" podcast, Jeff Carlisle gauges how USMNT fans are feeling about Mauricio Pochettino's time in charge of the team. At the Gold Cup so far, Cardoso has played a whopping 11 total minutes. He started the match against Turkey, but his error led directly to the equalizing goal and he was subbed off at halftime. Now, he missed the opener against Trinidad and Tobago because of an illness, so maybe that put him behind the eight ball. And maybe Pochettino's approach to the knockout matches will be different from what he has done through the group stage. But as of three weeks ago, it seemed like Cardoso was a potential starter at the World Cup. As of right now, it's unclear whether he'll even make the roster. Coming into this summer, it seemed like center back was the one position where the USMNT had most, and possibly all, of its potential World Cup starters on the Gold Cup roster. Crystal Palace's Chris Richards would be one half of the pairing, and then we'd actually get new, useful information about who was most likely to be there next to him. Miles Robinson started the match against Turkey next to Richards, but then Mark McKenzie replaced him at halftime. McKenzie then started against Switzerland, but with Walker Zimmerman by his side, not Richards. If you were going to draw one half-conclusion from the two friendlies, it might've been: Tim Ream is no longer in the picture. Instead, the 37-year-old Ream has played every minute of every match at the Gold Cup so far ... and he has been pretty darn important, too. Although he's a center back, Ream has added more expected possession value -- essentially, how much everything you do on the ball increases or decreases your team's chances of scoring a goal -- than all but three other USMNT players. Some of that is because he has played so many minutes, but a large chunk of it is that he's still so important to how the team moves the ball up the field. Ream has played 14 passes into the attacking third that have increased the USMNT's chances of scoring a goal by at least half a percent; no one else has more than eight. That might seem like a nothing number, but most of what happens on a soccer field doesn't drastically shift goal probabilities -- it's all about racking up a bunch of tiny moments that eventually add up. We'll see how Ream holds up against the stiffer competition, though. He has been a fantastic and underappreciated player for most of his career. Through three matches, the players replacing Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah have been quite good. Malik Tillman has played every minute of every game and leads the team in goals and possession value added. He has also been a fantastic final-third defender. For a team that has really struggled to break down low blocks, his creativity could bring something new and important. He has completed 11 passes into the penalty area -- no one else has more than six -- and leads the team in expected assists. Diego Luna, meanwhile, provides the rare combination of "guy who might actually try to fight a tank with his bare hands" and "guy who never loses the ball." There's a place for massive amounts of energy and ball security on most national team rosters. Tillman is still kind of a strange player: He's an attacking midfielder who relies more on positioning and off-ball running rather than a high volume of touches and seeing-eye creativity. McGlynn did most of his damage against a really weak Trinidad and Tobago team. And will Luna be able to provide enough attacking production once the schedule gets harder? All three players have really interesting qualities that could help the USMNT next summer, but the next game (or two ... or three, depending on how deep their Gold Cup run goes) should give us a better sense of how those traits will scale up against stiffer opponents. So, the U.S. is moving slightly slower and playing games with even fewer possessions than those already-program-low rates. A lot of this has to do with the approaches of its opponents, combined with the Trinidad and Tobago game being over by halftime, but another pre-tournament favorite, Canada, still manages to embrace a lot more chaos even when it's heavily fancied against its conservative opponents. Under Pochettino, the Americans' haven't really found a way to break down reasonably talented teams that are willing to sit back and counter-attack. And if they still haven't figured that out, then, well, their tournament is going to be over in just a couple of days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the United States men's national team, it has been a summer of podcast outbursts forming a tetchy soundtrack one year out from a heavily anticipated home World Cup. Following Christian Pulisic's decision not to join up with Mauricio Pochettino's team for the Gold Cup — along with a slew of other absentees — criticism came from USMNT icons Landon Donovan and Tim Howard (on their own podcast), Pulisic issued a riposte (on a CBS podcast) and Clint Dempsey said he struggled to understand Pulisic's decision (on the Men In Blazers podcast). In between all that, Pulisic's father appeared to launch a broadside at Donovan via Instagram (on a post liked by his son). Pochettino also used his news conferences to assert his authority, saying players “cannot dictate the plan” after Pulisic claimed he offered to play in the two warmup friendly games but with the condition of dropping out for the Gold Cup. Dempsey also pointed out how the situation might have been averted if U.S. Soccer, the nation's governing body, and Pulisic had aligned more closely on their messaging. During an interview with The Athletic, Dempsey said: “Why wasn't there a way that we could have been more unified in the messaging that's going out to the public? You have one of the best players for the national team, and if it had been England, if Harry Kane was missing a tournament or the Nations League or World Cup qualifying, there would be people asking questions. Then there's no back and forth looking like two people are at odds with each other, especially a year out from the World Cup. Dempsey, who earned more than 140 senior caps, has previously revealed he once had a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection in his adductor to play for the USMNT. He was asked whether his locker room would have required the federation to step in or if the players would have held themselves to account. Is there something I can do for you? At the same time, for me, it was never a question if I was going to go into the national team and play,” Dempsey said. “I knew that there were a lot of kids where I am from that didn't make it. “What's made this situation difficult is what happened with Copa America when we did not get out of the group stage, then losing to Panama and Canada in Nations League and then the four losses in a row, the worst streak we'd had in a long time. It put more pressure on this Gold Cup. There are not many opportunities left after this for meaningful games, and you want to try to get things right.” Pulisic, who racked up more than 3,500 minutes for Milan in the 2024-25 season, told CBS his body and mind “started talking” to him towards the end of the campaign and he felt a rest was best for his fitness. Does Dempsey, who spent 15 seasons playing in the English Premier League and in MLS, believe that USMNT players in Europe have a uniquely difficult task to balance club and country responsibilities? “No matter what league you're in, it's going to be difficult,” he said. When I played MLS, you weren't flying privately. But then in Europe at the top teams, you're playing in more competitions and it is a grind to go back and forth to the States.” And what of the soap opera that has surrounded the team this summer, with former players offering strong opinions and current players hitting back? “It shows there's a climate where people care,” Dempsey said. “I'm not trying to be a part of the drama. In terms of the Christian situation, all I think is U.S. Soccer could have been more unified about how that gets out to the public. “Playing for your country in a tournament, I tell you what my mentality was. I am not saying whether someone's doing right or wrong. Everybody has a right to their opinion — it shows that people do care, but you never want to get in a situation where it's tit for tat. They're gonna be in this Gold Cup, they're gonna push to get into the lineup and get this fanbase and team back on track to being inspired because we are one year out from the greatest tournament.” He said: “You've had this new talent, you've developed it so far, but then where's this next young talent that's coming up and pushing these guys and having competition for spots? Dempsey was talking to The Athletic as part of an initiative led by Abbott, a healthcare firm that has partnered with Real Madrid as part of the Abbott Dream Team program, which will see youngsters try out in cities across the U.S. for the opportunity to then travel to Spain to train under Real Madrid coaches and learn about sports nutrition from the club's medical team. “A buddy of mine, José Torres, he's from Longview, Texas. He played Hispanic leagues on Sunday, but through his play in Hispanic leagues, this allowed him to get a trial in Mexico with a Liga MX team and he was able to make it.” More broadly, the program is part of Abbott's and Real Madrid's ongoing “Beat Malnutrition” campaign to provide nutrition education and malnutrition screening to children in 12 countries around the world. Last weekend, during a conversation at Fanatics Fest in New York, FIFA president Gianni Infantino criticized the “pay-to-play” model for many young soccer players in the U.S., saying, “For children, it must be free to play football.” When speaking to The Athletic before Infantino's intervention, Dempsey said there is room for improvement. “My son is in an MLS academy and you don't have to pay to play,” Dempsey said. “If you're good enough, it doesn't matter where you come from, what your background is, that is covered. For the players in rural areas or inner cities that are not around MLS teams, it is a lot more difficult. It is a financial strain, and my family went into debt doing that. I didn't have a college fund growing up. It was, ‘How bad do you want something in life? Hopefully, that changes, but it's just so difficult to fix everything.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Esposito scored his first goal for Inter Milan in the win against River Plate Inter Milan went through to the last 16 of the Club World Cup with victory over Argentine side River Plate, who finished their final Group E game with nine players and are out of the tournament. The bad-tempered match at Lumen Field in Seattle ended with River Plate's Marcos Acuna having to be restrained by team-mates and staff - including his captain Franco Armani and Inter manager Cristian Chivu - as he chased opposition winger Denzel Dumfries who was jogging off the pitch. Fans threw objects at players as Dumfries was escorted down the tunnel. That was preceded by a melee between players from the two sides, sparked by a tackle by Acuna on Dumfries, with River Plate's Gonzalo Montiel dismissed in the aftermath after picking up a second yellow card. The Argentine side had already seen Lucas Martinez Quarta sent off after 66 minutes for denying midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan a goalscoring opportunity. "We have the job done," said Inter's Romanian boss Cristian Chivu. "We qualify for the further stage of this competition. "The game was very tough for us in the first half, River had a lot of aggression, a lot of intensity. Inter, who were beaten by Paris St-Germain in the Champions League final, will play Brazilian club Fluminense in the last 16 on Monday at 20:00 BST. Monterrey beat Urawa Red Diamonds 4-0 to progress to the knockout stage by  finishing second in Group E on five points - one point ahead of River Plate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the third-place team in Group E, the Rayados needed to win, scoring as many goals as possible, and then hope for a winner at Lumen Field during the match between River Plate and Inter Milan, because if the match was tied 2-2, Monterrey would be eliminated no matter what happened in Pasadena. “We have to enjoy now, the present,” said Domenec Torrent, Monterrey's technical director. Torrent added that he was happy to finish unbeaten during three group stage matches, earning one win and two draws. “We knew it was going to be a complex match. Urawa, despite being eliminated, we knew they were going to play a difficult game,” Monterrey midfielder Óliver Torres said. We knew it was a very important day for all the club's workers, for all the fans who were here and at home, and well, for all of Mexico.” Monterrey settled the match in a matter of nine minutes. Two minutes later, Argentine Germán Berterame fired a low shot on the right side of the Japanese goal and scored. Then, Jesús “Tecatito” Corona fired a long-range missile, extending Monterrey's lead to 3-0. “We were coming to win, but I think it was a dream night.” Monterrey will face Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta while Inter Milan will face Fluminense on Monday at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C., in the round of 16 of the tournament. “The next game we know is very difficult,” said Torrent, who added Dortmund plays a style very similar to Inter Milan. “It's another European team that competes very well, they have won things. We already know how they play, I've seen them very well.” Sergio Ramos' Monterrey and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami are the only two CONCACAF teams to survive the first round, as Pachuca, Seattle and LAFC were eliminated during the group stage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan have powered into the last 16 of the Club World Cup, scoring a stormy 2-0 victory over River Plate that sealed the Argentinian club's exit and sparked dramatic scenes at full-time. Teenage striker Francesco Esposito and Alessandro Bastoni scored the goals to settle a physical contest which saw River finish with nine men. The final whistle was marred by an ugly melee which saw players from both sides clash as they sprinted off the pitch, with missiles being thrown by River's fans at Seattle's Lumen Field. Both Argentine teams at the tournament, River and their rivals Boca Juniors, have been eliminated despite their fans creating vibrant atmospheres. “It's a shame for all the people who came en masse to watch the team that we couldn't give them the chance to keep going,” said disappointed River coach Marcelo Gallardo.” The tall teenage striker collected a pass from Petar Sucic, elegantly lost his marker before drilling a shot into the bottom right-hand corner past River goalkeeper Franco Armani. Bastoni then bagged Inter's second deep into injury time to seal a win which sets up a last 16 meeting against Brazil's Fluminense next Monday. Mexico's Monterrey, 4-0 winners over already-eliminated Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds, finished as runners-up in Group E and will face Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 on July 2. River's campaign ended in disarray, with defender Lucas Martinez Quarta sent off for denial of a goal-scoring opportunity in the 66th minute. Argentina international Gonzalo Montiel then followed his team-mate off the field in injury time after picking up a second yellow card Inter and River Plate had gone into the game with the Group E standings on a knife edge. But after Monterrey swept into an early 3-0 lead against Urawa in Pasadena, the stakes soon became clear in Seattle, where the winner would advance provided the result in California held. After a scrappy first half, Inter began to get on top in the second half against a River side who struggled to create much of note in the final third. Inter striker Lautaro Martinez squandered a golden chance in the 55th minute, shooting straight at Armani after cutting side. The game tilted decisively in Inter's favour in the 65th minute when Martinez Quarta was dismissed for bringing down Henrikh Mkhitaryan as the former Manchester United player went down on goal. Dortmund's second straight victory by a one-goal margin, following their 4-3 defeat of Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday, was watched by only just over 8,000 spectators in Cincinnati, among them US Vice President JD Vance and FIFA chief Gianni Infantino. It means Dortmund qualify for the last 16 as winners of Group F, while Fluminense go through behind them in second after holding off Sundowns in a goalless stalemate played at the same time in Miami. I think our performance was better than in the first two matches,” said Dortmund coach Niko Kovac. What the boys are doing is incredible. “Even if you just stand around it can get very taxing but I think they are doing a great job. Ulsan go home with three defeats from three games, while Fluminense are through, meaning all four Brazilian teams in the competition have progressed to the knockout phase. Conditions were also tough in Miami, where captain Jhon Arias flashed a shot across the face of goal and wide for Fluminense late in the first half. Their exit means none of the four African clubs who came to the tournament will feature in the last 16, but Sundowns' performances mean they can go home with their heads held high. We had a clear objective in this match, but I am very proud of the level the players performed at,” said the South African champions' coach, Miguel Cardoso.</p>
