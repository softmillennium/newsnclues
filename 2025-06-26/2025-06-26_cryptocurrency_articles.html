Joseph Lubin

Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin said that he might introduce leverage to Sharplink Gaming Inc., the sports betting and gaming technology firm that recently turned into an Ether treasury company, which Lubin serves as chairman.

“Sharplink isn't leveraged,” Lubin, also the founder and chief executive officer of Ethereum software infrastructure provider Consensys, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Thursday. “We may do some things that bring a bit of leverage into the situation, convertible equity potentially. We will do bond issuance at low rates with long duration. We will not put the strategy at risk.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pickup in MVRV momentum, profitability and onchain activity could push BTC above the next big hurdle at $110,000 into price discovery. Spot and onchain transfer volume must recover for BTC price to break out. Bitcoin's 50% rally to $112,000 from its April lows below $74,000 appears to be cooling off, but traders believe that BTC remains on track toward higher targets in 2025. A pickup in MVRV momentum would suggest that investors hold longer, reducing selling pressure. This, coupled with strong ETF inflows, could trigger Bitcoin's breakout past its current $112,000 peak, potentially reaching levels above $165,000, as predicted by analysts. Related: Bitcoin ‘Satoshi-era' miners sold just 150 BTC in 2025 amid all-time highs The 7-day moving average of onchain transfer volume has dropped by approximately 32% to $52 billion over the last weekend from a peak of $76 billion in late May. Additionally, current spot trading volume sits around $7.7 billion, significantly lower than the cyclical peaks in this bull market. This divergence further underscores the lack of speculative intensity. In its latest Week Onchain report, Glassnode said that “unlike the ATH rallies in Q2 and Q4 2024, the recent push to $111K was not accompanied by a surge in spot volume,” adding that it “reflects reduced investor engagement.” An increase in spot volume reflecting heightened trading activity on exchanges would indicate stronger investor demand and market conviction, as seen in past rallies where spot volume surges preceded price breakouts. “A real breakout for BTC needs more than just hype,” said crypto market insights provider Alva, adding, Glassnode concluded that while Bitcoin's general “bull trend remains intact, a revival in demand, activity metrics and conviction” would increase the odds of a breakout to new highs in the near term. Bitcoin's bullish case hinges on its BTC price flipping the resistance between $108,000 and $110,00 into support. It is “going to take a big effort to push through the 108K-110K level,” said popular Bitcoin analyst AlphaBTC in a June 26 post on X. Fellow analyst Rekt Capital opined that Bitcoin bulls needed to take out the “final major weekly resistance” above $108,000 to reach new all-time highs. MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said that $109,000 was the “area that we need to break in order to have upward momentum,” adding: This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home > Briefs > Technology > Crypto Exchange Kraken Unveils ‘Krak,' Its New All-in-One Global Money App Cryptocurrency exchange giant Kraken introduced a blockchain-powered global money app called Krak that allows users to instantly transact across borders for almost no cost, while also earning competitive rewards on their account balances. Krak is designed to fix the outdated norms of legacy finance, Kraken said, blending crypto technology with the exchange's trusted network of banking relationships and payment partnerships. The app will allow users to send funds peer-to-peer across 110 countries and using 300-plus assets, spanning cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies without inserting bank details or crypto wallet addresses, according to a press release. As the U.S. opens up more to crypto, big exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken are busy closing gaps in their customer offerings, whether that's taking advantage of crypto rails for payments, earning yield or trading stocks. The Krak app will also offer dedicated spend and earn accounts, where eligible users can earn up to 4.1% rewards on USDG stablecoin balances as well as additional opportunities across 20+ digital assets yielding up to 10%. USDG is the dollar-pegged token of the Global Dollar Network, of which Kraken is a key member.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The token's sharp decline marks a continuation of its recent downtrend, which has been marked by intense volatility and heavy intraday selling. Once a retail darling with viral momentum and even what appeared like a nod from Elon Musk back on April 9, PEPE has since slipped in market influence as attention shifts back to Bitcoin. This downturn is part of a broader shift across crypto markets, where Bitcoin's dominance has now climbed above 65%, a level not seen in over two years. The trend suggests growing investor preference for BTC over smaller altcoins, especially during periods of uncertainty and declining risk appetite. That shift is being felt acutely by high-beta assets like PEPE. Despite brief price rebounds, PEPE remains under pressure, facing resistance near $0.00001013. Its failure to sustain rallies reflects broader rotation away from meme coins, and its future performance may hinge on whether market sentiment returns to riskier assets or stays anchored in large-cap names.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK's independent data protection and freedom of information regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), has welcomed a guilty verdict in a trial related to the unlawful accessing and obtaining of people's personal information from vehicle repair garages to generate potential leads for personal injury claims. A jury at Bolton Crown Court this week found Craig Cornick, 40, of Prestbury, guilty of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain personal data contrary to the Data Protection Act. Earlier in the month, the jury returned a not guilty verdict for Cornick and Thomas Daly, 35, of Macclesfield, for a charge of conspiracy to access computer systems without authority contrary to the Computer Misuse Act. Cornick and Daly join six other men who had all previously pleaded guilty to the offences listed here: All the defendants are due to return to court on July 11, where it is proposed Proceeds of Crime Act and cost issues will be discussed, with sentencing following at a later date. ICO head of investigations, Andy Curry, said: “Most of us have had nuisance calls asking if we've been in a crash. At best they're annoying but at worst they cause real upset and fear, especially to vulnerable people, and have a real impact on the businesses affected. “This case uncovered a vast, murky criminal network where crash details were stolen from garages across England, Scotland and Wales and traded to fuel distressing predatory calls. “This has been an enormous and complex case which has seen ICO staff use both technical expertise and investigative skills to work tirelessly to track down those responsible and hold them accountable on behalf of the public.” The defendants were found to have conspired together between 2014 and 2017, where they accessed and obtained personal data of approximately one million people from vehicle repair garages without their consent. The ICO is in the process of relocating its headquarters from Wilmslow to Manchester city centre, having agreed a lease for 20,000 sq ft of high-quality workspace at Bruntwood SciTech's No.3 Circle Square.</p>

Can't find what you're looking for? n the busy shopping district of the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, ATMs let shoppers swap coins for cryptocurrency, beauty salons offer cut-price deals if you pay in Bitcoin, and people use Binance accounts to buy fried chicken. Bolivians are facing a rising economic crisis, with reserves of dollars near zero, inflation at 40-year highs and fuel shortages causing long lines at the pump. The country's currency has lost half its value on the black market this year, even as the official exchange rate has been held artificially steady by government intervention. Official data is patchy, and cryptocurrency was outlawed in Bolivia until last year, but the most recent central bank figures showed transactions of digital assets at US$24 million in October. In the speed of uptake, "Bolivia is now comparable to countries like Argentina and Venezuela," said Mauricio Torrelio from the Bolivian Blockchain Chamber. The overall size of the market, though, remains well behind those South American neighbors and other transactions domestically. With exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, "Prospects" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape. By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Jose Gabriel Espinoza, former head of Bolivia's central bank, estimated that daily USDT volumes hover around $600,000, a fraction of the $18-$22 million in the formal financial sector and $12-$14 million in the cash-based black market. "While crypto is growing, it's still a nascent market," he said. Torrelio said Binance was the most popular platform locally, for its relatively low transfer fees and peer-to-peer trading. The world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance has come under scrutiny globally. It agreed to pay a fine of over $4.3 billion in 2023 after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering. In Cochabamba, Pablo Unzueta's steakhouse Bros allows customers to pay via Binance accounts or buy Bitcoin using an ATM linked to Blink, a crypto wallet developed in Central American country El Salvador - which made waves in 2021 when it made Bitcoin legal tender. "If you go to the banks today, they don't have dollars," Unzueta told Reuters. "Paying for a chicken with Bitcoin or saving in Bitcoin is the most innovative and promising thing a city like Cochabamba can do." Carla Jones, a local spa and salon owner, offers incentives to customers who pay with crypto assets, which she said both attracted younger customers and acted as a savings safeguard. Bolivia is facing its most acute economic crisis in a generation. The lack of dollars has spawned a black currency market, with a wide gap between the formal and parallel FX rates. On the street, you need over 16 bolivianos to buy a dollar versus the largely symbolic official rate of around 6.9 per dollar. Crypto proponents have pushed blockchain-based tokens as an answer. On June 7, Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino posted photos from a duty-free shop in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, showing items like sunglasses and Oreo cookies priced in USDT, the firm's dollar-pegged stablecoin. "A silent revolutionary shift: digital dollars powering daily life, commerce and economic stability," he said on X. Economists, however, warned it was not so rosy. "This isn't a sign of stability," said former central bank head Espinoza. Crypto companies try to convince the rural poor to invest what little real money they have in a cryptocurrency," he told Reuters. "More and more people have understood that if they save bolivianos and keep them in their tills for too long, they're going to lose purchasing power," Canelas said. Cryptocurrencies did come with risk, he said, but added: "They may see some volatility in the short or medium term, but long term it's a good store of capital."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Arweave based app ensures all NFT.NYC creations are securely and immutably stored on permanent cloud AR.IO. Alongside OneHub, which helps creators connect with their fans to monetize their NFTs, the leading annual non-fungible token event - live in New York City 25-26 June 2025 - has given all artists submitting work to this year's show access to ArDrive. The decentralized storage app safely stores data on-chain in a way that proves the origin and ownership of a creators' work regardless of how it may be copied or misused, resisting current AI trends and placing power back in the hands of artists. Thanks to Arweave's 'pay-once-store forever' model, nothing stored through ArDrive and on AR.IO can ever be lost. Commenting on ArDrive's partnership with NFT.NYC, the app's founder Phil Mataras, says: "Preserving NFT.NYC artwork permanently aligns with our mission to get forever data storage in the hands of everyone, and ensures creators own their work and legacies without compromise. We're proud to help protect artistic expression from the fleeting nature of Web2." Notably, most digital art is not stored on-chain, making it susceptible to censorship, deletion, and loss. With over 18 million files permanently stored in the last five years, ArDrive has permanently preserved almost 2,000 pieces of art, which are now censorship-resistant, tamper-proof and verifiable, helping digital art to endure. Around 12 million users are projected to own NFTs by the end of 2025, and as the digital art ecosystem matures, permanence has become a critical missing layer. ArDrive is raising awareness of this issue through sponsorship of NFT.NYC where it is giving creators the ability to permanently store and preserve their art for generations to come. Whether you're preserving NFTs, AI datasets, or critical documents, ArDrive ensures your data is immutable, censorship-resistant, and accessible for generations to come. To learn more about ArDrive, users can visit https://ardrive.io and follow @ardriveapp on X Supported by the Arweave permaweb, AR.IO is the first permanent cloud network, enabling decentralized and censorship-resistant access to data, storage and domains that never disappear. By decentralizing access, AR.IO ensures that information remains permanently available, tamper-proof, and free from centralized control. Its incentivized gateway network enhances reliability, while the Arweave Name System (ArNS) introduces self-sovereign, permanent domains that never expire and never need renewing. AR.IO empowers developers, creators, and businesses to build on a truly resilient, open internet. To learn more about AR.IO, users can visit https://ar.io/ and follow @ar_io_network on X</p>

Real world asset (RWA) tokenization, which is a fancy way of describing the process of putting the legal rights to bonds, commodities, stocks, or even real estate directly on a blockchain, is turning into crypto's newest gold rush. The entrant with the biggest shovels and most capital right now is Ethereum (ETH 0.01%), and that's putting serious pressure on XRP (XRP -3.24%), whose investment thesis depends far more heavily on winning this very niche. Let's dig in and explore why one coin's good fortune doubles as the other's headache, at least for now. First, let's consider the scoreboard in this matchup. Ethereum hosts about $7.5 billion in tokenized RWAs, which accounts for almost 60% of everything in the sector that's emplaced on public chains. That alone signals significant network effects at work, but the bigger news is who's arriving next. BlackRock's money‑market fund called BUIDL, launched in March 2024 and now worth $2.9 billion, just became acceptable collateral at two major crypto exchanges, cementing Ethereum's role as the primary on-ramp for the fund. Institutional money only moves once it is confident that its intended destination is a place that will be compliant with the necessary financial regulations against money laundering. That's where Ethereum's ERC‑3643 identity‑aware token standard adds fresh credibility by baking important compliance features directly into the asset, albeit in a somewhat technologically clunky way. The standard, while optional to implement, does provide at least a measure of reassurance for conservative institutions that some of their bases will be covered. Instead, tokenization layers another fee‑generating stream on top of an already diversified ecosystem. Assuming even the low end of Boston Consulting Group's (BCG) $16 trillion RWA market forecast for 2030 is hit, a 10% slice of the market flowing through Ethereum would multiply today's on‑chain RWA base more than 20-fold. And that makes competition for a share of the pie very bullish, as victory is not needed for the chain to flourish. It's a chain that's designed specifically to meet the needs of institutional investors, giving them access to faster and cheaper money transfers as well as on-demand liquidity for their convenience in borrowing or trading. Its ledger carries only about $157 million in tokenized RWAs as of June 18, which is barely 1.3% of the market right now. Yet Ripple, the company behind XRP, markets the chain primarily as an institutional payments and tokenization hub, suggesting that it's a big problem that it isn't even in the running for winning one of its major pillar markets. To Ripple's credit, it is creating compliance features the big end of town is demanding, like built‑in tools for account freezing, blacklist controls, and an upgraded central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform that's now being demoed to more than 20 central banks. Those capabilities will likely lead the chain to capture a larger portion of the market for RWA tokenization over time. Furthermore, Ripple announced in May some new bank‑issued stablecoins and payment corridors on the XRP ledger (XRPL). Those moves should help, but they may only staunch the bleed rather than reverse it if Ethereum's compliance stack becomes "good enough" for traditional finance (TradFi) giants despite its fairly disorganized and piecemeal nature at the moment. But the threat posed by Ethereum is quite large today. XRP's market cap sits near $120 billion today, so its current on‑chain RWA value equals roughly 0.1% of the network's valuation. If XRP were to triple its RWA inflows tomorrow, it would still trail Ethereum's share by a wide margin, and Ethereum holders would barely notice the lost market share. But investors should watch where the next billion dollars' worth of key tokenized assets like U.S. Treasuries lands. If it settles on Ethereum, as Abu Dhabi's RBILL fund did last October, the momentum will speak volumes, and it'll be bearish for XRP. Long‑term investors who want exposure to tokenization's upside without outsize single‑segment risk may find Ethereum the safer bet despite XRP's technological superiority. In contrast, XRP bulls must demand and verify that continued institutional wins are on the way to keep their thesis alive, as otherwise the coin's upside will be significantly diminished.
