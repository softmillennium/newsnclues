Cities Confront Cars:

Philadelphia's largest transit system approved sweeping service cuts and fare hikes as it struggles to deal with a gaping budget deficit. 

Officials at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority voted Thursday to approve a fiscal 2026 budget that slashes service by 45% and raises fares by 21.5%. The system has been warning about a $213 million operating deficit for months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is set Thursday afternoon to host a group of working-class Americans at the White House, as he cranks up pressure on Senate Republicans to quickly pass his massive tax-and-spending agenda. The event in support of Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" will feature a collection of what his administration describes as "everyday Americans" poised to benefit from the legislation's tax cuts and other provisions. They include truck drivers, firefighters, law enforcement, healthcare workers, ranchers, and workers who rely on tips, a White House official told CNBC. "As a mom and a small business owner, every dollar counts," said Maliki Krieski, a DoorDash Driver set to attend the event, in a statement provided by the White House. "Thanks to No Tax on Tips, I'll be able to keep more of what I earn. This is the kind of policy that makes an impact for people like me across the country," Krieski said. Trump in a social media post Tuesday demanded that the Senate "GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK." But the bill —  a version of which passed in the House in May — faces significant headwinds in the Senate. Conservative holdouts there are wary that the bill could blow out federal deficits. The Senate parliamentarian earlier Thursday dealt another blow to the bill's prospects by rejecting some provisions intended to offset the cost of its hefty tax cuts and spending components.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many CEOs know what kinds of employees they want at their company, and can point out the top character trait they seek in job candidates. For Wisp CEO Monica Cepak, that trait is the ability to collaborate with your colleagues, especially when there's a problem to be solved. To find out if a job candidate has the soft skill, she asks a particular interview question: What's the hardest problem you've ever solved at work, and how did you reach a solution? If an interviewee's answer is "cross-functional in nature" — showing how they worked with other team members to solve an issue — they're probably a team player who regularly seeks insights from their coworkers, Cepak told CNBC Make It on April 24. We're a team at the end of the day, and your ability to problem solve by working with others is key," said Cepak, who has nearly 10 years of experience in executive-level roles. Cepak isn't the only company leader who seeks out specific traits in employees. Here are two more examples of CEOs' biggest employee green flags: Zig Serafin, the CEO of experience management company Qualtrics, appreciates an employee who can contribute big ideas without losing sight of their day-to-day job duties. Highly successful people know how to balance "having your head in the clouds and your feet on the ground," Serafin told CNBC Make It on April 14. DON'T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakes During interviews, hiring managers can gauge this trait by asking behavioral questions like "Tell me about a time when you had to juggle a long-term goal with an immediate task. Michael Ramlet, CEO of global data intelligence firm Morning Consult, looks for intellectual curiosity in his employees and job candidates, particularly against the backdrop of the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industry. As people and businesses increasingly rely on AI, employees who voraciously search for answers to questions and actively find solutions to problems will become more essential than they already are, Ramlet told CNBC Make It on April 1. "You think about [generative AI] chat prompts and ... [humans] still have to ask the question," Ramlet said. "So that intellectual curiosity is, I think, going to be a distinguishing trait, not just for those of us at Morning Consult, but across the board."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hello, this is Ganesh Rao, writing from London. This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Each weekday, CNBC's "Inside India" news show gives you news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse businesses, and the people behind its rise. Livestream the show on YouTube and catch highlights here. India's economy was staring down a ravine over the past week. Instead, India found in the Israel-Iran war a catalyst to beef up its defense sector. The two Middle East countries agreed to a ceasefire on Wednesday, following a U.S. bombing campaign that U.S. President Donald Trump said obliterated Iranian nuclear ambitions. Oil prices gave up their short-lived gains, removing India from the precipice. But the episode highlighted many of India's vulnerabilities. Any disruption would have meant a severe economic fallout for the country. For every $10 per-barrel increase in crude prices, India's consumer price inflation could rise by up to 35 basis points while economic growth could decline by 30 basis points, according to an analysis by SBI Research. The conflict also puts New Delhi in a tight spot between its investments in Iran — notably the Chabahar port, which is operated by Indian companies — and its deep and growing defense relationship with Israel. India is the single largest buyer of Israeli arms, accounting for 34% of its defense exports, according to a March 2024 report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. India's recent "Operation Sindoor" against Pakistan, launched after an April militant attack in Jammu and Kashmir, reveals the depth of this dependency on arms imports, according to analysts at investment bank Jefferies. The operation utilized a mix of old Russian gear and new Israeli-made equipment, including Heron surveillance drones, Spyder and Barak-8 surface-to-air missile systems. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, India found that Moscow, historically a top arms supplier, had become unreliable. Russian defense manufacturing capacity was directed toward Moscow's own needs for the war in Ukraine, causing significant delays for India's military modernization program. Worse still, analysts point out that Russian equipment, such as the T-90S tanks that are a staple of the Indian Army, appeared to have "underperformed" in Ukraine. India would certainly not have wanted to suffer yet another delay in weapons procurement, were the Iran-Israel conflict to drag on. This has created an urgent need for India to pivot. "I think undoubtedly the situation will have increased the desire and conviction that all the countries have to increase their defence spending, which was initiated because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine," said Anna Mulholland, head of emerging market equities research at Pictet Asset Management. "The Middle East turmoil, while not new, will surely have increased people's resolve and commitment to those increased defence budgets that have been spoken about," she added. Out of this crisis, India has made an opportunity to grow its domestic defense industry. Analysts at JPMorgan identified the recent geopolitical conflicts as a "pivotal moment for widespread recognition of BEL's capabilities," referring to the state-owned Bharat Electronics. The stock is up around 38% so far this year. "A steady stream of orders, elevated geopolitical risks both in India and globally, and strong medium-term growth prospects … with healthy [return on equity] should continue to lead to outperformance, in our view," said JPMorgan's Atul Tiwari, an executive director at the bank, in a note to clients on June 23. The most tangible sign of this pivot is "Project Kusha" — India's homegrown alternative to the Russian S-400 air defense system, in which BEL is a key development partner. "This program is expected to contribute significantly to the company's long-term order book once contracts are finalized," JPMorgan's Tiwari added. India is unlikely to be the lone customer for those companies. New Delhi is also targeting defense manufacturing as an export industry. Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC and Tim Seymour, CIO at Seymour Asset Management, see EM as undervalued, with Korea, India, Vietnam standing out. Proseus has invested in the buzziest tech firms in India, such as payments service PayU and e-commerce company Meesho. The Reserve Bank of India noted that factory and services activity in May remained healthy, but urban demand slowed sharply. During India's financial year 24-25, Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines pumped in 9,588 crore Indian rupees ($1.1 million) in the airline. Investors rushed into equities after easing tensions in the Middle East. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield moved lower by 3 basis points compared to last week and now trades at 6.27%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to pasta, the dish that I always look forward to most when I visit home is a Greek classic called pastitsio. There were many cold New York nights when I dreamed of a steaming bowl of avgolemono soup or a heaping plate of pastitsio as my radiator banged on and on in my tiny East Village apartment. After many years of lusting after my favorite homemade pasta dish, I finally asked my dad to teach me how to make his famous pastitsio. Lucky for you, I persuaded him to share the recipe, too. To make a pan of pastitsio for the family, you'll need: Before I got cooking, all I needed to do was roughly chop the onion and parsley. After bringing a big pot of salted water to a boil, I threw in the box of penne pasta. Then, I added my chopped onions to a pan with some olive oil over medium heat. Per my dad's instructions, I salted the beef and used a rubber spatula to break up the meat. "Let it brown and mix everything together," he told me. "Keep stirring until it's fully cooked, which takes around five minutes." I stirred everything together until the egg was fully cooked and had mixed with the ground beef. My dad says this step is optional, but he swears it makes the pastitsio even fluffier and tastier. My dad said you could also use tomato sauce for this recipe, but he believes marinara sauce is easier and "just tastes better." "This allows for better absorption of the flavors," my dad told me. After a few minutes, the sauce looked nice and thick. "Butter is always good," my dad told me mischievously as he mixed the penne. My dad told me that pastitsio is traditionally made with bucatini in Greece. "Penne just fits so easily into the pan," he said. My dad wasn't lying when he said this recipe has plenty of butter. My dad said it's important to slowly add the two cups of milk while simultaneously mixing the sauce over medium-high heat. "You just have to feel it," he told me sagely. The second you see those first few bubbles, take it off the stove, he told me. It should take, at most, about five minutes total. Overall, the pastitsio takes an hour to make. And one pan can easily serve up to eight. I've had more plates of pastitsio than I can count, and it has never, ever let me down. Plus, it's a nice contrast to the texture of the pasta on top — which has a great crunch. And, as with all Greek dishes, the pastitsio tastes even better if you add some feta cheese. Pastitsio is super easy to make, takes only an hour total in the kitchen, and is perfect for a dinner party or as a dish that'll give you plenty of leftovers. No matter the weather, day, or occasion, pastitsio has long been a family favorite. My grandma — who, like me, wasn't the most naturally talented in the kitchen — used to make it often for my dad when he was a kid. We'll probably never really know whether cooking skills (or lack thereof) are passed down from generation to generation. But, thankfully, great recipes can be inherited, too. Now I'm passing this one down to you.</p>

A London judge sided with the Financial Conduct Authority, ruling that the executive misled officials about the nature of the banker's relationship with the late pedophile financier. </p>
