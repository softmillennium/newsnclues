                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Biological drugs have improved the lives of many people with severe asthma. However, a new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that some immune cells with high inflammatory potential are not completely eradicated after treatment. Biological drugs (biologics) have become an important tool in the treatment of severe asthma. They help most patients to keep their symptoms under control, but exactly how these drugs affect the immune system has so far remained unknown." Valentyna Yasinska, consultant in pulmonary medicine at Karolinska University Hospital and doctoral student at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medicine in Huddinge In a new study published in the scientific journal Allergy, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have explored what happens to the immune cells of patients being treated with biologics. By analysing blood samples from 40 patients before and during treatment, they found that instead of disappearing during treatment, certain types of immune cell – which play a key part in asthma inflammation – actually increased. "This suggests that biologics might not attack the root of the problem, no matter how much they help asthma patients during treatment," says Jenny Mjösberg, professor of tissue immunology at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medicine in Huddinge. "Continued treatment might be necessary to keep the disease under control." The study is based on data from patients with severe asthma sourced from the BIOCROSS study. "We were surprised to find that blood levels of inflammatory cells increased rather than decreased," says Lorenz Wirth, doctoral student at the same department at Karolinska Institutet. It is important that we understand the long-term immunological effects of these drugs." Little is still known about the long-term effects of biologics like mepolizumab and dupilumab since they are relatively new, having been prescribed to asthmatics for less than ten years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Goodness is cared for by nurses and aides from various parts of Africa. One of them, Jackline Conteh, a naturalized citizen and nurse assistant from Sierra Leone, bathes and helps dress him most days and vigilantly intercepts any meal headed his way that contains gluten, as Goodness has celiac disease. "We are full of people who come from other countries," Goodness, 92, said about Goodwin House Alexandria's staff. The long-term health care industry is facing a double whammy from President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigrants and the GOP's proposals to reduce Medicaid spending. The industry is highly dependent on foreign workers: More than 800,000 immigrants and naturalized citizens comprise 28% of direct care employees at home care agencies, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care companies. But in January, the Trump administration rescinded former President Joe Biden's 2021 policy that protected health care facilities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. "People may be here on a green card, and they are afraid ICE is going to show up," said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofits that care for older adults. Federal spending cuts under negotiation may strip nursing homes of some of their largest revenue sources by limiting ways states leverage Medicaid money and making it harder for new nursing home residents to retroactively qualify for Medicaid. "We are facing the collision of two policies here that could further erode staffing in nursing homes and present health outcome challenges," said Eric Roberts, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Nursing homes have struggled to replace licensed nurses, who can find better-paying jobs at hospitals and doctors' offices, as well as nursing assistants, who can earn more working at big-box stores or fast-food joints. Quality issues that preceded the pandemic have expanded: The percentage of nursing homes that federal health inspectors cited for putting residents in jeopardy of immediate harm or death has risen alarmingly from 17% in 2015 to 28% in 2024. In addition to seeking to reduce Medicaid spending, congressional Republicans have proposed shelving the biggest nursing home reform in decades: a Biden-era rule mandating minimum staffing levels that would require most of the nation's nearly 15,000 nursing homes to hire more workers. The Census Bureau has projected the number of people 65 and older would grow from 63 million this year to 82 million in 2050. In an email, Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency "is committed to supporting a strong, stable long-term care workforce" and "continues to work with states and providers to ensure quality care for older adults and individuals with disabilities." In a separate email, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said foreigners wanting to work as caregivers "need to do that by coming here the legal way" but did not address the effect on the long-term care workforce of deportations of classes of authorized immigrants. Goodwin Living, a faith-based nonprofit, runs three retirement communities in northern Virginia for people who live independently, need a little assistance each day, have memory issues, or require the availability of around-the-clock nurses. It also operates a retirement community in Washington, D.C. Medicare rates Goodwin House Alexandria as one of the best-staffed nursing homes in the country. Jackline Conteh spent much of her youth shuttling between Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana to avoid wars and tribal conflicts. "She was sitting outside," Conteh, 56, recalled in an interview. She won, though she couldn't afford to bring her husband and two children along at the time. After she got a nursing assistant certification, Goodwin hired her in 2012. She washed her father when he was dying of prostate cancer. Her husband joined her in the United States in 2017; she cares for him because he has heart failure. "Nearly every one of us from Africa, we know how to care for older adults," she said. In the nursing home where Goodness and 89 other residents live, Conteh helps with daily tasks like dressing and eating, checks residents' skin for signs of swelling or sores, and tries to help them avoid falling or getting disoriented. Of 102 employees in the building, broken up into eight residential wings called "small houses" and a wing for memory care, at least 72 were born abroad, Hutter said. In 2023 he moved into one of the skilled nursing small houses, where Conteh started caring for him. Goodness said Conteh is exacting about cleanliness and will tell the housekeepers if his room is not kept properly. Conteh said Goodness was withdrawn when he first arrived. "He don't want to be with the other people in the dining room, so I start making friends with him." She showed him a photo of Sierra Leone on her phone and told him of the weather there. He told her about his work at the church and how his wife did laundry for the choir. The breakthrough, she said, came one day when he agreed to lunch with her in the dining room. Long out of his shell, Goodness now sits on the community's resident council and enjoys distributing the mail to other residents on his floor. "The people that work in my building become so important to us," Goodness said. While Trump's 2024 election campaign focused on foreigners here without authorization, his administration has broadened to target those legally here, including refugees who fled countries beset by wars or natural disasters. This month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the work permits for migrants and refugees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who arrived under a Biden-era program. "I've just spent my morning firing good, honest people because the federal government told us that we had to," Rachel Blumberg, president of the Toby & Leon Cooperman Sinai Residences of Boca Raton, a Florida retirement community, said in a video posted on LinkedIn. Let me tell you, they are not all criminals." At Goodwin House, Conteh is fearful for her fellow immigrants. Foreign workers at Goodwin rarely talk about their backgrounds. Her neighbors in her apartment complex fled the U.S. in December and returned to Sierra Leone after Trump won the election, leaving their children with relatives. "If all these people leave the United States, they go back to Africa or to their various countries, what will become of our residents?"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parse Biosciences today announced their commitment to support researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in generating one of the largest single cell datasets focused on understanding alternative splicing events in the cells of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients. The study's initial phase will analyze transcriptomic profiles from more than 10 million cells derived from more than 1,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples of patients with neurodegenerative conditions. The data amassed from these analyses will lay the foundation for discoveries that could transform how these diseases are understood, detected, and treated. "Historical research in neurodegenerative disease has focused on the genomic underpinnings for disease diagnoses, but few have looked at the post transcriptional events that may be further driving pathology and progression of disease," said Towfique Raj, PhD, principal investigator in the laboratory for functional genomics and core faculty member of the Ronald M. Loeb Center for Alzheimer's Disease at Mount Sinai, who will lead this study. Studies of this scale are critical to the development of foundational models to help us better understand neurodegenerative disease." Dr. Raj's research team at Mount Sinai is dedicated to understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). For this study, the Mount Sinai team is working to conduct high-throughput profiling on banked PBMCs donated by patients with confirmed Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease diagnoses. The researchers expect to profile more than 1,000 samples in order to capture single cell whole transcriptome repertoire data on them. The samples that have been prepared at Mount Sinai will then be sent to Parse GigaLab, a state-of-the-art facility purpose-built for the generation of massive-scale single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Leveraging Parse's Evercode chemistry, the GigaLab can rapidly produce large single cell datasets with exceptional quality. The speed and scale achieved with the GigaLab truly helps to accelerate research and get us to insights faster than we ever have before."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can a gut microbe protect your lungs from COVID-19? New research uncovers how Akkermansia muciniphila primes powerful immune responses against the virus. Study: Akkermansia Muciniphila Primes Lung-Resident Antiviral Immunity via the Gut–Lung Axis During SARS-CoV-2 Infection. *Important notice:  Preprints with The Lancet / SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. Akkermansia muciniphila is a commensal bacterium found in the human gastrointestinal tract. It has demonstrated preclinical efficacy to improve several human diseases, including diabetes and obesity. A recent study, led by researchers at Yonsei University, Korea, revealed a novel role of this bacterium in shaping lung-specific antiviral immunity in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The human gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and regulating immune, neurological, and metabolic functions. This network has gained significant attention during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a major determinant of disease severity and outcomes. Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota, such as short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) supplementation, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have shown promising outcomes in restoring microbial homeostasis and modulating immune responses in various infectious diseases. Considering potential therapeutic implications of gut microbiota, the current study was designed to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants on gut microbiota composition and host immune responses. This bacterium degrades mucin and is often enriched in patients with COVID-19. The study was conducted on K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (overexpressing human ACE2 under a cytokeratin promoter), which develop neuroinvasion and lethal pathology not fully representative of human COVID-19. The immunomodulatory role of Akkermansia muciniphila in SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed in antibiotic-pretreated mice (creating a pseudo-germ-free model), which was generated by pretreating the mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics before administering the bacterium. Importantly, Akkermansia muciniphila was administered prophylactically (before infection). The prophylactic efficacy of Akkermansia muciniphila was determined by monitoring weight loss, lung pathology, immune cell phenotypes, and cytokine profiles. The Wuhan infection was also associated with specific upregulation of lipid metabolism-related pathways (carotenoid/steroid biosynthesis). A strong positive association was observed between Akkermansia muciniphila abundance and SARS-CoV-2 infection-related consequences, including weight loss and reduced body temperature, in the study. Given these findings, gut microbiota profiling of five independent COVID-19 patient cohorts was carried out in the study. This suggests that the expansion of Akkermansia muciniphila in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a host-compensatory response, highlighting a novel role of this bacterium as a promising prophylactic candidate. The analysis of immune response in antibiotic-pretreated mice treated with Akkermansia muciniphila revealed significantly enhanced lung-specific antiviral immune responses, characterized by expansion and activation of tissue-resident memory T cells, increased cytokine production, enhanced polyfunctional T cell responses (IFN-γ/TNF-α), and formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, which is a type of organized lymphoid tissue that triggers immune responses in the lungs and helps clear infection. Mechanistically, this involved A. muciniphila's microbial antigens (Amuc_1434/1100) suppressing PD-L1, phospholipids activating the TLR2-TLR1 signaling pathway, and metabolites modulating the AhR pathways. The Akkermansia muciniphila treatment also conferred significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, mitigating weight loss and improving lung histopathology. According to the study findings, Akkermansia muciniphila can substantially increase lung-specific antiviral immunity by modulating the gut-lung axis. Specifically, the findings suggest that Akkermansia muciniphila primes distal mucosal immunity via a coordinated network of microbial antigens, lipids, enzymes, and metabolites, in addition to colonize in the gut. Akkermansia muciniphila, as a bacterium that degrades mucin, is known to exacerbate intestinal inflammation by disrupting the mucus barrier. However, it has also been documented that the bacterium plays a crucial role in promoting the production of certain cytokines that are essential for mucosal tissue repair and immune regulation. The current study findings support these beneficial impacts of Akkermansia muciniphila and endorse its utility as a novel microbiota-targeted prophylactic intervention against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. The study used K18-hACE2 transgenic mice for experimental purposes. These mice exhibit neurotropism and lethality patterns differing from human cases, limiting clinical extrapolation. Furthermore, the study used antibiotic-treated mice as a pseudo-germ-free model (lacking true germ-free immunological naivety), which can potentially affect the colonization efficiency and immunomodulatory functions of Akkermansia muciniphila. Future studies should consider these factors while investigating the immunomodulatory mechanisms of this bacterium and should evaluate therapeutic (post-infection) administration. *Important notice:  Preprints with The Lancet / SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.
