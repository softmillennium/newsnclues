                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, Russia, on June 4, 2025. Despite suffering over 1 million casualties, pounding Ukrainian cities nightly with missiles and drones, and committing countless war crimes, one startling fact about Russia's full-scale invasion remains — Moscow has yet to officially declare war on Ukraine. In February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin described what he believed was going to be a swift victory and the capture of Kyiv within days as a "special military operation." Nearly three-and-a-half years later, the Kremlin is stuck with the term, caught in a quandary of its own making — waging by what any measure is a war, while being unable to call it one for fear of a domestic backlash. A formal declaration of war would have far-reaching implications for the country's industry and economy, as well as allowing the Kremlin to launch a full mobilization. But partial mobilization announced in September 2022 led to the only widespread protests against the war inside Russia, making clear to Putin that announcing anything more would cause him serious political problems. "But as soon as that starts to spill over and actually be felt by more of the Russian domestic population, that's when he gets into more trouble." According to reports, there has recently been unrest within the Kremlin after Ukraine's audacious Operation Spiderweb, with hardliners reportedly pressuring Putin to make a formal war declaration that would permit true retaliation and escalation, and give the Russian government sweeping authority to shift the country fully onto a wartime footing. But experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent say this is unlikely, arguing that for all intents and purposes, Russia's industry and economy are already on a wartime footing even if Kremlin officials deny this, and that Putin simply can't risk his hold on power by launching what would be a deeply unpopular mobilization. A full war footing would be a complete pivot of the economy and its workers towards defense and the production of weapons, and allow for a full mobilization to conscript the necessary manpower to use them. By contrast, Ukraine spent 34% of its GDP on defense last year, while British military spending surpassed 50% of GDP during the Second World War. These same figures were cited by Russian Ambassador to the U.K. Andrey Kelin in an interview with CNN last week as evidence that Russia was in fact still fighting a "special military operation," and not a war. "Defense production in key capability segments such as drones, missiles, and armored vehicles is at full steam, with up to three worker shifts per day." Russia has drastically upped weapons production in recent months as it drains its stockpiles. According to data from Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) shared with the Kyiv Independent earlier this month, production of ballistic missiles, for example, has increased by at least 66% over the past year. Hird agrees with Borsari's analysis, saying the massive boost in defense manufacturing is a sign that, despite Russia's claims that it isn't at war, its depleted stockpiles are a pretty clear sign they are. "It's not like Russia has a secret reserve of weapons in the background that it can somehow kind of unlock and unleash on Ukraine," she said. "Russia is already fighting an all-out war in Ukraine, so there's actually not much more that can be done on their side." The one crucial area in which a declaration of all-out war against Ukraine could significantly boost Russia's ability to wage war is manpower. Declaring war on Ukraine would also have international ramifications for Putin, Shea said. But a formal Russian declaration of war will convey the entirely opposite message."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic socialist tells MSNBC his campaign against Cuomo shows leftist politics can thrive beyond New York Mamdani told MSNBC's Jen Psaki that his populist campaign – which focused on inequality and promised radical moves on rent, the price of food and free public transport – could be deployed anywhere in the US as Democrats seek to combat Donald Trump and his Maga movement. “I think ultimately this is a campaign about inequality, and you don't have to live in the most expensive city in the country to have experienced that inequality, because it's a national issue. And what Americans coast to coast are looking for are people who will fight for them, not just believe in the things that resonate with their lives, but actually fight and deliver on those very things,” he said. Mamdani added: “I think that in focusing on working people and their struggles, we also return back to what makes so many of us proud to be Democrats in the first place.” Mamdani – who was backed by fellow socialists Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – campaigned by combining an intense effort to knock on doors and meet voters with a highly effective social media strategy. That style contrasted sharply with Cuomo, who was backed by millions of dollars of money from rich donors and endorsements from party bigwigs including Bill Clinton and the South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, and who ran a campaign focused on more stage-managed events. But Cuomo has signalled he may run as an independent, despite his loss this week. And the current mayor, Eric Adams, who won as a Democrat, will also run as an independent, after his popularity within the party plummeted due in part to allegations of corruption and his newfound closeness with Trump. Mamdani nevertheless remains the favorite to win, which would make him New York's first Muslim mayor and solidify his place at 33 years old as a bright new star of the Democratic party.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Real Madrid star is at odds with his former club, arguing PSG owes him 55 million euros ($61 million) in unpaid wages. The prosecutor's office said Mbappé is “denouncing the ‘lofting' he claimed to have been subjected to at Paris Saint-Germain.” The word lofting is used in France to describe a practice that involves isolating a player from the main squad for sporting, administrative, or disciplinary reasons. Mbappé joined Real Madrid last summer on a free transfer after scoring a club-record 256 goals in seven years at PSG, which won the Champions League without him this year. Mbappé's relationship with PSG ended amid deep tensions, and some fans booed him in his last home game at Parc des Princes. PSG felt let down by Mbappé after offering him the most lucrative contract in club history when he signed a new contract in 2022. But Mbappé was frustrated because he felt promises to sign key players were not kept. When he signed that deal, he was paraded in front of fans holding up a jersey with 2025 on it. With his contract effectively into its final year, it put PSG in the position of needing to sell Mbappé to avoid losing him for nothing when the contract expired. His PSG career could have ended that summer amid a tense transfer standoff. After telling the club he would not extend, Mbappé was left off a preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and forced to train with fringe players. PSG said it would rather sell him than let the player leave for free in 2024, but he rejected a 300 million euros move to Saudi Arabia team Al-Hilal. PSG left Mbappé out of the opening league game of that season but he soon returned to the lineup following talks. Mbappé's legal team said in April it would start an action against PSG for harassment because of the way he was treated at the time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kyiv Independent has officially reached 20,000 paying members, becoming the first Ukrainian media outlet in history to cross this milestone. This is  not just a number — it's a reminder that people around the world believe in the importance of independent journalism from Ukraine, and are willing to stand behind it. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Kyiv Independent knew how important it would be to keep its reporting free and accessible — to show the world what was really happening on the ground. More than three years later, that mission hasn't changed. That´s why, in May, the Kyiv Independent launched a campaign to ensure that no matter what happens, it would be able to continue showing the threat Russia poses to the world, and the consequences of when it is allowed to do so unchecked. In less than one month, 2,400 people became new members of the Kyiv Independent community. Since its founding in late 2021, more than 50,000 people from over 130 countries have contributed financially to support the Kyiv Independent — either through one-time donations or recurring membership. “The journey to twenty thousand took us 3.5 years and thousands of hours of work by the most talented people I know. All of this is a powerful reminder of what a committed community can do, and how reader-funded journalism can thrive, even in the hardest conditions. This achievement belongs to all of them — and it shows what's possible when journalism is powered by community.</p>

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! The case, Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Carolina, concerns a 2018 order from the state's Republican governor that barred any clinic providing abortions from getting payments through Medicaid. Medicaid, which insures low-income Americans, does not cover abortions in most states, including South Carolina. Medicaid is the largest source of insurance for pregnant people in the country, and most people who get health care at Planned Parenthood clinics also rely on it. Planned Parenthood provides a range of services, including contraception, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Reproductive health clinics, including Planned Parenthood, typically operate on thin financial margins. In South Carolina, the loss of Medicaid funding could force clinics to turn patients away or to charge them for services that once would have been covered. Though Medicaid covers millions of Americans, health facilities typically aren't required to accept it. Without Planned Parenthood as an option, patients insured through the program could struggle to find health care providers who accept their insurance, let alone ones they trust and feel comfortable with. The court's ruling undercuts a key provision of federal Medicaid law: Beneficiaries are allowed to use that coverage at any qualified health provider who agrees to accept it. The ruling currently only applies to South Carolina, where abortion is already outlawed after six weeks of pregnancy. However, it offers a template to lawmakers in other states. Already, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas are enforcing laws that disqualify Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. President Donald Trump, while promising to leave abortion policy up to individual states, has said he supports policies eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood, most of which comes through Medicaid. In Washington, D.C., where Republicans control both chambers of Congress, senators are considering a budget bill that would prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid dollars. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that policy could increase the deficit by $300 million over 10 years, thanks to patients missing preventive care and requiring more expensive follow-up treatment later on for conditions such as cancer and sexually transmitted infections, as well as through unintended pregnancies.Already, many reproductive health clinics have been forced to slash their budgets, thanks to an April move by the federal government to withhold millions of dollars of family planning grants across 22 states. Those grants would have been disbursed through the federal Title X program, which supports family planning clinics that serve low-income people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Mobile, the wireless service provider and phone company launched by the Trump Organization, no longer promises on its website that its upcoming smartphone will be made in America. The revised language comes after industry analysts expressed skepticism about the phone's American origins, noting that its specifications resembled a phone made by a Chinese manufacturer. Despite changed language on the site, a spokesperson for Trump Mobile told CNN that “the T1 phones are proudly being made in America.” The Trump Organization's press release from last week announcing Trump Mobile still says the $499 gold-colored phone will be “proudly designed and built in the United States.” In the formal announcement from Trump Tower on June 16, Trump Mobile partner Pat O'Brien said, ”we are going to be doing phones that we are going to build in America.” But later, in a clip from an interview with conservative media personality Benny Johnson, Eric Trump said “eventually all the phones can be built in the United States of America.” Ryan Reith, group vice president for the International Data Corporation's Worldwide Device Tracker, previously told CNN that terms like “designed” and “built” are very vague. That makes it unclear precisely what parts of the phone making process would have taken place in the US. Apple, for example, designs its phones in California, but assembles them in areas like China and India with components from international suppliers. “There (are) no phones that are really being built in the US from start to finish,” Reith said last week when Trump Mobile was announced. While the phone was originally listed as having a 6.78-inch screen, the website now says it has a 6.25-inch screen. That's a noticeable change in size similar to the difference between an iPhone 16 and an iPhone 16 Pro Max. Todd Weaver, CEO of Purism, one of the only known companies to actually manufacture a cell phone in the United States, and Max Weinbach, an analyst at market research firm Creative Strategies, independently told CNN previously that they believe the originally announced T1 phone looks like a version of the already available Revvl 7 Pro 5G. That phone is made by China-based Wingtech, which provides manufacturing services for smartphones and other products, and retails for around $169 on Amazon. The debut of Trump Mobile came as President Trump, who is not involved in the daily operations of the Trump Organization run by his sons, has been pressuring tech giants like Apple and Samsung to make their smartphones in the United States. The move is part of a push to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, although experts have said making phones domestically at scale is a challenging, if not impossible, task – particularly under the September timeframe originally promised. “Unless the Trump family secretly built out a secure, onshore or nearshore (fabrication) operation over years of work without anyone noticing, it's simply not possible to deliver what they're promising,” Weaver previously said.

Following the U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine put U.S. adversaries on notice.

Caine, at a press conference at the Pentagon on June 26 alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, touted the work of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in studying the Fordow nuclear facility in Iran—which was one of the nuclear sites struck by the United States on June 21—and said that adversaries should know that the agency is studying them as well, suggesting that they could be next to be targeted by the United States.</p>

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. We will be hearing from Astra Taylor, who recently co-authored a piece called “The Rise of End Times Fascism” with Naomi Klein. In their piece, Astra and Naomi describe the supremacist siege mentality of the tech billionaires and Evangelical Christians who are currently working to rewrite our reality—and what it might take to stop them. Her books include Democracy May Not Exist, but We'll Miss It When It's Gone, Solidarity, and The Age of Insecurity. You can also support the show by subscribing to “Movement Memos” on Apple or Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts, or by leaving a positive review on those platforms. Sharing episodes on social media is also a huge help. Truthout is an independent news organization, publishing stories that the craven corporate media won't touch. We are a union shop with the best family and sick leave policies in the industry, and we could not do this work without the support of readers and listeners like you. And with that, I hope you enjoy the show. KH: This is such an overwhelming time, and I'm really grateful for the opportunity to talk with you amid everything that's happening. Some of our listeners are no doubt familiar with your work and might remember our last conversation, but for the unacquainted, can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do? So, I've written books on democracy, my most recent book is on solidarity, but a lot of my energy over the last decade has been focused on building a movement of debtors. So, I co-founded a group called the Debt Collective, which is an experimental union of debtors. We're most known for our work on student debt cancellation, but we are actually involved in organizing rent debtors or tenants, as well as medical debtors. We also fight for the abolition of school lunch debt, and for the provision of what we call reparative public goods. In other words, the free, high-quality, universal, inclusive public goods that we need, so that we don't have to go into debt in the first place. KH: Well, those sound like essential efforts, and I am extremely grateful that the Debt Collective is out there fighting the good fight. As a fellow writer and organizer, I respect the balancing act, and I also want to pivot, for a moment, to talk about your written work. You and Naomi Klein recently wrote a piece called “The Rise of End Times Fascism.” What is end times fascism, and how are its leading players different from some of our previous opponents and adversaries? AT: First, I guess I just want to say that it was such a delight to get to write an article with Naomi Klein, who is an icon of mine, and someone that I learned a tremendous amount from over the years, and continue to learn from. So, we worked on this piece together, and I think this is one of those pieces where the topic is so bleak, that it was good to have a buddy. So, I know you're also someone who does co-writing a lot, and I think it can be a great mechanism not just to sort of expand your conceptual and political horizons, but just to have the fortitude required sometimes to face this stuff. So, yeah, end times fascism is our name for the specific brand of fascism that we're facing today, and we call them “end times fascists” because we want to gesture towards a kind of theological resonance. And then he highlights… he flags what he calls an “Armageddon complex,” this idea that there's a constant prepping for the end of the world, this final battle, this sort of militaristic Armageddon mindset. But what he says is, the fascism of his time, this was a writer who grew up under Mussolini, did at least say, “Hey, for our followers, things are going to get better. We're going to have this purified paradise at the end of this conflict.” And our provocation is that the fascists today aren't even offering that. Corporate America knows that climate change is real, and they're choosing to accelerate it anyway. So, these are people who aren't just putting their hands up as the world burns, they're actually adding gasoline to the fire. So, that was a little bit of a long introduction to the idea, but this is why I think this idea that these are people who understand, they're not in the dark, they understand that what they're doing is devastating, and they're doing it anyway. And their hope is basically that they can grab a lot of wealth, and insulate themselves from the horrors that they're unleashing. KH: Let's talk more about the religiosity of this phenomenon. On this show, we've dug into longtermism and other cults of Silicon Valley, and we've also discussed the role of Christian Nationalism in the current moment. AT: What's interesting is there's been a lot of attention, and I think rightly so, because it could be strategically helpful on the divisions in the Trump Coalition, which is a very strange coalition. A lot has been made, for example, the battle between Steve Bannon, who claims to be a sort of economic populist, that he's a hardcore nationalist, and the tech bros, especially Elon Musk, and now there's a battle between Elon Musk and Trump, it seems. How is it that these Christian Nationalists, or Christian Zionists as sometimes they call themselves, and these often secular tech moguls come together and what unites them? One thing that unites them is just a contempt for the world, the contempt for other living beings. And so, you have figures like Elon Musk saying, he actually just tweeted the other day, I was really struck by it, he said, “If we don't go to Mars, we'll be stuck on earth forever.” And I was like, “Stuck on earth?” Earth is amazing. There's figures like Eric Schmidt, who was a major power player at Google, which is now Alphabet, who we quote as when he recently testified before Congress. He essentially says, well, we need to triple the energy consumption of the AI industry because we're building a higher consciousness, something higher than humanity, something better than all of these carbon-based life forms. And there's something kind of, again, quasi-religious about that, right? This idea that the earthly realm is mundane. The earthly realm is something that needs to be transcended. And they see themselves as the people with a special knowledge, whether that's access to this religious truth or the scientific-technical truth. And so, I think there's these points where these folks can recognize that they have more in common with each other, whether they're the engineer, the far right politician, or the religious fundamentalist leader. I think that we need to pay attention to those points of connection, and take seriously their contempt for life. And because they don't have the maturity to face that stuff, they're basically going to destroy us all. So, this is why we talk about bunkers, whether it's billionaires building their underground safety zones, or whether it's the bunkered nation, this idea that we'll turn the United States into a kind of armed lifeboat. This is why we talk about the phenomenon of Freedom Cities, so-called Freedom Cities, which are these sort of fantasy zones where there's no regulation, where cryptocurrencies can run in the day. This is why I'm like, “These people are weird.” And they're also tapping into something highly exploitable about the present moment, about our uncertain future, and the spiritual longings people have. The tech bros and the theo bros, as you call them in the piece — some of them are true believers in Evangelical Christianity or in tech cults, like longtermism or effective accelerationism, but they're all exploiting the scarred psyches of lost, frightened people. I'm thinking about the conversations I've had with Émile P. Torres about how a lot of people are walking around with a “God-shaped” hole in their lives, either because we grew up with religion and walked away from it, or because we're just grappling with the spiritual emptiness of our lives under capitalism. In a lot of people, that creates a kind of longing, even if they don't know how to name it.And we are also in this moment of extreme crisis, from climate chaos to global political instability, and all of the violence that entails. In the Trump coalition, we have these Evangelical accelerationist perspectives, which tell us that accelerationism is good, because the aftermath of the apocalypse will be paradise on earth for god's chosen people — which is why they cheer and abet the genocide in Gaza, so that Jewish people can be settled where they're supposed to be settled according to the Book of Revelations, and be slaughtered in accordance with scripture. And then, we also have tech accelerationists, who either argue that it's fine to destroy the environment to produce AI, because AGI will solve every imaginable problem — or, actually arguing, as Elon Musk has, that humanity is just a “biological bootloader” for advanced artificial intelligence. So, basically, it's okay if we ultimately make the world uninhabitable for biological humans, because artificial general intelligence is going to replace us. And so we just have to devote ourselves to the creation of a new digital god, and these new digital higher beings. These are beliefs that treat cataclysmic events as transformative and redeeming. So, I think it's really important to think about people's spiritual vulnerabilities, and spiritual desperation, in times of crisis and collapse. They are giving people the opportunity to cosign destructive acts and ways of being, while feeling like it's all happening for a reason, and headed somewhere important. AT: What you just said was so well put, and I think really right on the money. So, in 2023, I put out a book called The Age of Insecurity, which is about precisely what you were laying out, which is the way that economic insecurity has all of these affective consequences. It makes people, as you said, more vulnerable to fascist appeals. You can respond to insecurity in different ways. You can respond to instability in different ways. So, one thing we talk about in the piece is this explicit turn on empathy, because in this moment when people are feeling insecure and feeling unstable, then maybe they could be more open to hearing a message from the left, one that says, “Hey, we're all suffering right now. Let's band together.” So, what does the right do? They do everything in their power to stop that. Vance a few months ago talking about his brand of Catholicism, and what he called “ordered love,” just basically that, yes, it's okay to only love your family, and only love the people next to you, and maybe the people you share a nation with. But no, the church does not actually command you to love beyond maybe your neighbor, that it's okay to actually have shrinking circles of care and concern. And so, I think this is part of a concerted effort to turn people against each other in this moment. And it's just another interesting moment of alliance between the tech bros and the theo bros, that they're all kind of saying, “Yeah, let's make selfishness a legitimate and actually kind of glorified position to hold.” This is a bit of a tangent, but when we're talking about how strange these people are, I also think it's important to talk about how a sort of component of this agenda is really vilifying people who are trying to do good. So, there is the broader just war on “woke,” and attack on progressive ideologies, but we also quote Peter Thiel, who's, of course, a co-founder of PayPal, venture capitalist, and also it's important to note, was a kind of key figure in elevating JD Vance politically. And he is very erudite on some levels. So, somebody like Greta Thunberg comes along and says, peace and safety, no more genocide in Gaza, no more environmental destruction. And for Thiel, she's the harbinger of doom, because ultimately she would regulate his industry and the industries of his allies, but he's not so direct about it. Instead of just saying, “I don't like Greta Thunberg, I don't like environmentalists because they would curb my profits,” he is speaking of her in these pretty unhinged theological terms. And so, the biblical proportions of their rhetoric are not just rhetoric, because I think it speaks to the conviction with which they're pursuing their extremely lethal ends. KH: I really appreciate what you're saying about empathy, and the way that these folks are seeking to vilify and pathologize empathy. Breaking solidarity has obviously always been important to our opposition, but the extremity of how empathy is being portrayed as a potentially civilization-ending disease — that feels alarming to me, and also instructive, in terms of what actually has the potential to undermine these monsters. When Elon Musk talks about “suicidal empathy,” it's a lot like Peter Thiel calling Greta Thunberg the anti-christ. We already have a vehicle for that kind of condemnation and disregard, here in the United States, in the prison industrial complex. Once people are criminalized and disappeared, we have social permission to stop caring about them, their living conditions, and the manufacturing of their premature deaths. These folks are looking to massively expand the bounds and reach of that thinking. We also see disabled people being targeted in the administration's rhetoric around it being our duty to stay well, RFK Jr.'s lies about how infectious diseases aren't a threat to healthy people, and his false characterizations of autism — all of this feeds into ideas that some lives aren't worth saving or living. The idea that empathy itself is deadly, and that not everyone can or should be saved, is really at the heart of what we're up against right now. AT: Yeah, I think what you're saying is exactly right. I mean, think about George W. Bush and “Compassionate Conservatism.” Those days are done. It's a portal to recognizing that you're not the only human being who matters, right? It's a way out of a kind of solipsism, and I think the right understands that it is a first step towards the kind of solidarity that's very dangerous to them. They had pre-existing conditions, they were weak.And it is this rationing up of disposability, and that flows from this devaluation of the here, and the now, and the people in non-human creatures we share this planet with. And so, when you're preparing for Armageddon, when you are someone who has bought into this Armageddon complex, to use the language of Umberto Eco, then you have to find ways to rationalize life being disposable. And so, that's what we're seeing these people do, is concoct these ever greater categories [of disposability].And a lot of us were warning people, right? We're like, “Palestine, Gaza, this is not an isolated issue,” or, “Hey, racial justice is not just about Black and brown people. It's about all of us.” And I think we are seeing a… It feels always later than it should be, but maybe opportunities to advance a kind of acceptance, awareness, or awakening to the fact that it's never just the other who bears the brunt of these kinds of politics. KH: In your piece, you refer to a political force that you and Naomi Klein characterize as the “startup country contingent.” Can you talk about that movement, and how it's gained momentum under Trump? For years now, this fellow Patrick Friedman, who is Milton Friedman's grandson — Milton Friedman, of course, being the esteemed libertarian intellectual advisor to Ronald Reagan — has been peddling this idea of seasteading, of creating libertarian nations, maybe on abandoned oil rigs. And he's just been a jokester in the sense that it hasn't gotten anywhere. And, of course, that idea sort of riffs on things like free trade areas, these sort of zones, where typical regulations don't apply, and corporations can go about their business less encumbered by labor law, environmental regulations, et cetera. So, there's sort of precedents for this pivot, but some of these sort of tech utopian guys have come up with this idea of Freedom Cities, which is sort of these free trade zones, but ideally for them, places where people would live, and where they would be liberated from pesky governments, regulation, and also currencies. And the idea is maybe rich people can go to a sort of med spa and do some self-augmentation that's not allowed in the United States or in Europe, or maybe a nuclear power plant could be constructed without as much environmental oversight. So, one of these, we open with an account of this Freedom City called Próspera, which is a startup in Honduras that has really gone sideways. And so, these tech bros made a deal with a corrupt government [under Juan Orlando Hernández] to start a little Freedom City on an island, and we don't need to get into the details, but there's ongoing litigation, and these guys are now trying to sue this impoverished country for over $10 billion. So, they're absolutely willing to devastate a nation and its people for this utter fantasy of freedom from taxation, freedom from regulation, and ultimately, on a deeper level for this fantasy of exit. So, influential tech figures, Peter Thiel is one of them, have taken and kind of twisted the ideas of this political philosopher and economist, Albert Hirschman, who wrote a book called Exit, Voice, and Loyalty. And they have taken this idea of exit, this idea that the ultimate freedom that they want for themselves is to be able to abandon communities, abandon countries, and to start something new. And so, these Freedom Cities were really on the margin — they were able to track some sort of investment money, but they got a big boost on the campaign trail by Donald Trump, who kind of unexpectedly made a promise in the middle of one of his rambling campaign speeches, where he said, “If I'm president, I will help start up 10 Freedom Cities.” And though he hasn't made any concrete moves in that direction, it has really galvanized and energized this movement. And it's one that, yeah, I don't think we should laugh at anymore. In March, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum proposed the sale of as much as 625 square miles of land currently controlled by the Bureau of Land Management near existing cities, supposedly to create more affordable housing to address the housing crisis. Three days later, the American Enterprise Institute — a rightwing think tank — proposed what it calls “Homesteading 2.0,” which calls for the privatization of 850 square miles of federal land in two steps. First, 3 million new homes would be built over the next ten years, then, later this century, 20 new Freedom Cities, which would be home to millions of people, would be created around the Western United States. Right now, they're focused on selling federal land in Idaho, Alaska, Utah and Nevada. The administration says that far less federal money will be available, and that funds that are dispersed will either come directly from the White House or from the Department of Homeland Security. Now, this not only gives Trump a whole lot of leverage, in terms of arm-twisting Democratic governors into complying with his fascist policies, but also makes Democratic states and cities incredibly vulnerable to disaster capitalists. We know that more and more climate catastrophes are going to occur, so what does it mean when there's no federal money to rebuild? We've talked previously on this show about how Curtis Yarvin — an anti-democratic tech theorist, whose ideas are cherished by tech billionaires like Peter Thiel — has promoted the idea of replacing our current system with a “patchwork” of corporate tech dictatorships. These corporatized societies would exist under a kind of totalizing state surveillance. Given the current state of surveillance tech, what do you think life would be like for people living in one of these corporate fiefdoms? I mean, there are so many problems with the government as it currently exists, but there's a whole lot that it provides that I take for granted right now. I could smell the Canadian wildfire smoke a few days ago, but right now, I can breathe the air. I also know that if something happens and I impale myself this afternoon in my kitchen, that the emergency room, that I could get to maybe by calling an ambulance, has to take me in by law. I mean, there's just a million sort of protections that we take for granted. I'm pretty confident that unless I've let something get moldy in my fridge, that the food I am going to eat later today isn't going to kill me, that there's basic food safety.None of this would be guaranteed in a “Freedom City.” The idea of a Freedom City is to have none of that, right? I mean, things that are so basic, that movements won going back to the 1800s, to the early 1900 hundreds. I think it kind of boggles the mind to imagine this kind of retro future, where there's this high-tech network surveillance technology coupled with an absence of all of these basic protections that we fought for, from food safety, to things like ramps and basic accessibility for disabled people, to basic worker protections. As off-the-rails capitalist as America is, we've never ever existed in a space that was fully controlled by the market. So, I think it would be pretty dark. And one indication of how dark it would be was Curtis Yarvin's excitement at the devastation, destruction, the genocide in Gaza, when he said, hey, now is our chance. Let's make Gaza into the first corporate city state. For him, the destruction of a people is an opportunity to impose a vision that is not just market-driven, but monarchic, in that he literally says, “We need a kind of CEO king running society.” So, the fact that this guy, Curtis Yarvin, is peddling… I mean, anti-democratic doesn't do it justice, but corporate fascist, genocidal nonsense, because he is an idiot who calls himself a philosopher. KH: I also want folks to think about the fact that every fascism has its subhumans. To technofascists like Elon Musk, humans are the subhumans. We're “biological bootloaders” for a more consequential reality. People who are building the tech infrastructure for that new world are the only players that matter in their minds. The rest of us are non-player characters [NPCs]. When Musk talks about the “Kobayashi Maru” — for the non-nerds among us, that's a Star Trek reference, and it means hacking a simulation to make a no-win situation winnable — he's talking about his belief that some people, like him, can retool the system to make their worldviews inevitable. Fully expendable in the pursuit of his vision. Now, I am not arguing that he's driven by true belief, because his stated beliefs have morphed a lot over time, but this is the worldview that he is zealously pursuing right now. And now that he's kind of shot himself in the foot with Trump, I think it's critical that we maintain our understanding of him, and never allow him any semblance of redemption, because he's too dangerous, and there's no coming back from the things he's done. But something else I've talked to Brian Merchant about is the idea that, rather than marketing us the potential for salvation, these tech billionaires are really trying to market us a role within the apocalypse. Like, there's a way out of being an NPC. I'm thinking about something Mark Zuckerberg said recently, about how companies are already “systems that are smarter than any one individual” because they harness the intelligence of many people to accomplish a goal. He claimed “instead of having relatively few people” able to harness the power of “a 10,000 person organization” — by which he presumably means CEOs — AI technology will mean that “in the future” almost “everyone will have that.” Theo Von summarized this argument as “universal basic technology,” in a perverse play on the idea of universal basic income. The idea is that we, too, can become consequential. We can cease to be non-player characters by embracing the rise of AI, even as it contributes to the destruction of our world. We are being sold the idea that to escape our subhuman status, we need to dehumanize others and embrace isolating, dehumanizing technologies.And the degree to which a focus on the self, and the abandonment of others, is treated as a form of survivalism, in this philosophy, cannot be overstated. And on the subject of survivalism, in your recent piece with Naomi Klein, the two of you wrote, “The governing ideology of the far right in our age of escalating disasters has become a monstrous, supremacist survivalism.” Can you say more about that monstrous survivalism? AT: Part of what's so disturbing about that survivalism is not only do we see it happening, but we see it glamorized. We see it augmented, we see it turned into propaganda, and spit out through the social media feeds of the most powerful people on this planet. I mean, we were very struck, writing in this piece, by the way that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has become a kind of recurring figure in this grotesque anti-immigrant propaganda, making videos from the CECOT prison in El Salvador. So, I mean, there's something… Obviously, we shouldn't be naive. And there's something kind of pathetic about it. It actually just shows you're an insecure asshole. But it's really disturbing, and honestly, it just makes me really heartsick, literally sick at heart, to see that this stuff is out there, and that there are people kind of eagerly and gleefully responding to it. And I think one thing we were trying to do in this piece is say these people are tapping into really ancient myths. This idea of the chosen few, this idea that some people will be the chosen few who survive, who are able to make it to the promised land, who are, again, able to survive the rapture, able to survive Armageddon. This idea that there's a grand sort of final battle, these are old, old, old stories that are kind of, even if you're not religious, they're kind of woven into our cultural narratives. We need stories where, in contrast to those traitors, we're part of a movement that is brave, resilient, courageous, compassionate, and committed to being here. And that this is actually epic, heroic, important work. KH: I really agree that we need to position ourselves, on a spiritual level, in opposition to the dehumanization of these fascist politics. And on that note, I would love to talk more about AI. How do you see AI functioning as a tool of fascism? How is this technology being used to advance a fascist agenda, while also divorcing us from our humanity? AT: I mean, I think on the one hand, all of the arguments that I and other tech critics and you, I mean people have been making now for years, if not decades, is we have to pay attention, not just to the technology, but the underlying business interests. So, this question of political economy of ownership is incredibly important, because you could put these data sets to decent use, maybe trying to figure out how to make a public transit system run more efficiently. I think there's ways that technology could be deployed at scale for democratic ends. That is not what's happening here because we live under capitalism. And so, if you look at OpenAI, they're creating a labor disruption machine, that is the goal of their business, of their enterprise, because they know that then they can sell their services to bosses who want to reduce labor costs. And it actually doesn't matter always whether the machines can actually do the jobs, or whether the machines can just be used as a foil to scare workers and into accepting less. So, there's a whole lot of hype happening right now with AI, and we've been hearing about automation making us replaceable for ages. And so, I think part of what we're on the progressive end of the spectrum need to say is just we're not replaceable. And now, they're not just saying, “We'll be replaced,” but they're saying, “We'll be replaced with something better than you.” So, Eric Schmidt's saying, “We're building a higher consciousness.” Who are you to say you're building something higher? I mean, the fact is these guys know that they cannot actually just create a mirror world, an AI world, because AI requires too much energy, resources, and critical minerals — it actually is a force of depletion. And in that sense, it is kind of a zero-sum thing. It's like us, or… I'm not going to say them, because it's that, us or this thing that is not animate. So, I think we have to be real about the material conditions. We have to be real about the hype. What's propaganda that's being used to kind of scare us into submission? And I think we should just be very incensed because none of us are asking for this. Nobody is asking for the kind of AI that they're offering. And Steve Bannon is full of shit, and he's a liar — and Naomi Klein is far more of an expert on him and his rantings than I am — but he is extremely against AI, because this is something that's also not popular with people on the right. And so, I think this is something just on a strategic level that we should be paying attention to. And I don't think ordinary people want their kids to be taught by AI. I think that people don't want to be cared for in old age by AI, and people want to live as human beings for now, and we need to nurture that sentiment, and organize against it, and just be relentless about following the money. And for these guys, they're bringing about the apocalypse with their policies, but for them, the apocalypse would just be regulation. That's what they see, the idea of people waking up to their agenda, and restraining it as something worth waging an incredible war over. KH: What's coming up for me, as you talk about nobody wanting this technology is the ways that some people are embracing it, sometimes because they can't get away from it, or because they can't keep up with what's being demanded of them. And I really want us to understand that for the tech bros, that's not a bug, it's a feature. But we're seeing, more and more, people relying on AI in situations when they could be learning how to form arguments, think critically, and analyze the information in front of them. At the same time, we are being further deskilled socially, because people are out-sourcing opportunities to practice self-expression, and in some cases, turning to AI chatbots for companionship, or even therapy — which has already had horrifying results in some cases. The ultra wealthy tech bros don't want us to have critical thinking skills or emotional intelligence. We are being captured and altered by these technologies in real time, and in some cases, we are cooperating. These systems, which are being inserted into the government agencies that DOGE has gutted, are poised to further entrench inequality and human disposability. And these tech titans want us and the US government to be unable to function without the help of AI their models. We are being deskilled and devalued, because we are being made into the ideal, feudal subjects of corporate tech states. I think it's really noteworthy, for example, that Elon Musk, whose beliefs seem to lean toward longtermism and effective acceleration, has said positive things about Christianity in the last year or so. Not that he believes in the Christian faith, but that, maybe it's a good thing to be a Christian. KH: Now, I am not trying to knock Christianity or Christians, but why does Elon Musk want people to be Christian? Because he sees religion as a control mechanism. He longs for the days when people were more easily ruled by religious ideas, and by the people who dictated and interpreted those ideas. Because he wants us primed for exploitation, above all else. So, in opposition to all of the terrible things we've been describing, what kind of organizing do we need right now? And one thing he said is that, and it is just very in sync with what you were just commenting on. He said that essentially that, as AI gets more advanced, we, ordinary humans, will actually have to get more medieval, kind of like people in previous ages who believed in angels and had this kind of confusion about what kind of entities we share the world with. And I thought it was just a really telling moment, because it was exactly what you're saying, which is just to be dumbfounded. Leave the hard stuff to us engineers, and we will create a kind of quasi-religious technology that fleeces you and controls you. It wasn't the typical hype, which is, Oh, wow, you're going to have this chatbot that can answer all the questions for you, and the world of knowledge at your fingertips. It was like, No, actually, you'll just be even more in the realm of illusion, as a consequence of our new tools and our emerging business models. I think one of the challenges in a moment like this, and it's kind of the eternal challenge, is keeping our eyes on continuity and change. I mean, so contrary to what the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and their cheerleaders in Washington have been saying for decades, we still need unions. We still need these things that they want to tell us are out of date. Because somehow, these new tools are so novel and so innovative, that they've made all of these old mechanisms obsolete. That's why I'm dedicated to the Debt Collective. It's like, okay, so can we create an economic formation that helps people come to political consciousness, engage in coordinated strategies, when they might not have the opportunity to join a traditional union, given the nature of their employment or given the state they live in, maybe they live in a right to work state, or given the stage in their career they're at? And that change in continuity thing, I think, is at the heart of this piece with Naomi. This is fascism, but what's new about it? We're not fighting the Nazis all over again. We're not fighting Mussolini's fascism all over again. We're fighting on a terrain of accelerating communicative and network technologies. And so, we think that there's something potentially valuable about explicitly committing to here, that's the language that we use, to saying, “We are the people who are going to fight for one another, and fight for the livability and habitability of this planet, of this place.” And that seems so basic, but it is unfortunately something that at this moment needs to be said, and needs to be said really clearly. It's like, No, this is actually a beautiful place, and it's worth fighting for, and other people are worth fighting for. In this moment, I think just underscoring that commitment is actually valuable and worth doing. KH: I really appreciate what you keep underscoring about rejecting this idea of exit, and really fighting for the livability of this world. As Mariame Kaba and I repeatedly emphasize in Let This Radicalize You, it means refusing to abandon each other. I also think it means rethinking our own relationship with escapism, to some degree. Because, don't get me wrong, I love television, but we are being offered a world of distraction to get lost in, technologically, in these times, when we desperately need to get grounded in reality. One of the things tech bros idealize about a digitized future, populated by digital people, is the idea that there will be no suffering, and I feel like we really see flashes of that fantasy in the way we're encouraged to live now — constantly seeking stimulation, and then numbing ourselves out. We need to deepen our awareness of each other's struggles, and our regard for one another, and understand that by defending you I am also defending myself, because we have a shared home and destiny. Everything they're handing us is further removing us from what is glorious, sacred, and worth fighting for about this world. Because the more we lose touch with our humanity, the more we lose touch with each other, and the closer we get to that sort of techno-feudal world they want, where they imagine us celebrating each other's disposal — the way you see feudal subjects in movies cheering for executions in the public square. They believe the enlightenment was a setback, and they hate movements for liberation, and for the rights of marginalized people. AT: Anyway, I think you just nailed it. I mean, what you said, though, made me think that part of the war on empathy, this idea that empathy is suicidal. So, I think we are, you're exactly right, being encouraged to cut ourselves off from our humanity and from our interdependence. And for me, that is a kind of credible spiritualism. And this is something I wrote about with Leah Hunt-Hendrix in our book on solidarity, that movements need a sense of the sacred. And that's why, I think, as simplistic as it might be, it's also really profound to say, “No, this planet is actually sacred.” That's why I was so incensed by Musk's comment, “We'll be stuck here.” It's like, “No, we are so lucky to be here.” I mean, we're not made to live on fucking Mars, dude. And this guy is so incurious about the world around him, that he can't even see the wonder and beauty of this world. Every day, take a moment, and just experience some awe, and let that fortify you in the fight against these ridiculous, pathetic dudes. KH: What a great note to end on. Astra Taylor, thank you so much for joining us today. KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today. I will be taking a few weeks off to tend to my health, but I will be back in August with more conversations about how we can organize for change and support each other during these difficult times. For now, I hope you're all doing what you can to fight for a better world, and to take care of yourselves, and each other. If you're feeling discouraged and unsure of what to do, remember that our best defense against cynicism is to do good and to remember that the good we do matters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the psychedelic south-east corner of the Glastonbury festival site a rocket has been built to carry Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos on a one-way journey to Mars. The construction is not a hallucinatory vision but an installation designed by the political campaign group Led By Donkeys in collaboration with Block9, an area of Worthy Farm known for its immersive stage designs and diverse music genres. The billionaire's hand is thrown skyward, recreating a gesture he made at a rally celebrating US president Donald Trump's second inauguration, which appeared to be in the manner of a fascist-style salute. Fellow billionaires Zuckerberg and Bezos, followed by Trump and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, are seen queueing to board the rocket. They say the great priority of humanity should be to colonise Mars. “It encourages the notion that Earth is temporary and expendable, that we don't need to cherish and protect it because we can just move on. In reality Earth is the only place where humanity can thrive. Just don't expect the rest of us to come with you. Gideon Berger and Stephen Gallagher, the duo behind Block9, said: “Led By Donkeys are national heroes. Their activism sits perfectly alongside Block9's own values and we are delighted to work with them on this collab. “Seeing as the tech bros are so keen on Mars, it seems only fair to help them get there. Our installation captures the moment when we wave off our least favourite public figures to a far and distant red planet. Led By Donkeys explained why they chose the festival for their latest installation. “Glastonbury is a pretty special place,” they said. It's a place where artists feel free to come and say something and despite what some commentators would have us all believe, it still has a radical edge.” This year's Glastonbury festival, renowned for its activism, is expected to be politically charged against the fraught geopolitical backdrop. The Irish-language rap trio Kneecap have drawn controversy over alleged statements they made concerning Gaza. One of the members has been charged with a terror offence and senior politicians, including Starmer, have said they should not be performing at the festival. “The right gets terribly exercised about what it calls ‘cancel culture' but the single most policed and punished area of commentary is around Palestine,” Led By Donkeys said. Starmer's got a country to run, yet there he is telling us all who should and shouldn't be allowed to play the West Holts stage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carbon removal at this site will begin in the summer.Todd Korol/The Globe and Mail Startup Deep Sky recently completed construction at its “Alpha” Direct Air Capture, or DAC, test ground in Alberta, where it will have room for 10 companies to deploy and fine-tune technologies on their way to developing commercial-scale plants. CEO Alex Petre said that with the Trump administration's reduced focus on climate as well as uncertainty about the future of U.S. funding support for DAC technology, Deep Sky is fielding more inquiries than expected from U.S.-based carbon tech developers. Carbon removal at the testing ground, which is expected to capture 3,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, will begin this summer. DAC is different from the more established carbon capture and storage technology. Where traditional carbon capture and storage is deployed at industrial smoke stacks, filtering out the CO2 and storing it before it reaches the atmosphere, DAC removes carbon directly from the air – meaning it can clean up emissions that have already occurred. However, the technology has been expensive and slow to scale. In the U.S., DAC proponents are facing a broader political backlash against public funding for climate technology. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. Department of Energy pledged more than US$1-billion in funding support for two proposed DAC hubs in Texas and Louisiana. Petre said that once Deep Sky's Alberta test hub is fully up and running, the company plans to develop a large-scale commercial DAC project in Canada. She said she is encouraged by new Prime Minister Mark Carney's commitment to identify and fast-track infrastructure projects of national interest in an effort to help Canada become a conventional and clean energy superpower. “There's lots of really interesting developments [in Canada] that seem to be on the table that I think will really help us,” Petre said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Henry Mah, at his home in Edmonton, took up dividend investing and has self-published books on the topic.Amber Bracken/The Globe and Mail In Tales from the Golden Age, retirees talk about their spending, savings and whether life after work is what they expected. For more articles in this series, click here. We travelled continuously early in retirement, visiting places such as Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Jakarta, the United Kingdom and Europe. We also bought a motorhome and spent about four years travelling across Canada and the U.S. in the warmer months. It progressed slowly at first, but by 2019, she was homebound, ending our travels. Around the same time, my daughter quit her job and was looking for something else, so I offered her a paid position to help me. It's much better than relying on home care services, which can be hit or miss. It would be much more difficult for me if I didn't have my daughter available. My wife and I were always conscious of money in our working years and kept our debt to a minimum. Still, we didn't have a lot of savings. When I was 50, I got our finances reviewed at a local bank branch, and the advisor said that, based on our current income and savings, we wouldn't have enough money to retire on at 65. The advice was to reduce our expenses or start saving a lot more. We hired a financial advisor who helped us set money aside in mutual funds and guaranteed investment certificates. I started reading about dividend-paying stocks and decided to switch our money over to those and do it ourselves. By age 65, we were earning about $35,000 of dividend income annually. Combined with our Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits, we have enough money to meet our needs. I've also self-published a few books on the topic, which to date have sold a total of about 7,600 copies. The books and my blog are what keep me busy in retirement. Also, understand your potential sources of reliable income. That will help you meet your expected expense needs. You never know when your situation might change.

QINGDAO /China/, June 26. /TASS/. Anti-Russian and anti-Chinese blocs being created in the Asia-Pacific region by the US, the UK, and other countries are having a destructive impact on the regional stability in the region, Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov said.

"The activities of certain states to create closed, anti-Chinese and anti-Russian blocs in the Asia-Pacific region are having a destructive impact on stability," he said at a meeting of SCO defense officials in Qingdao.

Belousov listed AUKUS (Australia, the UK, and the US) and the US-Japan-South Korea alliance as examples of such blocs.</p>

MOSCOW, June 26. /TASS/. Units of Russia's battlegroup West eliminated five Starlink satellite communication stations, four field weapons depots, and 46 drone control centers of the Ukrainian army during the past day, the battlegroup's spokesman Ivan Bigma said.

"During the day, the enemy lost up to 200 troops, three electronic warfare stations, 12 mortar units, an L-119 howitzer, and a robotic system. Forty-six drone control centers, five Starlink satellite communication stations, and four field munitions depots were wiped out," he said, adding that the battlegroup's air defense units shot down 39 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones.</p>
