                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four players remain in contention for the ATP Mallorca Championships title. As usual, the last ATP 250 events before a Slam have been rather unpredictable. Who do you think will feature in Saturday's championship match? It's been over five years since Corentin Moutet made his first ATP Tour final in Doha at the start of 2020, but the Frenchman feels like he could produce a similar result in the near future. Last week at Queen's Club he took out Taylor Fritz and now he's reached his first main tour semifinal on grass. While he didn't give a chance to Alex Michelsen in Monte Carlo last year, this surface makes things a lot more open. Looks like he's doing better now as the wins over Ethan Quinn and Gabriel Diallo can only be described as routine. Felix Auger-Aliassime had to work for it a little bit more in the quarterfinals, surviving a three-setter against Hamad Medjedovic. This will be a battle of powerful ball-strikers and making impact on return won't be an easy task. Auger-Aliassime won their two matches but it was years back and since you can basically flip a coin here, there's no reason to think Griekspoor can't keep it close now that he's improved so much as a player over time. 700 play a ferret if he could see it from the stands. Always pleased by a beautiful one-handed backhand or classic volleying technique. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Special words from the Serbian, before making his debut in London, when recalling the battle that Carlos and Jannik fought in Paris. "The level was incredible, I have to congratulate both of them." üéæ Balsa Djokovic vs Oscar Lacides Sign up with Bet365 here Make your first deposit of at least ‚Ç¨5 Go to the ‚ÄúLive‚Äù section and watch every match Novak Djokovic doesn't have it easy in his quest for a new Grand Slam. The reason is nothing other than the extraordinary emergence of two generational giants, two flag bearers of a new way of understanding this sport who, to top it off, arrive at Wimbledon 2025 just weeks after having starred in a wonderful final at Roland Garros 2025. How can you not surrender to the level of tennis that Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner showed? It is the first time that Novak talks about a final he sought eagerly and that, unable to be at Philippe Chatrier, has a curious backstory within the Djokovic family. "It was on a different surface, with a different style of play, but what they did in that final in Paris was amazing. We came back home... and ended up watching it. I have to congratulate both: it was one of the most historic matches we have ever seen in this sport". Words that have a special meaning indeed because of who pronounces them. However, Nole wasted no time and sharpened his skills training, precisely, with the best: today he tested Center Court for the first time alongside Carlos Alcaraz, although he admitted it was thanks to the Murcian. "Carlos Alcaraz, as defending champion, has the right to debut on Center Court. I was just his training partner, and I'm happy he chose me", said Djokovic frankly, who, to conclude, chose an aspect of the game that has changed significantly since his first appearance back in 2005 at Wimbledon: "The Wimbledon balls are slower than they used to be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz shared the first Wimbledon Centre Court practice set of this year's championships, with the Serb sharing his thoughts afterwards of both the conditions and the Roland-Garros men's final. The line-up of the last two Wimbledon finals was on show once again during the tournament's first Centre Court practice set, with Djokovic and Alcaraz winning five games each. Djokovic, who was been defeated in both of those finals, was, reportedly, in very impressive form, looking happy and moving well on the grass. ‚ÄúAs happy as one can be,‚Äù the Serb responded, when asked how he was feeling to be back at SW19 for another year. ‚ÄúYou feel bad playing on it [Centre Court]. ‚ÄúWimbledon balls are slower than they used to be. In the end, it was the Spaniard who prevailed in a five-set epic, saving three championship points to defend his Parisian title. ‚ÄúIt is a different surface, a different style of play but what they produced in the final in Paris was amazing,‚Äù commended Djokovic. ‚ÄúTo be honest, I was in my country. My wife wanted to watch the final but I didn't want to watch it. ‚ÄúWe came back and I ended up watching it. It was one of the most historic matches we have ever seen.‚Äù Jimmy Connors warns Jannik Sinner about something that he ‚Äòmust not do' at Wimbledon How to build a winning record against Carlos Alcaraz by one of the few men to do it Djokovic will be seeking a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon title, which would put him one above Pete Sampras and equal with Roger Federer. At 38, and after his recent French Open comments, the tennis legend will know that time is running out if he wants to get his hands on yet another record. ‚ÄúIf this was the farewell match at Roland Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd,‚Äù admitted the Serb, after his loss to Sinner in Paris. ‚ÄúI don't know really what tomorrow brings in a way at this point in my career. ‚ÄúI guess my best chances maybe are Wimbledon, you know, to win another slam ‚Äì or a faster hard court, maybe Australia or something like that. ‚ÄúI said it could have been my last match. So I don't know right now ‚Äì 12 months at this point in my career is quite a long time. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? Novak Djokovic "was the 'villain' early on, but here's what I admire the most ‚Äî he's true to himself". Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu will be ambassadors for the same brand after a big announcement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has opened up about how he ended up watching the 2025 French Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, despite initially having no intention to tune in. The 24-time Grand Slam champion, who was defeated by Sinner in the semi-finals just days prior, confessed that he was back home in Serbia with his wife during the final and wasn't keen on watching it‚Äîat first. The Roland Garros final turned out to be one for the ages, with Alcaraz battling past Sinner in a gripping five-set encounter that lasted 5 hours and 29 minutes. Djokovic, speaking to the Express after a training session at Wimbledon where he hit with Alcaraz, admitted he only ended up watching the latter half of the final but was left thoroughly impressed by the quality of tennis on display. ‚ÄúTo be honest, I was in my country. We came back and I ended up watching it. It was one of the most historic matches we have ever seen," Djokovic said. In what many speculated could be his final match at Roland Garros, Djokovic lost in straight sets‚Äî4‚Äì6, 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì7(3)‚Äîin a contest that lasted just over three hours. Since his last Grand Slam triumph at the 2023 US Open, Djokovic has had a mixed run. He started the 2025 clay season with early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid but did manage to lift a trophy in Geneva just before Roland Garros. Despite battling age and fitness concerns, the 38-year-old remains committed to chasing a historic 25th major title. With Wimbledon on the horizon and plans to participate in the US Open and possibly return to Australia next year, Djokovic's Grand Slam journey isn't over yet.- EndsPublished By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: Jun 26, 2025Also Read |  Emma Raducanu praises Wimbledon after stalker blocked from buying tickets</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has finally reacted to the French Open final for the first time since Carlos Alcaraz retained his title. In what was undoubtedly one of the most dramatic matches in recent memory, the 22-year-old saved three championship points whilst two sets to love down and completely turned the match on its head. And yet, in the end, it came down to a super tiebreak in the fifth set, which Carlos Alcaraz took emphatically. Novak Djokovic had not really commented on such a legendary match, until now. And, when praising all he has accomplished this year, Djokovic could not omit that French Open final. ‚ÄòWimbledon balls are slower than they used to be. Then touching on that remarkable Roland Garros match, Djokovic continued: 'It is a different surface, a different style of play but what they produced in the final in Paris was amazing. ‚ÄòTo be honest, I was in my country. We came back and I ended up watching it. It was one of the most historic matches we have ever seen.' Jack Draper revealed how the entire ATP Tour reacted to the Roland Garros final, and that seemingly included Djokovic after these comments. To write off Djokovic would be a foolish move, but few can deny that the Serbian's powers are waning. Eventually, time had to take its toll on the 39-year-old, who had been defying biology for years now. What he has accomplished since turning 30 deserves so much praise, with his unwavering dedication and unrelenting mindset offering an inspiration not just to the next generation of youngsters, but to every player still currently on tour. However, with the emergence of Alcaraz and Sinner, his chances of snagging that elusive 25th Grand Slam title which he so craves are slimming. Djokovic likely knows this after watching that French Open final, but he will also be well aware of how an upset can come at any moment. It might not even need to be him who takes them out, so all the 24-time Grand Slam champion needs to do is stay in the competition and see what happens. A semi-final for Djokovic at Wimbledon, where he has lifted the title seven times before, would mark an outstanding achievement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ESPN owns the live U.S. broadcast rights to three of tennis' four Grand Slams: the Australian Open, U.S. Open and Wimbledon. It begins main draw coverage of the 2025 edition of the latter event, perhaps tennis' most prestigious, next week. TNT promised to approach its coverage with a ‚Äúfresh lens‚Äù from the outset, delivering a Red Zone-style whiparound show for the opening rounds of the main draw and a talent roster that mixed tennis media mainstays with up-and-comers. Speaking to reporters on a conference call Wednesday, they fielded a question about TNT's coverage, and if there was anything they saw they would like to see ESPN adopt moving forward. ‚ÄúTNT coming in fresh, it was good, because they were more willing. I'm hoping that ultimately it's a win-win.‚Äù Evert agreed saying, ‚ÄúESPN needs a little competition, and TNT -- it's like two top players going at it, and they're both going to improve in the process.‚Äù Evert added that TNT thought ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù with elements like Venus Williams' storytelling segments on French culture around traditional match coverage. ‚ÄúI just think they're [TNT] trying to bring in a younger audience. ... And I think that the young players, the professional players that are playing, to get their stories out there, get their families out there, get how they grew up, get the whole facade of who they really are, I think that will be appealing to the younger generation. They went outside the box and they brought in some new elements that maybe ESPN will look at. And maybe TNT will look at some of the really classic, elegant things that ESPN does. And they'll both be better as a result.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bianca Andreescu was brutally knocked out of Wimbledon qualifying as she continues to search for her form, despite having won more than $9.5 million during her career. With Wimbledon approaching, all eyes will be on the game's greats, with Carlos Alcaraz looking to secure his third win and Novak Djokovic facing a difficult route in the prestigious tournament. Barbora Krejcikova, a former winner, also has announced she will be taking time away to recover as she prepares for Wimbledon. At that point, Andreescu rose to a career-high No. Due to a knee injury and the Coronavirus Pandemic in 2020, Andreescu was unable to capitalize on her 2019 success. Then in 2021, she continued to see losses instead of wins, pushing her further away from the pinnacle she had reached just years prior. She also took time away from the sport during this period as she looked inward to find her form. After her first-round win at the Italian Open, Andresscu spoke on how the time away from the sport has helped her learn more about herself, especially since she has fallen greatly from her U.S. Open win six years ago. "Well, never taking the moment for granted," Andreescu admitted, one of the new perspectives she's had to adjust to. Yes, of course, I want to become, you know, number one, win many grand slams, have those goals. "But focusing more on the process is super important for me. Peacock has hit shows, movies, live sports, and more. You can watch popular titles like Wicked and The Traitors, along with Premier League matches and live golf all in one place. Peacock offers plans starting at $7.99 a month and you can cancel anytime. And while the Canadian played well in the Italian Open, her journey to another accomplishment was cut short, losing to Qinwen Zheng in straight sets. Taking her run in Rome into account, the 25-year-old admitted that perhaps her time was running out to claim herself as one of the best players in the world. "This is in a way maybe my last chance," she candidly explained, per CBC. "I don't want to waste any time." With how much she's had to overhaul her life, for myriad reasons, Andreescu understands that after admitting her U.S Open win feels like "another lifetime," the Canadian will continue to do what she can to get back to some semblance of her previous self. I really do believe that," she concluded to the outlet.

Following a win over Jiri Lehecka during the Australian Open, Djokovic wouldn't speak to Channel Nine's Jim Courier. As a result, Djokovic refused to speak with anyone from Channel Nine until an apology was issued, which Jones eventually did.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz are helping usher in a new era for tennis. With Wimbledon beginning Monday, the sport's most recent Grand Slam champions are Gauff, a 21-year-old American, and Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, who are both at No. 2 in the rankings and are both coming off French Open titles secured in riveting finals against the sport's No. Gauff-Sabalenka, Alcaraz-Sinner give tennis rivalries as Wimbledon arrives 1 Iga Swiatek in the women's game, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the men's, Gauff and Alcaraz offer a bright future for a sport's fanbase that in recent years saw all-time greats Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal walk away and currently might be pondering how much longer Novak Djokovic will contend for the biggest prizes. We are so fortunate to have not only Coco, not only Carlos, but a deep bench of young stars that are just propelling the growth of our sport,‚Äù U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said. We have had the exact opposite during this transition. One key for a sport, especially an individual one, to gain attention and grow popularity is to have rivalries that demand buy-in. The five-set, 5 1/2-hour men's final at Roland-Garros was as full of momentum swings, terrific tennis and athleticism as anything those greats conjured. ‚ÄúThe level,‚Äù two-time reigning Wimbledon champion Alcaraz said, ‚Äúwas insane.‚Äù ‚ÄúHaving these two guys fighting for big trophies ‚Äî I think we have to be very happy about it in the sport of tennis,‚Äù said Juan Carlos Ferrero, Alcaraz's main coach. ‚ÄúFor them, for sure it's something that they raise their level every time that they go on the court. Sabalenka apologized to Gauff about post-match comments in Paris It sure does seem as though Gauff vs. Sabalenka could provide that sort of dynamic and buzz, too. And consider that, like those other two, both own multiple major titles. Gauff's two Slam triumphs came via three-set victories over Sabalenka in the finals. Plus, their latest meeting, at Roland-Garros less than a month ago, came with some added spice because of Sabalenka's post-match comments that were seen as less than fully gracious toward Gauff. It became such a thing that Sabalenka felt the need to issue a pair of apologies ‚Äî one privately via writing to Gauff, and one publicly in an interview at her next tournament. Add that sort of off-court intrigue to the on-court interest, and if there are rematches at the All England Club a couple of weeks from now, no one who is invested in tennis will be displeased. ‚ÄúThere's incredible momentum and wind in our sales as we think about the sport, in total,‚Äù said Lew Sherr, who is about to leave his role as the CEO of the U.S. Tennis Association. ‚ÄúWe've had five consecutive years of participation growth ... and that certainly is being, in part, fueled by the great talent and inspiring players we have at the professional level, and also is feeding record attendance, record interest, record viewership. Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alejandro Davidovich Fokina is settling into the grass-court season rather nicely at this week's Lexus Eastbourne Open. Davidovich Fokina, who is competing in his first grass-court event of the year, countered the wind in style and delivered some trademark shotmaking brilliance, which included various diving volleys. ‚ÄúToday was not an easy day [with] so much wind, we were trying our best, but in the end I'm happy with how I was playing,‚Äù said Davidovich Fokina. ‚ÄúI need to recover my body, there was a lot of diving and sliding on the court today‚Ä¶ My muscles are a little bit tired after this match.‚Äù However, since getting married two weeks ago, Davidovich Fokina appears to be gathering momentum. He withdrew from his first-round clash with Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's Club last week and is now into his ninth tour-level semi-final, and first on grass. Davidovich Fokina, who is the first Spanish semi-finalist in Eastbourne since Feliciano Lopez won the title in 2014, will face top seed and defending titlist Taylor Fritz or Marcos Giron. Earlier in the day, Fritz overcame a late scare from #NextGenATP Brazilian Joao Fonseca to continue his love affair with the grass-court ATP 250 event. Their second-round clash had been suspended due to darkness on Wednesday evening after they split sets, and Fritz quickly regained his rhythm once play resumed. 3x Champ survives üí™@Taylor_Fritz97 withstands a serious test from Fonseca, 6-3 6-7(5) 7-5 to begin his hunt for back-to-back titles at the #LexusEastbouneOpen ‚ùóÔ∏è@the_LTA pic.twitter.com/4J0NIYDpae The top-seeded American, who owns the record for most titles won in Eastbourne (2019, ‚Äò22, ‚Äò24), will have to lace up and return to court later on Thursday to face countryman Giron in the quarter-finals. I was really happy with the level of tennis last night, it's a shame we couldn't finish the match then,‚Äù said Fritz. Fritz was looking assured on serve throughout the final set, during which he won all 11 points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, prior to the ninth game. Despite stumbling at the final hurdle, however, Fritz was able to draw on his grass-court pedigree, which has helped him to three triumphs in Eastbourne and a first title of the season two weeks ago in Stuttgart. ‚ÄúI think almost half of my career titles are on grass, which says a lot for how short the grass-court season is,‚Äù said Fritz, the nine-time tour-level champion. The top-seeded Fritz takes a 4-2 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his clash with Giron.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz has come under scrutiny from fellow players for sharing his excitement about the new mixed doubles format at the US Open. The 22-year-old tennis sensation, who is currently ranked world No. 2 in the ATP rankings and boasts five Grand Slam titles, will partner with Emma Raducanu in the event scheduled for August 19 and 20 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I will try to bring my doubles skills. Despite his enthusiasm, Alcaraz has faced criticism from some quarters of the tennis community. Kristina Mladenovic, a 2013 Wimbledon doubles champion and three-time US Open finalist, recently criticised Alcaraz and other participants for their apparent enjoyment of the preparations for this year's US Open mixed doubles. Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. The 32-year-old French tennis player told Eurosport: "When you hear participants say they're going to have fun while preparing for the US Open, it's embarrassing. A Grand Slam is neither preparation nor fun. You don't want to see your sport turn into a gigantic spectacle, even if it will indeed bring in a lot of money." She added: "From a sporting point of view, it's problematic because it touches on the essence of tennis. There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam!" This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Her concerns were echoed by Edouard Roger-Vasselin, who criticised the communication surrounding the event, explaining: "Personally, I found out a week before it came out in the media, via an internal press release. "But the form is a bit shocking. Touching mixed doubles, for most people, is perhaps not a big deal. Alcaraz is eager to dominate the courts alongside British sensation Raducanu in America. Jannik Sinner will join forces with Emma Navarro, while 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic will partner with Olga Danilovic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After two decades of Andy Murray, there's a new great British male hope at Wimbledon: Jack Draper. Emma Raducanu has won a Grand Slam since Murray last lifted a major, and Johanna Konta and Cameron Norrie have both reached the Wimbledon semifinals, but Draper ‚Äî the world No. Just as Murray succeeded four-time semifinalist Tim Henman in 2005, Draper, who will be seeded No. 4 when Wimbledon starts June 30, is about to step into a national sporting psychodrama like few others. Murray's 2013 win, which ended a 77-year drought in men's singles, took over the national consciousness. For a player who stands at 6ft 4ins (193cm) with a swinging leftie serve, good variety, and easy power, Draper's Wimbledon results are yet to inspire. Last year, a second-round match against Norrie looked set to be his coronation. Other than winning a Grand Slam, delivering at Wimbledon is the last big question Draper has to answer. Raised in Surrey and educated at the private Reed's School (like Henman), he fits the mould of a British tennis star: polished, well-spoken, even an IMG model and face of Burberry. Compared to Murray, who always felt a bit of an outsider to the tennis establishment, Draper could be straight out of central casting. At Queen's, he called the crowd ‚Äúmy people‚Äù and joked about playing on the renamed Andy Murray Arena: ‚ÄúCan't get rid of this guy.‚Äù I feel happy,‚Äù he said of the potential pressure after that defeat. Draper also referenced his vomiting on court in the past, including during September's U.S. Open defeat to world No. Consulting a breathing coach has helped Draper stay calm in big matches, and he added that the upset in New York was caused by painkillers unsettling his stomach. Henman, who carried British hopes for almost a decade, downplays the supposed burden. Both men have said that these pressurized situations are the fun part of tennis. ‚ÄúYou're doing that to play in the biggest events. Murray echoed the sentiment during his famous on-court interview after a 2012 final loss to Roger Federer: ‚ÄúEverybody always talks about the pressure of playing at Wimbledon, how tough it is ‚Ä¶ The people watching make it so much easier to play ‚Äî they make it incredible.‚Äù Konta, who reached the semifinals in 2017, said in a news conference then that ‚Äúpressure is self-imposed.‚Äù She also credited the crowd with helping her to a memorable quarterfinal win over Simona Halep. Norrie described how ‚Äúhuge‚Äù the crowd were during his 2022 run in an interview last week, while former world No. 38 Heather Watson said in a news conference earlier this month that her near-upset of Serena Williams in the 2015 third round gave her goosebumps. Even Williams said she'd never seen a crowd like it. Greg Rusedski, who reached the quarterfinals in 1997, said that the support is invaluable when things are going well, but that when a player is struggling, ‚Äúthere couldn't be a worse situation.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you don't then it can have the reverse effect, because they'll go from a high to a lull quite quickly. Draper believes he can find that way, having played against Australians and Frenchmen at their home Grand Slams this year. In some of those wins, especially against the mercurial Ga√´l Monfils in Paris, he has shown how to work a stadium, asking for noise even from adversarial crowds. While he won't necessarily tap Henman and Murray up for advice, he remembers them always saying that the pressure at Wimbledon was outweighed by the home support Thriving in the Wimbledon atmosphere as a British player is a singular challenge, but Draper spoke at Queen's of it being a ‚Äúprivilege,‚Äù not a burden.
