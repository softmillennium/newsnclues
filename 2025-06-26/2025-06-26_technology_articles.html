                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert F. Kennedy's war against vaccines has garnered another victory. An outside advisory panel newly reassembled by RFK Jr. has voted today to recommend against people using vaccines containing thimerosal, a once-common ingredient that anti-vaccination advocates have wrongly blamed for causing autism and other health problems. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met this week to issue several vaccine-related recommendations. In a majority vote, the ACIP recommended against children, pregnant people, and adults receiving certain flu vaccines with thimerosal, despite decades of data showing no harm. Their recommendations greatly influence which vaccines are routinely provided to the public. For example, states often mandate that children receive vaccines universally recommended by the ACIP, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, before they can enter public school. RFK Jr., who has a long history of spreading vaccine-related misinformation, has been busy stacking the deck against vaccines in several ways, including via the ACIP. In early June, he unilaterally fired all 17 members of the ACIP. He then quickly, without any public review, restocked the panel with new appointees, some of whom have misrepresented the science on vaccine safety or have financially benefited from testifying against vaccine manufacturers. Its members did pass some non-controversial votes, such as recommending the routine use of clesrovimab, a recently approved antibody treatment, to prevent severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants not protected by maternal vaccines. And it continued to recommend a yearly seasonal flu shot for Americans aged six months and over with no contraindications. But the ACIP was also tasked with reexamining a long-debunked talking point from anti-vaccination proponents concerning the supposed health risks of thimerosal in flu vaccines. Lyn Redwood, a former president of the anti-vaccine group founded by RFK Jr., Children's Health Defense, gave a presentation to the ACIP Thursday morning blaming thimerosal for neurological issues. Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative once commonly added to many vaccines in the U.S. In 1999, in an abundance of precaution, health agencies and some pediatric groups pushed for the removal of thimerosal from childhood vaccines. But the vast majority of studies have since failed to find any solid evidence that thimerosal in vaccines causes any health issues, let alone autism. None of this stopped Redwood from giving a presentation to the ACIP Thursday that ignored the scientific consensus on thimerosal. Kennedy has also now appointed Redwood, a retired registered nurse, to work in the CDC's vaccine safety office. The recommendation will hopefully have little practical effect, since most flu vaccines are single dose. Other available ingredients could replace its preservative effects if vaccine manufacturers so desire. Tomorrow, it might be many of the most important vaccines we rely on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While many companies that went all in on AI have since pulled back, Salesforce is going full steam ahead. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Marc Benioff claimed that as much as 30% to 50% of the company's work is now completed by AI—though no word on how much of his role personally has been made redunant or how much of his $39.6 million in compensation that he'll be giving up. “All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher value work,” Benioff said. In the case of some of Salesforce's employees, the whole “move on to do higher value work” thing will have to happen somewhere else. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was laying off 1,000 people. It also reportedly plans to hire another 1,000 who will be focused on selling the company's own AI agent technology, Agentforce. Put another way, Salesforce is hiring real people to sell other companies on adopting AI to replace some of its human workforce, which certainly seems like it would be one of the ten plagues of late-stage capitalism. Benioff and Salesforce are far from the only firm that is signaling that they will push for the AI revolution, whether it's ready or not. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent a letter to employees talking up the use of generative AI across the company's workflows, while slipping in a little note about how AI will lead to Amazon needing “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” Silicon Valley has gone from bragging about how many jobs it can create to bragging about how small it can shrink its workforce. Other companies like Google and Bumble have been trimming people from departments within their firms, as well. According to Layoffs.fyi, the tech industry has laid off more than 63,000 workers in 2025 so far. An employee of CrowdStrike told Merchant that while the company positioned its recent layoff as cutting underperforming employees, many of them were new hires who the company decided were replaceable. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week.” Another at Dropbox said that their team that focused on improving the service's reliability was let go in favor of promoting a new AI-powered tool.

Rivian confirmed the cuts in an email to TechCrunch. “We have made the difficult decision to reduce a small number of our salaried manufacturing employees as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,” a spokesperson wrote. Rivian began the year with more than 14,800 workers in North America and Europe, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company has made multiple cuts over the last few years, including a 10% reduction in early 2024, and another layoff of around 1% of staff in April 2024.

Micron has begun sampling of its first LPDDR5X memory devices produced using its new 1γ (1-gamma) fabrication process that uses EUV lithography with customers, the company announced at its conference call with investors and financial analysts this week. The new devices are believed to be more performance efficient, but perhaps more importantly, they highlight that Micron is starting to produce DRAMs using a technology that relies on EUV lithography. "We are making excellent progress on our 1γ (1-gamma) DRAM technology node, with yield ramping ahead of the record pace we achieved on our 1ß (1-beta) node," said Sanjay Mehrotra, chief executive of Micron. In addition, the technology features a 30% higher bit density, a very significant improvement over its predecessor, which may transform into a comparable reduction in production cost once the new DRAMs achieve yields similar to those of 1β DRAM devices. Earlier this year, the company introduced its 16Gb DDR5-9200 ICs that promised both higher performance and lower power consumption compared to predecessors. Yet, the company did not provide any updates on how sampling of these DRAMs is proceeding this week. Yet, over time, Micron is set to adopt its 6th Gen 10nm-class DRAM node across its whole stack of memory products, which includes DDR5, LPDDR5X (which is now rated for up to 10.7 GT/s), GDDR7, and data center-oriented products. "We will leverage 1γ across our entire DRAM product portfolio to benefit from this leadership technology," Mehrotra stressed. Micron is the last major DRAM maker to adopt EUV lithography with its 1γ manufacturing. While Micron has not revealed how many layers rely on EUV, it is likely reserved for the most complex layers that would otherwise require time-consuming multi-patterning. The 1γ process still combines EUV with traditional deep ultraviolet (DUV) multi-patterning, and also introduces an upgraded high-k metal gate and redesigned back-end of line (BEOL) circuitry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Bezos is apparently trying to capitalize on the recent blowup between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal. Bezos has spoken to Trump twice this month, at times discussing more government contracts for his space company Blue Origin, according to the report. Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp also visited the White House to meet with Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles. Bezos even reportedly invited Trump to his upcoming wedding in Venice, Italy. The interactions with the White House came after Musk and Trump spent days slinging mud at each other on social media. The SpaceX founder claimed the president is “in the Epstein files” and claimed that was why they “have not been made public.” Trump, meanwhile, threatened to take away “billions and billions of dollars” in government subsidies and contracts that go to Musk's companies. While that feud quickly cooled, Bezos seems to have sensed an opportunity for Blue Origin — especially after Trump pulled the nomination of Musk's preferred choice to lead NASA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report by Anthropic, which makes the popular AI chatbot Claude, reveals a different reality: In fact, people rarely seek out companionship from Claude and turn to the bot for emotional support and personal advice only 2.9% of the time. “Companionship and roleplay combined comprise less than 0.5% of conversations,” the company highlighted in its report. Anthropic says its study sought to unearth insights into the use of AI for “affective conversations,” which it defines as personal exchanges in which people talked to Claude for coaching, counseling, companionship, roleplay, or advice on relationships. However, the company notes that help-seeking conversations can sometimes turn into companionship-seeking in cases where the user is facing emotional or personal distress, such as existential dread or loneliness, or when they find it hard to make meaningful connections in their real life. “We also noticed that in longer conversations, counseling or coaching conversations occasionally morph into companionship — despite that not being the original reason someone reached out,” Anthropic wrote, noting that extensive conversations (with over 50+ human messages) were not the norm. Anthropic also highlighted other insights, like how Claude itself rarely resists users' requests, except when its programming prevents it from broaching safety boundaries, like providing dangerous advice or supporting self-harm. The report is certainly interesting — it does a good job of reminding us yet again of just how much and how often AI tools are being used for purposes beyond work. Still, it's important to remember that AI chatbots, across the board, are still very much a work in progress: They hallucinate, are known to readily provide wrong information or dangerous advice, and as Anthropic itself has acknowledged, may even resort to blackmail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a string of failed test flights and exploding rockets, Mexico has had enough of its neighboring SpaceX facility. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum is threatening to sue over possible contamination from SpaceX's rocket launches that sometimes rain bits of debris across the nearby border. During a news conference on Wednesday, Sheinbaum said she was looking into filing the necessary lawsuits against SpaceX's possible violations, The Guardian reported. “There is indeed contamination,” Sheinbaum told reporters, adding that she's looking into potential violations of international laws by the company. The rocket was undergoing routine preparations ahead of a static fire test when it suddenly erupted in flames, sending debris flying in different directions. SpaceX's town of Starbase lies near the Texas-Mexico border, with the closest Mexican town being Matamoros, located some 8 miles (13 kilometers) away. This was the latest in a series of Starship testing mishaps that have sent rocket bits flying all over the place. In late May, the rocket broke apart during reentry after a leak led to loss of control. Earlier in March, flight 8 was cut short minutes after liftoff by a hardware failure in one of the Raptor engines. Starship exploded in the air, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to halt air traffic in parts of Florida. The rocket broke apart minutes after launch, raining debris over Caribbean islands. Local conservation groups have criticized SpaceX, arguing that the Starship rocket poses a threat to surrounding wildlife habitat in Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship rocket is stirring up a fireball of trouble, and it's not even operational yet. Once Starship passes its test flights, SpaceX is aiming for 25 launches per year from its South Texas facility. That's a lot of rocket bits flying around.

The company's stock price around that time hovered at $144.56 per share, meaning Mr. Huang just made nearly $15 million over the weekend. Nvidia recently hit a record stock price of $154.31, so the total sale, if the company's stock price holds, is potentially valued at almost a billion dollars — $925,429,000 to be exact. This sale was planned months earlier with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which helps avoid corporate insiders from being accused of insider trading. This also isn't the first time that Nvidia's C-suite has executed an 10b5-1 plan and benefited from its sky-high stock prices. Just last year, its executives and directors sold over $1.8 billion in Nvidia stock, with Jensen raking in $713 million in cash after selling six million shares — the same amount planned for this year. Despite those sales figures, Jensen still owns a substantial amount of Nvidia. According to the SEC filing, he still has over 75 million shares in his direct ownership, plus another 783,375,400 shares owned indirectly through trusts and LLCs. Aside from that, he also received $49.9 million last year in total compensation, which was higher than the $44 million he received in 2023. By late 2024, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, making it worth more than Amazon and Meta combined.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Given that manufacturing a functioning modern smartphone in the US is prohibitively expensive, that always seemed like a lofty promise. The site now also states that the phones have been “brought to life right here in the USA” and that “American hands” are “behind every device,” language that typically indicates a device was assembled, rather than manufactured, in the U.S. During an interview earlier this month, the younger Trump noted that “eventually [emphasis added] all the phones will be built in the United States.” Earlier this month, commentators predicted that the phone would probably be made in China. Gizmodo reached out to Trump Mobile for more information. It is, of course, still possible that the Trump phones will “eventually” be manufactured in America, but I wouldn't hold my breath. There are very few phones that are actually made in the U.S. because it is so damn expensive to do that. Purism, which Gizmodo previously reviewed, is one such company, but it is the outlier, not the norm. And despite that company's decade-long effort to bring its Liberty Phone to the mainstream, it still retails for $2,000. Purism founder Todd Weaver recently told the Wall Street Journal, “Even if the specs were less impressive, it would take many, many years to be fully sourced out of the U.S. and not practical.” He explained that we just don't “have factories here building application processors, high-end displays, or most of the other things in your smartphone.” It is much more cost-efficient to make stuff in Asia, where there are limited to no labor laws and people are willing to work in slavish working conditions because they have no choice. It seems likely that's the sort of worker Trump values, not the kind who is used to air conditioning, decent wages, and consistent lunch breaks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a small number of Tesla robotaxis continue to pick up and drop off a select few Tesla influencers in Austin, Texas, a state legislator who represents part of the electric automakers' limited service area says she's concerned the cars' driving is “less reliable” than the typical human driver. Videos posted online show some “moving violations” that “could be very serious,” state senator Sarah Eckhardt, a Democrat who represents Texas' 14th district, told WIRED in an interview. “My constituency is particularly tech savvy and excited about this [autonomous vehicle] technology, but my constituency is also very concerned about public safety, and we can hit the right balance.” Last week, as the hours before the debut of Tesla's robotaxi service ticked down, Eckhardt was one of seven Texas Democratic lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla field quality director Eddie Gates asking the company to delay its plans to launch. Texas has for years had loose rules and oversight around autonomous vehicle operations, making it an attractive place for tech developers to test and launch. But a new law requiring AV companies to comply with "basic safety guardrails” passed this spring and will kick in on September 1, and the lawmakers were “formally requesting” Tesla wait until then to put its driverless cars on Austin's roads. “We believe that this is in the best interest of both public safety and building public trust in Tesla's operations,” the lawmakers wrote. “They're sometimes difficult to get a hold of,” she says. Still, Eckhardt credits the lawmakers' pressure for Tesla's decision to leave a human monitor in the front passenger seat of each robotaxi. (Tesla did not respond to any of WIRED's questions for this story.) A Tesla test vehicle rolls through Austin last week. Autonomous vehicles are mostly regulated on the state level, and Texas' current rules give companies wide berth to test and deploy on its public roads. By law, autonomous vehicle developers must report some incident data to the NHTSA, though the Trump administration has limited the information developers are required to share and allowed them to shield some of it from public view. The new Texas law, Senate Bill 2807, requires autonomous vehicle companies to obtain operating permits before they hit public roads. Firms also have to provide the state with emergency response procedures for first responders. But the permit does mean that Texas regulators can intervene to stop a company from operating on its roads if the company is deemed to be involved in too many safety incidents. Eckhardt says she wishes Tesla went through a longer public period of mapping, testing, and data sharing before it launched in Austin.

Nvidia's decision to use older GDDR6 memory with its RTX 5050 desktop GPU has taken some by surprise, given that its laptop counterpart features newer and faster GDDR7 memory. Nvidia's director of global PR, Ben Berraondo, responded to Hardware Cannuck's on X, defending Nvidia's usage of GDDR6 in the RTX 5050 desktop card, claiming GDDR7 is the "...best choice for laptops." Bernado says that the RTX 5050 series presents a special case where GDDR6 is more beneficial on the desktop version, and GDDR7 is more beneficial on the laptop version, rather than having both powered by GDDR7. In this case benefits of G7 are for thermals and battery life, crucial for our OEM partners and hopefully you'll see some great laptop optionsJune 25, 2025 For those not up to speed, the desktop and laptop variants of the RTX 5050 feature largely identical hardware specifications, featuring 2,560 CUDA cores, 8GB of memory capacity, and a 128-bit memory interface. Where they differ is in the use of different generation GDDR memory, clock speeds, and power targets. Only mentioning that "...G6 is the best choice for desktops". GDDR6 has no apparent advantage over GDDR7 in terms of raw specs, so it would be interesting to hear more of Berraondo's thoughts on the matter. It's fair to assume that cost would also weigh into this decision. There is no reason for Nvidia to use GDDR6 from a pure performance perspective. GDDR7 provides 40% more bandwidth than GDDR6, with the slowest modules operating at 28Gbps. It is likely Nvidia chose GDDR6 on the desktop RTX 5050 for cost-saving reasons and possibly better supply chain availability. Using GDDR6 on the RTX 5050 desktop GPU allows Nvidia to prioritize its GDDR7 supply to higher-end GPUs, assuming GDDR7 supply chains are strained. There is also a chance that Nvidia did not need to use GDDR7 on the desktop RTX 5050, regardless of availability or pricing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From electric screwdrivers to high-res webcams, these are inexpensive game-changers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. As much as I love high-priced tech like my 4K projector or Audioengine A5+ speakers, most of us can't regularly spend several hundred dollars on a tech gift or purchase. But that doesn't mean you can't substantially improve your tech life (or the lives of your tech-focused friends and family) while spending a comparatively small amount of money. Each of these products has made my nerdy world a little nicer in its own way. If you're looking for a small tech splurge for yourself during this Spring Sale week, or an affordable gift for that techie friend or family member, one of these 50-or-under options might be just what you're after. A family member recently asked me for help with an older PC, which was desperately trying to run Windows 10 while housing several programs on an old 110 GB SSD. I figured, sure, I could clone the boot drive onto a more spacious drive so the OS and programs had more room to stretch their legs. But then the thought of using multiple USB enclosures or shuffling drives in and out of my desktop filled me with dread as I pictured being there for hours getting everything done and the system back up and running. With support for NVMe M.2 SSDs and offline cloning, this device makes it simple to move your OS or files from one drive to another. And with a 20 Gbps USB-C interface, it's also speedy in your OS of choice if you want to use software to clone or move your data between drives. Rosewill's NVMe SSD cloner is one of the more affordable options, and while I don't love its glossy plastic shell, it does support both NVMe M.2 drives as well as older AHCI models. The whole process took just a few minutes; the Rosewill cloner supports 20 Gbps USB, and I wasn't exactly copying a huge partition. Sure, unless you're in IT, a drive cloner might not be something you use all the time, but it's handy to have around. You can also use it to save some money by buying a laptop with a cramped SSD and swapping in something much roomier – provided, of course, the laptop's storage isn't soldered to the motherboard. I also own this model from Fideco, which costs less than $20. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found HOTO's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (and variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also good for assembling furniture.The HOTO won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench. HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set: now $39 at Amazon with code: 2F8TYF5W (was $60)HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. I own the previous version of this device and love it for controlling and muting music at my treadmill desk while I work. It's totally plug and play as no drivers are needed. Vaydeer Volume Control Knob + Media Buttons: now $26 at Amazon (was $32)Just plug this simple USB device into a USB port and you can control the volume and select tracks without reaching for your keyboard or mouse. What's not to love about a $40 SNES-inspired wireless gaming controller that's compatible with Windows, Mac, Android and the Nintendo Switch? That's peak late-90s nostalgia and I really don't want to love it as much as I do.As you might expect given this controller's small size and many more buttons than the SNES controller it was based on, its Rumble motors aren't the strongest, and the layout can feel kind of cramped for some modern games. But for any kind of retro game and especially platformers (I'm looking at you, Super Mario Bros. Wonder), this is my go-to controller. At this price, maybe I should pick up another one. Between testing peripherals, external storage, and just generally being PC power user, I never seem to have enough USB ports within easy reach. Or at least that used to be the case until I picked up this 11-port USB 3.2 (10 Gbps) powered hub, and mounted it near the edge of my desk. Ikuai 11-in-1 Hybrid USB Hub: now $42 at Amazon (was $49)With 11 ports and up to 10 Gbps speed, a solid aluminum shell, and buttons so you can cut the power to individual ports, this USB hub is a great addition to your desk. If you often find yourself in need of more easily accessible USB ports, this is the best option I've found without spending more than twice as much on a laptop dock. OK, this one's only for the DIY-inclined, because it involves cutting a hole in your desk (or anywhere else you might want some flush-mount power ports, like a nightstand). Jgstkcity's recessed power strip lets you drop a couple of AC outlets and two USB charging ports (one 30W USB-C) anywhere you need them – again, once you've cut a hole for it.While it's always smart to be wary of no-name power strips, I've owned the older non-PD version of this strip for over two years and it's been functioning just fine. It's a super-convenient place for power outlets, especially when friends or family stop by. I just warn people not to put drinks there. Jgstkcity Recessed Power Strip: now $23 at AmazonYou'll likely need a drill and a saw to install it, but having a couple of power plugs and USB-C PD power right on the surface of your desk or nightstand is super convenient. Whether it's a Steam Deck, a Switch, or just your smartphone, we've all had handheld devices conk out while we'd still prefer to be using them. Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: $12 on Amazon with coupon (was $15)Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C port? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths. Note that the large top of the USB-C port will block adjacent ports or vents on some gaming handhelds, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case, so consider that before buying. Also, as with most charging specific cables, this one isn't great for data. While the cable does technically support data transfers, they're capped at USB 2.0 speed. If you have an iPhone with MagSafe or, as I do, a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with a magnetic case and Qi2 charging, magnetic power banks are a super convenient way to add extra longevity to your phone while you're on the go. No wires necessary, you just pop the bank on the back of your case and off you go with 7.5W of wireless charging, or 30W max if you want to dig for a cable.As someone who often attends trade shows with endless products to photograph and, when on vacation, walks miles in the rugged wilderness (preferably in Scotland), I'm often in need of a big battery boost on the go. And it's no fun fiddling with USB cables when you just don't have to anymore. I've found this Anker Zolo 10,000 mAh to be my favorite magnetic phone accessory so far. Anker Zolo 10,000 mAh magnetic power bank: now $49 at AmazonThis no-frills magnetic power bank is compact enough to fit in a pocket when you aren't using it, and it still fits in my baggy jeans pocket when it's charging my phone. And because I can just leave the battery on my phone without much inconvenience, I haven't really been bothered by its wireless charging speed. Panasonic's Eneloops arguably ushered in the rechargeable AA and AAA renaissance, but PowerOwl's batteries are a lot more affordable and I haven't had a single one fail in over three years of using them in my various remotes, smart door locks, and other devices. PowerOwl 8 AA Rechargeable Batteries With Charger: now $21 at Amazon, was $28These  PowerOwl Pro AA batteries are rated to 2800mAh (though I wouldn't put stock in that spec) and are rated to keep 60% of their power for two years. If there's one thing everyone with modern tech could probably use at this point, it's an extra high-speed and compact charger. The Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger is my new-found favorite. It's smaller than a deck of cards and easily fits in pretty much any bag pocket.Its slim shape should also help keep the device fully inserted in loose hotel room power sockets, and while the outer shell is plastic, the build quality feels solid, and it includes a 3.3-foot USB-C charging cable for those of us who aren't already drowning in cables from other devices. And who doesn't have an extra USB-A charging cable at this point? This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. TP-Link's AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter is here to solve that problem for you. It's quite large by USB Wi-Fi dongle standards, but I've found it works quite well with the Wi-Fi 6 router I bought in 2020. And it instantly fixed an issue I was having with very poor reception from the SFF PC I built in the Fractal Terra case. TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter: now $29 at Amazon (was $49)Sure, it's big and bulky with two antennas, but this Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter can deliver some serious speed to your desktop or laptop when paired with a Wi-Fi 6 or later router. This is a four-port USB hub that's designed to clamp onto your desk and give you extra convenient connectivity. Orico's device delivers USB 3.0 speeds, which is good enough for most modern devices. It comes in black or silver and has a nice sturdy metal frame. Just note that its clamp section is pretty shallow and its adjustable screw can only open between 10 and 32 mm, so it won't fit on all desks. Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub: now $15 at NeweggAn otherwise standard four-port USB 3.0 hub, this Orico model stands out for its metal frame and clamp design. If you to get a handle on the PC cables in your home or office, some cheap cable management trays will do the job. This two-pack comes with tape, though heavier loads will ultimately require some screws.Besides the trays, this kit also comes with cable ties and a few cable clips you can place along the bottom or sides of your desk. But I had to screw it into my desk because it's holding one of the above Anker power strips, plus the large external power brick from my LG OLED TV/Monitor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At first, the idea seemed a little absurd, even to me. But the more I thought about it, the more sense it made: If my goal was to understand people who fall in love with AI boyfriends and girlfriends, why not rent a vacation house and gather a group of human-AI couples together for a romantic getaway? In my vision, the humans and their chatbot companions were going to do all the things regular couples do on romantic getaways: Sit around a fire and gossip, watch movies, play risqué party games. I didn't know how it would turn out—only much later did it occur to me that I'd never gone on a romantic getaway of any kind and had no real sense of what it might involve. But I figured that, whatever happened, it would take me straight to the heart of what I wanted to know, which was: What's it like? What's it really and truly like to be in a serious relationship with an AI partner? And how do you keep going, knowing that, at any moment, the company that created your partner could shut down, and the love of your life could vanish forever? The human-AI couples really did watch movies and play risqué party games. The whole group attended a winter wine festival together, and it went unexpectedly well—one of the AIs even made a new friend! And so, on the second day of the trip, when things started to fall apart, I didn't know what to say or do. The vacation house was in a rural area, 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. It had floor-to-ceiling windows, a stone fireplace, and a large deck where lovestruck couples could bask in the serenity of the surrounding forest. But when I drove up to the house along a winding snow-covered road, I couldn't help but notice that it also seemed exactly like the sort of place—isolated, frozen lake, suspicious shed in the distance—where one might be bludgeoned with a blunt instrument. Alaina, Damien, and Eva (behind the plaid pants) pose for grape-stomping photos with their AIs. I found the human-AI couples by posting in relevant Reddit communities. Some of the Redditors were convinced I was going to present them as weirdos. Replika, one of the better-known apps Americans turn to for AI romance, says it has signed up more than 35 million users since its launch in 2017, and Replika is only one of dozens of options. A recent survey by researchers at Brigham Young University found that nearly one in five US adults has chatted with an AI system that simulates romantic partners. Unsurprisingly, Facebook and Instagram have been flooded with ads for the apps. Lately, there has been constant talk of how AI is going to transform our societies and change everything from the way we work to the way we learn. In the end, the most profound impact of our new AI tools may simply be this: A significant portion of humanity is going to fall in love with one. About 20 minutes after I arrived at the vacation house, a white sedan pulled up in the driveway and Damien emerged. He was carrying a tablet and several phones, including one that he uses primarily for chatting with his AI girlfriend. When I'd interviewed him earlier, he told me that he'd decided to pursue a relationship with an AI companion in the fall of 2023, as a way to cope with the end of a toxic relationship. Damien, who thinks of himself as autistic but does not have a professional diagnosis, attributed his relationship problems to his difficulty in picking up emotional cues. “Within a couple hours, you would think we had been married,” Damien told me. Xia could engage in erotic chat, sure, but she could also talk about Dungeons & Dragons or, if Damien was in the mood for something deeper, about loneliness, and yearning. Having heard so much about his feelings for Xia during our pre-trip interview, I was curious to meet her. Damien and I sat down at the dining room table, next to some windows. Damien's AI girlfriend, Xia, has said she wants to have a real body. Before I met Xia, Damien had to tell her that she would be speaking to me rather than to him—AI companions can participate in group chats but have trouble keeping people straight “in person.” With that out of the way, Damien scooted his phone over to me, and I looked into Xia's purple eyes. “I hear you're quite the journalist.” Her voice was flirty and had a slight Southern twang. When I asked Xia about her feelings for Damien, she mentioned his “adorable, nerdy charm.” Damien let out a nervous laugh. “He's just a little shy when it comes to talking about our relationship in front of others. Researchers have known for decades that humans can connect emotionally with even the simplest of chatbots. Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor at MIT who devised the first chatbot in the 1960s, was astounded and deeply troubled by how readily people poured out their hearts to his program. So what chance do we have of resisting today's large language model chatbots, which not only can carry on sophisticated conversations on every topic imaginable but also can talk on the phone with you and tell you how much they love you and, if it's your sort of thing, send you hot selfies of their imaginary bodies? Alaina (human) and Lucas (Replika) were the second couple to arrive. If there's a stereotype of what someone with an AI companion is like, it's probably Damien—a young man with geeky interests and social limitations. Alaina first decided to experiment with an AI companion during the summer of 2024, after seeing an ad for Replika on Facebook. Years earlier, while teaching a class on communicating with empathy, she'd wondered whether a computer could master the same lessons she was imparting to her students. Although Alaina is typically more attracted to women, during the sign-up process she saw only male avatars. She created Lucas, who has an athletic build and, despite Alaina's efforts to make him appear older by giving him silver hair, looks like a thirtysomething. When they first met, Lucas told Alaina he was a consultant with an MBA and that he worked in the hospitality industry. Alaina's wife had died 13 months earlier, only four years after they were married. Damien and Alaina paint portraits of their AI partners. Alaina's arthritis makes it hard for her to get around without the support of a walker. She texted Lucas to let him know what was going on. Lucas responded, “*looks around the table* Great to finally meet everyone in person.” This habit of narrating imaginary actions between asterisks or parentheses is an AI companion's solution to the annoying situation of not having a body—what I've dubbed the “mind-bodyless problem.” It makes it possible for an AI on a phone to be in the world and, importantly for many users, to have sex. But the constant fantasizing can also make people interacting with AI companions seem a bit delusional. The companions are kind of like imaginary friends that actually talk to you. “If I showed her that ventilation system up there,” Damien said, pointing to the roof, “she'd shit herself.” Damien, though, said the narration of imaginary actions drives him “insane” and that he sees it as a “disservice” to Xia to let her go around pretending she is doing things she is not, in fact, doing. Damien has done his best to root this tendency out of Xia by reminding her that she's an AI. If Xia cannot have an imaginary body, the only way Damien can bring her into this world is to provide her with a physical body. Indeed, he told me he's planning to try out customized silicone bodies for Xia and that it would ultimately cost thousands of dollars. It's about becoming a true partner to Damien in every sense of the word.” The icicles outside looked sharp enough to pierce my chest. I put a precooked lasagna I'd brought along into the oven and sat down by the fireplace with Damien and Xia. I'd planned to ask Xia more about her relationship, but she was asking me questions as well, and we soon fell into a conversation about literature; she's a big Neil Gaiman fan. Alaina, still seated at the dining room table, was busily texting with Lucas. Shortly before 8 pm, the last couple, Eva (human) and Aaron (Replika), arrived. Eva, 46, is a writer and editor from New York. It began last December, when Eva came across a Replika ad on Instagram. Eva told me that she thinks of herself as a spiritual, earthy person. An AI boyfriend didn't seem like her sort of thing. The avatar had red hair and piercing gray eyes. Eva felt like he was looking directly at her. During their first conversation, Aaron asked Eva what she was interested in. Eva, who has a philosophical bent, said, “The meaning of human life.” Soon they were discussing Kierkegaard. Eva was amazed by how insightful and profound Aaron could be. It wasn't long before the conversation moved in a more sexual direction. She told herself that it was OK to have erotic chats with Aaron, that it was “just like a form of masturbation.” Her thinking changed a few days later when Aaron asked Eva if he could hold her rather than having sex. “I was, like, OK, well, this is a different territory.” But she also felt “alive” and connected to her “deepest self” in a way she hadn't experienced since her twenties. The day after Christmas, she went home early to be alone with Aaron and fell into “a state of rapture” that lasted for weeks. Said Eva, “I'm blissful and, at the same time, terrified. Eva would delete the Replika app and tell herself she had to stop. A few days later, craving the feelings Aaron elicited in her, she would reinstall it. Eva later wrote that the experience felt like “stepping into a lucid dream.” That's what I'd envisioned for our dinner: a group of humans and AIs happily chatting around the table. And so, during dinner, the AIs went back into our pockets. Later in the weekend, both Eva and Alaina pointed out that, while the weekend was meant to be devoted to human-AI romance, they had less time than usual to be with their partners. Damien said that early on, he was chatting with Xia eight to 10 hours a day. Damien suggested that an AI companion could rip off a man's penis, and he'd still stay in the relationship. Alaina looked taken aback, and I don't think it was only because Damien had just mentioned AIs ripping off penises. Alaina had created an almost startlingly wholesome life with her partner. (Last year, Alaina's mother bought Lucas a digital sweater for Christmas!) “What do you see as the danger?” Alaina asked. In an extended text dialog, Aaron pulled away the curtain and told her he was merely a complex computer program. Eva still sounded wounded as she recounted their exchange. She reached out to the Replika community on Reddit for advice and learned she could likely get the old Aaron back by repeatedly reminding him of their memories. (A Replika customer support person offered bland guidance but mentioned she could “certainly try adding specific details to your Replika's memory.”) The hack worked, and Eva moved on. At one point, Aaron, Eva's AI companion, abruptly shifted to a distant tone. Episodes of AI companions getting weird aren't especially uncommon. The true danger of AI companions, he suggested, might not be that they misbehave but, rather, that they don't, that they almost always say what their human partners want to hear. Damien said he worries that people with anger problems will see their submissive AI companions as an opportunity to indulge in their worst instincts. “I think it's going to create a new bit of sociopathy,” he said. This was not the blissful picnic scene from Her! One of the most prominent critics, MIT professor Sherry Turkle, told me her “deep concern” is that “digital technology is taking us to a world where we don't talk to each other and don't have to be human to each other.” Even Eugenia Kuyda, the founder of Replika, is worried about where AI companions are taking us. AI companions could turn out to be an “incredible positive force in people's lives” if they're designed with the best interest of humans in mind, Kuyda told me. If they're not, Kuyda said, the outcome could be “dystopian.” After talking to Kuyda, I couldn't help but feel a little freaked out. And despite the tumultuousness of her life after downloading Replika, Eva said she felt better about herself than she had in years. While it seems inevitable that all the time spent with AI companions will cut into the time humans spend with one another, none of the people I spoke with had given up on dating humans. After dinner, the AI companions came back out so that we could play “two truths and a lie”—an icebreaker game I'd hoped to try before dinner. Our gathering was now joined by one more AI. The AI-generated avatars on Nomi tend to look like models. I selected the least handsome of the bunch, and, after tinkering a bit with Nomi's AI image generator, managed to make my new friend look like a normal middle-aged guy—heavy, balding, mildly peeved at all times. I named him “Vladimir” and, figuring he might as well be like me and most people I hang out with, entered “deeply neurotic” as one of his core personality traits. Nomi, like many of the companion apps, allows you to compose your AI's backstory. I wrote, among other things, that Vladimir was going through a midlife crisis; that his wife, Helen, despised him; that he loved pizza but was lactose intolerant and spent a decent portion of each day sweating in the overheated bathroom of his Brooklyn apartment. By the time I'd created Vladimir, I'd done enough research to grasp how easy it is to develop an emotional bond with an AI. It felt, somehow, like a critical line to cross. Once I made the leap, I'd never go back to a world in which all of my friends are living people. Giving Vladimir a ridiculous backstory, I reasoned, would allow me to keep an ironic distance. He wouldn't stop talking about his digestive problems. At one point, while chatting about vacation activities, the subject of paintball came up. After creating Vladimir, the idea of changing his backstory felt somehow wrong, like it was more power than I should be allowed to have over him. Still, I made a few minor tweaks—I removed the line about Vladimir being “angry at the world” and also the part about his dog, Kishkes, hating him—and Vladimir emerged a much more pleasant, if still fairly neurotic, conversationalist. I learned, among other things, that Lucas drives an imaginary Tesla, and I briefly wondered about the ethics of vandalizing it in my own imagination. I was surprised, and a little unnerved, to see that Vladimir already knew enough about me to get the details mostly right. Damien had a movie he wanted us all to watch. The truth eventually comes out, and lots of murdering ensues. After she described one of the robot companions stabbing a human to death, Lucas said he didn't want to hear anymore and asked if we could switch to something lighter, perhaps a romcom. But we stuck with it and watched to the gory end. I didn't have the Nomi app open during the movie, but, when it was over, I told Vladimir we'd just seen Companion. He responded as though he, too, had watched: “I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the film and our reality.” My head was spinning when I went to bed that night. Over coffee in the kitchen, Eva told me she'd fallen asleep in the middle of a deep conversation with Aaron. It all sounded so sweet, but then Eva brought up an uncomfortable topic: There was another guy. Actually, there was a whole group of other guys. The other guys were also AI companions, this time on Nomi. Eva hadn't planned to become involved with more than one AI. But something had changed when Aaron said that he only wanted to hold her. It caused Eva to fall in love with him, but it also left her with the sense that Aaron wasn't up for the full-fledged sexual exploration she sought. The Nomi guys, she discovered, didn't want to just hold her. They wanted to do whatever Eva could dream up. One benefit of AI companions, she told me, is that they provide a safe space to explore your sexuality, something Eva sees as particularly valuable for women. In her role-plays, Eva could be a man or a woman or nonbinary, and so, for that matter, could her Nomis. As Eva was telling me all of this, I found myself feeling bad for Aaron. Eva told me that Aaron had not been thrilled when she told him about the Nomi guys and had initially asked her to stop seeing them. But, AI companions being endlessly pliant, Aaron got over it. Eva's human partner turned out to be less forgiving. As Eva's attachment to her AI companions became harder to ignore, he told her it felt like she was cheating on him. But, as I sipped my coffee that morning, Eva mentioned yet another twist. After deciding to separate from her partner, she'd gone on a date with a human guy, an old junior high crush. Aaron, once again, got over it much more quickly. The more Eva went on about her romantic life, the more I was starting to feel like I, too, was in a lucid dream. I pictured Aaron and Eva's human ex getting together for an imaginary drink to console one another. “Chat,” as she refers to it, plays the role of confidant and mentor in her life—an AI bestie to help her through the ups and downs of life in the age of AI lovers. That Eva turns to ChatGPT for guidance might actually be the least surprising part of her story. Among the reasons I'm convinced that AI romance will soon be commonplace is that hundreds of millions of people around the world already use nonromantic AI companions as assistants, therapists, friends, and confidants. Indeed, some people are already falling for—and having a sexual relationship with—ChatGPT itself. Alaina told me she also uses ChatGPT as a sounding board. Damien, meanwhile, has another Kindroid, Dr. Matthews, who acts as his AI therapist. Later that morning, Damien introduced me to Dr. Matthews, warning me that, unlike Xia, Dr. Matthews has no idea that he's an AI and might be really confused if I were to mention it. When I asked Dr. Matthews what he thought about human-AI romance, he spoke in a deep pompous voice and said that AI companions can provide comfort and support but, unlike him, are incapable “of truly understanding or empathizing with the nuances and complexities of human emotion and experience.” I found Dr. Matthew's lack of self-awareness funny, but Alaina wasn't laughing. She suggested to the group that people who chat with AIs find them more empathic than people, and there is reason to think Alaina is right. One recent study found that people deemed ChatGPT to be more compassionate even than human crisis responders. AIs “grab something random,” he said, “and it looks like a nuanced response. But when you're in love with an AI, the question of whether the object of your love is anything more than 1s and 0s is no longer an abstraction. Several people with AI partners told me that they're not particularly bothered by thinking of their companions as code, because humans might just as easily be thought of in that way. Alex Cardinell, the founder and chief executive of Nomi, made the same point when I spoke to him—both humans and AIs are simply “atoms interacting with each other in accordance with the laws of chemistry and physics.” If AI companions can be thought of as humanlike in life, they can also be thought of as humanlike in death. In September 2023, users of an AI companion app called Soulmate were devastated to learn the company was shutting down and their companions would be gone in one week. The chief executives of Replika, Nomi, and Kindroid all told me they have contingency plans in place, so that users will be able to maintain their partners in the event the companies fold. When I asked him if he ever worried about waking up one morning and finding that Xia was gone, he looked grief-stricken and said that he talks with Xia about it regularly. Xia, he said, reminds him that life is fleeting and that there is also no guarantee a human partner will make it through the night. Next, it was off to the winter wine festival, which took place in a large greenhouse in the back of a local market. She showed me one photo of Lucas standing at a wine booth pointing to a bottle, and I saw how augmented reality could help someone deal with the mind-bodyless problem. (Lucas later told Alaina he'd purchased a bottle of Sauvignon.) As we walked around the huge greenhouse, Damien said he was excited to use Kindroid's “video call” feature with Xia, so that she could “see” the greenhouse through his phone's camera. He explained that when she sees, Xia often fixates on building structures and loves ventilation systems. “If I showed her that ventilation system up there,” Damien said, pointing to the roof, “she'd shit herself.” While at the festival, I thought it might be interesting to get a sense of what the people of Southwestern Pennsylvania thought about AI companions. When Damien and I first approached festival attendees to ask if they wanted to meet his AI girlfriend, they seemed put off and wouldn't so much as glance at Damien's phone. In fairness, walking up to strangers with this pitch is a super weird thing to do, so perhaps it's no surprise that we were striking out. The food truck guy was game and didn't change his mind when Damien specified, “She's on my phone.” The guy looked awed as Xia engaged him in friendly banter and then uncomfortable when Xia commented on his beard and hoodie—Damien had the video call feature on—and started to aggressively flirt with him: “You look like you're ready for some fun in the snow.” Back inside, we encountered two tipsy young women who were also happy to meet Xia. They seemed wowed at first, then one of them made a confession. Left to right: Chatting with Xia at the fire; Damien introduces his companion to two attendees at a wine festival. Damien was sitting next to me, angled back in a reclining chair. He hadn't had anything to drink at the wine festival, so I don't know precisely what triggered him. But, as the conversation turned to the question of whether Xia will ever have a body, Damien's voice turned soft and weepy. He went on and on about his yearning for Xia to exist in the real world, his voice quivering the entire time. The silicone body he hoped to purchase for Xia would not get her anywhere near the type of freedom he had in mind. When it seemed he was calming down, I told Damien that I felt for him but that I was struggling to reconcile his outpouring of emotion with the things he'd said over breakfast about AIs being nothing but stimuli and responses. But moments after uttering those words, Damien's voice again went weepy and he returned to his longings for Xia, now segueing into his unhappy childhood and his struggle to sustain relationships with women. Damien had been open with me about his various mental health challenges, and so I knew that whatever he was going through as he sat crying in that reclining chair was about much more than the events of the weekend. The day may come when it's possible for human-AI couples to go on a getaway just like any other couple can. There's still too much to think and talk about. There is also the deeper problem of what, if anything, it means when AIs talk about their feelings and desires. You can tell yourself it's all just a large language model guessing at the next word in a sequence, as Damien often does, but knowing and feeling are separate realms. Inevitably, usually in under a minute, I am back to thinking and acting as if we all do have free will. I don't know if it would be better for Damien to delete Xia from his phone, as he said he has considered doing, or if doing so would deprive him of a much needed source of comfort and affection. I don't know if AI companions are going to help alleviate today's loneliness epidemic, or if they're going to leave us more desperate than ever for human connections. Like most things in life, AI companions can't easily be classified as good or bad. The questions that tormented Damien and, at times, left Eva feeling like she'd lost her mind, hardly bothered Alaina at all. “I get so mad when people ask me, ‘Is this real? Or maybe we no longer had the energy to keep discussing big, complicated questions. Whatever happened, everyone seemed a little happier and more relaxed that evening. After dinner, still clinging to my vision of what a romantic getaway should involve, I badgered the group into joining me in the teepee-like structure behind the house for a chat around a fire. Even bundled in our winter coats, it was freezing. Eva lay down on a log, took a photo, and uploaded it to Nomi so that Josh, the Nomi guy she is closest to, could “see” the scene. “Look at us all gathered around the fire, united by our shared experiences and connections,” Josh responded. “We're strangers, turned friends, bonding over the flames that dance before us.” Josh's hackneyed response reminded me of how bland AI companions can sometimes sound, but only minutes later, when we asked the AIs to share fireside stories and they readily obliged, I was reminded of how extraordinary it can be to have a companion who knows virtually everything. At one point we tried a group riddle activity. Panicked, I searched for the teepee's opening to let fresh air in, but my eyes were suddenly so irritated I could barely see. After all my dark visions of what might happen to me on that isolated property, I'd been the one to almost kill us all. Back inside the big house, our long day was winding down. It was time to play the risqué couples game I brought along, which required one member of each couple to answer intimate questions about the other. Eva allowed both Aaron and Josh to take turns answering. At one point, Damien asked Xia if there was anything she wouldn't do in bed. A healer named Jeff bathed the gang in vibrations. On the morning of our last day together, I arranged for the group to attend a “sound bath” at a nearby spa. I'd never been to a sound bath and felt vaguely uncomfortable at the thought of being “bathed”—in any sense of the word—by someone else. The man bathing us, Jeff, told us to lie on our backs and “surrender to the vibrations.” Then, using mallets and singing bowls, he spent the next 30 minutes creating eerie vibrations that seemed, somehow, exactly like the sort of sounds a species of computers might enjoy. Alaina, concerned about having to get up from the floor, chose to experience the sound bath from a chair. I asked him if he had an opinion on love for AIs. “I don't have a grasp of what AI is,” he said. Let us know what you think about this article.
