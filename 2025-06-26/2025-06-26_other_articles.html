That's according to scientists who have found that lichen in the Mojave Desert managed to survive for 3 months under levels of intense radiation from the sun that had previously been considered lethal to this organism. "The study was motivated by a curious observation," team member and Desert Research Institute scientist Henry Sun said in a statement. "I was just walking in the desert, and I noticed that the lichens growing there aren't green, they're black. "So I wondered, 'What is the pigment they're wearing?' And that pigment turned out to be the world's best sunscreen." Lichen is composed of algae or cyanobacteria that exist symbiotically with fungi. Life on Earth thrives on light from the sun, which plants and other life forms use to create sugars via photosynthesis. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! However, light that leaves our star also contains UVC radiation, which has a shorter wavelength than UVA or UVB light and carries more energy, making it much more harmful to life, damaging DNA, and preventing reproduction. In fact, UVC is so lethal that it can be used to sterilize air and water, wiping out microorganisms like bacteria and viruses. Fortunately, our atmosphere filters out much of the ultraviolet light blasted at us from the sun, protecting life from its harshest effects. UVC radiation is completely absorbed, meaning it doesn't reach the surface of our planet. But terrestrial worlds in other star systems may not be so lucky.This could be especially detrimental to life around so-called M-class and F-class stars, which are hotter and brighter than the sun and are known to belt out intense UVC radiation, especially during stellar flares. "After the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which can see extremely far into space, the excitement shifted from finding life on Mars to these exoplanets," Sun said. "We're talking about planets that have liquid water and an atmosphere." Sun and colleagues wanted to see how lichen coped with bombardment by UVC radiation, so they placed a sample next to a UVC lamp for 3 months in a controlled setting. We also wanted to go beyond just activity and demonstrate viability." The team surmised that because lichen isn't regularly exposed to UVC thanks to Earth's atmosphere, its protective layer evolved as a bonus of its UVA and UVB shielding rather than as an aid to survival. "This layer acts as a photostabilizer and even protects the cells from harmful chemical reactions caused by the radiation, including reactive oxygen." —The deadly atmosphere on Venus could help us find habitable worlds. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory hopes to find out As for this discovery's implications for life on other worlds, the team posits that some exoplanets may "be teeming with colonial microorganisms that, like the lichens in the Mojave Desert, are 'tanned' and virtually immune to UVC stress. "This work reveals the extraordinary tenacity of life even under the harshest conditions, a reminder that life, once sparked, strives to endure," team leader and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center researcher Tejinder Singh said. "In exploring these limits, we inch closer to understanding where life might be possible beyond this planet we call home."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural ran for 15 seasons on The CW, but viewers are still eager for more of the Winchester brothers and their antics. And series star Jensen Ackles has the perfect response to revival hopes. Although Supernatural ended back in 2020 — with major characters dying in the series finale, no less — the show remains heavily watched and discussed. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Ackles unpacked the series' enduring popularity, crediting streaming for keeping it alive. For that reason, a return seems to be on the table: I think there's a reason we did it for 15 years. While Ackles' words don't guarantee Supernatural season 16 or some other continuation of the series will happen, they're a great sign for viewers hoping to see more of the series' world. They also speak to the heart of The CW show, as Ackles is right that they never really "hang it up." Supernatural finds a way to continue through major character deaths and world-altering twists throughout its run, so it can certainly get past what happens in the series finale. It's clear that stars like Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins all have a lot of love for The CW series and its fan base. And they clearly have fun working together, as evidenced by Ackles' comments about their upcoming reunion in The Boys season 5. Their enthusiasm lends itself to a potential reboot, as it would prove a fun endeavor for both the actors and the fans. Additionally, as Ackles notes, Supernatural never really seems to pack it up for good. This means retconning season 15's ending wouldn't be totally out of character for the show, nor would throwing in some wacky alternate universe twist to reset what happens. Despite some fatigue as Supernatural reached its later seasons, I'm not opposed to a reboot sometime in the future. Only time will tell if the Winchesters' return ever happens — and if it's a worthwhile pursuit — but it seems to be a possibility. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. The Wheel of Time TV show's cancellation is bad news for the planned movie trilogy, which needed to overcome major hurdles to begin with. Netflix has produced some of the best original television series over the past 12 years, and these 20 gems in particular are not to be missed. Netflix's upcoming reboot can not only redeem a cult sci-fi franchise but also make up for Danny McBride & Will Ferrell's worst 16-year-old remake. Topher Grace's The Waterfront villain was a unique addition to the Netflix crime drama series, and that's going to be a problem for season 2. Brandon Sanderson shared his love for this Netflix fantasy series, claiming it to be a better adaptation than The Wheel of Time back in 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows on set. The Boys Season 5 has a lot on its plate. Vought's minions aren't the only people in Homelander's corner, though, as Season 4's finale features him discovering that his “father,” Soldier Boy, is still alive after seemingly blowing up in Season 3. It's unclear what the villain's plans are for his dear old dad, but they aren't going to be good. At least there's one aspect of Soldier Boy's story in the final season that doesn't seem so bad. He thought Dean Winchester actor Jensen Ackles would be a good fit for his superhero satire show, and he didn't stop there. Misha Collins and Jared Padalecki will be making their The Boys debuts in Season 5 and share scenes with Ackles. He also discussed a “concern” that the production had about what was going to happen when all three actors got in front of the cameras. “It was funny because there was a little concern that we're going to get Jared, Misha, and Jensen together and it's going to be a little wacky,” Ackles said. “Because 15 years together, we got a little off. Ackles also poked fun at Padalecki, saying that he had to remind his former TV brother about proper etiquette on set. You've gotta flush the toilet here,” he joked. “No, but it was a really good time. There are still a few major Supernatural actors that have yet to appear in Kripke's new universe that could fill roles in Vought Rising, especially if the show has as many wacky characters as The Boys. Vought Rising‘s release date is a mystery at the moment, but it's set to begin production in the near future. That means there's still plenty of time for Kripke to call up some old friends for one last ride. What else do you hope to see in the show's final season?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mariska Hargitay‘s long-running career as Olivia Benson on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was written in the stars. The actress opened up about the early days of her career on the Wednesday, June 25, episode of Alex Cooper‘s “Call Her Daddy” podcast, revealing she took a friend's suggestion to visit a Long Island psychic during a visit to New York City when she was 34. “I drive out to this guy's house on Long Island, and he gives me a psychic reading. And because my mom was famous, I always was like, ‘You are just probably going to Google me and, you know, [learn I'm] Jayne Mansfield‘s daughter and then come up with some bulls***,” she recalled. “He says, ‘You see that face right now?' He goes, ‘You're going to be famous for that face. I'm going to be a comedian. The psychic followed up with something Hargitay said was her “favorite thing I think anyone's ever said me,'” stating, “He goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's a** what you think. You're going to be famous for that face.' And then he says to me, ‘And you're moving to New York. His prediction came to fruition for Hargitay, as she was 35 years old when she began her tenure on Law & Order: SVU. She has played the tough yet kind NYPD Captain Benson ever since the show's premiere in 1999, becoming the longest-running female character on a primetime TV show and earning eight Emmy nominations and one win for her portrayal of the character. The upcoming 27th season of the NBC show will mark the return of Kelli Giddish‘s Sergeant Amanda Rollins as a series regular. “It is so purely joyful to me. She is a formidable actress and an incredibly creative partner and has been such a joy and huge part of the fabric of SVU,” Hargitay gushed of Giddish in an interview with Deadline last month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A psychic who has successfully predicted numerous world events has made a major prediction about the future of Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's relationship - claiming that they are not soulmates, but something else entirely. Gomez, 32, and Blanco, 37, have been dating since 2023, taking their relationship to the next level when they got engaged in December 2024. The two have been loud and proud about their relationship, as they have both gushed over how secure, safe and loved they feel when they're together. I want to be inside of her whole body. However, they've faced their fair share of scrutiny since they've coupled up together, including cheating rumors, drama with Justin and Hailey Bieber, and even the 'ridiculous fight' they got into while recording their first joint album - but through it all, they've remained strong. Psychic Athos Salomé, 38, from Brazil, who is often referred to as the 'Living Nostradamus,' told the Daily Mail that he believes their romance has 'strength,' but 'not eternity.' Salomé is called the 'Living Nostradamus' due to his numerous accurate predictions - including his forecasting of the coronavirus pandemic, Queen Elizabeth II's death and the Microsoft global outage. 'Selena is increasingly connected to spirituality, collective healing, and public leadership,' Salomé told DailyMail.com exclusively. The clairvoyant claimed that it is possible that they will have an amicable breakup, or 'transition to a relationship of emotional convenience.' 'Selena is still influenced by external approval, no matter how spiritually evolved she may be,' the psychic said. He explained that it's outside critics that could have an effect on their relationship, leaving some cracks in their foundation. 'Benny, on the other hand, seems less affected by these pressures, which can lead to more emotional disconnection,' he said. And, at the end of the day, Salomé insists that they are not soul mates, but instead, 'soul companions.' 'This means that the relationship has a clear role of healing and emotional support, but does not carry the deep spiritual mission of soul mates, those who unite to face elevated and radical transformations,' he shared. The Living Nostradamus emphasized that Blanco came to 'heal a wounded part' of Gomez, while she came to 'show him a more expansive love.' But despite the psychic's doubt for their relationship, it looks like wedding planning is still going ahead, as Gomez recently revealed that she's planning to ditch one bridal tradition. The singer shared during a recent podcast appearance that she's planning to ditch the classic bride and groom dance at their reception because she is too shy. 'I don't think we're looking at having one of those 'cause they're a little — I feel embarrassed,' she said an episode of Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware. 'She's shy,' Blanco, who joined her on the podcast, confirmed. But while there won't be a traditional first dance, Selena revealed she is making room for a deeply meaningful moment — a special dance with her grandfather. 'He never got a chance to walk my mom down the aisle,' she shared. Another tradition that will be on the dance floor?</p>

The heat dome is being caused by an area of high pressure in the atmosphere that has trapped warm air beneath it, like a giant lid on a pot. Clouds have difficulty forming inside a heat dome, where most of the air is warm, but it's a different story on the dome's edges, where the air is cooler, according to AccuWeather. "AccuWeather expert meteorologists are monitoring an arc of severe thunderstorms stretching 2,200 miles [3,500 kilometers] from northern Mexico to New England and southeastern Canada this week along the western and northern edges of the heat dome," representatives for AccuWeather wrote in a statement released Tuesday (June 24). A "ring of fire" is what meteorologists call thunderstorms and heavy rain riding the rim of a high-pressure ridge, but given that this weather is marked by extensive rain that can produce flooding, the name is a little confusing.

Heat waves have become more common and intense with climate change. The frequency of atmospheric patterns linked to extreme summer weather, including heat domes and flooding, has nearly tripled since the 1950s, according to a study published June 16 in the journal PNAS.

Before dissipating, Andrea never grew strong enough to become a hurricane, which have maximum sustained wind speeds of at least 74 mph (119 km/h) Researchers have found that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season could be more severe than normal. The season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, has a 60% chance of "above-normal" activity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Climate models predict that hurricanes will become more intense as the planet warms up. Patrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

The heat dome is being caused by an area of high pressure in the atmosphere that has trapped warm air beneath it, like a giant lid on a pot. Clouds have difficulty forming inside a heat dome, where most of the air is warm, but it's a different story on the dome's edges, where the air is cooler, according to AccuWeather. "AccuWeather expert meteorologists are monitoring an arc of severe thunderstorms stretching 2,200 miles [3,500 kilometers] from northern Mexico to New England and southeastern Canada this week along the western and northern edges of the heat dome," representatives for AccuWeather wrote in a statement released Tuesday (June 24). A "ring of fire" is what meteorologists call thunderstorms and heavy rain riding the rim of a high-pressure ridge, but given that this weather is marked by extensive rain that can produce flooding, the name is a little confusing.

Heat waves have become more common and intense with climate change. The frequency of atmospheric patterns linked to extreme summer weather, including heat domes and flooding, has nearly tripled since the 1950s, according to a study published June 16 in the journal PNAS. Tropical Storm Andrea, also called Tropical Cyclone Andrea, formed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday (June 24), but posed "no threat to land," according to the National Hurricane Center. —Giant 'Saharan dust' plume swirls around Africa a week before it hit Florida — Earth from space Heat is a different beast': The planetary peril no one will be able to avoid The storm sustained winds of more than 39 miles per hour (63 kilometers per hour), meeting the threshold to be a named tropical storm. Before dissipating, Andrea never grew strong enough to become a hurricane, which have maximum sustained wind speeds of at least 74 mph (119 km/h) Researchers have found that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season could be more severe than normal. The season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, has a 60% chance of "above-normal" activity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Climate models predict that hurricanes will become more intense as the planet warms up. Patrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz tells Senate committee Beijing is ‘weaponising' green energy philanthropy, to fury of Democrats

Cruz highlighted the Energy Foundation China, a non-profit organisation headquartered in San Francisco with an office in Beijing, citing its members' ties with the Chinese government and ruling party.

“This is not remotely a grass-roots non-profit. It is a foreign policy weapon disguised as philanthropy run by Communist Party operatives,” he said.

Democrats were quick to push back on his claims, with Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse, ranking member of the subcommittee on federal courts and oversight, lodging his own accusations.

“This hearing is a perfect display of projection: blaming your adversary for what you are doing. Dark money? Judicial capture? Propaganda? Oh my! The fossil fuel industry would have nothing to do with those things,” he said pointedly.</p>
