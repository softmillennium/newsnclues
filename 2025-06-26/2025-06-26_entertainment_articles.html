CBS, ABC, CNN and National Geographic Among Top Winners at 2025 News Emmys The Academy faced widespread criticism for not issuing an immediate public condemnation of his treatment and later apologized.

If all 2025 invitees decide to join the organization, the total membership, including emeritus members, will number 11,120, of which 10,143 would be voting members. “We are thrilled to invite this esteemed class of artists, technologists and professionals to join the Academy,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and outgoing president Janet Yang said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On June 26, 1925, eager moviegoers and Hollywood insiders filed into Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles, California to watch Charlie Chaplin‘s latest silent picture, The Gold Rush. Similarly, when the film premiered in England, BBC Radio captured a 10-minute-long recording of uninterrupted audience laughter and broadcasted it across the country. In the century since its premiere, the film has taken on new lives through various edits, restorations, and re-releases, which have taken the work around the globe, and even transformed it from a silent picture into a “talkie.” Across its many iterations, though, The Gold Rush remains a cinematic touchstone for the same reasons Chaplin reached audiences a century ago: His profound humanity and boisterousness celebrate a defiant, resilient human spirit in the face of hardship, one that extends affection, compassion, and admiration to those who are fighting for a better life in the most dire of circumstances. In 1960s Cuba, Chaplin's films were screened through cine móvils as part of the revolution's efforts towards arts education and literacy. In the 1990s, the silent comedy served as inspiration for West African filmmaker Idrissa Ouédraogo, who made Obi, a film that looks at gold diggers in his home nation of Burkina Faso. Released only a few years before the Great Depression, The Gold Rush finds comedic inspiration in unconventional, but timely, sources—namely in real-life accounts of starvation and poverty. The idea came to Chaplin while visiting Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, where he viewed stereographic photographs of prospectors hiking up the Chilkoot Pass across a sea of thick, white snow. Also around this time, Chaplin read a book on the Donner Party. Their harrowing tales of cold and hunger, which led members of the party to eat their own moccasins and eventually turn to cannibalism, inspired two of the film's most memorable scenes: One in which Big Jim (Mack Swain), on the brink of starvation, hallucinates the Tramp as a giant chicken and attempts to shoot him with a double-barreled shotgun, and the other when the prospectors, starved and unable to retrieve food in the middle of a winter storm, boil and eat a leather boot. The filmmaker's position can be accredited to his own upbringing, which began in the slums of Victorian London and was riddled with economic hardship. Its production value and artistry is most apparent in its set design, which used materials such as flour, barbed wire, and hundreds of wooden planks to bring the Alaskan winter to the warm climate of California once Chaplin and his team ceased shooting on location due to unpredictable weather conditions. In 2025, these sets are still enchanting and immersive. What's more, these set pieces spring to life through the superb application of practical effects, which create a sense of delightful cartoonish magic throughout the picture. But of all the visual splendor and comedy present in the film, the image that captivates most is of Black Larsen's (Tom Murray) cabin rocking back and forth on the edge of a cliff after being blown away in a blizzard. The Tramp slips through the door, almost falling to his death in what appears to be a giant valley. Achieved through the use of miniatures, the sequence is everything one still wants from a big-budget blockbuster: exhilarating, awe-inspiring, nerve-wracking, and hilarious. The immortality of The Gold Rush is solidified in its latest restoration by mk2, Roy Export SAS, and La Cineteca di Bologna, which attempts to return the film “a step closer” to its 1925 version, which Chaplin re-edited in 1942, adding voiceover narration, removing original intertitles, and cutting down its length. Those in the audience who had never seen the film before laughed all the way through, just as this critic did, just as the eager moviegoers and Hollywood insiders did in June of 1925, just as millions of people around the world have done for a full century, and just as a new generation will do for decades to come. On its centennial in 2025—an era characterized by political turmoil, climate crisis, social unrest, and unprecedented economic disparity—The Gold Rush still represents cinema's profound ability to capture resilience and to create moments of intercultural, intergenerational connection. As Kiera Chaplin said in Cannes, “Our grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film.” JEZEBELPete Hegseth Would Prefer Reporters 'Wave an American Flag' Than Ask Him Questions Bugonia teaser reveals the unholy union of Yorgos Lanthimos and Ari Aster Spectrum customers will get Hulu and previously axed Disney channels under new deal</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Christopher Rodriguez-Marquette (Barry) has joined Reacher Season 4 opposite Alan Ritchson in a recasting, Deadline has learned. Rodriguez-Marquette will play Jacob Merrick, a small-town policeman. Baruchel had only been announced as joining the cast a couple of weeks ago. Sources said that part of what was notable about the experience for Rodriguez-Marquette is that he was cast the same day the breakdown for the role went out, and was flown out to set within a couple of days. Created by Nick Santora, who also writes, execs produces and serves as showrunner, Reacher is based on the novels by Lee Child. As recently announced, Sydelle Noel, Agnez Mo, Indonesian-French singer Anggun, Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Weisman, Marc Blucas, and Kathleen Robertson will also all be new additions this season. In addition to Santora and Child, Ritchson serves as an executive producer, along with Don Granger, Scott Sullivan, Mick Betancourt, Lisa Kussner, Sam Hill, Amy Pocha & Seth Cohen, and David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Matt Thunell for Skydance. The third season of Reacher debuted in February 2025 and quickly became the most watched returning series ever for Prime Video. Recently recurring on HBO's lauded dark comedy Barry, Rodriguez-Marquette has just wrapped filming a lead role in the horror anthology indie Grind. Other feature credits include I Hate the Man in My Basement, directed by Dustin Cook; Fear, Inc, directed by Vincent Masciale; Chokeslam opposite Amanda Crew; and Broken Horses opposite Vincent D'Onofrio and Anton Yelchin. His TV credits include appearances on Amazon's Mozart in the Jungle, the second season of Black Pill's digital series All Wrong, The Fugitive for Quibi, and Joan of Arcadia for CBS. Rodriguez-Marquette is repped by CESD, Strand Entertainment, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Annie Baker, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and director of 2023's “Janet Planet,” has set her next feature film, again teaming with A24, as an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire. Baker's film is called “Ancient History,” which she wrote and will direct, and A24 has already set Sophia Lillis (“I Am Not Okay With This,” “It”) and Daniel Zolghadri (“Funny Pages,” “Eighth Grade,” “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You”) to star in the film. Plot details are being kept under wraps. “Janet Planet” first premiered at Telluride in 2023, and while the film had a very small specialized box office that did not cross $1 million, it earned Baker two Film Independent Spirit Award nominations for Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay, as well as a Gotham Award nomination for Best Screenplay. The film starred Julianne Nicholson and newcomer Zoe Ziegler as a mother and daughter living in rural Massachusetts. Baker is best known for her play “The Flick” from 2013, which won her a Pulitzer Prize and an Obie Award  for Playwriting. Lillis is represented by CAA, Untitled Entertainment, and Ryan Levine. Zolghadri is represented by UTA and Circle Management + Production. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix has been slowly evolving into what broadcast networks have stood for — offering a broad spectrum of entertainment for everyone. After adding procedurals to its portfolio of original offerings, the global streamer also has been taking a page from the broadcast comedy playbook by building series around stand-ups and their lives and material. Following Shane Gillis' Tires, Michelle Buteau's Survival of the Thickest and Leanne Morgan's upcoming Leanne, Netflix has greenlighted Free Bert, a six-episode scripted comedy series starring, co-created and executive produced by Bert Kreischer, who has done six stand-up specials for the streamer. Fellow actor-comedian Arden Myrin (The Righteous Gemstones) also stars in the series along with newcomers Ava Ryan — who has a big social media footprint with 3.3M followers — and Lilou Lang. Free Bert is co-created and executive produced by Kreischer as well as Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel (Huge in France, The Grinder), who serve as writers, directors and showrunners. In Free Bert, Kreischer — shirtless comedian, party legend, perpetual wildcard — finds himself in uncharted territory when his daughters are accepted to an elite Beverly Hills private school. Myrin will play Bert's wife LeeAnn and the mother of their two daughters who grew up in a trailer park. Also executive producing the series are Kreischer's wife, LeeAnn Kreischer; Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns, and Elise Henderson for Counterpart Studios; as well as Judi Marmel. Stand-up comedians became the broadcast networks' top choice for sitcom subjects in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in such hits as The Cosby Show, Roseanne, Home Improvement, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond. In addition to his specials, Kreischer served as a tailgate correspondent for Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday and has made several special appearances on WWE Raw. Across platforms, Kreischer has amassed 4 billion impressions and 308 million views on YouTube.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, the Supreme Court delivered a decision that could be a death knell for Planned Parenthood health centers across the nation. The Supreme Court's ruling in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic is its latest assault on reproductive health care. (ADF lawyers represented the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services in Medina.) Seven years ago — before Roe v. Wade was overturned, before President Donald Trump was elected again, and before a Republican-controlled Congress was poised to approve the largest-ever cuts to federal funding for Planned Parenthood — South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster sought to kick the organization out of his state's Medicaid network. There are two Planned Parenthood health centers in South Carolina; together they serve an estimated 6,000 patients a year. But back in 2018, McMaster issued an executive order directing South Carolina's Medicaid agency to look for ways to keep Planned Parenthood  — which provides birth control, STI testing, and cancer screenings, in addition to abortion services — from receiving any public money at all. “Taxpayer dollars must not directly or indirectly subsidize abortion providers,” he said at the time. Federal law already bars Medicaid money from going toward abortion care except in the most limited set of circumstances, and abortion is now banned in South Carolina at 6 weeks gestation with very few exceptions, but McMaster continued his crusade — even after court after court ruled against him. “At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson added. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable. Susanna Birdsong, the general counsel and vice president of compliance for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, tells Rolling Stone that prior to this decision, “We won at every stage of the litigation.” Most recently, the Fourth Circuit re-examined the case and reached its original conclusion: that the federal Medicaid act allows patients to choose their provider — any qualified provider — and the state of South Carolina couldn't arbitrarily tell a person like Julie Edwards that she cannot choose an otherwise qualified provider. Scarlett Johansson, Sheryl Crow, Zayn Malik Urge Congress Not to Cut Food-Assistance Programs Mike Johnson Mocks Millions Who Could Lose Medicaid: ‘Do Something Constructive' Now, Birdsong says that Planned Parenthood is “looking at all of our options” — legally and otherwise — “to continue to fight for our patients.” “At a time when health care is already costly and difficult to access, stripping patients of their right to high-quality, affordable health care at the provider of their choosing is a dangerous violation of bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom,” Lopez added, citing Guttmacher data that showed that one in three patients who sought out birth control in 2020 received it from a Planned Parenthood. “Today's decision favors extremists who'd rather let someone die of cancer than let them get a cancer screening at Planned Parenthood,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. Right now, Congress is seeking to replicate South Carolina's ban nationwide, putting politics above patients in making health care decisions.” Scarlett Johansson Responds to Viral Red Carpet Kisses With Jonathan Bailey: ‘We're Friendly People' Sabrina Carpenter Shares Alternate Album Cover ‘Approved by God' for the Meltdown Crowd Laura Loomer Demands Trump Charge Zohran Over Made-Up Terrorism Claim Planned Parenthood has previously estimated that if South Carolina won the case, nearly 200 of their health centers in 24 states across the country would be threatened with closure, with the vast majority — 90 percent — of those closures to occur in states where abortion is legal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Late on June 25, 2026, one of HGTV's most famous personalities — New Kids on the Block member Jonathan Knight — disclosed via Instagram that the network decided not to renew “Farmhouse Fixer” for a fourth season. Currently in Las Vegas for his iconic boy band's residency shows, Knight wrote, “A lot of you have been asking about the future of Farmhouse Fixer. Mentioning his designer Kristina Crestin, who helped him to restore New England homes on the show, Knight continued, “While I'm still processing the reasons that led to their decision, Kristina and I are so grateful for all your support over the past 3 seasons. Several hours before Knight's post, Country Living published an interview with the singer and renovation expert in which he confirmed there were no plans for future episodes of “Farmhouse Fixer,” but he didn't reveal the show had been canceled until his evening social media post. Unfortunately, he and Crestin are not alone in having their series get cut. The day before, on June 24, married couple Egypt Sherrod and Mike Jackson announced that their show, “Married to Real Estate,” had not been renewed for a fourth season.” On June 23, longtime HGTV contractor Izzy Battres informed fans in the comment section of one of his posts that his new series, “Izzy Does It,” was not renewed for a second season. Multiple HGTV stars responded to Knight's post, wishing him well and acknowledging how much they'll miss him and Crestin on the network, including “100 Day Dream Home” star Brian Kleinschmidt, who wrote, “You both will be missed big time! I will always cherish the memories we shared together at Barbie and Hotel Challenge.” Scott McGillivray, whose second season of “Renovation Resort Showdown” premieres on July 22, wrote, “You will be missed my friend! Knight has been a huge part of the HGTV family for the last several years, so fans were in disbelief over his show's cancellation, with over 2,500 commenting within three hours of his post. In addition to starring on “Farmhouse Fixer,” Knight has competed on two seasons of top-rated “Rock the Block,” including the most recent season six — which aired in the spring of 2025 — alongside his brother Jordan Knight, also a member of NKOTB. He has participated in other competition series too, like “100 Day Hotel Challenge,” “Barbie Dream House Challenge,” and his own 2024 spinoff series, “Farmhouse Fixer: Camp Revamp,” in which he began restoring an old New England lakeside resort with his family. “I am devastated,” one fan wrote on his June 25 post. We'll be seeing a lot more of you on our tv screens ❤️” Another fan tweeted, “@hgtv I can't believe you aren't bringing back Farmhouse Fixer, this was a great New England based show and it had a huge fan base. People nowadays don't garden like they used to, but I have a few ideas I'm pitching that will be more farm-based, so we'll see where that goes.”</p>

Photographers captured the Kardashians boarding a water taxi before they met Orlando Bloom and fashion designer Domenico Dolce. At approximately 10 a.m., Oprah Winfrey's G700 touched down in Venice. She was spotted with longtime friend Gayle King, both of whom were boarding a boat near Marco Polo Airport en route to the wedding celebrations. NFL legend Tom Brady arrived shortly after noon, stepping off a charter flight from Miami. Google co-founder Eric Schmidt landed in his Gulfstream G650 at 1:30 p.m., followed by jets owned by James Murdoch and financier John Griffin. So far, details around Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's big day are still under wraps. However, it won't be held at Venice City Hall, which famously hosted George and Amal Clooney's 2014 nuptials. According to the New York Times, Venice's strict rules around marriage rites likely ruled that out. Instead, the couple may say “I do” aboard Bezos's superyacht or on the picturesque private island of San Giorgio Maggiore, if a report in Yahoo News is to be believed. And while there's no confirmation on whether the pair has signed a prenup, experts say it would be a smart move for the billionaire duo, especially since both have children from previous relationships. The lavish affair is being coordinated by Lanza and Baucina — the same planners behind George and Amal Clooney's iconic Venice wedding. Speaking to CNN, they shared that Bezos and Sánchez requested minimal disruption to the city and a strong focus on local support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Did you ever wonder what Tony Stark was like as a kid? The new Disney Jr. series Marvel‘s Iron Man and His Awesome Friends has you covered — and blink-182‘s Mark Hoppus crafted the “Totally Awesome” theme song to go with it, premiering exclusively on Billboard Family below. The theme song — which will be released digitally Friday via Walt Disney Records — introduces the new show's main characters, as Hoppus sings, “It's totally awesome when I'm with my best friends/ It's better than chocolate, it's better than weekends.” Each of the kid heroes (voiced by Mason Blomberg, Kapri Ladd and Aidyn Ahn) has his or her own Iron Suit that lets them fly and gives them “enhanced super-strength.” Other voice actors in the new series include Veep star Tony Hale as Ultron, Saturday Night Live alum Vanessa Bayer as Swarm, and Talon Warburton (son of Seinfeld star Patrick Warburton) as Absorbing Man. As part of Grammy-nominated pop-punk band blink-182, Hoppus has scored three No. 1 albums on the all-genre Billboard 200 over his three-decade career: 2001's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, 2016's California and, the group's most recent project, 2023's One More Time… They also have five No. 1 hits on Billboard‘s Alternative Airplay chart, starting with 1999's “All the Small Things” and most recently spending 20 weeks atop the list with 2023's “One More Time.” Hoppus' theme song follows in the footsteps of fellow alternative radio hitmaker Patrick Stump, lead singer of Fall Out Boy, crafting the theme song and additional music for Marvel's Spidey and His Amazing Friends, which premiered in 2021 on Disney Jr. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of authors, including Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, have lost their lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg's Meta. “On this record Meta has defeated the plaintiffs' half-hearted argument that its copying causes or threatens significant market harm,” U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said in his ruling (via CNBC). But “No matter how transformative LLM training may be, it's hard to imagine that it can be fair use to use copyrighted books to develop a tool to make billions or trillions of dollars while enabling the creation of a potentially endless stream of competing works that could significantly harm the market for those books,” Chhabria wrote (per The Hollywood Reporter). In his ruling, Chhabria also pointed out some flaws in Meta's defense, like the idea that Meta needs to have unfettered, free access to copyrighted text or else the development of LLMs would fall apart—”This is nonsense,” he wrote. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.” And, as should now be clear, this ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta's use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful.” This is the second significant pro-AI ruling this week, as another judge ruled in favor of AI company Anthropic and against authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace, finding that Anthropic's use of their work was “transformative” and “fair use.” Per THR, Silverman et.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From setting a new record at SoFi to Playboi Carti bringing out Travis Scott, here are the best moments from the first LA stop of his After Hours Til Dawn Tour. The Weeknd has a love-hate relationship with Los Angeles. Five years later, he reflected on simpler, sun-soaked times on “Take Me Back to LA” off of his latest album Hurry Up Tomorrow. But on Wednesday night (June 25), he seemed genuinely happy to be back in the city he's called home for years. During his second of two sold-out shows at the Inglewood, Calif. stadium in September 2022, the Ethiopian-Canadian superstar lost his voice, an incident that made the pop star feel so defeated that he began debating taking a curtain call on the persona fans have come to know and love and inspired his first feature film Hurry Up Tomorrow that was released in theaters earlier this year. Even though he performed two make-up shows in November 2022, one might expect him to experience PTSD stepping back on that stage three years later. Here are the seven best moments from The Weeknd's first SoFi Stadium stop of his After Hours Til Dawn Tour. While The Weeknd has been honoring his Ethiopian heritage by donning a black and gold kaba – a hand-embroidered Ethiopian robe historically worn by royals and traditionally worn at weddings – during his latest live performances, his fans honored him by wearing his old wardrobe. Travis Scott brought out Playboi Carti to perform “FE!N” during his historic headlining show at SoFi Stadium back in November 2023. Almost two years later, the King Vamp returned the favor by surprising his ravenous fanbase with his raging partner in crime. Scott stepped out to “Goosebumps” before the two sent the audience into a frenzy with a delirious performance of “Crush” from Carti's Billboard 200-topping album MUSIC, with Carti's guttural shrieks bouncing off the walls and rapidly flashing strobe lights bouncing off the crowd. They saved “FE!N” for the high-octane finale of Carti's opening set. The Weeknd and his right-hand producer Mike Dean cooked up a number of remarkably seamless transitions for his 2023 co-headlining Coachella set and first legs of his After Hours Til Dawn Tour. And a pitched-up version of the chorus from Metro Boomin's “Creepin,” also featuring 21 Savage, led straight into the pitched-up sample of Jon B and Babyface's 1995 Hot 100 top 10 hit “Someone to Love” that kicks off “Niagara Falls.” Right after revealing his face to fans, The Weeknd took a minute to bask in glory in the same spot he once felt defeated. We gotta make sure night one is the best night out of four nights though, right?” He later commemorated the momentous occasion by tweaking the second verse on his and Anitta's “São Paulo”: “Hit it from the back, she louder than four sold-out nights at SoFi.” Following his opening stint, Baby Boi hopped back on stage to perform their Hot 100 No. Carti took a page out of The Weeknd's playbook by interspersing some (Auto-Tuned) melodic runs as well as his signature “schyeah” ad-lib throughout both songs, and the joint performance reminded 00XO fans that outsiders can't handle the both of them at the top. That same week, Carti became the first rapper to notch more than 30 Hot 100 hits in a single week and the third artist ever, after Morgan Wallen and Taylor Swift.
