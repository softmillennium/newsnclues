                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norris: 'The team handled everything very well' after Canada crash With James Vowles extending his stay as Team Principal of Williams, Alex Albon believes that this is a positive sign for the squad. Alex Albon has hailed James Vowles' new contract with Williams as a “great vote of confidence for all of us”, with the Thai driver praising the Team Principal for being a “good leader”. Albon went on to praise Vowles' leadership skills as he reflected on how the Briton has most greatly impacted the team since his arrival. “He tells us the direction and we follow.” Upon joining Williams in 2023, Vowles set his focus on transforming the team's fortunes – and things definitely look to have improved in recent times, with the 2025 campaign marking the outfit's strongest start to a season since 2016. Pushed on whether there might be the chance for a podium during this campaign, Albon said: “We have a better chance than previous years, if the time ever comes to get a podium. “I don't think we can get a podium on pure pace, but it does feel like the podium chances often happen to the top midfield team of that weekend, and we're in that position quite often. “To be honest, Canada should have suited us too and it looked like it was, we just fell a bit short come Saturday and Sunday,” the 29-year-old conceded. I think this weekend does suit our car, Silverstone more so, but we're seeing now the other teams with their upgrades – they're definitely catching up.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norris: 'The team handled everything very well' after Canada crash For F1 The Movie, Brad Pitt lived the high-speed life of a Formula 1 driver. He drove with seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton. He spent years shooting scenes at racetracks around the world. The result is what he calls “the most visceral feeling you will get in a race car of anything put on film” – F1 The Movie, in cinemas on June 25 internationally and June 27 in North America. In the latest episode of Beyond The Grid, Pitt tells host Tom Clarkson about making the movie, the “adrenaline” he felt driving on spectacular Formula 1 circuits, what he learned from his time with Hamilton and how getting close to F1 cars and drivers took his breath away. Plus, he reveals the true F1 stories which inspired the character of Sonny Hayes, describes the feeling of driving a real Formula 1 car, and hints at his hopes for a sequel.
