                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seventeen people were injured – four of whom remain in critical condition – in a knife attack at Hamburg's Central Station, the city's fire department told CNN Friday evening. German police said they have arrested a 39-year-old German woman, who they believe acted alone, after a major police operation. Six people were “badly injured,” while seven others were “lightly injured,” the fire department said. Dozens of emergency services were active on the scene. Police previously said that several people have sustained “life-threatening injuries” in the attack, but reliable figures on the number of injured people were not immediately available. Investigations into the incident are ongoing. Police told CNN that officers are not currently assuming any political motivation, but were looking into whether the suspect had been in a state of mental distress. Following the attack, Germany's Friedrich Merz thanked the city's emergency responders for their assistance and said that his “thoughts are with the victims and their families,” according to federal government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius. Hamburg's Central Station is the busiest passenger railway station in Germany, with more than 550,000 travelers per day, according to the city's website. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Polish fighter jets intercepted a Russian Su-24 bomber in international airspace over the Baltic Sea on May 22, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said during a press conference on May 23, according to the Polish news outlet RMF24. Russian aircraft often fly from Kaliningrad without using transponders, failing to file flight plans, and not establishing contact with regional air traffic control — a pattern that NATO officials have long described as high-risk behavior. "We are resistant to provocations, but we react appropriately, individually and collectively," Kosiniak-Kamysz said, referring to NATO's air policing measures. The intercepted aircraft, a Soviet-designed Su-24 bomber, is capable of carrying guided bombs and precision missiles and was developed for low-level penetration missions. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has scrambled fighter jets multiple times in response to missile and drone attacks near its border. On several occasions, Russian projectiles have briefly entered Polish airspace, prompting strong protests from Warsaw and increased NATO monitoring in the region. Moscow blamed a navigational failure, though Polish officials have dismissed similar explanations in the past as implausible. Poland, which shares a border with Ukraine and hosts significant NATO infrastructure, has warned that Russian aerial provocations could trigger escalation if not contained. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>King Charles, centre left, and Queen Camilla leave after visiting the Canada House Trafalgar Square in London on May 20, 2025.Arthur Edwards/The Associated Press Now, as King Charles makes his first visit to Canada as monarch next week, his popularity is soaring and the monarchy has found new relevance in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's talk of annexation. '” said Justin Vovk a historian at McMaster University. Dr. Vovk said Prime Minister Mark Carney's decision to invite King Charles –officially extending the invite in March, not long after he took office – was shrewd. “It's an ace up the sleeve for him to be able to say to Trump: ‘This person, this institution that you love and respect and admire is at the heart of our institution, the heart of our identity as Canadians, as a sovereign country. The two-day trip to Ottawa comes at an opportune time for King Charles, who has struggled to win over the public and form an identity separate from his mother, who reigned for 70 years. Several Commonwealth governments were also voicing discontent at having the King as head of state. Barbados became a republic in 2021 and last year the Jamaican government introduced legislation to follow suit. During a trip to Australia last October King Charles faced awkward questions about republicanism and there have been calls from a number of Commonwealth leaders in the Caribbean for reparations to address the Crown's role in the slave trade. His age, 76, and cancer treatments have also forced him to cut back on public events and travel, further eroding his presence on the world stage. Mr. Trump's return to the White House has given King Charles a new purpose – a chance to show his mettle in defence of one of his realms and use Mr. Trump's fascination with the Royal Family to pursue diplomatic objectives. While protocol dictates that the King can't comment publicly on political matters, he has managed to send some not-too-subtle signals of support for Canada in recent months. During a recent meeting with Mr. Carney at Buckingham Palace, it was widely noted that the King wore a red tie. He also celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Canadian flag in February by calling it “a symbol of a proud, resilient and compassionate country.” “He's shown his views by various acts of what you might call soft power and he takes his role as King of Canada very seriously”, said Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College London and author of The Monarchy and the Constitution. How do you feel about King Charles's visit to Ottawa? Mr. Carney, as governor of the Bank of England for seven years, earned wide respect for navigating the 2016 Brexit crisis. The Prime Minister's brother Sean Carney, a former investment banker, runs the household of Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales, as Kensington Palace's chief operating officer. King Charles's quiet solidarity seems to be paying off. King Charles's personal approval had also climbed to 40 per cent. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has tapped into Mr. Trump's admiration of royalty to curry favour. When he met Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in February, Mr. Starmer dramatically pulled out a letter from King Charles inviting Mr. Trump for a state visit this fall. He's the first U.S. President to be given that honour twice. The invitation has not gone down well with Mr. Carney, who bluntly told Sky News this month that Mr. Starmer's move rankled Canadians. “To be frank, they weren't impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance,” Mr. Carney said. Nonetheless the state visit will force Charles to carefully weigh his many responsibilities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 76-year-old singer has canceled all concerts owing to condition, which can affect hearing, vision and balance Billy Joel has canceled all upcoming concerts after he was diagnosed with the brain disorder normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), the singer announced on Friday. “Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. The Piano Man singer added: “I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience and thank you for understanding.” Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a condition in which excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain's ventricles, leading to difficulty walking, problems with thinking and reasoning and loss of bladder control. It primarily affects people in their 60s and 70s and is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Joel's canceled dates include 17 stops in North America and the UK. The tour comes nearly two years after he wrapped a record-breaking residency at Madison Square Garden that began in January 2014. The project, directed by Susan Lacy and Jessica Levin, contains footage of unreleased performances as well as archival photographs, “intimate” home movies and exclusive interviews. Joel's team added that the 23-time Grammy winner was “thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The all-Republican commission abandoned a lawsuit accusing PepsiCo of providing Walmart with pricing advantages. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday dismissed a price discrimination lawsuit against the drink and food giant PepsiCo, a move that former FTC Chair Lina Khan, who served under former President Joe Biden, called “disturbing behavior.” The lawsuit, filed only a few days before U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, accused PepsiCo of providing a big box retailer customer, Walmart, with pricing advantages, while increasing prices for competing customers and retailers. “This lawsuit would've protected families from paying higher prices at the grocery store and stopped conduct that squeezes small businesses and communities across America,” Khan wrote on X on Thursday. “This meritless dismissal is a win for monopolists and billionaires,” said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, in a statement on Thursday. Stacy Mitchell, co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which is an advocate for independent businesses, called it “effectively an endorsement of the predatory tactics Walmart uses to crush local grocery sores, create food deserts, and drive up prices.” The agency had sued PepsiCo under the Robinson-Patman Act, a 1936 law intended to prevent price discrimination but has been little used in recent decades. X's owner, billionaire Elon Musk, who has played a core role in the Trump administration, has ongoing lawsuits against both the World Federation of Advertisers and Media Matters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US university scholars and international students: are you considering working or studying elsewhere? The announcement sent shock waves through US universities already reeling from funding cuts and executive efforts to bring them in line with the administration's agenda, but it will also add yet another element of uncertainty for international students after the administration abruptly terminated the legal status of thousands in recent weeks – a move it partially walked back but that has nonetheless disrupted students' education and upended their lives. “International students are not bargaining chips – they are scholars, researchers and contributors to our communities whose presence strengthens US higher education and society,” said Fanta Aw, CEO and executive director of Nafsa, the association of international educators. International student enrollment was already expected to decline for the upcoming academic year in light of recent policies by the Trump administration and bureaucratic hurdles that preceded it. But the latest announcement is certain to further destabilize the plans of students from abroad who were hoping to enroll at US universities this fall. A significant drop in foreign student enrollment will have serious consequences for universities' finances at a time when many are already feeling the pinch. That's far more than the number of US students who pay full tuition, as a vast majority of them receive at least some financial aid. But tens of thousands of international students also attend other institutions, private and public, with New York University, Northeastern University, and Columbia University boasting the largest number of international students – with more than 20,000 each. One in four US startups worth more than $1bn have at least one founder who was an international student, and international students have created or supported more than 378,000 US jobs, according to Nafsa. The administration's attempts to retaliate against universities by targeting international students are “shortsighted” but will have “long-term consequences”, warned Aw, the group's CEO and executive director. This spring, Harvard became a prime target for Trump's retaliation after it sued the administration over its funding cuts – the first, and so far only, university to do so. Last month, the university told admitted foreign students that they could simultaneously accept offers at both Harvard and at universities abroad – something it had never allowed before. In an email, admissions officials cited “recent events here in the United States and at Harvard” and recognized that foreign students may want a “backup plan”. Those only add to pre-existing bureaucratic obstacles, including rising visa denial rates – from 15% a decade ago to 41% last year – and slow visa processing. A full accounting of the impact of Trump's policies won't be possible until the fall, when universities are required to report their matriculation data. But a global survey of universities published earlier this month shows some early signs, including graduate student enrollment that dropped 13% this spring, while a separate analysis of student visas showed a 14% drop in the number of visas issued so far this year. Those trends will only be compounded by billions in funding cuts that have already destabilized research institutions and risk sending talented students elsewhere, analysts warn. “It certainly adds to the stress of a prospective or current international student who, in addition to worrying about immigration policy, has to worry about whether they will have uninterrupted funding if they're doing a PhD,” said Julia Kent, vice-president, best practices and strategic initiatives, at the Council of Graduate Schools, a group promoting graduate education and research. She noted that some foreign students were so anxious about the administration's campaign against foreign students that they feared driving their cars. So far, universities have attempted to mitigate the impact of Trump's policies, discouraging foreign students from traveling abroad during breaks and offering to connect them with immigration attorneys. Chris Glass, a professor of education at Boston College who researches international student trends pointed to a nationwide campaign during the first Trump administration during which universities responded to the Muslim ban by publishing videos telling international students: “You are welcome here.” None of that is happening now. “Obviously universities see the federal government is willing to use extraordinary forms of power, without precedent,” said Glass.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But Project Esther's authors make clear that their war on the Gaza solidarity movement is just a Trojan horse for a far more ambitious project: destroying the American left. At the center of Project Esther's crosshairs are the people and organizations it dubs the “Hamas Support Network,” or HSN, though there's no evidence that the entities it's targeting actually support Hamas, or that they are even organized in any sort of a network. The playbook proposes a slew of recommendations for dismantling this fictional network, including deporting international students, purging pro-Palestine faculty from educational institutions, defunding organizations, increasing criminalization and promoting social ostracization of people that speak out in support of Palestinian rights. There is no “vast network” of funders behind the grassroots uprising for Palestine — unlike Project 2025, which was crafted by 100 conservative organizations and, as DeSmog reported, bankrolled by six billionaire families. By attempting to frame the Gaza solidarity movement as a well-funded and cohesive network, Project Esther clearly aims to implicate any and all organizations on the left — a target that includes, but is not limited to, people and organizations that have spoken out in defense of Palestine. That goal is demonstrated in Project Esther's repeated claim that the so-called HSN is seeking to destroy capitalism, which carries clear echoes of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch hunts of the 1950s. The project goes so far as to ludicrously equate Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto, Soviet agitprop and Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. The proposals offered up by Project Esther can also be traced back to these witch hunts. One of Project Esther's suggested tools for quashing pro-Palestine activism is the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law enacted in 1938 to combat Nazi propaganda, which requires that agents of foreign countries register with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and periodically disclose their political activities, and creates criminal and civil penalties for noncompliance. Although FARA was intended to provide transparency around foreign lobbying, it was coopted for McCarthyist suppression in the ‘50s to paint left activists as agents of communist regimes. In one egregious abuse of power, the DOJ used FARA to prosecute renowned civil rights leader and historian W.E.B. That case was dismissed, but Project Esther is now urging federal leadership to pull from the same playbook, painting leftist activists and groups as “Hamas supporters” to tee up its own weaponization of FARA. And Republicans have already expanded their use of the “foreign agent” rhetoric beyond Hamas: Last month, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) accused The People's Forum, a New York-based community center, and CODEPINK, an antiwar group, of ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and urged the DOJ to investigate the groups for FARA violations. Citing a “pro-Hamas” campus environment, an accompanying letter from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the administration is barring Harvard from enrolling international students. But pointing out Project Esther's hypocrisy does little to undermine its mission, which hinges on equating anti-Zionism with anti-Americanism. Even more concerning than FARA, however, is Project Esther's recommendation that the government use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to prosecute activists. By weaponizing RICO against the pro-Palestine movement, the Trump administration could ensnare people and groups across the left in a massive policing dragnet, attempting to paint everyone from anti-capitalists to Black Lives Matter activists as Hamas supporters. We have already seen RICO weaponized in Georgia against the Defend the Atlanta Forest movement, where Attorney General Chris Carr indicted 61 protesters on flimsy racketeering charges. Prosecutors claimed in legal filings that the fight to stop a massive police training center began during the nationwide protests against George Floyd's murder by police in 2020. Project Esther's authors also invoke George Floyd's name, making clear they perceive all mass mobilizations against injustice as threats: The document claims that the pro-Palestine movement is using Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel as a “George Floyd-style event to spring onto center stage and grab a giant microphone.” Crucially, while Project Esther claims to be about combating antisemitism, no major Jewish organizations participated in its drafting, and the blueprint targets progressive Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. Only one of the four people on the project's leadership task force is Jewish, while two are evangelical Christian Zionists, and the document, notably, does not make any mention of right-wing antisemitism. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said in a statement on Thursday that its staff have completed a “major cleanup” of Social Security records after it was discovered that more than 12 million people aged 120 or older were in the system. But it added that “some complex cases remain, such as individuals with 2+ different birth dates on file,” which “will be investigated in a follow-up effort.” DOGE also provided a portion of a screenshot that showed there were about 3.3 million people aged 120 to 129, 3.9 million aged 130 to 139, 3.5 million listed as age 140 to 149, 1.3 million listed as age 150 to 159, and around 124,000 listed as age 160 to 169, all of whom were marked as deceased in the Social Security system. “The amount of people that were not alive that did not show on the system ... was outstanding. That's because, according to Bisignano, an active Social Security number that is “still alive in the system” presents the “opportunity for fraud.” Established by President Donald Trump in January, DOGE is tasked with finding what officials say are fraud, waste, and abuse. In March, U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander, who is based in Maryland, ruled that DOGE could not access Social Security systems because such a move could run afoul of the federal Privacy Act, also alleging that the task force's mission to root out fraud, waste, and abuse is a “fishing expedition.” She also directed the DOGE team to delete any personally identifiable data that it may have in its possession. “The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. The task force has been effectively led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, a senior adviser to Trump and a special government employee, meaning he has 130 days to complete his work. Musk said in a Tesla earnings call last month that he would be stepping back from his government duties in May to focus on his company.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Tim Hodgson arrives for a meeting of the federal cabinet in West Block on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on May 14.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press Canada's new Natural Resources Minister says the country needs more oil and gas infrastructure to open trade opportunities with overseas markets and shore up energy supplies in Eastern Canada. Tim Hodgson made the remarks at a hotel ballroom in Calgary packed with business and political leaders in the wake of a series of meetings with Western Canadian officials. That included Alberta's Energy Minister Brian Jean and its Affordability and Utilities Minister, Nathan Neudorf, as well as Saskatchewan's Deputy Premier Jim Reiter. Calling himself a pragmatist and a businessman, Mr. Hodgson took aim at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and broader trade friction with the country's largest export market. But we are going to win it,” he said at the event hosted by the Calgary Chamber of Commerce Friday morning. Canada will remain a reliable global supplier of oil and gas for decades to come, Mr. Hodgson said in a nod to fears in the oil patch that the Liberal government of Prime Minister Mark Carney might double down on some policies of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau. Industry executives criticized many of those policies as being anti-oil and gas, and have given Carney's government a laundry list of ways to attract energy capital and boost energy security, from scrapping a cap on emissions to streamlining project reviews. “The real challenge is not whether we produce, but whether we can get the best products to market before someone else does,” he said. Mr. Hodgson, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker who previously sat on boards of Alberta-based companies, stressed his first public appearance in his role was a first step in resetting the relationship between the province and Ottawa. The real question is, ‘How do we get it done?' That means breaking apart barriers and ripping down red tape,” he said. The government has said permitting decisions will be made within two years via a major federal projects office that will offer a single window for permits. The goal is to create an environment for the private sector to see potential gains from investments in such projects, he said. Many attendees from the business and political communities said they were encouraged by Mr. Hodgson's messaging and impressed that Calgary was his first major stop in his role. However, some stressed that the real test will be their ability to develop major projects with fewer regulatory burdens. “There is some repair and trust-building that has to happen given the challenges of the last ten years, I would argue,” Calgary Chamber president Deborah Yedlin told reporters. Although Mr. Hodgson emphasized the need for more infrastructure, he did not mention pipelines during his speech. The Pathways Alliance is a consortium of Canada's six largest oil sands companies, which together have publicly committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands production by 2050.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man charged with killing two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, DC, on Wednesday could face the death penalty, US authorities have said. Sarah Milgrim, 26, and Yaron Lischinsky, 30, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum during a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee on Wednesday. Israeli officials have strongly denounced the attack as a “depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.” Pirro said “it's far too early to say” whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty. And I suspect as we go forward, before we get to the grand jury itself, that there will be more charges added.” Pirro also stated that the case is “death penalty-eligible” and confirmed that the suspect, 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, has been notified he could face capital punishment. The victims, set to become engaged, were among more than 100 attendees at a “Young Diplomats Reception.” The young couple, having just left the reception, were gunned down on a quiet street in downtown Washington. Charging documents reveal graphic details of the attack, including surveillance footage showing Milgrim attempting to crawl away after being shot. An FBI affidavit released Thursday describes the attack as planned, alleging that Rodriguez flew from Chicago to Washington on Tuesday with a handgun in his checked luggage and bought a ticket for the event just three hours before it began. Following the shooting, the suspect reportedly entered the museum and admitted responsibility, saying: “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed.” Federal authorities also said that he shouted “Free Palestine” as he was taken into custody. Israel faces growing international criticism over its Gaza offensive and a prolonged aid blockade that has pushed the enclave to the brink of famine. On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces launched a major ground operation – ‘Gideon's Chariots' – advancing in both northern and southern Gaza. Israel says it has stepped up its offensive to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken during the militant group's October 2023 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 abducted.</p>

Andrey Kondratyev, deputy general director and chief designer at the Russian defense enterprise Kurganpribor, was attacked with a hammer in the city of Kurgan on May 22, the local outlet Oblast 45 reported. According to the Russian Telegram channel Baza, which appears to be close to Russian security forces, Kondratyev was assaulted while entering his residential building after returning from work. He sustained serious head injuries and was hospitalized. The attack is reportedly connected to his professional activities, though the exact motives and circumstances remain under investigation. Kurganpribor, which produces a range of equipment for Russia's defense industry, including components for rocket systems, missiles, and bombs, is under U.S. and EU sanctions in response to Moscow's full-scale war against Ukraine. Previously, Kyiv has targeted Russian officials who play a key role in Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukraine has not been linked to the attack on Kondratyev. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Appointment marks extraordinary turnaround for figure who was relieved of his command and court martialled “Ironic that I will be investigating who should be held accountable for Afghanistan,” Lt Col Scheller, who was handed a senior role at the Pentagon by Donald Trump, said this week. It shows just how much Washington has changed since Mr Trump returned to power. And it marks an extraordinary turnaround for a figure who was relieved of his command and court martialled after posting a video criticising senior officers on the day a blast ripped through American personnel guarding the evacuation from the Afghan capital. “I have been fighting for 17 years,” said Lt Col Scheller, then commander of the advanced infantry training battalion. Last month he announced he had taken up a post at the Pentagon as a senior adviser under Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence. He said his role was to tackle “careerism” in the armed forces and to ensure that people rose through the ranks on merit. And on Wednesday he was named to Mr Hegseth's new investigation. Afghan government forces melted away as their allies left, setting Taliban troops on a helter skelter race to Kabul. They seized the city in August that year, sending thousands of foreigners and Afghan nationals flocking to the airport seeking safe passage out. Tragedy struck when a suicide bomber detonated his deadly payload at one of the main entry points where American troops were protecting civilians. It will also include Jerry Dunleavy, a journalist who resigned from a Republican investigation last year in protest that it had not gone far enough. On message boards used by Marines, it was Lt Col Scheller's name that attracted most attention. “That guy who was popping off about an op he had no connection to and knew nothing about is now an investigator for it?,' said one user of a Reddit forum. Another poster, who claimed to have been trained by him, said: “More than anyone else I interacted with, that man cared about the future of the corps and knew the future [lay] in our subordinates and how we treat them. He won support from some veterans who shared his concerns but angered others who felt he was wrong to make such a public protest while in uniform. He followed up with further social media posts criticising military leaders and called for “revolution”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's move to bar Harvard University from enrolling international students has ricocheted across China, with officials and commentators seeing it through one lens: the growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Some commentators across Chinese social media platforms took a similar tack: “It's fun to watch them destroy their own strength,” read one comment on the X-like platform Weibo that garnered hundreds of likes. “Recruiting international students is … the main way to attract top talent! It's also the latest in a widening rupture between two superpowers. For years, China sent more international students to America than any other country. Those deep educational ties are being reshaped by a growing geopolitical rivalry that has fueled an ongoing trade and tech war. “This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Thursday. Related article Trump administration bars Harvard from enrolling international students The DHS statement included claims of ties between Harvard and Chinese institutions or individuals linked to military-related research, as well as with an entity blacklisted by the Trump administration for alleged human rights violations. It links to information about a letter that bipartisan US lawmakers sent earlier this week to Harvard requesting information about the university's alleged “partnerships with foreign adversaries.” Harvard has not replied to a CNN request for comment on the alleged partnerships. The ability of elite American universities to recruit top students from around the world, many of whom often go on to stay in the United States, has long been seen as a critical factor in America's science and tech prowess, as well as a key source of income for its universities. Among those students is Fangzhou Jiang, 30, a student at Harvard's Kennedy School, who said he couldn't believe it when he heard that his university status was in jeopardy and immediately began to worry if his visa was still valid. I just never anticipated that the administration could go this far,” said Jiang, who is also the founder of an education consulting company helping foreign students gain admission to elite American universities. “Ever since I was young, when it comes to the best universities in the world, from a young age, I learned that it's Harvard,” he said. China was the top source of international students in the US for 15 straight years since 2009, before it was surpassed by India just last year, according to figures from Open Doors, a US Department of State-backed database tracking international student enrollment. Harvard has educated Chinese figures like former Vice Premier Liu He, who played a key role negotiating Trump's phase one trade deal during the American president's first term. But those ties have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as the US began to see an increasingly assertive and powerful China as a technological rival and a threat to its own superpower status. Meanwhile, rising nationalist sentiment and government emphasis on national security in China have led to a shift in perception about the value of American versus Chinese universities. The Department of Homeland Security's claims regarding Harvard's institutional ties to entities and individuals with ties to military-related research are the latest move reflecting deep-seated concern in Washington about Chinese access to sensitive and military-applicable American technology via academia. To crack down on the perceived threat of Chinese students conducting espionage on US soil, Trump introduced a ban during his first term that effectively prevented graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields from Chinese universities believed to be linked to the military from gaining visas to the US. Related article Beijing sees a ‘victory' with the US tariffs truce. His first administration also launched the now defunct China Initiative, a national security program intended to thwart China's intelligence activities in the US, including those aimed at stealing emerging technology from research universities. Trump's broader tightening of US immigration policy during his second term has now unleashed a new wave of insecurity and uncertainty for many students and schools. And for some students at the start of their academic and professional careers, the latest development leaves them unsure about what to do next. Among them is Sophie Wu, a 22-year-old from China's southern tech hub of Shenzhen, who was accepted at a graduate program at Harvard this fall, after finishing her undergraduate degree in the US. “I did not expect that the administration would make such an irrational decision, and I also feel that it is more of a retaliation than a policy decision,” she told CNN. “International students are being held hostage for some political purpose.” CNN's Helen Regan and Joyce Jiang contributed to this report.</p>

Among those characteristics is the value that Japanese culture places on finding harmony between nature and human society, which will feature in the forum amid the divisions and conflicts currently faced by the international community. Leading figures in traditional arts, traditional crafts, fine arts, science and other fields have been invited to speak, providing a variety of perspectives on Japanese culture. Their lectures and discussions will be open to the public and recorded, and the recordings will be made public with multilingual subtitles included. The forum is also expected to cooperate with overseas universities and museums to enable the recordings to be used in classes at those institutions. In the first session on the day, Princess Akiko of Mikasa will give a special lecture titled “The essence of Japanese aesthetics.” In the second session, a discussion will be held with four participants: Masatomo Kawai, a professor emeritus at Keio University; Kazumi Murose, a lacquer artist designated as a living national treasure; Harvard University Prof. Yukio Lippit; and Tokugo Uchida, director of the MOA Museum of Art.

Currently, across the Gaza Strip, only 2,000 hospital beds remain available, for a population of over 2 million people, grossly insufficient to meet the current needs," the report reads. "Continued hostilities and military presence inhibit patients from accessing care, obstruct staff from providing care, and prevent WHO and partners from resupplying hospitals." The organization called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the region, reiterating that "the UN and its partners have a clear, principled and effective plan to deliver aid with safeguards against diversion, a system that has worked and must be enabled to continue." On March 18, Israel broke a ceasefire established in January with massive strikes on the enclave.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elias Rodriguez, who allegedly killed two Israeli embassy workers, made social media posts appearing to show thirst for violence The terror suspect accused of killing two Israeli embassy staff flaunted his support for Hamas online and attended Black Lives Matter protests. Elias Rodriguez, 30, was arrested after allegedly shooting Israeli embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim as they left a reception for diplomats near Washington's Jewish museum on Wednesday. On Thursday, Mr Rodriguez was charged with two counts of first degree murder. According to an FBI affidavit, Mr Rodriguez was captured on security cameras shortly after 9pm on Wednesday walking past the two victims, before turning round and shooting at them while their backs were turned. Mr Rodriguez seemingly reloaded his gun as Ms Milgrim attempted to crawl away and sat up, before shooting at her several times and jogging away, the affidavit continues. In another alarming message published around a week after the assassination attempt of Donald Trump in July last year, Mr Rodriguez shared an image that read: “I agree with the public opinion that says to kill him!” The account's profile picture features an avatar wearing a medical face mask. The FBI said it was investigating social media posts made by Rodriguez. “Make no mistake, this attack was targeted anti-Semitic violence, and it won't be tolerated,” Steven Jensen, assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office said. We're actively investigating to determine both the authorship and the attribution of these writings, if they belong to this subject or not.” Amid the chaos, he is said to have been allowed into the museum by security guards who assumed he was a distraught bystander. Minutes later, when officers arrived, Mr Rodriguez allegedly admitted to carrying out the shooting. From Chicago, the suspected gunman was once linked to the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a far-Left group that regularly posts anti-Israel rhetoric on social media and spearheaded Black Lives Matter protests. Before the killing, he once worked as an oral history researcher at the History Makers, a non-profit that documents the stories of “unsung” African Americans, an online CV shows.Amichai Chikli, Israeli diaspora affairs minister, said the world must hold to account the “irresponsible leaders in the West who give backing” to hatred against Jews and Israelis, “whether through appeasement, double standards, or silence”.Mr Chikli said: “French president Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Canadian prime minister Mark Carney have all, in different ways, emboldened the forces of terror through their failure to draw moral red lines. “This is a horrific crime, and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and by this office. “Let me also say that violence against anyone based on their religion is an act of cowardice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has promised to be helpful in any way possible to facilitate passage of legislation countering the Chinese regime's state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting. Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who co-led the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act (HR 1503), appealed to Rubio for help. “You and I have worked on issues like forced organ harvesting,” Smith said to Rubio, noting that the two had co-chaired the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China to work on human rights issues in China. “[Chinese leader] Xi Jinping is making billions by killing tens of thousands of young people, average age 28 each and every year,” Smith said. While a Florida senator during the last Congress, Rubio had signed on to the Senate version of Smith's Act, which aims to sanction perpetrators of the abuse with a civil fine of up to $250,000 and criminal penalties of up to $1 million and 20 years in prison. The Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act would sanction anyone implicated in the abuse, including members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), by freezing their assets, prohibiting transactions, revoking their visas, and eliminating other immigration benefits. Rubio was outspoken about the issue as a senator. Last July, he led the Falun Gong Protection Act, which aims to deploy sanction tools to protect the principal victim group of forced organ harvesting, practitioners of the persecuted faith group Falun Gong. Smith's bill would require the United States to make an assessment on forced organ harvesting and trafficking in each foreign country. “But nobody does it worse—nobody—than the People's Republic of China,” he said. Smith noted that forced organ harvesting had been going on “far too long,” and without accountability, “it will continue to get worse.” Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a spiritual practice that encourages practitioners to abide by the core principles of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance. In 2019, the China Tribunal in London concluded that the Chinese regime had been forcibly harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience for years “on a substantial scale,” with Falun Gong practitioners being the “principal source” of organs. The law bans health insurance providers from covering organ transplants involving organs sourced from China or any country linked to forced organ harvesting.</p>
