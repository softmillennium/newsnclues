                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural delivered a mini-horror movie every week, but with over 300 episodes, they couldn't all be winners. Many storylines left viewers feeling unengaged, and they would take a break from the show and come back later. Other plot points were so upsetting that fans quit watching and never looked back. From pointless character deaths to uninspired writing, some scenes pushed their audience too far. Even Jensen Ackles felt that the Leviathans had overstayed their welcome by season's end. In its 15-season run, Supernatural introduced some very bizarre concepts and storylines some of which didn't work for the fans. Fourteen years later, fans are still upset about Bobby's death at the hands of Dick Roman. While “Death's Door” is a generally well-liked episode, because it takes a tour through Bobby's memories as he fights to deliver one last message to Sam and Dean, killing Bobby devastated the audience and the Winchesters. Bobby deserved better than turning into a vengeful ghost, and some fans found it unforgivable after the mixed bag that was seasons six and seven. Sam's decision to give up hunting and move on with his life isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the way he did it upset fans. Amelia doesn't make a good first impression when audiences meet her in the season eight premiere. It only went from bad to worse the more screen time she had, but the tipping point for fans was in “Blood Brother,” when she was downright unbearable and the romance between Amelia and Sam felt incredibly forced. Amelia was not the most well-written character on Supernatural, but it didn't help that the actress's performance fell flat. In “Blood Brother,” she calls Sam creepy and accuses him of stalking her, which weirdly turns into a sort of bonding moment that leads to romance. Another nail in Amelia's coffin, cementing her as one of the more hated characters, was that Dean's new relationship was with Benny, a loyal and lovable Southern vampirate. The reluctant prophet Kevin Tran was put through the wringer in seasons seven and eight, and thought he was finally safe when he joined Sam and Dean in the Men of Letters bunkers. Kevin started to serve as their support at home the way Bobby used to, but it was all cut short when Gadreel killed him. Part of Supernatural's success comes from its many great characters, and some standouts unfortunately only appeared for one episode. Sadly, death wouldn't be the end of his troubles. Every subsequent episode with Kevin only made his death in season nine worse. Felicia Day's Charlie was a beloved and fan-favorite character. So when Sam needed help researching how to free Dean from the Mark of Cain, Charlie was eager to do what she could. The Steins could track the book, so it had to be kept in a warded box to protect it. When it came time to translate the book, so Rowena could cast the spell that would remove the Mark of Cain, Castiel used his angelic powers to create a safe space for them to work. The death relied heavily on Charlie making bad decisions and served largely as a plot device to push Dean over the edge, upsetting many fans and causing them to accuse the show of “fridging” Charlie. Sam and Dean finally catch a break when Amara resurrects Mary Winchester for Dean in the finale of season eleven. The boys had their mom back, and Sam could finally develop a relationship with her. While it is completely understandable that there would be some adjustment period coming back from the dead after thirty years, Mary didn't need to break Sam and Dean's hearts in the process. The devastating look on their faces when she says she needs space from the Winchester brothers was enough to make fans turn on her pretty quickly. With so many fan-favorite characters getting ganked after one of the worst seasons of the show, it was a few steps too far for some viewers. Dean Winchester is one of Supernatural's most beloved characters, and there are more than a few reasons that prove why. After bringing a traumatized Gabriel back, the Winchesters had an ally and a way to get to Apocalypse World. Gabriel was done sitting on the sidelines and ready to help Sam and Dean take on Lucifer, or was it Michael? Michael killed Gabriel, and this time it was for real. With his return only a few episodes earlier—right when they were fresh out of Archangel's grace—followed by such an abrupt and ultimately pointless death, fans couldn't help but feel they brought him back for his grace and killed him when they didn't need him anymore. It was laughably bad, but it's worth mentioning that Jensen Ackles and Mark Pellegrino committed and did their best to save the scene. If that wasn't enough to make the viewers' heads spin, Michael and Lucifer grappling while twirling around in circles will finish the job. Michael spiriting away with Dean's body after such a disaster of a scene was the last straw for some fans. There are some other great fantasy shows, old and new, that fans can watch to scratch the Supernatural itch. Mary Winchester may not have been perfect, but she deserved better than an off-screen death to force Jack into the role of a villain. The season fourteen finale was chock-full of drama. Jack was soulless, and Dean wanted to kill him. As Jack knelt in front of Dean, giving him permission to kill him with the special “equalizer” gun, Dean had a change of heart. He couldn't kill Jack and Chuck was pissed. Not everyone was happy with the dramatic character shift. Many viewers didn't like it when Chuck became the bad guy, mercilessly smiting Jack and bringing forth the end of days out of petty frustration. The motivation was a little beneath an ancient and primordial being. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Supernatural's most traditional monsters also have a fair bit of lore that benefits the series and the fans once they learn it. SWAT has come to an end at CBS, but Shemar Moore will return in a newly announced spinoff, which makes very little sense. ABC's TGIF lineup debuted several timeless '90s TV show classics filled with humor, life lessons, nostalgia, and family-friendly entertainment. Andor may be the best Star Wars addition in recent memory, but fans are letting it get to their heads. Universal praise from critics has led to a renewal for the series.</p>

Jamie Foxx attended the 2025 Golden Globe Awards as a nominee for his Netflix comedy special, "Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was . Jamie Foxx is addressing conspiracy theories that Sean "Diddy" Combs played a role in his 2023 hospitalization. In a roundtable discussion with several other comedy stars for The Hollywood Reporter, Foxx spoke about recovering after his nearly fatal stroke. He recalled that while he was in the hospital, he was "heavily sedated" and on multiple painkillers, and in his altered state he got on his phone to see what people were saying about his then-mysterious condition. "So, they ‘Men in Black'-ed me, and I'm f---ed up, and this isn't funny, but I snuck in my phone because I didn't know what the outside world was saying, and I couldn't get my mind around the fact that I had a stroke," Foxx said. [I see things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me.' No, Puffy didn't try to kill me." Jamie Foxx said that despite conspiracy theories, Sean "Diddy" Combs did not try to kill him in 2023. At the time, an unfounded rumor was that Combs had attempted to silence Foxx from sharing any details he might have about the alleged crimes he would go on to be charged with – in September 2024, Combs was arrested on racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking charges. Foxx also joked about rumors that he'd tried to hurt him in his December comedy special. There, he said, "The Internet said Puffy was trying to kill me, that's what the Internet was saying. I know what you thinking, ‘Diddy?' Hell no, I left them parties early. I was out by 9, something don't look right. Sean "Diddy" Combs and Jamie Foxx, pictured in 2017, were friends for years. While Foxx told The Hollywood Reporter that the rumors about Combs weren't true, he did share another rumor that had upset him while he was in the hospital. "When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These b-----a-- motherf---ers are trying to clone me,'" he said. The psychiatrist says, ‘Are you all right?' I saw you trying to get the white motherf---ing Jamie Foxx and it ain't going to happen.' He just calmly goes, ‘I think we're going to lower your dosage.'" Jamie Foxx also joked about Diddy in his Netflix special, "What Had Happened Was . In another part of the conversation, Foxx revealed that a stand-up joke about Oprah Winfrey was one of her best friend Gayle King's favorite things. The "Django Unchained" star explained "I did an Oprah joke" when asked by the outlet about a "combative or hilarious post-joke encounter." Jamie Foxx once made a joke about dating Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King. He said after he won the Oscar for portraying Ray Charles in "Ray," there was a rumor he was dating the media mogul. "When we did ‘Ray,' my management, they're from Oakland, but those mother-----s started talking in English accents, like, 'Well, we've won the Oscar now …'" the 57-year-old joked. He continued, "But I wanted to go back to doing stand-up, and there was this rumor that me and Oprah were dating, and I thought, ‘Well, that's a perfect joke.'" Foxx said a woman who worked on his management team told him: "Don't do a joke.' Gayle King thought the Oprah Winfrey joke was hilarious, Foxx said. The comedian said he went in front of the crowd at Madison Square Garden and told them: "Since I won the Oscar, everybody's saying I'm dating everybody." "So, I'm laying in bed with Oprah," he deadpanned, pantomiming the crowd hissing. Jamie Foxx with Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King in 2007. Comedian Sarah Silverman wondered, "She didn't like it?"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have calculated that the gas giant Jupiter used to be twice as big as it is now, based on the odd orbits of two of its many moons. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The cloud of gas and dust from which the sun and planets formed dissipated around 4.5 billion years ago. At that time, Jupiter was at least twice its current size, and its magnetic field was about 50 times stronger, researchers found. "Our ultimate goal is to understand where we come from, and pinning down the early phases of planet formation is essential to solving the puzzle," study co-author Konstantin Batygin, a planetary scientist at Caltech, said in a statement. "This brings us closer to understanding how not only Jupiter but the entire solar system took shape." But how the giant planet itself formed remains opaque. The paths these moons chart are similar to what they were when they first formed, but the moons have been pulled slightly over time by their larger, volcanically active neighbor Io. Related: 'This has left us scratching our heads': Astronomers stumped by James Webb telescope's latest views of Jupiter When the solar nebula dissipated, marking the end of planet formation, Jupiter's radius would have been between two and 2.5 times its current size to give Amalthea and Thebe their current orbits, the scientists calculated.

"It's astonishing that even after 4.5 billion years, enough clues remain to let us reconstruct Jupiter's physical state at the dawn of its existence," study co-author Fred Adams, an astrophysicist at the University of Michigan, said in the statement. —'This has left us scratching our heads': Astronomers stumped by James Webb telescope's latest views of Jupiter Giant storm may not be the original one discovered 350 years ago The calculations also don't depend on how Jupiter formed — a process that's still not understood in detail — relying instead on directly observable quantities. "What we've established here is a valuable benchmark," Batygin said in the statement. "A point from which we can more confidently reconstruct the evolution of our solar system." Jupiter is currently shrinking by about 2 centimeters per year, according to Caltech. This is due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism — a process by which planets grow smaller as they cool. As Jupiter slowly cools, its internal pressure drops, causing the planet to steadily shrink.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Dire wolves" created by Colossal Biosciences were pegged as "the first animals in history to be brought back from extinction." When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The "de-extinction" company Colossal Biosciences promises to fulfill that dream, at least for extinct animals like woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), dodos (Raphus cucullatus), and Tasmanian tigers (Thylacinus cynocephalus). It has recently been making waves in its quest to de-extinct charismatic fauna. First, it claimed to have developed elephant induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), from which they could "de-extinct" woolly mammoths, then for creating Colossal Woolly Mouse, or the Mammouse, a proof of concept that mammoth-like traits can be engineered into other animals. Most recently, in a choreographed, but botched, reveal, Colossal made an astonishing claim: they had brought back the dire wolf from extinction. "De-extinction is now a reality," it posted to X. To me, this feels like an assault on objective truth in pursuit of profit. Colossal's years-long de-extinction campaign is built on a semantic house of cards and the "illusory truth effect" — where if you repeat something enough times, people will believe it. The common-sense definition of de-extinction is reversing extinction — bringing a species that no longer exists back to life. The company has rebranded it as "deëxtinction" or "functional de-extinction" — describing it as "the process of generating an organism that both resembles and is genetically similar to an extinct species [emphasis added]." It ignores that "similar" is relative given all organisms descend from a common ancestor that lived 4.2 billion years ago; humans are more genetically similar to sponges than bacteria, but swapping genes between humans and sponges doesn't transmutate one into the other. Saying they are with a tweaked definition of de-extinction doesn't make it true. In a subsequent interview with New Scientist, chief scientist at Colossal Beth Shapiro acknowledged that dire wolves haven't been de-extincted, while seemingly claiming Colossal never said they were. Colloquially, they're calling them dire wolves and that makes people angry." They further mislead by simplifying and exploiting a nuanced scientific debate over species concepts; because there is no universally agreed-upon species definition, it gives them license to use an alternative, more convenient one. While evolutionary biologists debate whether species are real biological entities or conceptual abstractions, no definition is based on overall similarity. Much like the meaning of de-extinction, Colossal redefines what it means to be a species. In a remarkable bit of lawfare, Colossal has filed patents that, if accepted as written by the Patent and Trademark Office, would legitimize their definition of de-extinction as a single gene from an extinct species introduced into an extant one. They have also filed for a type of trademark that secures their rights to use the names of the de-extinct "dire wolves," Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi, in board games, toys, video games, trading cards, etc., to protect their "brand identity." Thus, if transgenic grey wolf clones are transmutated into dire wolves because Colossal says they are, and if the government agrees with Colossal's definition, then one mutation could turn living species into monetizable and lucrative extinct ones. Related: 'Closer than people think': Woolly mammoth 'de-extinction' is nearing reality — and we have no idea what happens next The foundations of their house of cards are shoddy and built on disinformation, or, as the philosopher Harry G. Frankfurt might say, bulls**t. Colossal's investors, who I can't imagine care about quiet academic debates over species concepts. Developing these methods will have profound implications for human health and disease when successful. When, and I do believe it is when, not if, they succeed, infertility and genetic disease will be a thing of the past. In fact, 97 percent of species that are added to the endangered list remain there." Burgum declines to note in his post that those 97% of species remain on the list because we have failed to protect their habitats from human encroachment; their populations have not rebounded, therefore, they stay on the list. Who needs to protect endangered species like the red wolves from extinction when we can just introduce one of their extinct genes into a coyote and deëxtinct them? —Most complete Tasmanian tiger genome yet pieced together from 110-year-old pickled head In an era where "alternative facts" reign, Colossal's claim to de-extinction is more than just semantics and nonsensical differences in definitions. It is about market capitalization, at the expense of the foundations of scientific integrity and public trust in science and scientists. Their scripted narrative has polluted the information ecosystem, and like a forever chemical, now that it has been introduced, it will linger on. It's hard to dismantle a multi-year disinformation campaign wielded by a $10 billion biotech Goliath and work toward the de-extinction of truth. What Colossal Biosciences offers us is bulls**t in exchange for objective truth. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Vincent J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When $220,000 worth of platinum went missing from a Pennsylvania glass factory, authorities were stumped. A traveling saleswoman for AT&T, Penny loved her work. [I] had a really good job, drove a really nice car… Life was good.” She had made it out of Bradford, Pennsylvania, a once-booming oil town that had become a blue-collar factory town where everyone knew everyone else's business. Her older sister, Cindy, had stayed in Bradford, though. But now, it seemed, Dale had vanished. Dale Kerstetter, 50, had reported for his shift as a security guard at Corning Glass Works on Saturday, September 12, at 10:30 p.m. After he got off at 7 a.m. the next day, he was supposed to visit his girlfriend, Pamela Mays. The second oldest of Kerstetter's six children, Penny was the one most like him: slight of stature but strong in personality. “What do you mean they can't find him?” Penny asked her sister. Then she got in her car and drove to Bradford. The day before, when Kerstetter had arrived for work at Corning, he had talked with the guard he was replacing, Art Peterson. Peterson left a few minutes later without punching his time card. The next shift worker often punched the previous worker's time card, but Kerstetter did not do so that night. After midnight, he also did not check in every hour as was customary. (The record is unclear about how the check-in process worked at Corning, but Penny maintains someone should have known something was wrong if a guard didn't check in during his shift.) When John Lindquist arrived Sunday morning to replace Kerstetter, he found Kerstetter's uneaten lunch, plant keys, and a newspaper in the cafeteria. A carton of cigarettes and the holster of his .22 caliber gun, but not the gun, were inside, along with a daypack. It was not until Sunday evening that the township police were called. But the dog also alerted in a place Kerstetter would not have usually been, the kiln area where sand and other raw materials were melted at over 1,400°C to make glass rods. While new methods of examining forensic evidence—DNA testing, for example—can be useful for solving cold cases today, Kerstetter's case is different. There is no forensic evidence to reexamine. And the time to get answers from them is running out. AT CORNING, KERSTETTER worked as a journeyman, which means he did whatever was needed: painting offices, operating the machines, performing maintenance jobs. Penny remembers him helping install a new tile floor and washing the windows. They made glass resistors and insulators that control the flow of current between wires in television and radio sets. That was also the year he married his first wife, Nancy. They knew each other from the school bus. Kerstetter left high school early to join the Air Force. Nancy, who was three years younger, had gotten a job at the phone company after she graduated. They dated for six months and then married. Cindy was born and then Penny, whom Kerstetter named after a beloved childhood dog. Kerstetter had been so close to the animal that he refused to leave his room for two days after it died. Nancy stayed home with the children while Kerstetter worked at Corning. At work Kerstetter was known as something of a survivalist, having once sewn up a cut on his own finger. Roland “Skeet” Stoughton used to work nights with Kerstetter. In 1987, when Corning was downsizing and Kerstetter's pay was cut, he added overnight and weekend security shifts. Kerstetter brought his own gun, which fits with the “tough, scrappy little guy” image Peterson Jr. has of Kerstetter from when their families used to go camping together. Penny remembers the door being unlocked when she visited her father during his shift. After her father's disappearance, Cindy thinks people got the idea that Bradford “was a perfect town to commit a crime in because nobody was going to do anything.” At one time Bradford was the perfect place for nefarious activities. Located about 90 miles south of Buffalo, New York, and the Canadian border, Bradford was well-positioned during Prohibition. Local bootleggers sold moonshine, beer, and wine to the city's wealthier residents who were happy to turn a blind eye, explains Sally Ryan Costik, curator of the Bradford Landmark Society and author of the 2011 book on Bradford during that era, Bootleggers, Bullets and Blood. Fights with neighboring bootleggers resulted in around 50 murders in Bradford and two neighboring communities during the Prohibition years from 1920 to 1933. Surrounded by the Allegheny National Forest, Bradford began as a lumber town. After oil was discovered in the late 1800s, Bradford got big, producing more than 630 million barrels of oil from 1871 to 1967. After the oil boom petered out, there were the big factories: Zippo lighters, Case Knives, Dresser Industries, Corning Glass Works. Bradford's population peaked in the 1930s at around 33,000. The 1930s are also when Bradford became known for another disappearance. While on a family picnic, two young girls left their parents briefly to pick flowers. A massive manhunt was launched for 4-year-old Marjorie West. Bloodhounds and soldiers searched a three-mile radius. Aside from her grandmother, Cindy was the only family member who remained in town following Kerstetter's disappearance. (Al had gone to see his mother in Texas after the incident, and Penny had returned to the D.C. In the days and weeks after Kerstetter went missing, everyone's questions were directed at Cindy. “I felt like all eyes were on me,” she says. “Imagine someone you know that doesn't come home,” she says. And how am I supposed to feel? Cindy believes it is easier to get away with things in a place where everyone knows you. In Bradford, she says, “there's all kinds of things people hide.” Nancy has returned to her maiden name, which she does not want used. Aside from Penny, and sometimes Cindy, her children “really don't want to talk about it—especially Al.” In an early media interview, Al suggests, in the wishful way a young man might, that his father could be in Canada or Australia. Private and protective, Cindy doesn't want to discuss her personal life or her life growing up, but she's willing to discuss the incident. She asked that we not use her last name. “Every winter during hunting season, I always hoped that somebody would find something, and they could go back and identify him,” she says. THE MONDAY AFTER Kerstetter disappeared, Patrick Foley sat down at his desk to watch the grainy security footage, a compilation of still images taken every few seconds by three cameras placed at three different angles. In the footage, a masked man comes into view. “Then Dale Kerstetter came back and met this masked person,” he said in an interview with Unsolved Mysteries, which recreated the footage for a 1989 episode. Platinum is a critical material used in glassmaking equipment because of its resistance to high temperatures and corrosion. Typically, raw materials like sand, limestone, and soda ash are melted in a large tank called a kiln. The two cylinders are connected to “down draws,” which make canes, or long, thin rods, which are then cut to make resistors. The cylinders themselves were covered with insulating fire brick. The thief would have had to use a tool of some kind to carve out the U-shaped fire bricks, then a saw to cut away the platinum. When Corning employees were interviewed for Unsolved Mysteries, they suggested the company thought it possible Kerstetter was an accomplice. C. Dale Parry, another personnel manager at the company, told the show that Kerstetter was a “marginal employee” and a “slow worker.” His colleague Foley said, “I think the fact that he did everything in front of the camera was once again just Dale Kerstetter just saying to us ‘Hey, here I am. I'm taking your platinum and there isn't a thing you can do about it. “I think he's looking at the camera saying, ‘Do you guys see this? Is somebody going to come and help me? Prior to the platinum theft, there had only been minor thefts at Corning, explains Bradford Township Police Lieutenant Tim Gigliotti. Employees would take pieces of flooring or a shelf they could use in their homes. This was a much more brazen crime. At 12:51 a.m., the masked man uses a hand truck to drag what looks like a plastic-covered load out of the plant. He is not seen on film again. Although he left high school early, Kerstetter was a lifelong learner, obtaining his GED and taking several college courses. “He wasn't the country bumpkin,” says Penny. Both Penny and her mother mention Kerstetter being ahead of his time. Even though men were not expected to play a large role in child rearing in the 1960s, Nancy remembers her husband questioning why he couldn't get paternity leave when she was pregnant. They also remember family excursions: picking berries, fishing, cooking out. In winter they would drive to a country road where they would cook hamburgers over a fire, drink hot chocolate, and go sledding. He hunted, fished, trapped, and went skydiving (once shattering his ankle so badly, his surgeon used pins to repair it). There are the obvious similarities: They both smoked and liked a bit of excitement. And then there is the part she can't explain. “Just sometimes she might do something that would remind me of something he might do,” Nancy says. Despite the divorce, Nancy and Dale remained close. In the 1980s, Nancy moved to Texas, and was there when she found out Dale had disappeared. “I could see it both ways,” she says. “But the more I think about it, I really think somebody did go in there and do something to him.” From the start, Corning management viewed Kerstetter with suspicion. Patrick Foley, following a tip, told the police to check Kerstetter's discharge papers from the Air Force, implying Kerstetter had been accused of stealing platinum while in the service. (United States Air Force records show Kerstetter was honorably discharged.) Corning did not respond to multiple phone and email requests for comment. “I think they sat outside my apartment a couple times,” she says. When the family first tried to have Kerstetter declared legally dead so they could collect life insurance, Corning objected. A 1990 appeal from an order dismissing the family's petition explains that the company was permitted to intervene to “assert its contention that Kerstetter had been a participant in the theft of the platinum.” According to Corning, there was evidence Kerstetter was experiencing financial difficulties. A September 9, 1987, letter from Mastercard declared his balance of $3,882.88 to be in default. According to his family, he had more than enough in his bank account to pay this off, as well as investments and people he could count on to help him out financially if he needed. Kerstetter was also very close to retirement and collecting his pension. If he helped with the heist, he wouldn't have done it for the money, says Penny. It would have been for the thrill. FENCING THE PLATINUM would have been more than just exciting—it would have required prior planning and connections to a facility that could melt the metal down, making it easier to sell. The platinum was of such high grade that melting it down would have entailed a special machine, says retired Pennsylvania state trooper Max Bizzak. “All the places I contacted had no means or facility to melt that down.” Bizzak, a tall, slim father of three, was called to assist the township police three days after Kerstetter went missing. He remembers being shown the video footage. Aside from the footage, he didn't have a lot to work with. He doesn't remember seeing the daypack or gun holster; the family says they never got an accounting of what happened to those. They also found it strange that there was a daypack at all because Kerstetter never used one. There had been no leads on the masked man. At first Bizzak and the township police, under the leadership of Chief Dave Doyle, worked together chasing down leads. Because the state police had more resources, they eventually took it over. It was Bizzak who contacted Unsolved Mysteries, hoping they might discover something the police had missed. She also became his de facto coordinator during long assignments. Marshals to help investigate the Pagan's Motorcycle Club. At a time before pagers and cell phones, Barb was the one they primarily checked in with. The undercover operation may have been Bizzak's most exciting assignment, but it doesn't haunt him the way Kerstetter's case does. Bizzak was five years away from retirement when he began work on the Kerstetter case. By mid-September, the FBI had been called in to assist. Local law enforcement offices often called the bureau if they needed help with laboratory services or forensic metallurgy services, or in the apprehension of a fugitive. At the time, the FBI was not involved directly in investigating platinum thefts, says FBI Supervisory Special Agent Michael Howard. But among the FBI files on the Kerstetter case is information about a 1960 theft of $152,000 worth of platinum from a Corning plant in Rhode Island. There were at least three more platinum thefts at Corning in the 1970s, two in New York and one in Virginia, and quite a few others at plants owned by different companies. Kerstetter was not the first guard to go missing. A month before the Bradford heist, in Solon, Ohio, a night watchman vanished along with $85,000 worth of platinum. In a newspaper account at the time, private investigator Lee Feathers said he suspected the theft involved insider knowledge. The night watchman had been employed by Brinks Security System. Feathers contacted the Pennsylvania State Police to see if Kerstetter was also employed by Brinks. When Feathers was asked by a reporter where the platinum would be sold, he said it depended on the thieves' contacts, but that it was obvious they would have already had a contact or buyer for it. The FBI attempted to figure out who that buyer might be in the Bradford case, interviewing several scrap-metal dealers, all of whom reported that the only platinum they dealt with was through collecting catalytic converters. However, substantial deposits that can be mined in large quantities are rare, which is one of the reasons platinum is so valuable, explains Ruth Schulte, a mineral commodity specialist for the National Minerals Information Center. This rarity, combined with resistance to wear and tarnish, make platinum well suited for making jewelry as well as investments in the form of coin and bullion. But its ability to withstand chemical and temperature assault, to deform without breaking under different types of stress, and to enable catalytic reactions make it useful in industrial applications, like at Corning. Platinum group metals are also used in the chemical industry to produce fertilizer, explosives, and silicone. In the last 40 years, platinum has primarily been used by the automotive industry in catalytic converters to capture harmful exhaust emissions. Platinum's value also makes it desirable for thieves. Special Agent Howard, who manages the FBI's major theft program, says the trend today is to steal platinum group metals that are already in finished products and not in their raw form. Because thieves now tend to target distributors—which involve interstate shipments—and not refineries, the FBI has taken a more active role in these investigations. Howard believes the pivot from targeting raw materials to finished products—for platinum, mainly catalytic converters—is likely because there is less raw material in circulation. Laundering the stolen items is not difficult. “There are very active laundering markets for precious metals virtually everywhere in the world,” says Howard. He thinks Kerstetter could have participated as part of a theft ring with ties to Mexico, and that perhaps he was killed by accomplices in a hotel in Florida. Doyle has nothing to base this on. “I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of platinum was inside the furnace, but they didn't go do that,” he says. THE SECOND PHONE call Penny Chlebowy received after her father went missing came in March 1992. Penny was pregnant and living in Buffalo, New York. She was at work and took the call in her boss's office. A Pennsylvania state trooper was on the line. A headless, handless body had been found in Florida. The trooper wanted Penny's permission to review Kerstetter's medical records and see if the damage matched her father's ankle injury. When her boss heard the conversation, he was shocked. She was tough because she had to be, but that didn't mean it didn't bother her. “There's not too much more that I could find unsettling than to get a phone call like that,” says Penny. Penny gave the trooper permission to access her father's records. There were other leads over the years. On September 23, just 10 days after Kerstetter was declared missing, a man reported seeing him on West Washington Street in Bradford. As recently as 2020, a woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico, contacted authorities after viewing the Unsolved Mysteries episode because she was convinced Kerstetter was her neighbor. In police interviews, the executive theorized his name was on the note because a Bradford company with which he formerly did business had a grudge against him. He did deal in platinum, but only catalytic converters. The stories are colorful: a doctor who was suspected of trying to kill his wife; an accused killer who was one of three men tried for shooting a man and pushing his truck, with his body inside it, into a large body of water. The accused killer was found innocent and is now deceased, but he used to meet with Kerstetter on Saturday mornings at a local restaurant, according to Doyle. These and other acquaintances of Kerstetter's were interviewed by police and the FBI, then dropped for one reason or another. A few years ago, Penny met with one of her father's friends who was living in Florida at the time Kerstetter went missing. He had come under suspicion when Kerstetter's young son Al told police that his father had seen the man with a suitcase containing a large amount of cash after he had declared bankruptcy. Penny knew about his background and knew her father was a loyal friend; yet after talking to him she decided the police were right to not pursue him. TODAY BRADFORD HAS plenty of churches and brick buildings. Grass grows through cracks in the visitors' parking lot. The office space remains intact, but in serious need of upkeep. The long, carpeted main hallway is dark. Floors inside offices are pocked with puddles below where the ceiling has collapsed and leaked. A sign on the wall thanks people for not smoking. Penny toured the facility a few years ago. She posts on an Unsolved Mysteries message board dedicated to her father's case. That is how she met Heather Graupmann, an Illinois woman who's also behind Lostnfoundblogs.com. Graupmann felt more could be learned from these thefts and listed some of them in the two blogs she wrote about Kerstetter in 2018 and 2019. It was the video footage she mentioned, though, that caught readers' attention. Graupmann asked a film hobbyist named Mike West to clean it up. During the process West discovered what he believes could be a third person, bringing up the possibility there were two intruders. Chief Doyle had retired in 2012, and Gigliotti was then handling the case. Gigliotti is aware of West's work and said the video breakdown was slightly helpful but that West's work doesn't “really clarify anything.” But he worked for them before and after, and interacted with Corning through his father's trucking company, which picked things up at the facility. Gigliotti felt with Kerstetter's friends in “their golden years, somebody might come forward.” “It would take years.” Time is something they don't have. As time passes, says Gigliotti, it becomes “progressively less and less probable we're going to find any body.” A lot of the people who'd remember anything are gone now. Penny tells me how Kerstetter would bring home fresh doughnuts when he got off the night shift. Once, the neighbor's dog jumped on Penny's sister and knocked her over. Both Penny and Nancy remember Kerstetter being a crack shot. Nancy has short gray hair and a gentle manner. The women have long since given up hope Kerstetter is alive. “Anybody that really knew him would tell you that he would never [leave his family],” she says. Kerstetter's former colleague, Skeet Stoughton, is now 87 and battling lymphoma. He would have known about the security camera and would have covered it up instead of looking at it. And finally, Kerstetter wouldn't have left a carton of cigarettes in his truck. “In my opinion, and I'll go to my grave saying that, and I'm getting closer to that, Dale Kerstetter never had one thing to do with stealing that platinum,” says Stoughton. When I reach him by phone, he refers me to his Unsolved Mysteries interview. “I fully believe what I said then, and there's been no reason for me to change my mind since then,” says Foley. A summer rainstorm beats down outside as Bizzak sips coffee on his covered porch, his long legs stretching out in front of him. A week before his 84th birthday, he is neither hunched nor hesitant. Tall and lean, with a head full of white hair, Bizzak is dressed in shorts and a trim athletic shirt. Barb, who is small and quick with a wink, sits against the wall. “She wanted to find out what happened to her father, and I couldn't give her an answer,” he says. “I couldn't even tell her if her father was involved in the theft, or he was a victim. And today, I still can't tell you.” When her husband steps out for a minute, Barb approaches, a large manila envelope in her hand. “Now he can be done,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When most fans think of the scariest Supernatural episode, they probably picture terrifying demons, shape-shifting wendigos, or vengeful spirits lurking in the shadows. After all, the long-running CW series built its legacy on gory creature effects and nightmarish folklore. But for Jensen Ackles, who played Dean Winchester across all 15 seasons, the most disturbing episode had nothing to do with monsters at all. The episode left a lasting impression on Ackles, and it still sticks out in the minds of fans who remember just how grounded - and unsettling - it was. Digging into why this episode freaked him out so much reveals what made “The Benders” so unique, and how it's part of a much larger pattern across the show's history. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly (available via YouTube), Jensen Ackles opened up about the episode of Supernatural that scared him the most - and surprisingly, it wasn't about ghosts, demons, or anything supernatural at all. “The reason that always kind of stuck with me is…because it wasn't a monster,” he said, “it was real people as humans doing very bad things.” There's no creature to blame, just cruelty and depravity in its purest human form. “The Benders,” which aired during Supernatural season 1, follows Sam and Dean as they investigate a case in Minnesota involving mysterious disappearances. These villains - the Benders- are deeply unsettling because they operate without magic or monsters. They're a twisted, murderous family who trap, hunt, and kill strangers for fun, in scenes that evoke movies like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Deliverance. There's no creature to blame, just cruelty and depravity in its purest human form. Dean ends up captured, held in a cage like the Benders' other victims. Meanwhile, Sam teams up with a local sheriff's deputy, Kathleen, whose brother was one of the Benders' earlier victims. What follows is a tense, gripping rescue mission, with minimal reliance on the supernatural. There are no spells to reverse the situation, no demon blades to drive into evil entities - just survival instincts, grit, and the terrifying unpredictability of human nature. Jensen Ackles' pick for the scariest Supernatural episode is revealing. It underscores how even in a show dominated by the paranormal, some of its most unforgettable moments came from very real threats. And that, as Ackles points out, is exactly what makes it so disturbing. These human antagonists reminded viewers that evil doesn't always wear a monstrous face. Take, for instance, the chilling doctor in “Time Is On My Side” from season 3. There's a scientific edge to the horror, but the core of it is a human being playing god with people's lives. It's not ghosts that keep you up after this one - it's the cold calculation of someone who believes their twisted experiments are justified. Another unnerving example comes from “Malleus Maleficarum” in season 3, which introduces a coven of witches. While the witches technically use magic, the real horror isn't their spells - it's how casually they turn on one another and sacrifice innocent lives for petty revenge and social climbing. Their magic amplifies their dark intentions, but the root of the terror is very human: jealousy, betrayal, and a complete lack of empathy. Then there's “Family Remains” from season 4, a deeply uncomfortable episode that, like “The Benders,” seems to be going the classic ghost route - until it isn't. From memory wipes to brutal experiments, the Men of Letters were a reminder that even those fighting on the side of "order" can be deeply unethical. Sometimes, it's born out of trauma, power, obsession, or sheer psychopathy. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Star Trek: Picard season 3 showrunner Terry Matalas recalls what it was like losing season 1 and 2's actors ot make way for the Next Generation cast. If you liked The Witcher, there's an even better fantasy adaptation that can be found on Netflix, and it's much more aligned with its source material. Timothy Olyphant was a part of an excellent Netflix horror-comedy TV show that ended after three seasons, though it deserved much more time. Game of Thrones season 8's King Bran twist is among its most controversial developments, but the series set the stage for it years earlier. AMC didn't always hit the mark when expanding the Breaking Bad universe, and this forgotten prequel set before Better Call Saul proves it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During these military exercises in 1952, various UFO sightings were recorded... but what did those at sea really see? In 1952, just seven years after Victory in Europe Day, NATO forces, comprised of the twelve founding members along with Greece and Turkey, which joined that year, reported observing a series of mysterious flying objects during peacetime military exercises. These UFO sightings were becoming increasingly common in the United States, with newspaper headlines featuring stories from individuals who claimed to have spotted an alien vessel flying above their backyards. More than four sightings were recorded by the US non-profit research organization into UFO sightings, the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), during Exercise Membrance, with news stories from the time detailing that many of the witnesses assumed the objects to be weather balloons. On one occasion, an object that a Danish crew described later to investigators as triangular was spotted flying overhead at incredible speed. This first sighting occurred on September 13, just as the men involved were getting into position to begin the 12 days of military exercises. Another sighting came on September 19 after a British fighter pilot had carried out their planned operation over the North Sea and was on the return to the Topcliffe airfield, in Yorkshire. Whether it was an optical illusion caused by the sun's reflections, soldiers in the group reported seeing a silver flying object above the Meteor jet piloted by one of their own. The next day, a sighting was reported by US military members onboard the USS Franklin D. Rosevelet aircraft carrier. These members captured an image of the UFO, they say, which was described as “silvery” and “spherical.” However, these photos were not made public, writes Hall, while adding that those who did see them described them as “excellent” and that "judging by the size of the object in each successive photo, one could see that it was moving rapidly.” The crew and other military leaders ruled out the possibility of the object being a weather balloon. At least three more sightings would be made during the remainder of Exercise Mainbrace. In the years that followed, what was seen was attributed to the hype of UFO sightings that had just begun to take off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Goatboy here with an armylist from the new Thousand Sons codex, that's all vehicles, no Battleline!. I think there is a very strong vehicle build in here using the new Robots, some Daemon Engines, a mixture of Thousand Sons Monsters, and good ole Psychic Leaders. This might be a good list for any kind of Team event where having an option that can floor things on an open field would be a powerful thing to have. Plus you wouldn't have to paint a ton of Rubricae. Also, your Deadly Demises are on a 5+ if you are within 6” of the Psyker so be ready to lose your Sorcerer if too many tanks explode. You also get some sweet Enhancements that do things like give your infantry-based Psychic Characters Lone Operative if they are within 3” of a Vehicle and even better bonuses to your rituals. As you can tell from the right up above will most likely see a ton of robots, some characters, a few tanks, and maybe a Mutalith or two. Now these might change again before they become official and bonafide. Yup there is no Battleline for the army. The Sorcerer in Terminator armor is there to Deep Strike in and throw a Psychic hit on something if needed to activate some of the armies powers. The three smaller units of Robots is there to get in the way and hopefully let your army do the good work of creating a Castle of crap that is murdering you downfield. The Tzaangor parts are to cover objectives, help give the Daemon Prince Lone Operative, and just give you some action play as needed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jamie Foxx has broken his silence on the conspiracy theory alleging Sean “Diddy” Combs orchestrated the 2023 medical emergency that had him “within an inch of his life.” The “Ray” actor said that while in the hospital, sedated on a cocktail of pain medications, he was able to sneak his phone and find out what the world was saying about him, he told a Hollywood Reporter roundtable Thursday. [I see things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me,'” Foxx, 57, recalled. “No, Puffy didn't try to kill me.” “When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. Even while heavily medicated and still trying to figure out what caused his medical emergency, the Oscar-winning actor didn't miss a beat, using his comedic chops to lighten up the situation. He just calmly goes, ‘I think we're going to lower your dosage,'” Foxx quipped. While the “Django Unchained” star has shot down any conspiracy theory about Combs causing his medical emergency, it's not the first time he's brought it up publicly. Foxx previously addressed the rumors that the disgraced Bad Boy Records founder tried to kill him in his 2024 Netflix stand-up special, “What Had Happened Was.” The beloved comic told the audience that he always was “out by 9” whenever Combs threw a party — sharing that “something [didn't] look right” as the evenings would get later. Combs, who was arrested in September 2024 and is currently on trial for sex trafficking and racketeering, is alleged to have had wild sex performances dubbed “Freak-Offs” at his parties over the years. In his comedy special, Foxx said a brain bleed caused him to have a stroke, which led to his April 2023 hospitalization. He detailed the “medical complication” that nearly killed him and caused him to lose 20 days of memory after a “bad headache,” before waking up in a wheelchair in the hospital, where doctors told him he was “within an inch of his life” when he first arrived. The Grammy winner credited his sister Deidra Dixon with getting him the help he needed, as well as his daughter Anelise for saving his life by keeping him calm as a “spiritual defibrillator.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I'd describe it as a thrilling blend of circus artistry, horror, and live entertainment,” says Yury Belaus, a gymnast and key performer with the Paranormal Cirque crew. “It's an immersive journey filled with spine-chilling acts, captivating performances, and an eerie atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat.” This season will introduce new acts, such as a daring performance atop the "tallest unicycle anyone has ever seen," Yury said. “This show is filled with spooky and surprising moments,” they continued. “From unexpected scares that leap out from the shadows to illusions that defy explanation, each act is designed to keep the viewers on their toes.” Paranormal Cirque will roll back into town for several shows: Anyone ages 17 and younger must be accompanied by an adult or parent. Tickets cost $15-$65, depending on age and proximity to stage. Tickets and more event details on the Eau Claire show dates are available online at paranormalcirque.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural follows Sam and Dean Winchester, two brothers with plenty of unresolved trauma, traveling around the country, saving people, and hunting things. Over fifteen years, the Winchesters overcame numerous obstacles, evolving and growing. Padalecki gave great depth to Sam and showed off his versatility, playing beautiful, tragic scenes as brilliantly as Sam's more comedic ones. Supernatural has always balanced the dark and violent nature of monster hunting with humor. When the Winchester boys are investigating a series of strange occurrences, things get personal. When Crowley died in Supernatural Season 12, Mark Sheppard left the series on not-so-great terms with one or more of the executives. Sam and Dean recount the events leading up to the present, and they both have their own version of what happened. One of the best Sam moments comes in Dean's version. The laughs don't stop there, either, like when Dean depicts Sam hugging a student and telling him that he's "too precious for this world." When they approach the set of Stars Hollow, Sam becomes visibly uncomfortable. "Bad Day at Black Rock" is about a cursed object. A rare and magical rabbit's foot gives its possessor fantastic luck, but once someone loses the foot, their luck turns deadly. Initially, Sam has great luck, winning $15,000 in lotto scratchers and free meals for a year, but when Bela picks his pocket, Sam becomes a clumsy safety hazard. Supernatural introduced several characters in memorable ways that revealed to the audience who they truly are in a single scene. Some of Sam's most hilarious and iconic moments from Supernatural are in "Bad Day at Black Rock." As Dean talks to Bobby about Bela, Sam steps in gum. In an effort to get the gum off his shoe, he began scraping it against an open drain in the street. His shoe comes off and falls into the sewer. When Dean turns around, Sam is hunched over, defeated, and pouting. Jared Paddalecki delivers comedy gold when he says, "I lost my shoe." After Gordon is locked up for killing a few psychics and trying to kill Sam, he breaks out of prison. Gordon tries to kill Sam, but Sam, being the skilled hunter he is, manages to get the upper hand on Gordon, wrapping razor wire around his neck. Sam brutally and justifiably decapitates Gordon in an impressive show of strength. Audiences get to see a darker side of Sam in season three's "Mystery Spot." Sam gets stuck in a time loop where, every day, he has to watch Dean die. After one of the days, Sam thinks he's broken the loop, but he is still unable to prevent Dean's inevitable demise. Sam becomes a badass hunter in the weeks and months that follow, hunting down the trickster with a steely resolve. He didn't even flinch when sewing up his wounds. In the montage, through a series of voicemails from Bobby, it becomes clear that Sam was an incredibly efficient solo hunter. Fueled by anger and determination, viewers got a glimpse at the scary side of Sam. The plan was for Sam to overpower Lucifer and jump back into the cage from which he came, but things didn't go to plan. In one last-ditch effort to save the world, Dean crashes Lucifer and Michael's fight. When Dean looks at the abduction site, a bright white light starts to follow him. Sam humorously remains indifferent to his brother's peril, making jokes about "close encounters" and ordering another beer while Dean runs for his life. One of Supernatural's best episodes is, without a doubt, "The French Mistake." Sam and Dean are sent to an alternate reality where they're actors who only play monster hunters on TV. The meta-episode is pretty perfect from start to finish, but the highlight is Sam and Dean trying to act on camera. From body language to facial expressions to line readings, Jared Padalecki delivered a comedically genius performance, creating one of the best moments for Sam Winchester. During Dean's lines, Sam stands behind his brother, having forgotten how to stand casually. Sam and Dean kidnap Crowley to perform a special exorcism that involves injecting the demon with purified blood. Supernatural is a beloved and long-running series that, unfortunately, still has more than a few problematic episodes that aren't easy to rewatch. The entire sequence of Sam and Crowley is incredible, but the moment Sam tells Dean what he has confessed is heartbreaking and flawless. Sam's greatest regret is letting down his big brother. With tears in his eyes, the audience can hear the pain and guilt in his voice when he tells Dean what it feels like that Dean turned to Castiel and Benny, because Dean felt he couldn't count on Sam. Since the "Pilot" episode of Supernatural, Sam and his father have had a contentious relationship. Their final moments before John Winchester died in the season three premiere were no different. Sam challenged John and didn't play the dutiful son, like his brother. In the 300th episode, Dean uses a wish-granting pearl to give him his heart's desire. John gets to tell his boys how much he loved them, and Sam finally gets closure and can let go of the guilt he'd carried around for years. It was a beautiful and perfect moment for the Winchester clan. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Dean Winchester is one of Supernatural's most beloved characters, and there are more than a few reasons that prove why. Transformers' Rodimus Prime was a controversial G1 character, but a more organic development could have seen him successfully replace Optimus Prime. The coming-of-age drama wants to give Fast & Furious a run for its money. Andor may be the best Star Wars addition in recent memory, but fans are letting it get to their heads. The critically acclaimed Ted Lasso will return for a fourth season on Apple TV+.</p>
