President Donald Trump backed a partnership between United States Steel Corp. and Japan's Nippon Steel Corp., crediting his tariff policies for an investment that would keep the iconic American firm in the US.

While Trump appeared to stop short of endorsing Nippon Steel's proposed $14.1 billion takeover of US Steel, shares of the American steelmaker surged as much as 26%, on apparent optimism over the deal's prospects.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders on Friday to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and speed the deployment of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. Under the new rules, the commission will be forced to decide on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months. But the president also said his administration supports building large plants. "We're going to be doing them also." Nuclear executives joined Trump for the signing ceremony, including Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez. When asked whether NRC reform will result in staff reductions, the White House official said "there will be turnover and changes in roles." "Total reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization" of the agency, the official said. Any reduction in staff at the NRC would come at time when the commission faces a heavy workload. The agency is currently reviewing whether two mothballed nuclear plants, Palisades in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, should restart operations, a historic and unprecedented process. Dominguez said the nuclear industry's biggest problem has been regulatory delay. Constellation is aiming to bring the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island back online in 2028 after it closed for economic reasons. A separate reactor, Unit 2, was the site of a partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979. "We're wasting too much time on permitting and we're answering silly questions, not the important ones," the Constellation CEO said. Trump's orders also create a regulatory framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land, the administration official said. The NRC will not have a direct role, as the departments will use separate authorities under their control to authorize reactor construction for national security purposes, the official said. Trump's actions also aim to speed up reactor testing at the Department of Energy's national laboratories. Investment in nuclear power is growing in the U.S. after a long period of financial turmoil for the industry, including the shutdown of a dozen reactors in recent years as the industry struggled to compete against cheap and abundant natural gas. Building new nuclear plants in the U.S. is notoriously slow and expensive. The two new reactors that recently came online at Plant Vogtle near Augusta, Georgia took seven years longer-than-planned to build, and came in $18 billion over budget. But the computer technology industry is now driving the revival in nuclear as it races to meet growing electricity demand from data centers used to drive artificial intelligence. Three Mile Island is expected to return to service with financial support from Microsoft, for example, and Alphabet and Amazon are investing in small, advanced reactors.

Trump's Higher Ed Fight:

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump is “moving forward” with efforts to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, ratcheting up the government's high-profile clash with one of the nation's wealthiest and most prestigious schools.

Harvard may not be complying with some of the rules that govern institutions with the federal tax benefit, Bessent told Bloomberg Television's David Westin on Friday. “We will see if they are following the rules,” he said. “It looks like there is a substantial number where perhaps they weren't.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US stocks fell ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, with investors reacting to the latest trade war rhetoric from President Donald Trump. Here's where major indexes stood at 3:10 p.m. in New York on Friday: Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday morning that Apple would be subject to a 25% tariff if it did not make iPhones in the US, and "not in India, or anyplace else." Meanwhile, the president said in a separate post that he would recommend a 50% tariff on the European Union starting on June 1. The 10-year Treasury yield was down four basis points to 4.50%, reversing direction after being down as much as nine basis points earlier in the day. The long-dated 30-year bond yield was three basis points lower at 5.03%. "I think as we get closer to the end of this 90-day window for these trade negotiations, the market is really going to start focusing on tariffs more and more," Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told Business Insider. Trump's tariff pause is due to end on July 9. Markets were also assessing new comments from a top Federal Reserve official on the outlook for interest rates. Hickey said that Waller is known to be more dovish, so his comments aren't wholly surprising. He added that bond investors may also be encouraged on Friday by a Supreme Court ruling that insulated Fed Chair Jerome Powell, even as the high court said Trump could fire other agency heads.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immediately after the Trump administration blocked Harvard University on Thursday from enrolling future international students and retaining currently enrolled foreign students, some members of next year's freshman class started scrambling. "I was on the phone with a parent who was visibly shaken and completely frantic," said Christopher Rim, president and CEO of college consulting firm Command Education. Rim, who works with a large share of international students from abroad, said a few of his clients were accepted into the Class of 2029 and committed to Harvard on May 1, also known as National College Decision Day, which was just three weeks ago. "This is a major moment in these students' lives," Rim said. "Given the circumstances and policies and laws that we have right now, we are advising these families to look into taking a gap year — hopefully by then, the Trump administration and Harvard can come to an agreement." On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security terminated Harvard's student and exchange visitor program certification, therefore blocking foreign students from enrolling and forcing existing foreign students to transfer or lose their legal status. A federal judge in Massachusetts on Friday temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on international students, following a petition from Harvard earlier in the day calling for a reversal of the policy. International students accounted for 27% of Harvard's total enrollment in the 2024-25 academic year. Kantrowitz doesn't expect the Trump administration to prevail in Harvard's lawsuit, though of course it's a possibility, he said. More from Personal Finance:Wage garnishment for defaulted student loans to beginWhat loan forgiveness opportunities remain under TrumpIs college still worth it? "It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Thursday. In a statement on Friday, Harvard called Thursday's action "unlawful and unwarranted." "It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams," Harvard said. "At a time when international applications — and international yield — are under pressure, this sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students," Lakhani said. International enrollment is an important source of revenue for schools, which is why colleges tend to rely on a contingent of foreign students, who typically pay full tuition. Altogether, international student enrollment contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy in 2023-24, according to a report by NAFSA: Association of International Educators. Kantrowitz's advice to admitted or enrolled international students at Harvard: Start exploring your options but don't make any sudden moves until you hear from the university. In its statement, Harvard called international students and scholars "vital members of our community." "We will support you as we do our utmost to ensure that Harvard remains open to the world," it said. Transferring to another U.S. school may have its own risks, Kantrowitz said. "I've heard from [Harvard] students who are seeking to transfer," Kantrowitz said. "But that might be jumping from the frying pan into fire. These other colleges could be targeted soon enough." Many institutions may already be at full enrollment for the coming academic year, he said. Harvard students who require financial aid may have a tougher time transferring, depending on the university, compared to those who don't need assistance, Kantrowitz said. Already, some of Lakhani's college-bound clients have started considering schools outside the U.S., fueled by fear about rapid policy changes, he said. Indeed, some schools overseas are trying to woo Harvard's international students in light of the Trump administration's recent maneuver. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, for example, issued an "open invitation" to Harvard students on Friday to continue their education there, to "pursue their educational goals without disruption." "This sends a clear signal for the best and brightest to look elsewhere — including other countries — to thrive intellectually," Lakhani said.

The Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation headquarters in Mclean, Virginia.

Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. will cut about 7% of its almost 36,000 employees this quarter in response to the Trump administration's move to shrink government spending.

Most of the headcount reductions will take place in the civil business, Chief Financial Officer Matt Calderone said on an earnings call Friday. </p>

Canada's economy is likely in the early stages of a recession, according to forecasters, as unemployment rises and exports fall because of a trade war with the US. 

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg say output will shrink 1% on an annualized basis in the second quarter and 0.1% in the third quarter, a technical recession.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shreya Mishra Reddy, a 33-year-old Visa technical program manager completing Harvard Business School's Program for Leadership Development. It has been edited for length and clarity. BI has verified her enrollment in the program. I'm an international student at Harvard Business School's Program for Leadership Development, and I'm reeling from the news of the Trump administration blocking Harvard from enrolling foreign students. I moved to the US from India in 2021 to do my master's at Duke University, and then got my dream job at Visa in Austin. After I started working at Visa, I came across this program at Harvard, which is an alternative to their executive MBA. When I told my parents, they were so excited. I just have one module left, from May to July. I was at home in the middle of a meeting when I saw the news pop up on my phone that Harvard had been banned from accepting international students. I went numb for a minute because I knew my module was supposed to start in a few days, and I was supposed to travel to Boston in July. I've emailed the university to ask what was happening and if they had an update for us, but I haven't heard back yet. I hope to hear back soon because the program starts in just a few days. I was excited to start classes again, meet all the professors back on campus, and see my batchmates again. Harvard's program was one of the best experiences I've had so far. With this news, I don't plan to enroll in another school for the executive program. Getting into Harvard was not just about a degree; it was about studying in one of my dream schools. It does not make sense for me to try to pursue the same kind of degree from any other school or country. I'm now on an optional practical training (OPT) visa that expires in January, and I've not had any luck getting picked for an H-1B visa. So, I'm planning to leave the country in January.</p>
