            The Trump administration's move to bar Harvard University from enrolling international students has ricocheted across China, with officials and commentators seeing it through one lens: the growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing.
    


            “China has consistently opposed the politicization of educational collaboration,” a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry said Friday, adding that the US move “will only tarnish its own image and reputation in the world.”
    


            Some commentators across Chinese social media platforms took a similar tack: “It's fun to watch them destroy their own strength,” read one comment on the X-like platform Weibo that garnered hundreds of likes.
    


            “Trump comes to the rescue again,” wrote another, commenting on a hashtag about the news, which has tens of millions of views. “Recruiting international students is … the main way to attract top talent! After this road is cut off, will Harvard still be the same Harvard?”
    


            The announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a clear escalation of a dispute between the oldest and the richest Ivy League institution and the White House and part of a broader drive to tighten control over international students in the US amid an immigration crackdown. The administration of US President Donald Trump has revoked hundreds of student visas in nearly every corner of the country as part of a vast immigration crackdown.
    


            Harvard and Trump's administration have been locked in conflict for months as the administration demanded the university make changes to campus operations. The government has homed in on foreign students and staff it believes participated in contentious campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            But the revocation isn't just about a feud between a university and the US president. It's also the latest in a widening rupture between two superpowers.
    


            For years, China sent more international students to America than any other country. Those deep educational ties are being reshaped by a growing geopolitical rivalry that has fueled an ongoing trade and tech war.



            “This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Thursday.

Trump administration bars Harvard from enrolling international students



            The DHS statement included claims of ties between Harvard and Chinese institutions or individuals linked to military-related research, as well as with an entity blacklisted by the Trump administration for alleged human rights violations. It links to information about a letter that bipartisan US lawmakers sent earlier this week to Harvard requesting information about the university's alleged “partnerships with foreign adversaries.”
    


            Harvard has not replied to a CNN request for comment on the alleged partnerships. In a statement on its website, the university said it was “committed to maintaining our ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University and this nation.”
    


            The ability of elite American universities to recruit top students from around the world, many of whom often go on to stay in the United States, has long been seen as a critical factor in America's science and tech prowess, as well as a key source of income for its universities.
    


            The decision by the DHS both bars Harvard from enrolling international students for the coming academic year and requires current foreign students to transfer to another university to maintain their status.
    


            International students make up more than a quarter of Harvard's student body, with those hailing from China making up the largest international group, according to a tally on Harvard's International Office website.
    


            Among those students is Fangzhou Jiang, 30, a student at Harvard's Kennedy School, who said he couldn't believe it when he heard that his university status was in jeopardy and immediately began to worry if his visa was still valid.
    


            “I was absolutely shocked for quite a few minutes. I just never anticipated that the administration could go this far,” said Jiang, who is also the founder of an education consulting company helping foreign students gain admission to elite American universities. “Ever since I was young, when it comes to the best universities in the world, from a young age, I learned that it's Harvard,” he said.
    


            Ivy League schools like Harvard, Princeton and Yale are household names in middle class China, where American universities have for years been viewed as a path to a prestigious education and a leg-up in China's fiercely competitive career-ladder.
    


            China was the top source of international students in the US for 15 straight years since 2009, before it was surpassed by India just last year, according to figures from Open Doors, a US Department of State-backed database tracking international student enrollment.
    


            Along the way, US-China educational ties have cultivated close relationships between Chinese and American academics and institutions, while US universities and industry are widely seen to have benefited from their ability to attract top talent from China, and elsewhere, to their halls.
    


            Harvard has educated Chinese figures like former Vice Premier Liu He, who played a key role negotiating Trump's phase one trade deal during the American president's first term.
    


            But those ties have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as the US began to see an increasingly assertive and powerful China as a technological rival and a threat to its own superpower status.
    


            More than 277,000 Chinese students studied in the US during the 2023 to 2024 academic year, down from over 372,000 in the peak 2019-2020 year – a decline that coincides with the Covid-19 pandemic but also increasing friction between the two governments.
    


            Meanwhile, rising nationalist sentiment and government emphasis on national security in China have led to a shift in perception about the value of American versus Chinese universities.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security's claims regarding Harvard's institutional ties to entities and individuals with ties to military-related research are the latest move reflecting deep-seated concern in Washington about Chinese access to sensitive and military-applicable American technology via academia.
    


            To crack down on the perceived threat of Chinese students conducting espionage on US soil, Trump introduced a ban during his first term that effectively prevented graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields from Chinese universities believed to be linked to the military from gaining visas to the US.

            His first administration also launched the now defunct China Initiative, a national security program intended to thwart China's intelligence activities in the US, including those aimed at stealing emerging technology from research universities.
    


            The program, which drew comparisons to the McCarthy-era anti-Communism “red scare” of the 1950s, was cancelled by the Biden administration after facing widespread blowback for what was seen as over-reach and complaints that it fueled suspicion and bias against innocent Chinese Americans.
    


            Trump's broader tightening of US immigration policy during his second term has now unleashed a new wave of insecurity and uncertainty for many students and schools.
    


            While those concerns are shared by international students from many countries, the heightened tensions between the two countries have elevated pressure on Chinese students and scholars – and the impact has already been seen.
    


            Over the past year, at least a dozen high-profile academics with roots in China who were working in the US have returned to China and taken up posts at prominent universities in the country, CNN has found.
    


            And for some students at the start of their academic and professional careers, the latest development leaves them unsure about what to do next.
    


            Among them is Sophie Wu, a 22-year-old from China's southern tech hub of Shenzhen, who was accepted at a graduate program at Harvard this fall, after finishing her undergraduate degree in the US. Wu said she felt “numb” after hearing the news.
    


            “I did not expect that the administration would make such an irrational decision, and I also feel that it is more of a retaliation than a policy decision,” she told CNN. “International students are being held hostage for some political purpose.”

Follow:


            Chancellor Friedrich Merz inaugurated a groundbreaking German brigade in Lithuania that is meant to help protect NATO's eastern flank and declared Thursday that “the security of our Baltic allies is also our security” as worries about Russian aggression persist.
    


            He said Berlin's strengthening of its own military sends a signal to its allies to invest in security.
    


            The stationing in Lithuania marks the first time that a German brigade is being based outside Germany on a long-term basis since World War II. “This is a historic day,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said after meeting Merz. “This is a day of trust, responsibility and action.”
    


            Germany has had troops in Lithuania — which borders Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and Moscow-allied Belarus — since 2017, as part of efforts to secure NATO's eastern fringe, but the new brigade deepens its engagement significantly.
    


            An advance party started work on setting it up just over a year ago and expanded into an “activation staff” of about 250 people last fall. The 45 Armored Brigade is expected to be up to its full strength of about 5,000 by the end of 2027, with troops stationed at Rukla and Rudninkai.
    


            Dozens of military helicopters roared over the central cathedral square in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, as the inauguration wrapped up on a rainy Thursday afternoon, with hundreds of troops and spectators attending. Merz told the event that “protecting Vilnius is protecting Berlin.”
    


            The deployment in Lithuania has been taking shape as Germany works to strengthen its military overall after years of neglect as NATO members scramble to increase defense spending, spurred by worries about further potential Russian aggression and pressure from Washington.
    


            Merz said that, beyond the new brigade, “Germany is investing massively in its own armed forces.”
    


            “With this, we also want to send a signal to our allies: let us now invest with determination in our own security,” he added. “Together with our partners, we are determined to defend alliance territory against every — every — aggression. The security of our Baltic allies is also our security.”
    


            Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, then-Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged to increase Germany's defense spending to the current NATO target of 2% of gross domestic product and announced the creation of a 100 billion-euro ($113-billion) special fund to modernize the Bundeswehr.
    


            Germany met that target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027. Even before it took office earlier this month, the new governing coalition pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt.
    


            Merz, the first chancellor to have served in the Bundeswehr himself, told parliament last week that “the government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.”
    


            Host Lithuania said in January that it would raise its defense spending to between 5% and 6% of GDP starting next year, from a bit over 3%. That made it the first NATO nation to vow to reach a 5% goal called for by US President Donald Trump.
    


            A plan is in the works for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure — roads, bridges, airports and seaports.
    


            Merz said in Lithuania that those figures “seem sensible to us, they also seem reachable — at least in the time span until 2032 that has been stipulated.”
    


            German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said earlier this week that the plan is to increase defense spending by 0.2 percentage points each year for five to seven years.
    


            Merz has plunged into diplomatic efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine since taking office earlier this month.
    


            “We stand firmly by Ukraine, but we also stand together as Europeans as a whole — and, whenever possible, we play in a team with the US,” he said.

Apart from killing millions, a war between Russia and the US could result in a ‘nuclear winter' that would devastate the Earth's atmosphere and lead to a drastic reduction in agricultural production, a group of American scientists has said.

A team led by an assistant research professor at Pennsylvania State University, Yuning Shi, published the results of their stimulation of a war between the two largest nuclear powers in an article in Environmental Research Letters earlier this month.

According to the paper, “a global nuclear war” could see up to 150 million tons of soot released into the atmosphere, leading to “prolonged cooling, agricultural collapse, and social upheaval on an unprecedented scale.”

In such a scenario, precipitation and solar radiation would decrease by as much as 70% globally, resulting in the average air temperature dropping by over 15 degrees Celsius, it said.

Due to this ‘nuclear winter', the annual production of maize, which the scientists focused on, could decrease by as much as 80%, the paper said.

Supply chains and trade could also be seriously disrupted, further worsening the situation in the agricultural sector and leading to regional or global famine, the researchers stressed. According to their estimates, it would take from seven to 12 years to restore food production levels.

Understanding the possible damage from a nuclear exchange and preparing for it is “critical” given current geopolitical trends, including the Ukraine conflict, the tensions between India and Pakistan, and instability in the Middle East that have “undermined the fragile detente that prevailed during the last years of the Cold War,” the paper stressed.

Shi and his colleagues proposed to develop what they called ‘Agricultural Resilience Kits' of region- and climate-specific seeds and technology packages to serve as a “buffer against uncertainty” in case of a ‘nuclear winter'.

Last month, Nikolay Patrushev, national security adviser to President Vladimir Putin, accused Western powers of “deploying their military machine against Russia and becoming delirious with nuclear apocalypse scenarios.”

Moscow has repeatedly denied claims by the US and EU of planning to use nuclear weapons during the Ukraine conflict. However, Russia updated its nuclear doctrine in 2023, allowing for the use of such arms as a deterrent to prevent aggression by hostile powers and military blocs that possess weapons of mass destruction or large arsenals of conventional weapons.

US President Donald Trump has recommended a “straight 50% tariff” on the entire European Union, citing a $250 billion yearly trade deficit with the bloc. He suggested that the new rate will start being applied on June 1.

Writing on his Truth Social account on Friday, Trump suggested that the EU was initially formed “for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the US on Trade,” and stated that the bloc has been “very difficult to deal with.”

He further claimed that the EU's economic policies, taxes, regulations and “unfair and unjustified lawsuits against American companies” have led to a trade deficit with the EU of “more than $250,000,000 a year,” which he described as “totally unacceptable.”

“Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025,” Trump announced, adding that there would be no tariff on products “built or manufactured in the United States.”

In April, Trump imposed a sweeping 20% tariff on all EU goods as well as a 25% tariff on all car imports and metals. However, he later suspended the 20% levy for 90 days, keeping only a 10% baseline tariff.

Last week, the US president stated that the EU had proven to be very difficult to deal with regarding trade practices, claiming that the bloc was “in many ways nastier than China.”

“They treated us very unfairly,” Trump said. “They sell us 13 million cars; we sell them none. They sell us their agricultural products; we sell them virtually none,” he claimed, vowing that Washington would “equalize” the situation and that “Europe is gonna have to pay a little bit more…. And America is gonna pay a lot less.”

Friday's announcement comes as Trump has significantly revamped Washington's tariff policies since returning to office in January, claiming that the entire world had supposedly been taking advantage of the US.

On April 2, which he dubbed “Liberation Day,” Trump imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all goods imported to the country as well as additional surcharges on countries such as China, Mexico and Canada, citing significant trade imbalances.

Shortly after the move, he suggested that the US would later negotiate individual deals with all US trade partners. However, earlier this month, he announced that Washington would set the terms unilaterally. He explained that “it's not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us,” claiming that the US had received deal requests from some 150 countries.

The White House has not yet disclosed the terms of these deals or the exact rates that would be applied.

German Chancellor Frederick Merz actively supports an EU plan to ban any use of the Nord Stream gas pipelines and wants to block any moves to revive energy trade with Russia, the FT reported on Friday.

The move comes amid reports that Russia and the US are exploring ways to resume shipments through the still-intact line of Nord Stream 2, as part of broader efforts to normalize ties between Moscow and Washington.

According to the FT, citing sources, Merz has opened talks in Berlin and Brussels to prevent any such developments, while potentially aiming to shift the burden of decision-making to the EU level.

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea have been inactive since 2022 due to EU sanctions and sabotage, which Russia insists was orchestrated by Western intelligence agencies.

Earlier this month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the natural gas pipelines were part of the planned new 18th sanctions package against Russia.

According to the FT, the restrictions would target Nord Stream 2 AG, the Switzerland-based entity that owns the pipelines, and any other companies that are necessary for their restart and operation.

Florian Philippot, a prominent French Euroskeptic politician, has criticized the EU's proposal, calling it “madness.” He warned that such a move would amount to a “death sentence” for European industry.

His remarks echoed broader concerns about the economic fallout from cutting ties with Russian energy. Following the 2022 sabotage and sanctions, European gas prices quadrupled compared to the previous year, placing immense strain on industry and consumers.

Before 2022, Russia met up to 60% of Germany's demand for natural gas. The loss of an affordable supply resulted in production cuts and job losses across the country's industrial sector.

In recent months, a growing number of German industrial leaders and politicians have advocated for the resumption of Russian gas imports. Christian Gunther, managing director of the Leuna chemical park in eastern Germany, told Reuters that affordable Russian gas is essential for reviving sectors like chemicals.

Moscow has repeatedly stressed that it remains a reliable supplier and is ready to negotiate restarting gas exports to the continent.

GENEVA, May 23. /TASS/. At least 94% of all hospitals in the Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed, and people in the north of the Palestinian enclave have practically lost the opportunity to receive any medical care, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report.

""Only 19 of Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals remain operational, including one hospital providing basic care for the remaining patients still inside the hospital, and are struggling under severe supply shortages, lack of health workers, persistent insecurity, and a surge of casualties, all while staff work in impossible conditions. Of the 19 hospitals, 12 provide a variety of health services, while the rest are only able to provide basic emergency care. At least 94% of all hospitals in the Gaza Strip are damaged or destroyed,"" the report says.

It says that since the resumption of hostilities in the enclave on March 18, 2025, WHO has recorded 28 attacks on medical facilities, and since October 2023, there have been at least 697 such attacks.

""North Gaza has been stripped of nearly all health care. In southern Gaza hospitals are overwhelmed by a surge of injured people. Currently, across the Gaza Strip, only 2,000 hospital beds remain available, for a population of over 2 million people, grossly insufficient to meet the current needs,"" the report reads.

""Continued hostilities and military presence inhibit patients from accessing care, obstruct staff from providing care, and prevent WHO and partners from resupplying hospitals.""

The organization called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the region, reiterating that ""the UN and its partners have a clear, principled and effective plan to deliver aid with safeguards against diversion, a system that has worked and must be enabled to continue.""

On March 18, Israel broke a ceasefire established in January with massive strikes on the enclave. Israel explained this by the refusal of the radical Palestinian movement Hamas from the proposals put forward by mediators and US special envoy Steve Witkoff, adding that the purpose of the operation is the release of all hostages. The radicals blamed Israel and the United States for the resumption of hostilities.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The group is in temporary custody of homeland security in Djibouti following challenges in court

US politics live – latest updates

Eight men the Trump administration attempted to send to South Sudan are in temporary custody in Djibouti after a federal court ruling halted their removal, officials confirmed on Thursday.

The Trump administration had attempted to send the men, who it said had been convicted of criminal offenses, to their home countries: officials said two each were from Myanmar and Cuba and the others were from Vietnam, Laos, Mexico and South Sudan.

When the countries declined to accept them, authorities arranged to fly them to South Sudan on Tuesday, a country that remains under a US state department travel advisory due to persistent instability and threats to safety.

The removals were challenged in court. On Wednesday evening Brian Murphy, a US district judge in Boston, determined that the administration had disregarded his earlier judicial directive, issued in April, which ruled that anyone being deported to third-party countries had the right to challenge it legally. He criticized the brief window allowed for the men to object to their transfer, labeling it “clearly inadequate”.

The group is currently being held by the Department of Homeland Security in Djibouti, which also hosts a key US military installation. At a briefing on Wednesday the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed that the men would stay in Djibouti for two weeks.

Donald Trump responded to the ruling on his Truth Social platform, expressing dissatisfaction with the order. The US president wrote that the judge “has ordered that EIGHT of the most violent criminals on Earth curtail their journey to South Sudan, and instead remain in Djibouti. He would not allow these monsters to proceed to their final destination”.

The president added that the administration was “also forced to leave behind, in order to watch these hardened thugs, a large number of Ice Officers, who would otherwise be in the United States, protecting our Citizens”.

Murphy's ruling stipulated that the men must receive adequate notice and a minimum of 15 days to contest their deportation, aligning with international human rights standards. He further specified that six of the individuals had the right to assert, with legal representation, fears of torture or mistreatment in the destination country.

Students will need to move schools to keep legal status, as US universities reel from funding cuts and Trump orders

US university scholars and international students: are you considering working or studying elsewhere?

The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it would revoke Harvard University's eligibility to enroll international students marked the most severe escalation yet in its weeks-long showdown with the university.

The move, which the university challenged in court on Friday, would force more than 6,000 currently enrolled students to transfer to other universities or lose their legal status, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The announcement sent shock waves through US universities already reeling from funding cuts and executive efforts to bring them in line with the administration's agenda, but it will also add yet another element of uncertainty for international students after the administration abruptly terminated the legal status of thousands in recent weeks – a move it partially walked back but that has nonetheless disrupted students' education and upended their lives.

Education advocates denounced the administration's latest attack against Harvard as a gross overreach that they warn will damage US students as well. “International students are not bargaining chips – they are scholars, researchers and contributors to our communities whose presence strengthens US higher education and society,” said Fanta Aw, CEO and executive director of Nafsa, the association of international educators. “We turn global talent away at our own expense”.

International student enrollment was already expected to decline for the upcoming academic year in light of recent policies by the Trump administration and bureaucratic hurdles that preceded it. But the latest announcement is certain to further destabilize the plans of students from abroad who were hoping to enroll at US universities this fall.

A significant drop in foreign student enrollment will have serious consequences for universities' finances at a time when many are already feeling the pinch. About 65% of international students in the US pay for tuition out of pocket – a figure that rises to 80% for undergraduate students, according to the Institute for International Education. That's far more than the number of US students who pay full tuition, as a vast majority of them receive at least some financial aid.

There were more than 1 million international students in the US during the last academic year, contributing about $43.8bn to the economy, according to an analysis by Nafsa. At Harvard, international students make up roughly 27% of the student body, a figure in line with that of other Ivy League universities. But tens of thousands of international students also attend other institutions, private and public, with New York University, Northeastern University, and Columbia University boasting the largest number of international students – with more than 20,000 each.

Beyond their tuition dollars, on which many universities have come to rely, international students make major contributions to a variety of fields. One in four US startups worth more than $1bn have at least one founder who was an international student, and international students have created or supported more than 378,000 US jobs, according to Nafsa.

The administration's attempts to retaliate against universities by targeting international students are “shortsighted” but will have “long-term consequences”, warned Aw, the group's CEO and executive director.

“The US has benefited from the brain trust of the world for decades,” she said, adding that many countries were eager to woo international students away from the US.

This spring, Harvard became a prime target for Trump's retaliation after it sued the administration over its funding cuts – the first, and so far only, university to do so. For now, it is the only university the administration has barred from hosting international students – a move it had anticipated.

Last month, the university told admitted foreign students that they could simultaneously accept offers at both Harvard and at universities abroad – something it had never allowed before. In an email, admissions officials cited “recent events here in the United States and at Harvard” and recognized that foreign students may want a “backup plan”.

But Harvard's current and prospective international students are not the only ones whose education in the US is on the line. Advocates had already warned of dropping enrollment in light of the recent visa revocations as well as the targeting of some pro-Palestinian students for detention and deportation. Those only add to pre-existing bureaucratic obstacles, including rising visa denial rates – from 15% a decade ago to 41% last year – and slow visa processing.

A full accounting of the impact of Trump's policies won't be possible until the fall, when universities are required to report their matriculation data. But a global survey of universities published earlier this month shows some early signs, including graduate student enrollment that dropped 13% this spring, while a separate analysis of student visas showed a 14% drop in the number of visas issued so far this year.

Those trends will only be compounded by billions in funding cuts that have already destabilized research institutions and risk sending talented students elsewhere, analysts warn.

“It certainly adds to the stress of a prospective or current international student who, in addition to worrying about immigration policy, has to worry about whether they will have uninterrupted funding if they're doing a PhD,” said Julia Kent, vice-president, best practices and strategic initiatives, at the Council of Graduate Schools, a group promoting graduate education and research. She noted that some foreign students were so anxious about the administration's campaign against foreign students that they feared driving their cars.

“It's creating a climate of chaos and uncertainty.”

So far, universities have attempted to mitigate the impact of Trump's policies, discouraging foreign students from traveling abroad during breaks and offering to connect them with immigration attorneys. But that's not much in the face of an administration willing to go to unprecedented lengths in its effort to submit universities to its will.

Chris Glass, a professor of education at Boston College who researches international student trends pointed to a nationwide campaign during the first Trump administration during which universities responded to the Muslim ban by publishing videos telling international students: “You are welcome here.” None of that is happening now.

“Obviously universities see the federal government is willing to use extraordinary forms of power, without precedent,” said Glass. “We're just in a different environment.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President says EU imports to US will be subject to levy from 1 June as markets slump in reaction to ‘major escalation'

Business live – latest updates

Donald Trump has said he will impose a 50% tariff on all EU imports to the US from 1 June after claiming trade talks between the two trading blocs were “going nowhere”.

In a surprise announcement, the US president posted on his Truth Social platform that his long-running battle to secure concessions from the EU had stalled.

He accused the EU of taking advantage of the US on trade, saying: “Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.”

Stock markets slumped in response to the post, with S&P 500 down by 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq down 1.3% on opening. The STOXX Europe 600 index fell by 1.7%. In London the FTSE 100 closed down 0.2% after initially dropping as much as 1.5%. Germany's car makers were particularly hard hit, with BMW down 3.7%, Volkswagen off 2.6% and Mercedes-Benz down 4%.

The US imposed a 20% “reciprocal” rate on most EU goods on 2 April, but halved that rate a week later until 8 July to allow time for talks. It has retained 25% import taxes on steel, aluminium and vehicle parts and is threatening similar action on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other goods.

“This is a major escalation of trade tensions,” said Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg, on Friday. “With Trump you never know but this would be a major escalation. The EU would have to react and it is something that would really hurt the US and European economy.”

“I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU,” said the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. “The 90-day pause on the April 2 tariffs was based on countries or trade blocs coming to us and negotiating in good faith,” Bessent told Fox News. He said the EU's proposals “have not been of the same quality” as those from other trading partners.

EU negotiators have been locked in meetings with White House representatives since Trump's so-called “liberation day” tariffs were first announced. Dozens of countries have been holding discussions to try to bring down their own levies before the 90-day pause elapses.

The White House has relented on many of its most onerous tariffs, including lowering total tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% after what Trump declared were constructive talks with Beijing, which lowered its retaliatory border taxes from 125% to 10% in response.

A week ago the US president appeared to acknowledge that Washington lacked the ability to negotiate deals with scores of countries at once, saying the US would instead send letters to some trading partners to unilaterally impose new tariff rates.

Perceptions of an easing back on a hardline approach to trade brought a period of calm to stock markets, but Friday's threat of a 50% levy on EU goods, plus a separate threat made the same day of 25% tariffs on iPhones made abroad, have brought an end to the peace.

The EU presented a fresh trade proposal to the US on Thursday. The offer included phased tariff cuts on non-sensitive goods, plus cooperation on energy, AI and digital infrastructure. The bloc was readying about $108bn in retaliatory tariffs if talks failed.

To sweeten the deal, EU officials were also willing to extend a 2020 tariff-free arrangement on US lobster imports, according to the Financial Times. But it appears to have proved insufficient to persuade the US president to sign a deal allowing only his 10% universal tariff to apply to the EU, as it does the UK.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

IMPORTS

Beef import rules eased

Taiwan has officially opened its market to imports of all Japanese beef products, regardless of the age of the cattle, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Thursday. Previously, Taiwan only permitted imports of Japanese beef from cattle under 30 months old. The policy change followed a 60-day public comment period that began on March 4, after the FDA proposed revising the restrictions, which were promulgated in 2003 during a global outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease. Since 2017, Taiwan has relaxed its beef import rules for the US, Canada and Japan. It allowed beef from cattle of all ages from the US in 2021 and from Canada in 2023. FDA Director-General Chiang Chih-kang (姜至剛) said that Japan has not reported a case of mad cow disease in more than 15 years.

TRAFFIC

License-less driver crashes

A car driven by a person without a license crashed into a bus and three other vehicles in Taipei yesterday, injuring the driver and seven others, police said. The incident happened on the southbound-only section of Sec. 1, Chongqing S Road near Xiangyang Road, two blocks away from the Presidential Office. Dash cam footage from a trailing vehicle showed a black car speeding through a red light at the Wuchang Street intersection and into vehicles that were stopped ahead of Xiangyang Road at about 2:19pm. The front of the black car was smashed. The driver, a 78-year-old man, surnamed Chiu (邱), was taken to hospital along with seven others. Chiu initially tested negative for alcohol, but further tests were to be conducted to confirm the result, police said.

CONSTRUCTION

Collapse kills two

Two workers were killed and two were injured when scaffolding collapsed at a construction site yesterday, Taichung Fire Bureau officials said. The bureau received a report of the incident at the site in South District (南區) at 9:04am, it said. Two workers on the scaffolding, about 10 stories high, were believed to have fallen and showed no signs of life, it said. They were taken to a hospital, but efforts to resuscitate them failed and they were pronounced dead, the bureau said. The two injured workers were hit by falling scaffolding, Taichung police said. The Taichung Labor Affairs Bureau ordered the construction site to suspend operations. If an investigation finds contraventions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (職業安全衛生法), the construction company would face fines ranging from NT$30,000 to NT$300,000, the labor bureau said.

CULTURE

Manga exhibition to open

An exhibition tracing the roots of Japan's manga culture and Taiwan's comic book scene is to open today in Kyoto, Japan. “A Century of Manga Culture: An Encounter of Taiwan and Japan's Youth,” organized by the Preparatory Office of the National Taiwan Museum of Comics and the Kyoto International Manga Museum, with support from the Ministry of Culture, runs through June 24 at the Kyoto museum. The exhibition delves into modern history to examine the similarities and differences between Taiwanese and Japanese comics from historical and political contexts, the organizers said. The exhibition would move to the National Taiwan Museum of Comics in Taichung from July, the Kyoto International Manga Museum said.



                                                                                Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr arrived in Taiwan last night to kick off his first  visit to the country since beginning his second term earlier  this year.
After arriving at Taoyuan International Airport at around  6:30 pm, Whipps and his delegation were welcomed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍).
Speaking to gathered media, the Palauan leader said he  was excited and honored to be back in Taiwan on his first  state visit to Taiwan since he was sworn in this January.
Among those traveling with Whipps is Minister of State  Gustav N. Aitaro, Public Infrastructure

""Palau has never stopped voicing support for Taiwan"" in the UN General Assembly, the WHO and other UN-affiliated agencies, Lai said during a bilateral meeting with visiting Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr.

""We have been profoundly touched by these endorsements,"" Lai said, praising the Pacific island nation's firm support as ""courageous.""

Lai's remarks came as Taiwan was excluded for the ninth consecutive year from the WHA, which is being held in                                    


RESOLUTIONS DEBATE:
                                        Taiwan's allies said that UN and WHA resolutions cited by China and other nations ‘do not determine Taiwan's participation in WHO activities'                                        A proposal to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) was rejected on Monday, resulting in Taipei's absence from the annual meeting for a ninth consecutive year, although partners spoke up for Taiwan's participation at the first day of the meeting.
The first agenda item after the opening was a “two-on-two debate” on a proposal to invite Taiwan to participate at the WHA as an observer.
Similar to previous years, two countries made statements in favor of the proposal, while two others expressed their opposition.
Philippine Secretary of Health Teodoro Herbosa, president of the 78th WHA, accepted the WHA General Committee's

The incident happened at about 4pm when a car rammed into pedestrians at an intersection near Bei Da Elementary School.
Witnesses said the sedan, being driven at a high speed, ran a red light, knocking scooters out of the way and hitting students crossing the road before careening into a median near the intersection of Guocheng and Guoguang streets.
The incident resulted in three deaths and 13 injuries, including the driver, a 78-year-old man                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Australian Olympic champion Cam McEvoy has rubbished a record claimed by a Greek swimmer using performance-enhancing drugs and dismissed the relevance of the Enhanced Games. 

Kristian Gkolomeev claimed to have blitzed the 50m freestyle in 20.89 seconds in February, eclipsing the official current record time of 20.91 set in 2009 by the Brazilian Cesar Cielo. 

Greece's Gkolomeev has been taking performance-enhancing drugs while training for next year's Enhanced Games and was also wearing a special swim suit that would breach Olympic standards.

“It doesn't count in any way, shape or form when you take drugs or wear one of the banned suits, or both,” said McEvoy, who won 50m freestyle gold at last year's Paris Olympics. “It's got no relevance to Olympic or world championship 50m comps, or to the international rankings around them.” 

The first edition of the Enhanced Games is to be staged in Las Vegas in May next year, with athletes 

participating in three sports — athletics, swimming and weightlifting. Athletes would be allowed to use drugs which are banned across international sport such as steroids and human growth hormones.

Anti-doping authorities on Thursday lined up to condemn the event.

The World Anti-Doping Agency called it “a dangerous and irresponsible concept.”

Aron D'Souza, the Australian entrepreneur behind the event, said it was an exercise in testing the boundaries of human performance.

Winners stand to reap US$250,000, and a bonus of US$1 million for anyone who breaks a world record.



                                                                                SSC Napoli will have to wait one more week to seal the Serie A title after on Sunday being held to a goalless draw at Parma, while closest rivals Inter drew 2-2 in a dramatic game with SS Lazio.
Antonio Conte's team stayed one point ahead of Inter and were unfortunate not to win after twice striking the woodwork through Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Matteo Politano, while Scott McTominay also had a free-kick tipped onto the crossbar.
The away side thought they would be handed a chance to take the points from the penalty spot in the 96th minute when David Neres

Marmoush let fly from about 30m to put City ahead in their 3-1 win against AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League.
The victory moved Pep Guardiola's team up to third in the standings and left qualification for the UEFA Champions League in their own hands heading into the last round of the season.
“It's really important. To be in the Champions League after what happened [this season] will be really nice,” the City manager said.
De Bruyne was making his final home appearance for City before                                    



                                                                                Brighton & Hove Albion's Jack Hinshelwood on Monday sealed a dramatic 3-2 victory against Liverpool to leave the English Premier League champions without a win since clinching the title.
Arne Slot's side took the lead through Harvey Elliott's early opener before Yasin Ayari equalized at the American Express Stadium.
Dominik Szoboszlai restored Liverpool's advantage just before halftime, but Brighton staged a late fightback as Kaoru Mitoma leveled before Hinshelwood came off the bench to net with his first touch.
Liverpool have taken just one point from their three matches following the title-clinching rout of Tottenham Hotspur on April 27.

Kershaw allowed three runs and threw 38 pitches in the first inning. The three-time National League Cy Young Award winner lasted four innings, giving up five runs on five hits with three walks and two strikeouts.

The World Forum on Japanese Culture is set to kick off at the MOA Museum of Art in Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture, on May 31.

The number of applications from people wishing to attend the inaugural day has already reached the venue's seating capacity. However, recordings from the day will be viewable on the museum's website and other places at a later date.

The Cultural Affairs Agency and other entities established the forum to convey to the world the distinctive characteristics of Japanese culture. Among those characteristics is the value that Japanese culture places on finding harmony between nature and human society, which will feature in the forum amid the divisions and conflicts currently faced by the international community.

Leading figures in traditional arts, traditional crafts, fine arts, science and other fields have been invited to speak, providing a variety of perspectives on Japanese culture. Their lectures and discussions will be open to the public and recorded, and the recordings will be made public with multilingual subtitles included.

The forum is also expected to cooperate with overseas universities and museums to enable the recordings to be used in classes at those institutions.

In the first session on the day, Princess Akiko of Mikasa will give a special lecture titled “The essence of Japanese aesthetics.” In the second session, a discussion will be held with four participants: Masatomo Kawai, a professor emeritus at Keio University; Kazumi Murose, a lacquer artist designated as a living national treasure; Harvard University Prof. Yukio Lippit; and Tokugo Uchida, director of the MOA Museum of Art. Both sessions will be recorded.

Andrey Kondratyev, deputy general director and chief designer at the Russian defense enterprise Kurganpribor, was attacked with a hammer in the city of Kurgan on May 22, the local outlet Oblast 45 reported.

According to the Russian Telegram channel Baza, which appears to be close to Russian security forces, Kondratyev was assaulted while entering his residential building after returning from work.

He sustained serious head injuries and was hospitalized. 

The attack is reportedly connected to his professional activities, though the exact motives and circumstances remain under investigation. No suspect has been detained yet.

Kurganpribor, which produces a range of equipment for Russia's defense industry, including components for rocket systems, missiles, and bombs, is under U.S. and EU sanctions in response to Moscow's full-scale war against Ukraine. It is described as one of the leading enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reports. Ukraine has not commented on the incident.

Previously, Kyiv has targeted Russian officials who play a key role in Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukraine has not been linked to the attack on Kondratyev.

Ukraine cannot expect to return Russian-occupied territories as long as Moscow has the resources to continue its war, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former commander-in-chief and current ambassador to the U.K., said on May 22.

Speaking via video at a forum in Kyiv, Zaluzhnyi said that Ukraine can only wage a ""high-tech war of survival"" using a minimum of human and economic resources.

""Ukraine is not capable of (fighting) another war in terms of demography and economy, and we shouldn't even entertain the thought,"" the ambassador added.

According to Zaluzhnyi, the only way to win the war is to destroy Russia's military and economic potential to wage it.

""I hope there is no one left in this hall still waiting for a miracle — for some white swan to bring peace to Ukraine, restore the borders of 1991 or 2022, and after that there will be great happiness in Ukraine,"" Zaluzhnyi said.

He believes that as long as Russia has the resources, manpower, and capability to strike Ukrainian territory and launch offensives, it will continue to do so.

Ukraine's leadership has consistently vowed to restore the country's 1991 borders, which includes the liberation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas occupied by Russia since 2014. 

After the failed 2023 counteroffensive and U.S.'s foreign policy shift this year, Kyiv adjusted its rhetoric. President Volodymyr Zelensky said this February that Russia has to pull back its troops to at least the front line as it was before the 2022 invasion.

In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale war, further occupying territories in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as partially occupying territories in Kharkiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

Canada Post is in major financial trouble. A recent report commissioned by the federal government says the postal corporation is in an “existential crisis.” Canada Post has lost $3-billion since 2018, and, according to the report, that's due to a drop in letter mail and parcel delivery competition. This is putting even more pressure on the corporation and the union to come to a deal.

Fake news in the White House: the footage Trump wants to use to prove the “mass murder of white farmers in South Africa” is outdated. The white crosses on the roadside are from a demonstration in 2020.

During his visit to the White House, US President Donald Trump confronted South Africa's head of state Cyril Ramaphosa with claims that white farmers are being mass murdered in South Africa.

The narrative that white population groups are being systematically and deliberately killed is not supported by facts and official statistics. It has been circulating in right-wing circles for years and is linked to the racist conspiracy myth of the ""Great Replacement.""

Claim: ""These are the -- these are burial sites right here,"" Trump said (White House videominute 24:25), while describing a footage during a meeting with Ramaphosa at the White House on May 21.

""Each one of those white things you see is a cross. And there's approximately a thousand of them. They're all white farmers, the family of white farmers,"" added Trump.

DW Fact check: False

Trump's claim was already circulating on social media before Ramaphosa's state visit to the US. On May 12, a user on X explained that every cross stands for a murdered white farmer in South Africa. The video posthas been viewed almost 55 million times at the time of publishing.

A reverse image search shows that the footage used by Trump with the white crosses on the side of the road was already shared on social media in 2020 and 2023. These are not, as Trump claims, the gravesites of more than a thousand murdered farmers.

Instead, the scenes show a protest near the South African city of Newcastle on September 5, 2020. The protest was triggered by the murder of married couple Glen and Vida Rafferty on their farm in August 2020.

Among others, the South African newspaper Newcastle Advertiser reportedon the incident:

""Trucks, tractors, trucks, bakkies, vans, sedans, scooters, motorcycles, helicopters and airplanes – vehicles of almost every description formed part of the Move ONE Million group's procession deep into Normandien today (September 5)."" [...]

""Just after the Horn River bridge, hundreds of symbolic wooden crosses had been erected along the route by volunteers. Almost halfway to Hanover, the farm where Glen and Vida Rafferty were murdered, an enormous banner was strung above the road: ‘President Ramaphosa, how many more must die???'""

In another passage of the video used by Trump, the South African politician Julius Malema is shown proclaiming the slogan “Kill the boer, kill the farmer”.

The footage was taken at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, where the left-wing South African party “Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)” celebrated its tenth anniversaryin August 2023. Media outlets like public broadcaster SABC News reportedon the event.

Julius Malema was a member of the South African ruling party African National Congress ANC before the EEF was founded and was expelled from the party in 2012.

The song is an old declaration of war from the apartheid era and has been classified as hate speech in South Africa on several occasions.

South Africa's President Ramaphosa distancedhimself from the aforementioned statements immediately after the video screening. The President said those speeches are not his government policy.

South African farmer Theo de Jaeger, head of the Southern African Agri Initiative, also told DW that there is no genocide of white farmers in South Africa (see video above).

After Trump recently offered white farmers asylumin the US, he wrote a public letter to the US President, feeling compelled to set the record straight.

""We were scared that he might misunderstand what it's all about. I sent him that letter that the challenges we have are not only challenges for white farmers, there are even bigger challenges for black farmers,"" he told DW.

Land distribution in South Africa is still extremely unequal more than 30 years after the end of apartheid.

According to a 2017 report by the South African government, white people own around 72% of agricultural land, while black South Africans only own around 4% of individually registered farms.

White South Africans make up only 7.8%of the total South African population.

Benjamin Netanyahu accused Sir Keir Starmer and other world leaders of siding with Hamas following the murder of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington DC.

The Israeli prime minister said Sir Keir, along with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, were “on the wrong side of humanity”.

In a televised statement addressing the shootings at the Capital Jewish Museum, Mr Netanyahu said that by condemning the war in Gaza, the leaders were supporting “mass murderers, rapists, baby killers, and kidnappers”.

Embassy workers Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim had just left a reception for diplomats on Wednesday night when a stranger armed with a handgun approached them and opened fire.

The alleged murderer in Washington DC told police “I did it for Gaza” and shouted “free, free Palestine” as he handed himself in.

Mr Netanyahu's criticism follows a joint statement by the UK, France, and Canada that criticised Israel for expanding its ground operation in Gaza and preventing aid from entering the war-torn strip.

The Israeli leader said Hamas wanted to destroy Israel and that he could “never understand how this simple truth evades the leaders of France, Britain, Canada and others”.

He said: “I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer, when mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice.

“You're on the wrong side of humanity, and you're on the wrong side of history.”

No10 declined to comment on Mr Netanyahu's remarks but instead highlighted the Prime Minister's condemnation of Wednesday's attack.

The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder late afternoon on Thursday. He has also been charged with murder of foreign officials, causing death with a firearm and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.

The attack is being investigated as a hate crime and terrorism, Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney, said on Thursday night, adding that it was a “death-penalty-eligible case”.

Earlier this week, Sir Keir said he was “horrified” by Israel's actions, saying that an “utterly inadequate” amount of aid had been let into Gaza.

The UK later announced a raft of sanctions against Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including those who featured in Louis Theroux's recent documentary, and suspended trade talks with Israel.

Amichai Chikli, the Israeli diaspora affairs minister, said on Thursday that the world must hold to account “irresponsible leaders in the West who give backing” to hatred against Jews and Israelis, “whether through appeasement, double standards, or silence”.

Mr Chikli added that the leaders of France, Canada, and the UK had “emboldened the forces of terror through their failure to draw moral red lines. This cowardice has a price – and that price is paid in Jewish blood.”

Sir Keir has not responded to the Israeli criticism, but said on Thursday morning: “I thoroughly condemn the anti-Semitic attack outside the Israeli embassy in Washington DC.”

A UK minister on Friday said that he did not “recognise” Mr Netanyahu's criticism of the Prime Minister.

Luke Pollard, the Armed Forces minister, told Sky News: “We condemn the killing of diplomats thoroughly. We want to see a proper investigation as we would do in all things to secure justice for those people who have been murdered in the States.

“But we also at the same time should not remove ourselves from the need to secure a lasting peace in Gaza.”

Footage described by the FBI in a charging document revealed that the suspect passed the couple after they left the museum before shooting them in the back.

Rodriguez leaned over the couple and fired at them repeatedly after they dropped to the ground, the FBI said. Ms Milgrim attempted to crawl away before Rodriguez allegedly followed behind her and fired again. He is then accused of reloading his weapon and firing at Ms Milgrim as she sat up.

Following the shooting, the suspect was allowed into the nearby Capital Jewish Museum by security guards who initially thought he was a distraught bystander.

Yoni Kalin, the event's organiser, told Fox News: “He was clearly in trauma, he was in shock. Some of the people at the event sat him down, brought him water, asked if he was okay, and he was like, ‘Call the cops'.”

Minutes later, when officers arrived, Rodriguez allegedly admitted to carrying out the shooting.

Ms Kalin said: “He grabbed a red keffiyeh out of his pocket and started a ‘Free Palestine' chant, ‘There's only one solution, Intifada revolution'.”

Pamela Smith, the chief of the Washington metropolitan police, said: “Once in handcuffs, the suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered, and he implied that he committed the offence.

“The suspect chanted, ‘free, free Palestine' while in custody.”

The suspect is believed to have written a letter, which was made public an hour after the attack:

The letter states: “Public opinion has shifted against the genocidal apartheid state, and the American government has simply shrugged.”

“Free Palestine,” the letter concludes, according to Sky News.

Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the US, described the victims as a “beautiful couple” who “came to enjoy an evening in Washington's cultural centre”.

The ambassador added: “The young man [Yaron] purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem.”

Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered Israeli embassy security to be boosted around the world in response to the incident.

He added: “The terrorist who cruelly gunned them down did so for one reason and one reason alone – he wanted to kill Jews. And as he was taken away, he chanted, ‘Free Palestine!' For these neo-Nazis, ‘Free Palestine' is just today's version of ‘Heil Hitler'.”

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: “We are horrified by the killing of two Israeli embassy staff in DC, and the Prime Minister's thoughts are with the victims, their families and all staff at the embassy, for whom this is a very troubling time. Diplomats must always be allowed to do their jobs safely.

“Anti-Semitism is an evil that we must stamp out wherever it appears. Now, as always, the Prime Minister stands in solidarity with the Jewish community in the UK and the Government has offered its support to the Israeli embassy in London.

“We continue to provide £18 million per year in funding for protective security measures for Jewish community sites in the UK.”

The terror suspect accused of killing two Israeli embassy staff flaunted his support for Hamas online and attended Black Lives Matter protests.

Elias Rodriguez, 30, was arrested after allegedly shooting Israeli embassy staff members Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim as they left a reception for diplomats near Washington's Jewish museum on Wednesday.

On Thursday, Mr Rodriguez was charged with two counts of first degree murder. He was also charged with murder of foreign officials, causing death with a firearm, and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.

According to an FBI affidavit, Mr Rodriguez was captured on security cameras shortly after 9pm on Wednesday walking past the two victims, before turning round and shooting at them while their backs were turned.

When they collapsed to the ground, he is said to have leant over them and continued to fire.

Mr Rodriguez seemingly reloaded his gun as Ms Milgrim attempted to crawl away and sat up, before shooting at her several times and jogging away, the affidavit continues.

Mr Rodriguez then entered the museum and was detained by security staff as witnesses rushed to help the victims, police said.

Footage of his arrest showed him chanting “free, free Palestine” as he was taken away by an officer.

Social media posts, which appear to have been made by the alleged gunman, have revealed the extent of his obsession with the terrorist group Hamas and his thirst for violence.

On New Year's Day, an account believed to belong to Mr Rodriguez posted: “Happy New Year, Death To Israel.”

In another alarming message published around a week after the assassination attempt of Donald Trump in July last year, Mr Rodriguez shared an image that read: “I agree with the public opinion that says to kill him!”

Another post suggested he supported the bombing of the New York Times newsroom.

“Progressive tweeps, as much as I love delving into the day's discourse, can we PLEASE save the idealistic and high-minded debate over the morality of sending a truck bomb into the offices of The New York Times until *AFTER* we send a truck bomb into the office,” the post read.

The account's profile picture features an avatar wearing a medical face mask.

The FBI said it was investigating social media posts made by Rodriguez.

“Make no mistake, this attack was targeted anti-Semitic violence, and it won't be tolerated,” Steven Jensen, assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office said.

“We are also executing search warrants for his electronic devices, reviewing his social media accounts and all of his internet postings. Regarding some internet postings, we are aware of some writings that are purported to have been authored by this subject. We're actively investigating to determine both the authorship and the attribution of these writings, if they belong to this subject or not.”

After the shooting, Mr Rodriguez fled into the Capital Jewish Museum and was detained.

Amid the chaos, he is said to have been allowed into the museum by security guards who assumed he was a distraught bystander.

Minutes later, when officers arrived, Mr Rodriguez allegedly admitted to carrying out the shooting.

From Chicago, the suspected gunman was once linked to the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a far-Left group that regularly posts anti-Israel rhetoric on social media and spearheaded Black Lives Matter protests.

Mr Rodriguez participated in a 2017 Black Lives Matter protest outside the home of Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago at the time, according to a now-deleted article on the group's Liberation news outlet seen by the New York Post.

Before the killing, he once worked as an oral history researcher at the History Makers, a non-profit that documents the stories of “unsung” African Americans, an online CV shows.Amichai Chikli, Israeli diaspora affairs minister, said the world must hold to account the “irresponsible leaders in the West who give backing” to hatred against Jews and Israelis, “whether through appeasement, double standards, or silence”.Mr Chikli said: “French president Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Canadian prime minister Mark Carney have all, in different ways, emboldened the forces of terror through their failure to draw moral red lines. This cowardice has a price – and that price is paid in Jewish blood.”

Jeanine Pirro, interim US attorney for the District of Washington, pledged to prosecute the alleged gunman with the full force of the law.

“This is a horrific crime, and these crimes are not going to be tolerated by me and by this office. A young couple, at the beginning of their life's journey about to be engaged in another country, had their bodies removed in the cold of the night in a foreign city in a body bag,” she said.

“Let me also say that violence against anyone based on their religion is an act of cowardice. It is not an act of a hero.”

			Appointment marks extraordinary turnaround for figure who was relieved of his command and court martialled

Lt Col Stu Scheller was thrown in the brig and then drummed out of the US Marine Corps for publicly condemning the chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Almost four years later, he is part of the team investigating the Biden administration's handling of the evacuation that led to the deaths of 13 US troops in a suicide attack at Kabul airport.

“Ironic that I will be investigating who should be held accountable for Afghanistan,” Lt Col Scheller, who was handed a senior role at the Pentagon by Donald Trump, said this week.

It shows just how much Washington has changed since Mr Trump returned to power.

And it marks an extraordinary turnaround for a figure who was relieved of his command and court martialled after posting a video criticising senior officers on the day a blast ripped through American personnel guarding the evacuation from the Afghan capital.

“I have been fighting for 17 years,” said Lt Col Scheller, then commander of the advanced infantry training battalion. “I am willing to throw it all away to say to my senior leaders: ‘I demand accountability.'”

His protest made him a hero to supporters of Mr Trump, as they accused Joe Biden of botching the withdrawal and leaving billions of dollars of weapons to fall to the Taliban.

Last month he announced he had taken up a post at the Pentagon as a senior adviser under Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence.

“The military is in desperate need of change and there can be no change without disrupters,” he said at the time. “For those who criticise, wanting stability and the status quo… you are the real problem.”

He said his role was to tackle “careerism” in the armed forces and to ensure that people rose through the ranks on merit.

And on Wednesday he was named to Mr Hegseth's new investigation.

“He was the one guy fired for telling the truth about what happened in Afghanistan,” said Mr Hegseth a day earlier.

Mr Biden, the president at the time, ordered the withdrawal of the last remaining American troops from the war-torn country in April 2021.

It quickly descended into chaos. Afghan government forces melted away as their allies left, setting Taliban troops on a helter skelter race to Kabul.

They seized the city in August that year, sending thousands of foreigners and Afghan nationals flocking to the airport seeking safe passage out.

Tragedy struck when a suicide bomber detonated his deadly payload at one of the main entry points where American troops were protecting civilians.

The attack will be at the centre of the new investigation, led by Sean Parnell, a former Ranger who now serves as Pentagon spokesman. It will also include Jerry Dunleavy, a journalist who resigned from a Republican investigation last year in protest that it had not gone far enough.

On message boards used by Marines, it was Lt Col Scheller's name that attracted most attention.

Opinion divided on whether he was a wise choice.

“That guy who was popping off about an op he had no connection to and knew nothing about is now an investigator for it?,' said one user of a Reddit forum.

Another poster, who claimed to have been trained by him, said: “More than anyone else I interacted with, that man cared about the future of the corps and knew the future [lay] in our subordinates and how we treat them.

“I wish him the best and I know he will do the best for our country.”

Lt Col Scheller's actions as the withdrawal collapsed into chaos also divided opinion at the time.

He won support from some veterans who shared his concerns but angered others who felt he was wrong to make such a public protest while in uniform.

He followed up with further social media posts criticising military leaders and called for “revolution”.

He was eventually charged with six violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and struck a plea deal, resigning his commission and leaving the Marines at the end of 2021.

The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said the cuts will barely boost the economy and mostly go to the rich.

An analysis released Thursday by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found that the tax cuts at the center of Republicans' massive reconciliation package would do little to boost economic growth — and would not come anywhere close to paying for themselves.

The JCT report, published hours after Republicans pushed the bill through the House, estimates that the tax cuts would boost the nation's average annual economic growth by 0.03 percentage points over the next decade — hardly the explosion of growth that GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump have promised.

Economic activity spurred by the tax breaks — which are largely an extension of soon-to-expire provisions of the 2017 Trump-GOP tax cuts — would increase federal revenues by roughly $103 billion between 2025 and 2034, according to JCT.

That would barely put a dent in the overall projected cost of the tax cuts, bringing it down to $3.7 trillion from $3.8 trillion.

“I'm sorry, it is so funny that JCT says the GOP tax provisions pay for only 2.7% of themselves,” Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, wrote in response to the analysis. “Republicans are out here pretending their tax bill will be the single greatest boost to the economy ever, and JCT says they only get a minuscule boost.”

A separate analysis published Thursday by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) shows that the benefits of the Republican bill's tax provisions would flow disproportionately to the wealthiest Americans.

“The $121 billion in net tax cuts going to the richest 1% next year would exceed the amount going to the entire bottom 60% of taxpayers (about $90 billion),” said ITEP, whose analysis did not factor in the impact of the legislation's unparalleled cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition assistance, which would deliver a major blow to the household resources of lower-income Americans.

Amy Hanauer, ITEP's executive director, said Thursday that “it's not surprising that this bill was written behind closed doors and rushed through in the night before Americans had a chance to see what it contains.”

“This bill extends enormous tax cuts to those who have the most,” said Hanauer. “It will increase inequality, reduce health coverage, and take food from people's tables, all to shower the wealthiest people in this country and foreign investors with tax breaks. In the end, this reconciliation bill redistributes resources up the income scale, widening the already-huge chasm between the rich and the rest of us.”

The all-Republican commission abandoned a lawsuit accusing PepsiCo of providing Walmart with pricing advantages.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday dismissed a price discrimination lawsuit against the drink and food giant PepsiCo, a move that former FTC Chair Lina Khan, who served under former President Joe Biden, called “disturbing behavior.”

The lawsuit, filed only a few days before U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, accused PepsiCo of providing a big box retailer customer, Walmart, with pricing advantages, while increasing prices for competing customers and retailers.

“This lawsuit would've protected families from paying higher prices at the grocery store and stopped conduct that squeezes small businesses and communities across America,” Khan wrote on X on Thursday. “Dismissing it is a gift to giant retailers as they gear up to hike prices.”

The three members of the FTC, all Republicans, voted 3-0 to drop the suit. Current FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, who was named chairman by Trump, cast the lawsuit as a “nakedly political effort to commit this administration to pursuing little more than a hunch that Pepsi had violated the law.” He also said that the FTC under Biden “rushed to authorize the case.” Ferguson also opposed the lawsuit when the FTC first voted to pursue it.

Antimonopoly groups were quick to criticize Thursday's move.

“This meritless dismissal is a win for monopolists and billionaires,” said Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, in a statement on Thursday. “Adding insult to injury, the agency dropped the case just one day before the parties were due to justify extensive redactions in the complaint, denying the public the ability to review the facts and judge the merits for themselves. This is a corporate pardon for Walmart and PepsiCo.”

Open Markets legal director Sandeep Vaheesan said the move illustrates that despite their rhetoric, the current FTC commissioners are “not willing to faithfully apply the law enacted by Congress.”

Stacy Mitchell, co-director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which is an advocate for independent businesses, called it “effectively an endorsement of the predatory tactics Walmart uses to crush local grocery sores, create food deserts, and drive up prices.”

The agency had sued PepsiCo under the Robinson-Patman Act, a 1936 law intended to prevent price discrimination but has been little used in recent decades.

The announcement of the dropped lawsuit came the same day it was reported that the FTC is investigating the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America over potential coordination with other groups, including the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, which was a World Federation of Advertiser initiative. Media Matters president Angelo Carusone confirmed in a statement to Axios that the investigation is over claims Media Matters and other groups coordinated advertising boycotts of the social media site X.

X's owner, billionaire Elon Musk, who has played a core role in the Trump administration, has ongoing lawsuits against both the World Federation of Advertisers and Media Matters.

Despite growing suppression, students have achieved multiple divestment victories and are pushing for more wins.

In recent weeks, students across multiple university campuses in the United States have launched hunger strikes in solidarity with the people of Gaza enduring famine. The protesters are also calling on their school to cut ties with weapons manufacturers and other companies connected to Israel.

In addition to the hunger strikes, we have seen new encampments and even campus occupations. Despite the growing suppression of the movement, students have achieved multiple divestment victories and are pushing for more wins.

Student protestors across the country are adapting their strategies to Trump's crackdown, but it's safe to say the activism is not slowing down.

More than two dozen California students began a fast on May 5, with more schools joining in the proceeding days.

“If ever there was a moment that demands civil disobedience, it is the hour of genocide. We walk in the footsteps of earlier Stanford students who occupied this same plaza to end the Vietnam War and later to force partial divestment from apartheid South Africa. Now that baton passes to us. On October 20, 2023, Stanford students built the nation's first Gaza‑solidarity encampment,” said the Stanford University's hunger strikes in a statement published at Mondoweiss.

“For 120 days, hundreds of Stanford community members sustained this encampment to demand an end to the genocide in Palestine and to press Stanford University to act — by providing direct support for Palestinian students and, ultimately, by divesting its endowment from defense contractors and surveillance firms complicit in that genocide. Our university's leadership and administration ignored the calls from the overwhelming majority of the Stanford student body to take action and only reacted with escalated repression.”

San Francisco State University (SFSU) students recently ended their strike after obtaining several commitments from their school. The administration said it would expand the implementation of the divestment policy and work toward a partnership with Palestinian universities.

San Francisco State University (SFSU) is one of three schools that have pressured their university to some level of divestment in the past and is building upon those earlier victories.

A post shared by GUPS 🇵🇸 (@sfsugups)

At a press conference about the development, a fourth-year SFSU student said the action could inspire other schools to take action.

“How are we able to study and learn and not feel a sense of duty to the students in Palestine who are without a single standing college because of a genocide funded by our student dollars?” she said. “Here at San Francisco State, we are the example. Our school goes to show we can divest for more on occupation. Students do not and should not have to be complicit in genocide just because they want education.”

Six students at Sacramento State, which has also previously adopted a divestment policy, also recently ended their hunger strike.

Amal Dawud, a Sacramento State student, said it's a way to remind people about what hundreds of thousands of people are experiencing in Gaza.

“It's been two years and it's been two months, and they haven't had food entering the Gaza Strip,” a student told the local news, referring to Israel's ongoing blockade on humanitarian aid. “That's kind of why a hunger strike was the method that we chose.”

At UCLA, student activist Maya Abdullah was hospitalized on the 9th day of her hunger strike.

Students with the group Yalies4Palestine recently met with Yale College Dean Pericles Lewis amid an ongoing hunger strike at the school. The demonstrators are demanding that Yale divest from weapons manufacturers, adopt human rights-based investment strategy, end its academic partnerships with Israel, and grant amnesty for student protesters.

Lewis told the strikers that he couldn't grant students amnesty without knowing their plans. Yale President Maurie McInnis has refused to meet with the protesters so far.

“Maurire McInnis, the people are watching,” said Yalies4Palestine in a statement on social media. “Our support is overwhelming and our numbers are growing.”

“The strikers demand a response,” it continues. “McInnis, meet with us. Commencement is coming. Your starving students are still here. We are not going anywhere.”

A post shared by Yalies4Palestine (@yalies4palestine)

In addition to the hunger strikes, students have also erected Gaza solidarity encampments this semester, but most have been shut down by campus police departments.

On May 8, students at Johns Hopkins University erected an encampment on the campus's Keyser Quad, declaring it the Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya Liberated Zone, in solidarity with Palestinians.

According to the protesters, over 30 university cops (JHPD) and Baltimore police pulled the canopies down, injuring multiple students.

“Cops mangled the metal so that the legs were sticking in all directions and support beams were twisting,” said one student. “The person I was linking arms with got stuck bending over under the canopy trying to get out someone else out—their heads were getting caught between metal poles in the canopy roof, and we weren't able to get them out until JHPD stopped pulling it down for a moment.”

A post shared by HJC🇵🇸 (@hopkinsjusticecollective)

Last month, about 200 student protesters gathered at Yale University's Beinecke Plaza to protest far-right Israeli security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to New Haven. An encampment was erected, but eventually disbanded over fear of retribution from the school.

The next day, Yale College revoked the aforementioned Yalies4Palestine's status as a registered student group, despite the fact that they did not organize the protest.

At Dartmouth College, students disbanded an encampment after the administration agreed to set up an immigration legal fund for international students and release a formal response to the protesters' divestment demands by May 20.

Palestine Solidarity Coalition member Ramsey Alsheikh told the student paper that the development was “a massive victory” and “a step forward for the student movement,” but pointed out that the activism would not be stopping.

“We will move forward,” said Alsheikh. “This is not the end.”

Last spring's encampments also continue to reverberate.

In 2024, students at the University of San Francisco pressured their school into adopting a divestment task force through their encampment protest. Their Students for Justice in Palestine chapter secured a seat on the task force, and protesters investigated the school's investments. Since discovering the university's economic connections to Palantir, L3Harris, GE Aerospace, and RTX Corporation, they have been pressuring the administration to divest from the U.S. defense companies over their contracts with the Israeli military.

Last month, the University of San Francisco agreed to sell off its direct investments in the weapons manufacturers.

An organizer who spoke with Mondoweiss said the victory was achieved through the persistence of the student movement.

“It's been exhausting for students, but they haven't faltered,” she said. “People have worked to pressure the administration, whether it's through the student government or the alumni. Our comrades disrupted graduation last year. All these different things have increased our visibility.”

The activists acknowledge that this is a major win, but they say the fight is not over. They want the school to overhaul its investment strategy entirely and sever its remaining connections to Israel.

On May 7, Columbia University students occupied the school's Butler Library to protest the genocide in Gaza.

Columbia's administration quickly called in the cops. Roughly 80 people were arrested, and the school swiftly suspended students over the action, including some who didn't even participate in the protest.

In a statement, acting Columbia president Claire Shipman said she was compelled to call in police because the students were causing “substantial chaos.” She also blamed the Trump administration's targeting of campus activists on the protesters.

“I am deeply disturbed at the idea that, at a moment when our international community feels particularly vulnerable, a small group of students would choose to make our institution a target,” said Shipman.

In the New York Times, reporter Sharon Otterman contrasted the protest with the occupation of Columbia's Hamilton Hall last year, when the only public safety officer present left the scene.

“The university's newly assertive response satisfied many of those who were harshly critical of Columbia's management of last year's protests, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, which has cut more than $400 million in research funding from Columbia, citing what it called the university's failure to protect Jewish students,” wrote Otterman. “Columbia is negotiating with the task force in hopes of having the federal dollars restored.”

The Trump task force praised Shipman's response to the library occupation. “She has stepped in to lead Columbia at a critical juncture and has met the moment with fortitude and conviction,” said the group in a statement.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has promised to be helpful in any way possible to facilitate passage of legislation countering the Chinese regime's state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting.

The question came up at the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where Rubio testified on May 21 about the State Department's 2026 budget proposal.

Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), who co-led the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act (HR 1503), appealed to Rubio for help.

“You and I have worked on issues like forced organ harvesting,” Smith said to Rubio, noting that the two had co-chaired the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China to work on human rights issues in China.

“[Chinese leader] Xi Jinping is making billions by killing tens of thousands of young people, average age 28 each and every year,” Smith said. “And you know it—you're the sponsor of the bill.

While a Florida senator during the last Congress, Rubio had signed on to the Senate version of Smith's Act, which aims to sanction perpetrators of the abuse with a civil fine of up to $250,000 and criminal penalties of up to $1 million and 20 years in prison. The bill passed the House on May 7 by a near-unanimous vote, garnering 406 lawmakers' support.

Rubio, in response, called forced organ harvesting “concerning.”

“We would obviously be helpful in any way we can in helping you pass that in the Senate, certainly putting a good word for it and the like,” he said.

The Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act would sanction anyone implicated in the abuse, including members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), by freezing their assets, prohibiting transactions, revoking their visas, and eliminating other immigration benefits.

Rubio was outspoken about the issue as a senator. Last July, he led the Falun Gong Protection Act, which aims to deploy sanction tools to protect the principal victim group of forced organ harvesting, practitioners of the persecuted faith group Falun Gong. The bill also passed the House in May upon reintroduction in the 119th Congress.

In May 2024, Rubio and Smith sent a letter to then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, asking him to set up a reward program to seek firsthand evidence of the Chinese regime's illicit organ trade.

Smith's bill would require the United States to make an assessment on forced organ harvesting and trafficking in each foreign country.

“We will task the State Department to look at what's happening in every country,” and “determine whether or not there's a forced organ harvesting problem,” Smith told The Epoch Times on the day the House bill was passed.

“But nobody does it worse—nobody—than the People's Republic of China,” he said.

Smith noted that forced organ harvesting had been going on “far too long,” and without accountability, “it will continue to get worse.”

The act of killing for organs is “right out of Nazi Germany and Joseph Mengele ... the cruelty of what he did during the Third Reich,” he said.

Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a spiritual practice that encourages practitioners to abide by the core principles of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance. It was first introduced to the public in 1992 and grew rapidly in popularity, with official estimates indicating that at least 70 million people picked up the practice in China by 1999.

In 2019, the China Tribunal in London concluded that the Chinese regime had been forcibly harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience for years “on a substantial scale,” with Falun Gong practitioners being the “principal source” of organs.

In 2023, Texas became the first U.S. state to enact a law to combat the issue. The law bans health insurance providers from covering organ transplants involving organs sourced from China or any country linked to forced organ harvesting.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Last year, the United States appeared to be consolidating its pole position as a haven for international investment. The U.S. economy's remarkable strength relative to other major economies helped account for a nearly ten percent surge in the dollar's value in the fall of 2024. The economy and labor market continued to perform well leading up to and following Donald Trump's inauguration. And inflation was gradually falling back toward the Federal Reserve's target of about two percent.

But since he came into office, Trump has sowed doubt among both domestic and foreign investors. His “Liberation Day” announcement, on April 2, of across-the-board tariffs on all U.S. trading partners disrupted global trade and roiled financial markets. Even though the White House has paused or lowered some of those tariffs from their initial sky-high levels, the damage has been done. The uncertainty the tariffs fomented in international trade has hurt growth prospects for the remainder of this year. This is true in particular for the United States, because the tariffs affect virtually all U.S. trade. Consequently, it has become more likely that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates later this year to support the economy. This, in turn, has caused the value of the dollar to fall roughly back to its September 2024 level, before its ten percent increase.

These developments have even raised questions about the dollar's historic role as a refuge for international investment. In the past two decades, every instance of economic and financial turmoil resulted in a mad dash by investors around the world for safe financial assets in which to park their money while the storm blew over. As I argued in Foreign Affairs last summer, those instances invariably featured swelling demand for U.S. Treasury securities, long seen as the safest of assets because of the U.S. economy's stability and because these securities are available in large quantities and easily tradable. This higher demand typically pushes up the price of Treasury securities and drives down their interest rates, making it easier for both the U.S. government and American households to borrow cheaply. The inflow of money into dollar assets also props up the dollar itself.

After Trump's tariffs announcement, the reaction was different. Panicked investors seemed to prefer not U.S. Treasuries or other assets denominated in dollars but alternatives, such as Japanese government bonds and gold. Unlike in other recent episodes of turmoil, U.S. long-term interest rates spiked, especially the yield on the ten-year Treasury note, which serves as a benchmark for auto, mortgage, and business loans in the United States. Moreover, the dollar's value against other currencies—which had been stable during past unravelings of U.S. financial markets—fell.

With his economic policies, his attack on the Federal Reserve's independence, and the damage he's done to the rule of law in the United States, Trump has endangered not only the strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets but also the institutional framework that underpins the currency's longer-term dominance. Such conditions suggest that a reckoning is surely at hand for the dollar, which has lorded over international finance as the dominant invoicing, payment, and reserve currency for more than a century. That Trump has floated the idea of seeking other countries' cooperation to weaken the dollar—in a wishful bid to boost U.S. exports—only underlines the danger.

And yet the dollar's dethroning, a prospect that has long excited U.S. allies and adversaries alike, is unlikely if other countries don't seize the opportunity to supplant it. It appears that they are unprepared to do so. Despite Trump's weakening of the United States' economic position, investment assets in other major economies, including China, Japan, and the eurozone, remain less attractive relative to those in the United States. In some cases, these countries' weaker economic growth prospects have made their assets less alluring. In the eyes of investors, China is also hamstrung by both the restricted mobility of capital into and out of the country and the lack of independence of the Chinese central bank. Europe's own political turbulence, meanwhile, raises questions about the eurozone's stability.

The U.S. dollar's position at the top of the world's monetary system has never looked more tenuous. Luckily for the United States—and unfortunately for the dollar's detractors—there appears to be no competitor strong enough to bump it off its pedestal.

It is still unclear whether the global rush toward non-U.S. assets that quickened earlier this year marks the beginning of a trend or simply reflects technical and macroeconomic factors. The shifts in projections of U.S. growth and interest-rate levels brought on by Trump's tariffs announcement, for example, forced hedge funds that had taken highly leveraged bets on U.S. Treasuries to sell their stakes once those bets went awry. Macroeconomic forces have pushed in the same direction, leading purchasers of U.S. government debt to demand higher interest rates, an indicator that they anticipate higher inflation. With the United States on track to increase its already astronomical federal debt level and with the announced tariffs likely to push up inflation, it is small wonder that interest rates on the government's borrowing have risen, despite the prospect of a growth slowdown, which would normally push rates down.

The shift away from dollar assets might also be driven by investors wanting to diversify their holdings. For foreign investors, whether they are private or official—with the latter category including central banks and sovereign wealth funds—holding more than 50 percent of a portfolio in the assets of one country or denominated in that country's currency makes little sense. Such a high degree of concentration exposes investors to economic, financial, and geopolitical risks, all of which have intensified since Trump took office. Therefore, the purchase of non-U.S. assets might simply indicate an opportunistic shift by global investors toward the sensible goal of diversification.

But this shift could reach its limits soon, because other countries' currencies and financial markets simply lack the depth (the availability of great quantities of high-quality assets) and liquidity (the easy tradability of those assets) to support large inflows of capital. Similarly, although technological changes helping link different countries' payment systems with one another as well as the desires of global investors to diversify might erode the dollar's role as a payment currency for international transactions, there is little evidence so far that this is happening. The dollar continues to maintain a wide lead over all other currencies.

This lead is shrinking, however. History shows that the forces that can precipitate a sharp shift in a country's relative financial and currency power can accumulate over time, with the final switch occurring quickly. Consider the damage Trump is inflicting on the U.S. institutional framework, which is one of the crucial bulwarks underpinning both the dollar's dominance and the trust of domestic and foreign investors in the dollar-based financial system. Trump's degradation of the rule of law and his erratic policymaking should prompt foreign governments and central banks to lower their reliance on the dollar as an international payment and reserve currency, as should Trump's attacks on the independence of the United States' central bank. He has not only pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates but has also signaled that he may appoint to it more pliable senior officials who will do his administration's bidding on monetary policy and regulatory matters. His direct assault on the Federal Reserve's autonomy will have serious implications for the institution's ability to deliver on its mandates of maintaining low inflation and unemployment, which is a crucial driver of foreign investors' trust in the long-term value of the dollar.

It is premature, though, to write an obituary for the dollar's dominance, considering the fragilities of other reserve currencies and the enormous demand for safe financial assets at a time of economic and financial turmoil. The Japanese government bond market is certainly deep and is widely regarded as safe, as are bond markets in some of the core eurozone economies, such as Austria, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. But each of these alternatives is beset by weak growth prospects or turbulent domestic politics. The eurozone, for example, has made little progress in recent years toward greater economic and financial integration, and its core economies have taken a populist, rightward turn, presaging political instability. Such developments, along with rising budget deficits in these economies, hardly inspire confidence in investors for strong, stable growth.

China's economy is finally having to come to terms with its internal fragilities, too. The unraveling of the country's property markets continues to cause strains. The financial risks from its growth model, characterized by a heavy dependence on inefficient investment financed by bank credit, have become apparent to investors. China also remains unable to shake the specter of deflation stemming from how its production capacity has outpaced domestic consumer demand for its products in recent years. Household and private-business confidence in the government's policies and economic management have crumbled. And China hardly has the trust of foreign investors because of its weak institutional framework, with the Chinese Communist Party maintaining an iron grip over the country's economic, legal, and political systems.

Even as the U.S. dollar's perch at the apex of the international monetary system looks increasingly fragile, the lack of viable alternatives should keep it from tumbling off that perch—for now. As has long been the case, this resilience is less a product of American exceptionalism than of fundamental economic, political, and institutional weaknesses in the rest of the world. Unless that changes, the dollar will remain on a much longer leash than any currency should rightfully have.

Nearly two weeks after India and Pakistan reached an uneasy cease-fire, neither New Delhi nor Islamabad agree on what happened preceding it. India blames Pakistan for the April 22 terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that left 26 people dead; Pakistan denies responsibility. On May 7, India launched retaliatory missile strikes against targets in Pakistan associated with known terrorist groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed; both sides dispute the scale and impact of these attacks. That barrage prompted further salvos that led to the downing of Indian fighter jets (according to Pakistani and international media) and Pakistani jets (according to Indian media). Drones and missiles whizzed across the border in both directions, with the governments and national media offering dueling claims about targets hit, infrastructure destroyed, and lives lost. Fighting came to an end after senior U.S. officials pressed both sides to step back from the brink, but even here the fog of war prevails; while Islamabad thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for helping bring the fighting to an end, New Delhi denied that any mediation took place.

Although the dust remains in the air, some outcomes are clear. The recent fighting represents a significant escalation in the cross-border disputes that have periodically flared between India and Pakistan. Unlike India's limited punitive strikes in the past, this offensive pressed deeper into Pakistani territory. India's Operation Sindoor ranged far beyond Pakistani-administered Kashmir into Punjab, Pakistan's heartland, eventually hitting not just the facilities of militant groups but also military targets, including air bases. In recent decades, fighting has mostly been confined to the border region around the disputed territory of Kashmir. In May, Pakistan's major metropolises and many big cities in northern India were on high alert.

With its strikes, the Indian government hoped to demonstrate strength to a public that wanted revenge for the terrorist attack in Kashmir. But by venturing deeper into Pakistan and hitting a broad array of targets, India also wanted to reestablish deterrence and discourage Pakistan's military from backing militant groups active in Indian territory. In that effort, India will probably be disappointed. Rather than deterring its rival, India precipitated a retaliation that ended up burnishing the Pakistani military's reputation and boosting its domestic popularity. Paradoxically, India's retribution has handed the Pakistani army its biggest symbolic victory in recent decades. And that will hardly discourage Islamabad from reining in the proxy war against New Delhi or from risking future flare-ups between these two nuclear-armed states.

Pakistan's military has long used proxies against India. A group affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, which famously staged a bloody attack on Mumbai in 2008, claimed responsibility for the April massacre in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan denied any involvement in the incident, but that didn't persuade India. Soon after the attack, India took the unprecedented step of unilaterally suspending the Indus Water Treaty, an agreement brokered by the World Bank in 1960 to manage the flow of water critical for hydropower, irrigation, and agriculture in Pakistan. The treaty had endured several wars and militarized disputes between the two countries, but no longer. The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi eventually coupled this diplomatic act with its military attack on a slew of targets in Pakistani territory. It may have hoped that these efforts would assuage the domestic outrage over Pahalgam without provoking a wider conflict. But here New Delhi miscalculated.

Indian officials underestimated how much the Pakistani military needed to demonstrate its own war readiness and resolve, both to India and to its domestic audience. According to accounts in the Pakistani and international press, Pakistan's Chinese-made jets and air defense systems shot down several Indian fighter planes, including a French-made Rafale. That amounted to a major symbolic victory for Islamabad. It also encouraged Pakistan to test Indian air defenses with a spate of drone and missile attacks. And it revealed the limitations of India's presumed air supremacy, renewing the Pakistani military's confidence that it can hold its own in a limited conflict despite India's conventional superiority.

The crisis came when the public image of the Pakistani army and that of its chief, General Asim Munir, had plummeted. It has now helped restore the military's domestic legitimacy. Munir faced a backlash over the crackdown on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of Imran Khan, the country's former prime minister and most popular leader. The army had imprisoned Khan on politically motivated corruption charges in May 2023, prosecuted his supporters in military courts after they attacked military installations, and blatantly put its thumb on the scale in February 2024 parliamentary elections that cemented the power of PTI's major rivals. That political dissension was compounded by the country's parlous economic situation; Pakistan came close to a debt default in 2023, at a time when crippling inflation reached 38 percent. Economic angst has helped fuel political dissent. The army forcefully crushed a PTI march on Islamabad in November 2024, but the party's supporters inside and outside the country have waged a relentless campaign on social media against Munir, which the military has described as “digital terrorism.”



For the time being, that pressure has abated. To a domestic audience, the military has been able to present itself as a triumphant force, guarding the country from Indian aggression. A Gallup Pakistan poll found that 96 percent of Pakistanis believe their country was victorious in the recent fighting. The military's calls for national unity have momentarily drowned out public concerns over political repression and the country's deep economic woes. Munir has emerged from the confrontation with India stronger. As a reward for his leadership in “defeating the enemy,” the country's nominal civilian government has elevated Munir to the highest military rank of field marshal, making him only the second officer to hold that title after Mohammed Ayub Khan, the general who led the country for a decade after a military coup in 1958.

Worse for India, its attempt to reestablish deterrence backfired. New Delhi hoped that a punitive response, backed by the threat of economic coercion, might discourage Pakistan from engaging in proxy warfare. Instead, the recent hostilities will likely have the opposite effect. Indian attacks on militant sites in Muridke and Bahawalpur did little to damage Pakistan's jihadi infrastructure. The military-run Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan's most important intelligence agency, had ample time to relocate its prime assets to safety. In any case, planning and launching terror attacks on India is not dependent on fixed structures vulnerable to enemy fire. Pakistan fully retains its capacity to use terrorism to rattle India.

Indeed, far from deterring the Pakistani military, India's attacks may suggest to the generals that their provocative strategy is working. The military, which has ruled Pakistan for much of the country's history, has long used hostility toward India to deflect from its own failings. For example, with little evidence, it has blamed New Delhi for backing the resurgent Tehrik-e-Taliban, a militant group at war with the Pakistani state, as well as separatists in southwestern Balochistan province—India denies all these accusations. Even compared to his recent predecessors, Munir had taken a visibly hard-line approach to India. Less than a week before the Pahalgam attack, he invoked the “two-nation theory,” or Pakistan's founding idea that Hindus and Muslims are two distinct and fundamentally incompatible civilizations, at a convention in Islamabad. In his words, “Our religions are different, our cultures are different, our ambitions are different.” Describing Pakistan as a “hard state,” he vowed to continue backing the Kashmiris' “heroic fight” against Indian occupation.

Many in India, including Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, interpreted Munir's antagonistic posturing as evidence of his personal “religious bigotry.” But his remarks and subsequent actions also reflect the imperatives of the military as an institution. Although the general has conservative views, Pakistani officers are socialized into an organizational culture that fixates on India as an implacably hostile neighbor. The continued waging of Pakistan's subconventional war against India is ample proof that institutional indoctrination and interests matter more than the personal characteristics of the army's top commander. (Qamar Bajwa, Munir's immediate predecessor, was perceived as more conciliatory toward India, but even he presided over a major provocation, the February 2019 attack by Jaish-e-Mohammed on Pulwama that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers and prompted Indian airstrikes on Pakistani territory.) The recent fighting has not shaken these convictions. Indeed, Pakistan's generals are not about to change course.

The generals think that way even though the possibility of nuclear war looms over any conflict between the two neighbors. Although India has adopted a “no first use” policy since it tested nuclear weapons in 1998, senior Indian officials have indicated in recent years that the country's nuclear restraint is not cast in stone and that India may review the policy in the future. As the weaker South Asian power (in conventional terms), Pakistan does not have a no-first-use policy. Instead, it has maintained the right to strike first if faced with imminent defeat or major territorial losses to India. After India enunciated its “cold start” doctrine, a plan to launch a rapid conventional incursion to capture Pakistani territory as punishment for cross-border terrorism, in 2004, Pakistan further lowered the nuclear threshold by threatening to deploy tactical nuclear weapons against Indian forces on its territory.

It is not altogether surprising, then, that Pakistan has a penchant for nuclear posturing. Much to New Delhi's chagrin, Islamabad has successfully used the specter of nuclear war in its previous standoffs with India to precipitate a timely U.S. intervention. For example, according to then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the two sides came perilously close to a nuclear exchange during a 2019 crisis after India informed the Americans that Pakistan was preparing to deploy nuclear weapons. That threat triggered hectic American diplomacy that ultimately led to the return of the captured pilot of a downed Indian jet, providing both sides with an off-ramp.



In this round of violence, Pakistan also resorted to nuclear signaling. Ahead of India's retaliatory attack, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif warned the world in late April that Pakistan would consider using nuclear weapons if “there was a direct threat to our existence.” After India hit key Pakistani air bases, including the strategically located Nur Khan base close to the army's general headquarters and the country's nuclear command center, Pakistan did not just retaliate conventionally. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif immediately summoned an emergency meeting of the National Command Authority, which oversees the country's nuclear arsenal and is tasked with approving the use of the weapons, to send a calculated message to India—and everybody else. Modi has warned that Pakistan's “nuclear blackmail” will not prevent India from striking against terrorist sanctuaries on its soil, but the nuclear saber rattling sufficiently alarmed Washington that it stepped in. In fact, Trump has claimed that his administration did not just broker a cease-fire but also prevented a “nuclear conflict.”

An optimistic view of the confrontation would be that both sides responded with appropriate and measured retaliation without overplaying their hands. Put differently, the two rivals did not want to risk the catastrophic costs of a nuclear war and managed to find a timely off-ramp by inviting American mediation. (To be sure, India denies that the United States played a major role in producing the cease-fire, a rhetorical position that reflects New Delhi's insistence that its conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir is merely a bilateral issue, not one that needs “internationalization.”)

Although the crisis did not spiral to the nuclear level, its rapid escalation showed the paradoxical effects of the countries' ownership of nuclear weapons. Nuclear deterrence can reduce the probability of a full-scale conventional war but it can also breed instability by widening the space for lower levels of conflict, including skirmishes and terrorism. In other words, the possession of nuclear weapons may have incentivized risky confrontations that pass just below the ambiguous nuclear threshold. A pessimist could justifiably point to the hazardous outcomes that this dynamic could produce. As militaries strike a wider variety of targets with an ever-evolving arsenal of new weapons, the possibility of disaster balloons. No matter how rational Indian and Pakistani leaders may be, the risk of miscalculation or misunderstanding in the absence of reliable crisis communication channels makes every future flare-up more dangerous.

The cease-fire is by no means a lasting peace. Both sides have grounds to claim victory that can, for at least some time, keep a lid on tensions. Pakistan's military can boast of balancing India's conventional power, reviving international focus on the Kashmir dispute, and re-hyphenating India with Pakistan when India's great-power ambitions have it looking to shed the baggage of this local rivalry. For his part, Modi has bolstered his vaunted image of being a vigilant chowkidar, or watchman, among his Hindu nationalist base, pointing to the precise targeting of known militant centers deep inside Pakistan.

But two new dimensions—disinformation and drones—add unpredictable levels of danger to future standoffs. Although Pakistan's media were hardly objective in reporting the crisis, Indian TV news channels took war hysteria to a new peak by concocting or amplifying falsehoods, including strikes on the port of Karachi and the supposed capture of Pakistani cities. The jostling jingoistic media narratives further exacerbated tensions amid a lack of direct communication.

The introduction of armed drones has opened a new front in the conflict. As the crisis unfolded, fleets of loitering (self-detonating) drones launched by both sides created widespread public panic and fear. Drone technology will likely shape both escalation and restraint in future crises. India and Pakistan can more readily deploy drones and exacerbate tensions without the political and military risks associated with the use of manned aircraft. To be sure, the act of intercepting or destroying drones will probably be less escalatory than the shooting down of conventional aircraft. But the use of drones in great numbers widens the remit of any future clash, in turn widening the possibility of escalation.

Despite the cease-fire, New Delhi has asserted that it has merely paused its offensive. It could resume its attacks at any time to punish future incidents of cross-border terrorism. A single terror attack could destabilize the region by triggering another cycle of retaliation and counterretaliation. For now, Indian policymakers still likely believe that the Pakistani military has been at least temporarily deterred from future adventurism because of its higher expected costs. That is not how Pakistan's generals see it. They have emerged out of the crisis stronger and more determined to stand up to India, with their domestic position bolstered and their battlefield reputation enhanced. Cooler heads would exercise restraint from a proxy war because Pakistan can ill afford repeated confrontations with an economically and militarily more powerful rival—nor to court the risk of nuclear escalation. India, too, should not want perpetual conflict with Pakistan when it seeks to be a great power. But any respite from violence will likely be temporary as long as one side still believes that it has something to gain from assailing the other.

            Consumer advocates say the dropping of those legal actions removes protections that consumers can't replace on their own – giving businesses the green light to take advantage of customers without fear of penalty.
    


            “They're basically trying to take consumer financial protection down to zero and not defend people at all when they've been ripped off by banks and other financial services companies,” said Chuck Bell, financial policy advocate of Consumer Reports. “They've never seen a business practice they didn't approve of.”
    


            The White House, and most of the agencies, did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            Boeing agreed last year to plead guilty to defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. But now, the attorneys for families of those crash victims say the Justice Department has notified them it's prepared to drop that case.
    


            Boeing declined to comment on reports its criminal case will be dropped, but the attorneys for the crash victims called the decision “morally repugnant.”
    


            “Dismissing the case would dishonor the memories of 346 victims who Boeing killed through its callous lies,” said Paul Cassell, an attorney for many of the families, in a statement last Friday.
    


            The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            The Securities and Exchange Commission also dropped a case it had previously brought in 2023 against Coinbase, America's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accused the company of unlawfully making billions of dollars by acting as an exchange, broker and clearing agency “without having registered any of those functions with the Commission as required by law.”
    


            Coinbase, which had challenged the assertion and argued the SEC overreached, praised the decision to drop that case.
    


            The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Capital One during the final days of the Biden administration, accusing the company of “cheating millions of consumers” by not paying more than $2 billion in interest to holders of its high-interest savings accounts. Now that case, like many others brought by the CFPB, was dropped after the agency's director was dismissed and its funding was slashed. No new director has been named.
    


            The Department of Transportation sued Southwest Airlines in January under former President Joe Biden, seeking “maximum civil penalties” for operating two “chronically delayed flights” in 2022 that resulted in 180 flight disruptions. The Justice Department dropped that case quietly on Friday afternoon, with little comment. The Department of Transportation defended the decision in a statement.
    


            “This was a lawsuit that should have never been brought forward,” the department said in a statement to CNN. “Southwest has remedied the underlying issues and USDOT will work with them fairly, not sue them for political gain.”
    


            Both Capital One and Southwest said they appreciate the cases being dropped, arguing that the suits should never have been brought in the first place.
    


            “We welcome the CFPB's decision to dismiss this action, which we strongly disputed,” said Capital One.
    


            “We appreciate the DOT's decision to abandon its lawsuit against Southwest, which we believe is the correct result in this case,” said Southwest. “The two flights at issue occurred years ago when the industry faced unprecedented challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic and were delayed due to issues outside of Southwest's control in numerous cases.”
    


            The most recent relief for a business came Thursday from the Federal Trade Commission. It dropped a case brought in January by the Biden administration against PepsiCo that had accused the company of “unfair pricing advantages” with a large retailer. The retailer's name was redacted in the initial statement, but a source familiar with the case told CNN at the time that it was Walmart.
    


            FTC chair Andrew Ferguson in a statement called the Biden administration suit a “nakedly political effort to commit this administration to pursuing little more than a hunch that Pepsi had violated the law.”
    


            PepsiCo thanked the FTC for its action.
    


            “PepsiCo is pleased with the FTC's further consideration and withdrawal of this matter,” said the company in a statement. “PepsiCo has always and will continue to provide all customers with fair, competitive, and non-discriminatory pricing, discounts and promotional value.”
    


            Walmart did not immediate respond to a request for comment. But Walmart at the time told CNN it did not have a comment on the lawsuit.
    


            Trump has made clear he believes American businesses need to be freed from what he sees as unfair and undue enforcement actions.
    


            But it's not just less enforcement – the Trump administration also wants to make it easier for companies to move ahead with mergers, particularly in financial services. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a regulator that is part of the Treasury Department, announced new rules this month to make it easier to grant approvals of deals, including Capital One's effort to buy Discover.
    


            “Making it easier for well-managed and well-capitalized banks to merge promotes competition and facilitates economic growth and innovation,” said a statement from Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood.
    


            Consumer advocates are bringing legal challenges to combat the Trump administration's actions. But they say there is little hope they can entirely stop the gutting of consumer protection cases over the next three and a half years of Trump's term.
    


            “I think much of what the Trump administration has done is go after the very foundation of consumer protection,” said John Breyault, vice president of public policy for the National Consumers League. “It's not a surprise they would de-prioritize it. But they're seeking to make these agencies non-functional. That should worry all consumers.”

            Hours before President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs were set to take effect last month, he said, “These countries are calling us up, kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal. ‘Please, please, sir, make a deal. I'll do anything, I'll do anything, sir.”
    


            But the reality was that deals were not free-flowing. Instead, financial markets tanked after the tariffs took effect as impacted nations readied up retaliation plans, deepening the already steep losses markets experienced after Trump unveiled the rates on April 2. Even some of Trump's biggest supporters begged him to back down.



            Just over 12 hours after the tariffs took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause, ostensibly to buy more time to work on “bespoke” trade deals with impacted countries, he said.
    


            In the weeks since, Trump and administration officials have been constantly teeing up a slew of trade deals, claiming they're imminent. Talk is starting to get cheap — or, perhaps, more expensive.
    


            As Trump's self-imposed July 9 deadline for when “reciprocal” tariffs would resume inches closer, just one deal with the United Kingdom has so far been announced. Trump and administration officials are starting to hint at cracks in their plan to get individualized trade deals done in time.
    


            They blame it on other countries not negotiating in “good faith,” without elaborating on what that means. The punishment for that, though, is potentially even higher tariffs than the scorching rates announced in April.
    


            “At a certain point over the next two or three weeks, I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out essentially telling people — it will be very fair — but we'll be telling people what they'll be paying to do business in the United States,” Trump said last week, referring to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
    


            For reference, Trump also called his initial “reciprocal” rates, which went as high as 50%, fair. “The tariffs will be not a full reciprocal. I could have done that, yes, but it would have been tough for a lot of countries. We didn't want to do that,” Trump said at his April 2 Rose Garden event where he initially unveiled the tariff rates.
    


            In a Sunday interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Bessent alluded to a regional tariff scheme under consideration. “My other sense is that we will do a lot of regional deals: ‘This is the rate for Central America, this is the rate for this part of Africa,'” he said.
    


            If that's the case, countries with relatively lower rates that are near China, the administration's prime target for higher tariffs, are likely to face elevated levies.

The 3D-chess Trump trade theory is falling apart



            The White House and the US Treasury did not respond to CNN's inquiry regarding whether a country's proximity to China could influence the tariff rates it sees if a regional strategy is pursued.
    


            “The Trump administration's trade team is working around the clock to negotiate with other countries who do not want to lose access to the American economy, the biggest and best consumer market in the world,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told CNN in an emailed statement.
    


            “President Trump has been clear, however, that new trade deals must be custom-tailored to reduce the unfair trade barriers that have left American industries and workers behind,” he added in a statement to CNN.
    


            On the surface, the regional tariffs Bessent floated may sound somewhat arbitrary, since the administration has broadly said each trade deal would be bespoke.
    


            So, shifting to a system where countries are grouped together under blanket tariff policies risks, in some cases, throwing out the baby with the bathwater for countries whose trade practices are less disturbing to the administration.
    


            But there is an important practicality element to it, said Keith Rockwell, a former director at the World Trade Organization who is now a senior research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation.
    


            As it stands, there's a highly complex classification system the United States uses to assign tariff rates to specific products. The classification system is so granular that there are over 17,000 unique tariff product codes. If every country the US trades with has its own unique tariff rate in addition to the product rates, there would be millions of tariff combinations, he said.
    


            That's why the WTO has what's known as “Most-Favored Nation” tariff rates for its 166 member countries, which essentially is a ceiling of mutually agreed-upon import taxes, though those can vary by sector. “There's a reason why you negotiate things on a Most-Favored Nation basis: it's just a heck of a lot easier,” Rockwell told CNN.
    


            Furthermore, that is why countries are often drawn to entering regional trade agreements that can simplify and lower tariff rates. Some examples involving the US include, the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement.
    


            But grouping countries together poses another risk: It gives them more ammunition to retaliate against the United States than if the individual countries were on their own, he said.

Follow:


            The federal government may have partial answers on the purported causes of autism by this fall, but not the full picture, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised in April.
    


            Kennedy sat down with CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Thursday shortly after a White House event to release the Make America Healthy Again Commission's first report, which argued that ultaprocessed foods, environmental toxins and overmedication are driving a rise in childhood chronic illnesses.
    


            The commission's next report, spelling out strategies to combat chronic diseases across health, agricultural and environmental agencies, will be released this August, Kennedy said.
    


            But his self-declared deadline to distill the drivers of autism by September — as Kennedy announced in an April Cabinet meeting — is slipping.
    


            “We'll have some of the information [by September]. To get the most solid information, it will probably take us another six months,” Kennedy said Thursday. By the end of those additional six months, or roughly March, “I expect we will know the answers of the etiology of autism,” he said.
    


            Autism researchers and scientists have questioned the likelihood of delivering definitive conclusions on the drivers of autism in such a short timeframe, considering the years of research that is often undertaken in this area.
    


            That research has already identified likely factors leading to autism, including genetics and prenatal exposures.

            Yet Kennedy said Thursday that HHS “will have some studies completed by September,” primarily replications of previous research. “We're also deploying new teams of scientists, 15 groups of scientists. We're going to send those grants out to bid within three weeks,” he said.
    


            National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya has suggested that results could take longer. “Science happens at its own pace,” he told reporters in April, adding that he would like to see “preliminary results” within a year.
    


            The ability to replicate research, or repeat studies and arrive at the same results, has been a core priority of Bhattacharya and was highlighted in the MAHA report. Kennedy seemed to suggest Thursday that scientists could draw different conclusions from that research than those working on previous studies.
    


            Kennedy also addressed his terse exchanges in Senate hearings this month with Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has questioned his response to an ongoing lead crisis in Milwaukee public schools.
    


            Kennedy told senators during an appropriations hearing this week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a team on the ground in Milwaukee to help. The city said that is not true.
    


            In his interview with CNN, Kennedy clarified Thursday that the CDC is giving Milwaukee assistance “with their lab, their analytics and advice,” but said he did not know how many CDC officials were onsite in Milwaukee.
    


            CNN's Collins said there was one technician on the ground, before Kennedy referenced those hearings.
    


            “You could hear my other exchanges with Tammy Baldwin,” he said. “And anyway, I'm not necessarily believing what Senator Baldwin says.”
    


            Kennedy also addressed the pushback from major agricultural groups Thursday over the MAHA report's inclusion of studies suggesting toxic exposure from commonly used herbicides.
    


            Organizations including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Corn Growers Association released statements saying the insinuations about pesticide risks could erode Americans' confidence in the national food supply.

            Asked about their criticisms, Kennedy emphasized the need for farmers and the agricultural industry to be on board with the MAHA agenda.
    


            “If we lose the farmers, the MAHA agenda is bankrupt,” he said. “We don't want to put a single farmer out of business. What we want to do is create incentives and innovation to allow them to innovate themselves, to use less chemical intensive [methods,] but we're not a nanny state.”
    


            Collins also asked Kennedy about the affordability of whole foods compared to less expensive ultraprocessed options.
    


            “It's an illusion to think that processed food is cheap, because you end up paying for it with diabetes, you end up paying for it with autoimmune dysregulation, with mitochondrial dysfunction, with inflammation, and you end up paying much higher costs in the long run,” he said.
    


            Kennedy also doubled down on comments during a budget hearing last week, when he said that Americans should not take medical advice from him.
    


            “They probably shouldn't take medical advice from any HHS secretary,” he said Thursday. “I'm somebody who is not a physician. But they should also be skeptical about any medical advice. They need to do their own research.”
    


            Kennedy pointed to frustrations with medical experts during the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            “I would say, be skeptical of authority. My father told me that when I was a young kid, people in authority lie,” the health secretary said.

            Millions of low-income Americans, including families with children, could lose their food stamp benefits under House Republicans' newly passed tax and spending cuts package, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released Thursday.
    


            Others could see smaller monthly assistance.
    


            The analysis is the latest to show the impact of the historic cuts to the nation's safety net programs contained in the package, which aims to fulfill President Donald Trump's agenda. The legislation would provide trillions of dollars in tax cuts while slashing federal support for food stamps and Medicaid to help offset the cost. The package, however, is expected to undergo multiple changes in the Senate, where some lawmakers have already expressed concerns about the safety net provisions.
    


            As written, the bill would reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, the official name for food stamps, by roughly $286 billion over the next decade, according to the CBO analysis, which was requested by Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Angie Craig, ranking members of the Senate and House agriculture committees, respectively. House Republicans have said the measures are intended to “restore integrity” to the program, which provides aid to roughly 42 million Americans.
    


            Among the most consequential and controversial provisions are expanding the program's existing work requirements to many older Americans, and, for the first time, to many parents. Also, states would have less flexibility in waiving these requirements during tough economic times.
    


            These measures would strip roughly 3.2 million people of their food stamp benefits in an average month over the next decade, CBO estimates. This includes 800,000 people who live with children ages 7 and older.
    


            States would have to share in the cost of the benefits for the first time, shouldering between 5% and 25% of the cost depending on their payment error rate. State responses would vary, but some “would modify benefits or eligibility and possibly leave the program altogether because of the increased costs,” CBO projects.

            The provision would lead states to reduce or eliminate food stamp benefits for about 1.3 million people in an average month over the decade, CBO estimates. Also, subsidies for child nutrition programs would decrease for about 420,000 children during that period.
    


            Other measures in the bill, including capping annual increases in benefits, would also reduce monthly assistance. And a provision tightening eligibility for noncitizens would leave between 120,000 and 250,000 people without aid.
    


            CBO noted that the coverage loss projections are for each set of provisions individually and do not account for overlap in the people who could be affected. Its analysis does not provide an overall figure for how many people would lose access to food stamps.
    


            The House bill also calls for introducing the first-ever work requirement to Medicaid, which could leave millions of low-income Americans without health coverage, according to experts.

A California State freshman died in an accidental drowning while vacationing with fellow fraternity members in Arizona over the weekend, according to the Sigma Pi Fraternity at Cal State Fullerton. 

Simon Daniel, 18, was visiting Lake Havasu River with his fraternity on Saturday when he decided to go for a swim with friends. 

The college freshman entered the water with three fraternity brothers and two sorority members when ""unbeknownst to them, recent heavy rains in the Havasu Valley region had significantly increased water flow, creating hazardous conditions including strong currents, crosswinds and swells,"" the fraternity said in a statement on Facebook.

Tyler Saltsman, founder and CEO of EdgeRunner AI, warns that creating artificial general intelligence could ""destroy the world as we know it.""

Whether it's powering your phone's autocorrect or helping someone create a new recipe with a few words, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere right now. But if you're still nodding along when someone mentions ""neural networks"" or ""generative AI,"" you're not alone.

Today I am breaking down five buzzy AI terms that you've probably seen in headlines, group chats or app updates, minus the tech talk. Understanding these basics will help you talk AI with confidence, even if you're not a programmer.

Stay tuned for more in this series as we dive deeper into privacy-related tech terms and other essential concepts, answering the top questions we get from readers like you.

The big umbrella term 

Artificial Intelligence is a broad term for computer systems that can do tasks normally requiring human intelligence. That includes understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions and even learning from experience.

You're using AI when:

Think of AI as the category; everything else on this list is a branch of it. It's the foundation for all the smart tools we use today, from voice assistants to facial recognition. As AI continues to evolve, it has the power to make everyday tasks easier, faster and more personalized. But as it becomes more embedded in our lives, understanding the basics is key to using it wisely and protecting your digital autonomy.

AI TECHNOLOGY HELPS REUNITE LOST DOGS WITH THEIR OWNERS 

How AI learns patterns

Machine Learning is a type of AI that learns from data instead of being explicitly programmed. It improves over time by finding patterns and making predictions.

For example: You like action movies. You watch a few. Over time, the algorithm learns your preferences and recommends similar titles, even if you didn't say anything directly.

Common uses of ML:

ML is how AI ""gets smarter"" by itself, and it's a big part of how tech becomes more helpful and intuitive. From catching suspicious charges on your credit card to curating your favorite music, machine learning can make life more seamless and even safer. But as with any technology, it's important to stay aware of how your data is being used and who's doing the learning. The more we understand how it works, the better we can decide how and when to trust it.

The tech that mimics your brain

Neural Networks are a special kind of machine learning designed to mimic how the human brain works, at least loosely. They're made up of layers of ""neurons"" that process data and make decisions.

They're particularly good at recognizing complex patterns, like identifying faces in photos or translating languages.

Use cases include:

If AI is the brain, neural networks are the brain cells doing the work. Neural networks are the part of AI that actually processes information. They're designed to mimic how human brains work, taking in data, learning patterns and making decisions. So, when AI recognizes a face, writes a sentence or makes a suggestion, it's neural networks making that happen behind the scenes.

FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: THE SCHOOL WHERE AI RUNS THE CLASSROOM

AI that creates, not just predicts

Generative AI doesn't just analyze data, it creates new stuff: text, images, videos, code, music, even voices. It's trained on huge amounts of content and learns how to generate something new that mimics the original.

You've seen it in action if you've used:

It's like giving a machine a vibe and watching it invent something that fits. Generative AI is creative, fast and sometimes uncannily realistic, which is what makes it both exciting and a little unsettling.

Think you can tell the difference?Be sure to play my game to guess which photo is AI and which one is real. It's harder than you think and a good reminder that as these tools get more advanced, staying alert and informed is more important than ever.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Find the fake kitten. (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

FIND THE FAKE: KITTENS

The magic words that make AI work

A prompt is the input you give to an AI system, usually a question, command or description. It's how you talk to tools like ChatGPT or image generators.

The better your prompt, the better the result.

Examples:

Prompts are to AI what questions are to Google, but with more creativity and conversation. Unlike a search engine that simply points you to existing content, AI can generate entirely new ideas, images and text based on what you ask. It's more than a search box; it's a creative tool. Whether you're drafting a story, designing a logo or planning a vacation, learning how to prompt effectively lets you tap into AI's full potential as a collaborator, not just an information source.

DON'T MISS OUT ON THESE MEMORIAL DAY BEST DEALS & DISCOUNTS

You don't need a computer science degree to understand AI, just a few solid definitions. From machine learning and neural networks to generative AI and prompts, these tools are no longer reserved for tech labs; they're becoming part of your everyday life. Whether it's helping you write an email, organize your photos or get dinner ideas based on what's in your fridge, AI is already working behind the scenes to make life a little easier (and sometimes a lot more interesting).

Now that you've got the lingo down, you'll be better equipped to navigate the AI-powered world with confidence and curiosity.

Julie Chapon, co-founder of the New York-based Yuka food rating app, tells Fox News Digital how it scores different food products to help shoppers make informed decisions about what they buy.

As health-conscious Americans look for ways to eat better, there is a mobile app that shoppers can use to guide them at the grocery store, sometimes with surprising outcomes.

Yuka is a free app that proponents of the Make America Healthy Again movement are embracing – even U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

""I use Yuka,"" Kennedy told Fox News Digital in April.

EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT MAHA

Developed in France, Yuka expanded to the U.S. in 2022.

It has been gaining ground, with about 25,000 new users each day, co-founder Julie Chapon told Fox News Digital. (See the video at the top of this article.) 

""I think consumers are really being more conscious now about what they want to eat – and there is really this need to have access to more transparent information,"" said Chapon from New York City. 

Sam Stark, a public relations consultant in New York City, said she uses the app ""about every other shopping trip, mostly when I'm considering adding something new to our meals.""

""My husband and I eat as [healthfully] as possible with minimal processed foods, but we also want variety,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""It's become a regular part of my shopping routine when I'm browsing unfamiliar products.""

Many times, Stark said, she'll avoid a food product that has scored poorly. 

""I often use it to compare similar products, such as which granola is actually the healthiest option,"" she said. 

Some users of the Yuka app have said they use it routinely while shopping. (Yuka)

""The results can be surprising.""

""I've limited and given up foods I really enjoyed as well, like this blue cheese dressing I loved, after seeing the rating. Sometimes the app tells you what you need to hear to make better choices.""

""Sometimes the app tells you what you need to hear to make better choices.""

Stark also introduced her friend to Yuka.

FARMERS COME FIRST AS INITIATIVE AIMS TO LOWER THEIR COSTS, GET FRESH FOOD TO AMERICANS MORE EFFICIENTLY

Cristina Cote, a New York-based real estate broker, told Fox News Digital that she uses the app every time she shops, ""especially when exploring new products.""

""I appreciate Yuka as a tool to be mindful and make healthy choices,"" Cote said.

She's also cut out products that score poorly on the app.

'GOD-INTENDED FOODS' ARE KEY TO A HEALTHIER AMERICA, EXPERT SAYS

""If I find out that a product I like is not well-rated, I will stop buying it and replace it with something healthier and [purer],"" she said. 

""It can be disheartening when you find out something you enjoy contains harmful ingredients.""

Yuka lets users scan the bar codes of food products, generating a score from one to 100 based on three criteria: nutritional quality (60% of the rating), the presence of additives (30%) and whether the product is organic (10%), Chapon said.

AMERICAN NUTRITION A TOP PRIORITY FOR MAHA AS THE 'KNOWLEDGE DOC' WEIGHS IN

The scores are then color-coded into four different categories: excellent (dark green), good (light green), poor (orange) and bad (red).

""You also have access to a detailed information sheet on each product to understand why the rating is good or bad,"" Chapon said. 

The Yuka app is color-coded, with bright green signifying the best products and red representing the worst. (Yuka)

If an item receives a poor or bad rating, Yuka recommends similar products with a better ranking. 

""The app is 100% independent,"" Chapon said. ""We receive absolutely no money from brands or manufacturers to influence our evaluations or recommendations.""

Although Yuka isn't affiliated with MAHA, Chapon credits the increasingly popular movement for the app's ascent – and for challenging the food industry.

""I think the MAHA movement has also fueled this interest,"" Chapon said.

Yuka also has a feature that allows users to call out a food maker with a high-risk additive.

Since the feature launched in November, more than 600,000 callouts have been made, Chapon said.

Julie Chapon, shown above, says the Yuka app she co-founded is steadily growing since it was introduced to the U.S. in 2022. (Yuka)

""A lot of brands have received a lot of emails – and they are very mad,"" Chapon said. ""But that's part of our mission and we know it's risky.""

Among the brands that have had dialogue with Yuka are Tru drinks and Chobani, Chapon said.

For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle

Both companies ""were really interested in improving their ratings and understanding why they don't have good ratings.""

Fox News Digital made multiple requests for comment to Tru drinks and Chobani about the app's rating system.

Yuka's co-founder (not pictured) hopes the app will ""help people make better choices for their health"" when shopping for groceries. (iStock)

Ultimately, Chapon said she hopes the app will ""help people make better choices for their health"" and ""push manufacturers to improve what they put in their products.""

""We have many brands starting to really pay attention and trying to understand how they can do better. Sometimes they just don't realize they are using very controversial ingredients.""

""We are here to help them to improve,"" she added.

Charlie Hurt tours an oil rig in the Gulf of America with Energy secretary Doug Burgum on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' 

As the Secretary of Energy honored to play a role in implementing the historic agenda of President Trump's first term, it was deeply troubling to watch Joe Biden spend four years undoing that progress with a relentless war on American energy.

President Biden failed to grasp that affordable, reliable energy is the cornerstone of fighting inflation, creating jobs, and ensuring our national security. His crackdown on all forms of energy left us weaker on all three fronts.

Thankfully, the voters delivered a mandate last November, ushering President Trump back to restore America's energy dominance – and he has been putting on a clinic the last four months by ramping up homegrown energy production at an unprecedented pace.

GOP LAWMAKERS MOVE TO ROLL BACK BIDEN-ERA ENERGY PROGRAMS

By declaring a National Energy Emergency on his first day in office, the President showed that reviving our energy capabilities is a top priority. He followed this by rescinding Biden's efforts to freeze domestic oil and natural gas production. And in April, the White House issued executive orders to increase coal production, safeguard the energy industry from state overreach, and protect an energy grid that had become increasingly unreliable during the prior administration.

These actions have already led to a 12% year-over-year gas price reduction. And more relief is on the way. The reconciliation bill Republicans advanced in the House yesterday is packed with provisions championed by the president to drive a surge in domestic energy production. Some key measures include:

While this is a powerful blueprint for growth, there is one significant shortfall: the bill's approach to certain energy tax credits. 

The House budget bill indiscriminately phases out or repeals nearly every major tax credit from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act—including credits for electricity generation (45Y and 48E), hydrogen production (45V), and advanced manufacturing (45X). While it may be sensible to phase out credits during a carefully planned transition period, it is not good policy to make abrupt changes that stifle investment and create uncertainty. With so much at stake right now, it is crucial that we do not eliminate the policies that support actual U.S. energy production and keep energy costs low.

In the face of soaring demand—driven by AI, data centers, industrial reshoring, and electrification—every molecule or megawatt we disincentivize contributes to market scarcity and rising costs. These are not academic choices, but critical price signals. Pulling energy production offline now—whether fossil, renewable or otherwise— makes America less secure and American consumers poorer.

As Vice President Vance noted earlier this year, the surest way to fight Biden-era inflation is to lower energy costs – that means growing, not shrinking, our domestic supply.

It's also important to acknowledge the economic reality: these credits are lowering consumer costs, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and supporting billions of dollars in private sector investment—much of it in Republican-led states. Gutting these incentives indiscriminately would strain the economy and risk political backlash in key districts at a time when conservative leadership has never been more necessary.

President Trump understands this. That's why he created the National Energy Dominance Council and embraced an all-of-the-above energy approach – not as a slogan, but as a strategy. America wins when we produce everything: oil, gas, coal, nuclear, and renewables. Taking any of them off the table – whether by regulation or tax policy – weakens our position.

We should celebrate the wins this administration has already delivered. But we shouldn't offset them by slashing energy tax credits that genuinely drive production, create jobs, and enhance our national security.

The goal is dominance, not disruption. Congress should act accordingly.

Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang dissects President Donald Trump's relations with China and the Chinese economy on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

The recent announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and China is making headline news. It's a political and economic win for President Trump and his administration and it's a clear achievement in the president's America First policy agenda. But while the news of a trade deal with China marks a new dynamic in the U.S.-China relationship, it is still important that we recognize the fact that China continues to pose a major national security threat that no trade deal will immediately fix – especially with the use of Chinese technology by government officials, at the state and federal level, as a national security risk that must be taken seriously.

Chinese-made devices collect critical information and data which, as mandated by the Chinese government, must be shared with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). That means that our most threatening adversaries, like China in this case, could have direct access to sensitive information on U.S. citizens, government communications, military planning, and even defense and critical infrastructure systems. This self-inflicted wound presents a serious threat, yet it does not heal – it persists year after year due to the absence of clear federal direction from the U.S. government.

As someone who served on the frontlines of our homeland security, I find it baffling that we continue allowing this. We permit the U.S. government to gather and store data and conduct critical communications and defense coordination on technologies with a direct line of access to a foreign adversary through their data collection laws. This should be unacceptable.

HEGSETH REVEALS PLANS TO COUNTER CHINA, STAY AHEAD IN ARMS RACE AS PENTAGON PIVOTS TO INDO-PACIFIC

Every time Chinese-made devices enter our government or connect to our networks they jeopardize our national security and the safety of Americans across this great country and in battlegrounds around the world.

What's needed now is bold action to stop this practice – something that only President Trump and today's Congress can deliver on.

As a first step, the Trump administration should immediately consider imposing a government-wide ban across all federal agencies, like the ones I previously served in, on the procurement of computers and other interoperable devices and technologies manufactured by Chinese-domiciled companies.

In turn, Congress should also consider passing federal legislation enshrining this principal, ensuring that national security takes precedent.

Such action would protect critical government infrastructure and citizen's data and prevent Chinese companies from inserting so-called ""made in America"" backdoor manufacturing policies into devices that compromise our security.

Lawmakers need to understand the stakes, and the solution for our national security is quite simple.

President Trump is already proving his commitment to confronting China's growing influence in U.S. foreign affairs through bold tariffs, trade deals, and a peace through strength defense strategy. From his trade policies to his efforts to decouple certain sectors of the American economy from China, he is showing the drive and willingness to take strong action.

We cannot afford to let foreign adversaries weaken our technological foundations. Our national defense depends on secure and trustworthy systems. Allowing Chinese technology into our government's operations undermines that security. The U.S. is far too strong a nation to be undermined by foreign-made technology designed to infiltrate and compromise our systems.

Our American future is at stake. Our way of life is at stake. And these stakes are simply far too high to do anything less. President Trump's leadership to embolden Congress will put America first. I'm confident Congress will do what is right. American lives are on the line.

USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt was grilled by the DOGE subcommittee after Stephanie Turner was punished for refusing to face a trans competitor.

Just over a year ago, I argued in Fox News that national governing bodies like USA Volleyball and USA Fencing were corruptibly operating outside of accountability. Now they are saying the quiet part out loud, admitting in Congressional testimony and written policy that they won't comply with female-safety/opportunity standards unless ""required by oversight bodies."" Female athletes like me have suffered the devastating consequence of the lack of NGB oversight, and it is time Congress and the White House finally call them out.

USA Fencing released a ""Revised Transgender & Non-Binary Athlete Eligibility Policy"" earlier this month with the added note ""it will only be implemented if required by oversight bodies."" This follows their humiliating spotlight when female fencer Stephanie Turner had to bow out of her own competition when the rule makers allowed a male opponent to jeopardize her safety. The USA Fencing-sanctioned event issued her a disqualifying black card as a ""direct result of her decision to decline to fence an eligible opponent.""

Their ""inclusive"" message was exposed in the light—it's nothing but discriminatory exclusion.

USA FENCING TRANSGENDER CONTROVERSY ESCALATES AT DOGE HEARING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA REGRETS, CALLS FOR RESIGNATION

The story doesn't end with Stephanie. Reduxx continues to uncover more men masquerading as women in USA Fencing competitions, some of which hold leadership positions within the organization. Their elevated platforms affirms the ideologically captured state of the board who voted against playing the national anthem at championships earlier this year and openly admits to factoring ratings from LGBTMAP.org and healthcare access (abortion laws) into fencing site selection.

Congress certifies these sports' national governing bodies (NGBs) through the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act. Doing this largely yields oversight responsibilities to the USOPC, which generally allows for regulatory autonomy.

But this yielded authority is not just about general rules of sport; it directs eligibility standards, informs university rulemaking, dictates how our country is represented in the Olympics, and more.

It's hard to ignore the politically charged nature of athletics in today's climate, from covering USA jerseys in sexual pride to recognizing DEI as a core tenant of sports governance (see: USOPC ""Diversity Scorecards""). It is clear; the USOPC's passivity has enabled the NGB's to operate as extended political arms with Congressional approval and very little accountability.

But their politically-charged discrimination has now made its way to the national stage.

Last month, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) penned a letter to USA Fencing requiring they ""must comply with United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee rules and procedures, its statutory obligations to protect women, and President Trump's recent Executive Order (EO) on Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" to keep their NGB certification.

While the NGBs already hold a specific obligation to ensure fairness and safety, President Trump's executive order specifically clarifies the secretary of state must ""use all appropriate and available measures to see that the International Olympic Committee amends the standards governing Olympic sports to promote fairness, safety, and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women's sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.""

Sen. Cruz's letter brought the weight of the Upper Chamber in his demands for documentation, clarity on how many men were competing in their women's categories, answers for their compliance in accordance with the executive order, and more.

In the House of Representatives, the DOGE subcommittee invited Stephanie Turner and USA Fencing Board Chair Damien Lehfeldt to testify in a hearing on May 7th. After refusing the invitation, the Committee required Mr. Lehfeldt's appearance by issuing a subpoena. Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said USA Fencing ""should not be recognized as the National Governing Body for fencing if it continues to defy the law.""

During the hearing, Mr. Lehfeldt said he is ""prepared to pivot"" if the Ted Stevens Act is amended or the IOC directs them. But it begs a greater question; why must the federal government force them to protect female athletes? Why hasn't the USOPC stood up for female athletes?

Without the accountability of the people and their elected representatives, NGBs have pursued policy goals that hurt women and undermine our country's values. Congress and the White House must continue to strengthen enforcement through the USOPC and remind NGBs that our country is a place for opportunity, not politically charged discrimination.

Senate Republicans are vowing a major rewrite of President Donald Trump's “one big, beautiful bill” despite House leadership's pleas not to undo the carefully crafted legislation.

House and Senate leaders are broadly aligned on the tax bill and have been meeting regularly to avoid points of conflict. But Senate Republicans made clear the compromise, a product of frenzied last-minute negotiations, must be negotiated again after it passed the House by a single vote on Thursday.

Committee leaders want to make their imprint on the legislation in a series of markup hearings, while the infighting over its price tag, which nearly paralyzed the House, will now be litigated in the Senate.

“No, of course not,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), the chairman of the Commerce Committee, said Thursday when asked if he supported the bill. “The Senate will change it significantly.”

In some ways, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) will inherit the same headaches that plagued Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for weeks. Both have a three-seat majority, lending little margin for error despite an ideological gulf between fiscal hawks and a bloc of centrists.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), one of those hawks, suggested the Freedom Caucus had failed despite extracting $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. He promised to oppose the bill unless it committed to hundreds of billions in additional offsets.

“It's a lot easier to pressure House members than it is us; that's just a basic fact,” Johnson said.

At the same time, Senate Republicans are more averse to Medicaid reforms passed in the House. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), among others, is taking issue with changes to a provider tax that helps states finance Medicaid programs.

“If you fool around with that provider tax in my state, you really risk getting to benefit cuts there,” Hawley said.

The House speaker reached delicate compromises on those and other political flashpoints. He erred on the side of satisfying the Freedom Caucus, but centrists also got major concessions and avoided the deepest cuts.

The deal came together shortly after Trump made a final push to win over holdouts. On Tuesday, he visited the Capitol and later hosted Freedom Caucus members at the White House.

After a hard-fought win in the House, Speaker Johnson has urged the Senate “to modify this as little as possible” to avoid another showdown when the bill is sent back. But the upper chamber has other ideas.

Senate Republicans seem open to the higher cap on the state and local tax deduction, a key demand of blue-state House members who ensured the $10,000 limit was lifted to $40,000.

One of Johnson's steepest concessions to fiscal hawks, an accelerated rollback of Biden-era green energy tax credits, is also expected to face Senate scrutiny, given that many red states benefit from them.

“I think that even if we're going to revise them, we've got to make sure that businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) told reporters.

Some changes to the House bill were expected, thanks to the strict rules of reconciliation, a budget process that allows Republicans to sidestep the filibuster.

Sen. John Boozman (R-AK), the Agriculture chairman, said one of the first steps toward passage is running his committee's language by the parliamentarian, a nonpartisan arbiter of Senate rules.

“We don't know,” Boozman said of what will be permitted. “We'll be checking with the parliamentarian to see if any of the things that they've done violate the Byrd Rule. And then that doesn't necessarily mean that we'll do them all, but we'll know what's possible and what's not.”

He also noted concern from some Republican members over changes to food stamps that shift the cost burden onto states. 

Other points of friction include the sale of spectrum licenses, with defense hawks warning that the House legislation does not adequately protect the Pentagon's most sensitive radio frequencies from being sold to the private sector.

“I do not believe the votes are here in the Senate unless they make that modification,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), a member of the Armed Services Committee. “I'm convinced we'll get to ‘yes' on it, but it will require fixes in the spectrum portion of it.”

Hawley separately indicated his interest in a higher child tax credit than the $2,500 currently contemplated in the bill.

“Anything higher would be good,” Hawley said.

He also revealed that Trump again lobbied for the so-called carried interest loophole to be closed in a Wednesday evening phone call, though that change is unlikely.

Senate leaders were reluctant to put a date on when they would pass their version of the megabill, but have set Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's requested date of July 4 as an aspirational goal.

“Yet to be determined,” Thune told the Washington Examiner when asked about a Senate timeline.

Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID), the Senate's top tax writer, said the threat of default creates a hard-and-fast deadline for Congress, with Bessent predicting the Treasury will run out of money in August.

“I never do timelines or deadlines, but there is a debt ceiling in there,” Crapo said. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion increase to the debt limit. 

Complicating that deadline is the risk that Republicans must reconcile their two bills and pass them through each chamber. There are fewer procedural hurdles in the House, whereas the Senate would be forced to undergo another marathon session on the Senate floor known as a “vote-a-rama.”

“I think our goal ought to be the Senate should make the changes we need to make, and then send it back to the House — and that'd be the end of it,” said Hawley.

BIDEN CANCER DIAGNOSIS FUELS GOP INVESTIGATIONS ON CAPITOL HILL

In the meantime, Senate Republicans will be juggling the “one big, beautiful bill” alongside other priorities such as cryptocurrency legislation and the 2026 appropriations process.

Senators departed town on Thursday for a one-week Memorial Day break, but Boozman insisted the recess was not time wasted, telling the Washington Examiner that staff will continue coordinating on the bill text.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Revelations about former President Joe Biden's mental and physical decline in office have set off a credibility crisis in the Democratic Party that may take years to overcome, according to political strategists.

Biden, 82, faced public skepticism about his ability to carry out presidential duties after he decided to run for reelection. New reporting from several books, such as Original Sin, suggests that the former president's allies knew he was cognitively unable to handle reelection and purposely hid that knowledge from the public. 

COMER INVESTIGATES BIDEN'S DOCTOR AND AIDES, CALLING FOR CONGRESSIONAL INTERVIEWS

Biden's surprise announcement last week of aggressive prostate cancer has reignited questions about his tenure in the White House. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have called for investigations into Biden's aides and health team to determine who was running the White House and signing government documents. 

Dave Carney, a Republican strategist based in New Hampshire, thinks the Democratic Party's credibility may be shot for a generation.

“Does anybody believe what Enron says?” he asked, referring to the Fortune 500 company that succumbed to a billion-dollar accounting scandal in 2001. “This is a catastrophic ethical line that they've crossed. Even their biggest defenders in the media have turned on them. No one believes accounting from Enron post-collapse, and no one is going to believe what Democrats say post-collapse.”

Carney said the Democratic Party will require a massive change in leadership before anyone buys what it's selling, and that regaining trust is very difficult in politics. 

The decisions of Biden's inner circle have rippled out to the entire Democratic Party, which is suffering from historically low approval ratings.

The fallout for Democrats couldn't come at a worse time, as they are trying to develop a cohesive strategy to counter Trump as he upends foreign and domestic policy at a dizzying pace.

But as they go on offense, including against the GOP budget reconciliation bill as a giveaway to billionaires, Republicans counter that Democrats who defended or even downplayed Biden's health problems can't be trusted on any issue. 

“The same people who have been telling you that President Biden's health was just fine are now telling you all these other things about millionaires and billionaires,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) said on the House floor before final passage of the “one big, beautiful bill” legislation.

Republicans intend to keep the spotlight on Democrats with investigations into Biden's use of an autopen to conduct presidential business and whether the former president's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, lied to the public about Biden's health problems.

Biden last received a prostate-specific antigen blood test, which helps detect prostate cancer, in 2014, according to a spokeswoman. On top of the decision not to give Biden a cognitive test, the disclosure raised fresh questioning about why O'Connor would have allowed Biden to go more than a decade without the cancer screening.

“As we keep learning, the concerns over Biden's health as president were very real and deeper than most know, and questions of how we were being governed are legitimate,” said Douglas Heye, a GOP strategist and a former Republican National Committee communications director. “These questions aren't going away, and if Democrats want to move past this and try to rebuild the trust they squandered, they should want to have this resolved as soon as possible.”

Ford O'Connell, another GOP strategist, claimed the severity of Biden's problems and other members of his administration couldn't be ignored.

“You cannot let this go by. This can never happen again, regardless of party, because you're talking about national security,” said O'Connell. “And add in all the other stuff that went on during this, like Lloyd Austin just disappears for three days. There's some people that need to be legally held accountable after the dust settles.”

O'Connell was referencing the stunning revelation that Biden's former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin kept his prostate cancer diagnosis and hospitalization for treatment hidden from the public last year.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Democrats' handling of Biden's health “truly one of the worst political scandals this country has ever seen. That the previous administration covered up the decline in the former president's mental and physical ability, and it's now all coming out.”

A Democratic operative, who requested anonymity to speak freely, claimed, “Democrats will restore accountability when we produce candidates voters can trust.”

Democrats are still struggling to determine how best to counter Trump and win back voters who historically voted blue but drifted to the GOP under Trump. In addition to Biden's decline, Democrats are also in a fierce internal debate over age and elderly lawmakers blocking the next generation from leadership.

These issues, which some Democrats claim are distractions, have made it harder for the party to unite to oppose Trump ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, a boon to the GOP.

“The problems that face the Democrats are far deeper than Joe Biden's obvious infirmities,” said GOP strategist John Feehery. The bigger problem is “they have abandoned the white working class, which used to be the heart of their party.”

TRUMP RAMPS UP QUESTIONING OF BIDEN'S FITNESS AS DEMOCRATS CALL FOR A COOLDOWN

To fix it, Ohio-based GOP strategist Jai Chabria says the party will need not only its own Trump-like figure to give it new direction in 2028, but its own Joe Rogan to carry that message to the masses because the media is also wrapped up in the Biden scandal.

“The mainstream media was the Democratic Party's biggest weapon,” he said. “That was their biggest way to get a message out, and when that has been discredited, what do they do?”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Reports on China's victory are greatly exaggerated","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3420000/us-china-economic-competition-growth/","Fri, 23 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

In the 1950s and 1960s, professor Paul Samuelson was arguably America's preeminent economist. His textbook for introductory economics was used at colleges and universities across the United States. He was a close adviser to President John F. Kennedy. 

In 1961, Samuelson predicted that the then Soviet Union would overtake the United States in economic size somewhere between 1984 and 1997. By 1980, he continued to suggest that the Soviet Union would become the world's largest economy within a few decades. 

Obviously, Samuelson was wrong. He did not understand that extreme authoritarianism and the rejection of free market capitalism would consign the Soviet Union to the dustbin of history.

Today, however, other respected academics are making Samuelson's mistake in their assessments of Communist China. They opine that in the current century, China will become the dominant global economic power. One researcher from Princeton University wrote recently in the New York Times that the battle for global economic superiority is being “decisively” won by China and that the U.S. is becoming economically irrelevant.

Let's be clear, researchers who predict the ascendancy of China are wrong. 

Yes, some of President Donald Trump's economic policies are misguided and, in the short run, will impede economic growth. But over the coming decades, economic history and current data say the U.S. will continue to be the world's largest economy.

Financial markets have a way of sorting out political nonsense. Over the past 10 years, the S&P 500, the U.S. benchmark equity index, is up 170% or so. In stark contrast, a broad index of Chinese equities is flat. U.S. equities have soared on optimism about the future of the U.S. economy. Chinese equities have done nothing, reflecting the enormous buildup of debt in China, its demographic decline, and the deep real estate recession that continues to plague the country.

Yes, China has enjoyed many years of rapid economic growth. The problem is that much of that growth was fueled by debt and building infrastructure that sits idle today. China has built cities where few live. It has constructed roads to nowhere. Its vaunted high-speed rail trains are underused. China destroys capital by investing in underused infrastructure projects. China allocates scarce capital to state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, where returns are in the low single digits. At the same time, China starves capital investment in the more economically vibrant private sector. It is almost as if China chooses economic stagnation. 

It is true that China is a world leader in a number of industries. But China's domestic economy cannot absorb the output of those industries. In China, domestic consumption accounts for about 40% of GDP. In most other countries, internal consumption makes up 60% to 70% of national production. In the U.S., private consumption accounts for almost 70% of GDP. 

Domestic consumption is also too low in China because there is no social safety net. This plainly evident connection between fear of future impoverishment and low personal spending is something the supposedly beneficent Communist Party doesn't like to think about. Instead, Chinese households have high savings rates. Xi Jinping, the all-powerful chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, does not believe in a social safety net. He says it encourages laziness.

But Xi's intellectual laziness is also coming home to roost.

After all, because China produces a lot but consumes less than it produces, it must export its excess production. China often exports goods at an economic loss. China “dumps” excess production on the global market. But this isn't going down so well around the world.

One academic brags that by 2030, China will account for 45% of global manufacturing. I doubt it. Which countries will absorb China's excess production and destroy their own domestic manufacturing sectors? Few, I think. Certainly, few nations have democratic sovereignty outside of the debt-dagger loitering power of the Chinese Communist Party. And the U.S. is far from the only country that is saying “no” to importing China's surplus production. The world sees that China is destroying the German car industry. Consequently, the European Union is erecting trade barriers against China. Countries will protect their industries and their workers.

China faces a cruel choice. It exports, or its economy withers. Already, manufacturing plants are closing in China. The global market is not buying what China's factories produce. Economists are lowering long-run economic forecasts in China. In fact, respected research institutions say that China is falling behind the U.S. economically. 

The U.S. economy is about 40% larger than the Chinese economy. American investment in emerging technologies dwarfs that of China. To illustrate, a few months ago, with much fanfare, China announced a $138 billion venture capital fund — not a big deal compared to U.S. venture capital. In 2024, U.S. venture capital investment exceeded $228 billion, about 60% higher than Chinese VC funding. Moreover, in the U.S., capital is invested with the expectation of very high returns. In China, investment is often made for political reasons. Capital is destroyed in China. 

Yes, China has made rapid advances in high technology. Again, however, the strings attached here are suffocating. Consider that China continues to lag the U.S. in the most important high-technology sectors. Artificial intelligence will be the foundation of economic growth for the balance of this century. Superiority in AI is a central policy of the U.S. AI is also at the center of China's economic ambitions. And while China did shock the world with its DeepSeek AI large language model, that model used semiconductors designed by Nvidia and fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC. It is well known that China goes to extreme lengths to obtain possession of chips designed by Nvidia. Regardless, U.S. AI models are superior to those of China.

The U.S. is also the world leader in designing semiconductors. Chips are the critical industry of this century. AI is built with chips. Moreover, the U.S. has open access to the semiconductor fabrication technology of TSMC, the world leader. China is shut off from TSMC by U.S. restrictions. Why is that a problem for China? Well, for one example as to why, observe that TSMC is manufacturing 2-nanometer chips and is testing 1-nanometer semiconductors. China's best fabrication plants are stuck at producing 5-7 nanometer chips. In this case, smaller is better. China wants to change this situation but faces yet another problem in that regard. Namely, that it will be difficult for China to advance to 1-2 nanometer technology because China is denied access to the semiconductor lithography technology of ASML, a Dutch company. ASML's lithography technology is essential for manufacturing the most advanced chips. The U.S. has access to the semiconductor fabrication technology of TSMC, and the U.S. is able to purchase ASML's lithography technology. This is a crucial advantage.

Basic economic data points also bear close attention. Note that the U.S. is home to the world's largest technology companies. This year, Amazon, Alphabet-Google, Meta, and Microsoft will invest almost $330 billion in data centers and AI technology more generally. By contrast, in 2025, China will invest about $55 billion in AI, including data centers. It will be hard for China to be No. 1 in AI when it invests 70% less than the U.S. 

In addition to falling behind the U.S. in AI, data centers, and semiconductor technology, China faces myriad additional economic and social challenges. The country is entering the demographic doom loop in which its declining population will weigh heavily on economic growth. Total debt in China equals about 300% of GDP.  Arguably, the banking system in China is bankrupt. China's real estate sector, which had been the growth and investment engine of the economy, remains in a deep depression. For a typical worker, owning a home in a major city is only a dream, unaffordable today and for many tomorrows. 

Unemployment is rising in China. Youth unemployment is especially high. As many as 16% of China's young men and women are unemployed. To make matters worse, recent college graduates in China can't find work. China's consumer sector is experiencing deflation because efforts to raise consumption growth are almost impossible when prices are falling. Chinese consumers keep waiting for lower prices before buying.

THE SENATE SHOULD PASS THE STABLECOIN GENIUS ACT

Put simply, if the future belongs to China, then China would be highlighting economic statistics that point to a bright picture. Instead, China has stopped releasing important economic data. Clearly, something is rotten in the state of Xi.

The truth is that the U.S. is pulling away from China economically and in the cutting-edge technologies of this century. Trump is making mistakes by alienating allies and driving down investment with his unpredictable tariff wars. Nevertheless, his time in office is limited. All-knowing Xi Jinping will probably rule for the rest of his life.

A U.S. district judge in California blocked the Trump administration on Thursday from revoking the legal status of international students.

District Judge Jeffrey White blocked the government until the case is resolved from arresting, imprisoning, or transporting foreign students anywhere else, with exceptions made for those who have been convicted of a violent crime carrying a prison sentence of a year or more.

The nationwide injunction was enacted after lawyers for nearly two dozen students sued following Immigration and Customs Enforcement's termination of their legal status, and the legal status of thousands of other foreign students, in April amid President Donald Trump's deportation effort.

Lawyers with the U.S. government have contended that such legal protections are unneeded, citing the reinstatement of the visas, but White countered that the rescindments, still in the students' records, hindered their ability to change or receive a new visa and “wreaked havoc” on the lives of those using such visas.

GERRY CONNOLLY'S DEATH REIGNITES DEMOCRATIC DEBATE OVER AGE

The Department of Homeland Security had canceled the visas of students after running the names of suspects who were arrested on charges of their involvement in pro-Palestinian rallies. These students may have had the charges dropped or were never charged, though the Trump administration argues it was executing its authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 

The news comes as the Trump administration blocked Harvard University from admitting international students on Thursday. International students attending the school must transfer to other universities to maintain their nonimmigrant status.

The candy convention was a celebration of everything that the health secretary believes is wrong with our food.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

A Wednesday morning in May is a strange time to be trick-or-treating—especially if you're an adult wearing business casual. The Indiana Convention Center had just opened to visitors for the second day of Sweets & Snacks, the largest gathering of the candy and snack industry in North America. Along with nearly 15,000 other attendees, I went from booth to booth trying samples. By 10:40, I was sipping a complimentary blue-raspberry-watermelon Icee while a woman to my right took a selfie with Mr. Jelly Belly. At the Slim Jim booth a few feet away, a bunch of people in blazers gathered around a smorgasbord of meat sticks. The only thing that could get between attendees and their snacks was the occasional free beer or run-in with a mascot. At one point, the Jack Link's Sasquatch attempted to steal my Entenmann's mini muffins.

I had come to Sweets & Snacks to taste the future of junk food. The annual conference is the industry's most prominent venue to show off its new products. Judging by my three days in Indianapolis, the hot new trends are freeze-dried candy and anything that tastes vaguely East Asian: think “matcha latte” popcorn. But right now, that future looks shaky, particularly for confections. Candy embodies everything that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. believes is wrong with the American diet. It's mainly sugar (which Kennedy has called “poison”), counts as an ultra-processed food (which Kennedy has called “poison”), and is often colored with synthetic food dyes (which Kennedy has called “poison”). Last month, RFK Jr. announced a goal of eliminating synthetic food dyes by the end of 2026, a major threat to an industry predicated on making bright, eye-catching treats. In an email, an HHS spokesperson said that “Secretary Kennedy has been clear: we must build a healthier future by making smarter choices about what goes into our food.” The spokesperson added that “the secretary is committed to working with industry to prioritize public health.”



At Sweets & Snacks, I did not encounter an industry that was gearing up for change. Instead, it was RFK Jr.'s worst nightmare: an unabashed celebration of all things sugary, artificial, and indulgent. On the convention floor, it was hard to find a single product—beyond the litany of meat sticks and the occasional mixed nut—that would get RFK Jr.'s stamp of approval. Even a finalist for the convention's annual salty-snack award, Vlasic Pickle Balls, contained tartrazine, a synthetic yellow dye that Kennedy has specifically bashed. As I stuffed my face with sugary treats, I began to wonder: Was the industry delusional about Kennedy, or the other way around?

RFK Jr.'s presence was conspicuously absent from the moment I arrived in Candy Land. “Anywhere over here is fine,” I told my Lyft driver as we pulled up to a hulking red M&M. Candy companies have already been investing in healthier options: Mars bought snack-bar maker Kind in 2020 and proudly displayed the bars in a booth alongside their more traditional M&Ms, Skittles, and Starburst. But the only vague mention of the looming RFK Jr. threat on the convention floor was a billboard posted by the conference's organizers, the National Confectioners Association (NCA). It reiterated the candy lobby's longstanding message: Candy shouldn't be lumped together with other ultra-processed foods, because it is an occasional indulgence.

It's hardly surprising that candy companies aren't abruptly changing their products in response to pressure, even when it's coming from the country's top health regulator. Americans bought $54 billion worth of these treats last year. In April, the health secretary boasted that the U.S. food industry had “voluntarily agreed” to remove synthetic dyes from their products, but judging from the items on display at Sweets & Snacks, the candy industry has little interest in fulfilling that promise anytime soon. When I asked Christopher Gindlesperger, NCA's senior vice president of public affairs and communication, if the candy industry had an understanding with RFK Jr. to eliminate synthetic dyes voluntarily, his response was simple: “No.”

Some of the discussions around dyes are understandably frustrating for the industry. Federal regulators haven't done the sort of thorough academic evaluation of these dyes that's typically expected before trying to push them out of the food supply. (The state of California released its own evaluation in 2021 and found that “synthetic food dyes are associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in some children.”) At the same time, the candy industry isn't doing much to signal that it recognizes the growing concern over these ingredients. It's hard to be sympathetic toward companies that purposefully market unhealthy products to children through the use of mascots and funky colors. I was taken aback when I stumbled upon a Despicable Me–branded coloring set that let kids color in a cookie with a marker filled with tartrazine.

The industry's efforts to uphold the status quo are risky. If Kennedy is intent on enforcing an actual ban on synthetic food coloring, it could have a monumental impact. Making the switch to natural colors is not as simple as FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested when he told food makers during a press conference last month to just start coloring their products with fruit and vegetable juices. Natural colors are typically more expensive, and they're far more finicky than their synthetic alternatives. Moisture, pH, and even light can cause the dyes to degrade. A naturally colored M&M might be red when it leaves the factory, but if it sits in your pantry too long, it could take on a not-so-appetizing color. There's a question, too, of whether there are even enough fruits and vegetables in the world to supply the food industry with enough natural dye to serve the massive U.S. market. “The amount of crops that go into some of these dyes is just so high that we don't necessarily have these crops planted,” Renee Leber, a food scientist at the Institute of Food Technologists, told me.

Here's yet another concern: Natural dyes may alter the taste of certain treats. The company behind Dum-Dums lollipops has suggested that replacing artificial red dye with beet juice could make its red lollipops taste like beets. (That doesn't mean it can't be done. Many companies already sell products in Europe without synthetic dyes. And Katjes, a German company sandwiched between Jack Link's and Harvest Snaps, was giving away its rainbow unicorn gummies, which looked plenty eye-catching to me, despite being colored solely with fruit and vegetable juices.)

Food dyes are only one part of the RFK Jr. threat that the candy industry faces right now. Yesterday, the Trump administration's “MAHA Commission” released a much-touted report on childhood health, calling out sugar and ultra-processed foods as a major contributor to the youth chronic-disease problem. When I spoke with Gindlesperger, he was quick to point out that candy is far from the biggest cause of America's sugar problem. (Sweetened drinks are.) “People understand that chocolate and candy are treats, and consumers have carved out a special place for them in their lives,” he said. He cited an NCA-funded analysis of CDC survey data, which showed that people in the United States eat roughly 40 calories a day of candy.

But that analysis doesn't distinguish between kids and adults. Data are scant on children's consumption of candy, though if you've walked with a kid down a candy aisle, you can probably tell that most haven't fully grasped that gummy worms are meant to be an occasional indulgence. “It's really difficult for a child who has access to candy to stop eating it,” Natalie Muth, a pediatrician and dietitian, told me. Candy consumption among kids, she added, is a “big problem.”

In a country where nearly 20 percent of children are obese, more needs to be done to protect people from the candy industry's worst tendencies. But mandating any such changes will be incredibly difficult for RFK Jr. To ban tartrazine alone, the FDA would need to compile a docket of information demonstrating its harm, issue a draft regulation, take public comments, and then finalize the regulation. Gindlesperger said the candy industry is waiting for the FDA to formally review the safety of the dyes it takes issue with: “We support and would welcome that review.” Even after all those steps, the food industry can—and likely would—sue. There's even less precedent for cracking down on sugar. Kennedy has acknowledged that a sugar ban is unlikely, and instead has argued for more education about the risks of having a sweet tooth.

If Kennedy succeeds in ushering in actual reform, the “Make America Healthy Again” movement won't truly revolutionize the American diet until it figures out how to redefine our relationship with certain foods. Whether Kennedy likes it or not, candy is part of our national psyche. He can't simply wave a wand and ban trick-or-treating or candy canes. Over the course of three days, I saw grown adults fill multiple shopping bags with free treats. Candy companies displayed bags of their products to show retailers what they'd look like in a store, and the bags literally had to be taped down to avoid getting swiped. (Some still were.) I learned that attendees commonly bring a second suitcase just to haul their loot home.



Nothing quite epitomized the affection for treats like the impromptu dance party that broke out near the close of the conference. Chester Cheetah, Ernie the Keebler Elf, the purple Nerd, the Lemonhead, Bazooka Joe, Clark Cheese Head, and Chewbie, the Hi-Chew mascot, all began to sway in unison to a marching band that was hired to entertain guests. Conference attendees clamored to get a video of the spectacle and snap a selfie with their favorite mascot. The moment was absurd, and funny, and more than a little embarrassing. Still, I couldn't help but pull out my own phone and crack a smile. Perhaps it was nostalgia for bygone Halloween nights, or maybe all the sugar was just getting to my head.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What started as the adventures of a brilliant spy morphed into the mythology of an exemplary human being. 

Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise's most enduring role, was rarely much more than a name. That's the point of him; as the Mission: Impossible franchise's secret agent extraordinaire, Hunt can pretend to be anyone, accomplish basically any physical task, and uncover conspiracies with aplomb. He's a cross between James Bond and a vaudeville performer. But personality was not part of that package, and a backstory was entirely superfluous. After the third Mission film tried to give Hunt a wife and burgeoning family, the subsequent sequel rejected that subplot, instead asserting that for him, experiencing a normal life was impossible.

So it was to my possibly foolish surprise to learn that Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning, the saga's latest (and rumored to be last) film, is a nearly three-hour salute to Hunt. It's a remarkable, lore-filled pivot from what we'd been made to believe about our hero for the past two decades. Over time, he's gone from cipher to human being, from an excellent showman in the art of espionage to a model of the ideal man. This sense of self-importance, however, is one that the series can't quite sustain.

The Final Reckoning, marking Christopher McQuarrie's fourth time in the director's chair, has all of the required elements for a solid Mission: Impossible outing. It includes globe-trotting location shooting, wild and miraculous action stunts, and a reliable ensemble of character actors around Cruise—who, in his early 60s, retains his boyish energy despite finally sporting a few wrinkles. But the film also makes a sometimes-dutiful effort to bring cohesion to Hunt's decades-long collection of missions. Flashbacks to the first film, from 1996, introduce revelations that newer characters are related to those who died off in the original installment; monologue after monologue from heroes and villains alike details just how uniquely special a figure Hunt has become.

As a grand valediction to a long-running storyline, the self-reflexiveness makes some sense. But it does leave the film feeling a little too encumbered. There's less time for balletic set pieces if it has to keep slowing down to explain how important everything is—partly because it's so intent on catching the audience up on the minutiae of Dead Reckoning, the previous entry. But even when the plot kicks into a higher gear, The Final Reckoning never quite settles into the cheerfully goofy groove that propelled the franchise toward its peaks.

The Hunt-heaviness stems from the creative decision that actually saved Mission: Impossible long ago: The writers decided to start creating lasting consequences for their protagonist's actions. The first Mission: Impossible, directed by Brian De Palma, is a swerving, absurd folly; it introduces a team around Hunt and immediately kills most of them off, thus putting him on the run and throwing a maze of sexy triple-crosses his way. Its sequel, directed by John Woo, was geared toward that director's aesthetic: It's long, operatic, and unfortunately a little light on humor. For the third film, Cruise (who acts as a lead producer and has always played a major part in picking the directors) brought in the TV maven J. J. Abrams, who focused the story on Hunt getting engaged and trying to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Mission: Impossible III slightly underperformed expectations; coupled with the intense tabloid scrutiny that Cruise began to face in the mid-2000s, it seemed plausible that the entire enterprise might draw to a close.

But Cruise and Paramount, the studio behind the franchise, managed to turn things around—after a five-year break. For the fourth film, Ghost Protocol, the director Brad Bird (who had previously worked only in animation) helped produce the most epic stunts the series had seen and filmed them with IMAX cameras, still a novelty at the time. The initial plans to treat that chapter as something of a torch pass—with Cruise retiring and the lead role perhaps jumping to his co-star Jeremy Renner—were also scrapped. The screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie came on late in preproduction to help with rewrites, and he reportedly derided the idea; Hunt couldn't just retire and go off into the sunset with his erstwhile fiancée. His life's work was accomplishing unbelievable feats of espionage. Switching the emphasis back toward the stalwart hero and away from his potential protégé was a brilliant storytelling gambit, grafting the actor's public reputation for mega-intensity onto Hunt's growing addiction to death-defying behavior.

Cruise then brought McQuarrie on to direct the next movie, Rogue Nation, and he's remained in the role since. Under him, Mission: Impossible brought Cruise's love of pushing his body beyond its reasonable limits to the forefront: He'd tie himself to a plane for Rogue Nation, jump out of a plane from above the clouds for Fallout, and take a header off a mountain while riding a motorcycle in Dead Reckoning. Beneath that dizzying madness, McQuarrie introduced a progressively more labyrinthine mythology, knitting the installments together in ways plausible and not, and expanding Hunt from impressive spy to a more elemental force. “He's the living manifestation of destiny,” the director of the CIA, played by Alec Baldwin, hoarsely cries in Rogue Nation; by Dead Reckoning, Hunt has become the only potential impediment to world annihilation by an AI system called the Entity.

This choice of villain was a topical one—AI fears are cresting only higher and higher in the news. But the Entity also helped reiterate how important Hunt had become to the Mission: Impossible brand. After all, even if the situation appears to be insurmountable—whether he's thwarting an assassin or a hyperintelligent machine—Hunt knows he can find a way to pull it off. So by The Final Reckoning, his nigh godhood is at hand. In fighting the Entity, he's sticking up for the rest of humanity, yes; but as the only person that the world can trust to do so, he's also being heralded as the most capable of them all.

I love the Mission: Impossible movies, and I was still compelled by The Final Reckoning, even with its sludgier opening pace and patronizing reliance on exposition. A sequence that sees Hunt diving into an abandoned submarine is one of the spookiest and most atmospheric in the series; another, where he hops from biplane to biplane while in battle with another major foe, is one of the most spectacular. But the film's triumphalism about Hunt the man left me, to my surprise, a little cold. What was most entertaining about Mission: Impossible was never the overarching plot; Hunt's heroism was more a dazzling bout of flamboyance from one of Hollywood's last stars than the result of some meaningful backstory. The Final Reckoning gives him enough concluding flourishes to make the send-off just about succeed, but it nearly drowns that endeavor out with a constant stream of thundering applause.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

They thought they'd reached their journeys' end. Now many of them have come full circle.

The Decapolis Hotel advertises “spacious suites & ocean views” in a business area in Panama City. The glass tower is also one of the few hotels in the city that can accommodate 299 people on short notice. When three planes carrying non-Panamanian deportees arrived in mid-February from the United States, the Decapolis redirected its guests to partner hotels and turned over its trendy lobby to armed security personnel, who ensured that no one could get in or out.

Comfortable rooms were repurposed as prison cells, with police officers stationed in the hallways to ensure that people left only for meals. Still, the migrants managed to communicate with journalists by holding written messages up to the windows. One Iranian woman wrote HELP US in lipstick on the glass.

These were the first migrants Donald Trump sent away in a third-country deportation agreement. Some had intended to apply for asylum in the United States—a right enshrined in U.S. and international law. But Trump has suspended the asylum process as part of his immigration crackdown. Many of the 299 people shipped off to Panama—some without even knowing where the planes they'd boarded were bound—now find themselves in a dangerous purgatory. Some don't feel they can return to their countries of origin, but also don't wish to stay in Panama, or don't trust that their asylum pleas will be given due consideration there.

Read: The rushed, blundering effort to send deportees to third countries

Inconveniently, the U.S. planes arrived in Panama at a moment when the country's leader was keen on reducing immigration. President José Raúl Mulino campaigned last year on building a Trumpian border wall. But when Trump started threatening to seize the Panama Canal, Mulino sought to placate him, even if that meant putting Trump's anti-immigration agenda before his own. Mulino sought to reassure the public that the migrants' stay in Panama was essentially a long layover on the way to deportation: “We hope to get them out of there as soon as possible.” Government officials emphasized that the migrants were “in transit,” just like the ships passing through the Panama Canal. But Mulino has said on other occasions that international law would be respected, and that no one would be forced to return to a country where they didn't feel safe.

In mid-March, I went to Panama to find out what might become of the migrants who were still there—those who, politicians kept saying, are in transit, but who seem to have nowhere else to go.

In the early days after the planes' arrival, some of the migrants told me, staffers from the United Nations International Organization for Migration showed up at the hotel and paid each person a visit. According to those I spoke with, the IOM staffers told them that they could either fly home right away on a commercial airline or wait to be deported by the Panamanian authorities. More than half of the migrants signed repatriation documents and flew to their countries of origin, such as India and Uzbekistan.

The Panamanian authorities and the IOM called these returns “voluntary.” “IOM does not carry out forced returns or coerce people to voluntarily depart,” an IOM spokesperson told me. “Our role is limited to assisting those who choose to return so they may do so safely.”

But how well the migrants understood their options is not clear. A Chinese man who identified himself as Xu told me that a woman he'd met at the hotel had texted him from the Istanbul airport. (Xu asked me to withhold his full name so Chinese officials wouldn't know his location.) She told him that she had agreed to repatriate only because she thought she had no choice. When she landed in Istanbul for a layover, she refused to board the connecting flight to China. Then she learned that the people who hadn't signed the repatriation documents had stayed in Panama. She asked Xu if he could talk with someone to arrange her return. Xu wasn't able to help her, and the last time I talked with him, he said that the woman had spent five days in the Istanbul airport before making it to another country, and that she didn't want to talk with reporters. (The IOM spokesperson declined to comment on the woman's case.)

Staff from Panama's National Refugee Office visited the Decapolis and invited the 100 or so remaining migrants to apply for asylum. But the government's public messaging had given them little reason to believe the offer was sincere. On February 19, soon after the migrants landed in Panama, Security Minister Frank Ábrego had declared at a press conference: “At no point will Panama offer asylum to any of these people.” Hardly any of the migrants made claims at first.

Still, five women from Cameroon and one from Ghana decided to take advantage of the opportunity. “America doesn't want us and sent us here,” one of them told me. “Let's stay here.” Asylum decisions usually take years, but an initial decision as to whether their cases were eligible to move forward would take about two weeks from the asylum hearing, they were told. In fact, it came in two days: All six applications were refused. (The national refugee agency, known by its Spanish acronym as ONPAR, did not respond to my request for interviews or comment.)

One of the women was a 32-year-old who fled Cameroon amid fighting last November. She asked me to withhold her name so that assailants in her home country wouldn't be able to locate her. In her asylum hearing, she said that police officers had entered her house and raped her in front of her siblings, and that the police had burned her whole village. But she also said she hoped to work in Panama, because she was “the only one able to send money to her family.” In the refusal letter, the agency argued on the basis of these words that she was an economic migrant and therefore not in need of asylum.

She and the other remaining migrants were transported from the Decapolis to a camp in San Vicente, in the Darién Gap, the same jungle many of them had crossed by foot on their journey to the United States. They spent three weeks there, amid filth and mosquitos, in unrelenting heat—and without access to lawyers or phones, according to the migrants I spoke with as well as a Human Rights Watch report. Then Panamanian officials came and told them they were free to leave.

They were given permits that allowed them to live, but not work, in Panama for 90 days. All they had to do was sign a document certifying that the Panamanian authorities had treated them well and another agreeing to the terms of the 90-day permit. According to a lawyer who has worked with this group since, some at first refused to sign—they had questions about what the permit entailed—but were pressured into doing so under threat of deportation. (Panama's security ministry declined to comment on the claim that migrants were pressured to sign.) Then they boarded buses that would take them back to Panama City.

The first two buses dropped the migrants off in the parking lot of a shopping mall late on March 8. UNICEF staffers were there waiting for the families with children, to bring them to a hotel. The rest were on their own. Some had been in touch with Caitlyn Yates, a blond, bespectacled American who'd moved to Panama as a doctoral student to study the migration of Asians and Africans through the Darién Gap to North America. When Yates found out that some of her research subjects were on their way to Panama City, she messaged the Panamanian lawyer Victor Atencio, who was also following the migrants' situation closely. Yates and Atencio arrived at the parking lot less than an hour after the migrants, ready to help.

The migrants didn't know it, but Atencio was probably the reason they'd been allowed to leave the Darién Gap. A robust, buttoned-up man of 50, he had read about the migrants in The New York Times. He'd filed a habeas corpus petition that the Panamanian government had ignored. Then he sued Panama before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, asking the court to set some “precautionary measures”: for the migrants to be set free, communication with lawyers to be allowed, and deportation to be deferred. Several legal organizations, including the Global Strategic Litigation Council, joined the suit.

The day before Panama's deadline to respond to the court, it released the migrants and gave them the 90-day permits. According to GSLC's lawyers, the Panamanian government claimed that it had not mistreated the migrants or held them incommunicado. The human-rights commission eventually declined to set the precautionary measures, but reminded Panama to follow international law.

By the time the buses arrived that March night, only a chicken joint and a McDonald's remained open in the mall's food court. Yates bought everyone a meal as Atencio called hotels in the city to find one with availability. Together, they stopped taxis one by one, until there were enough to go to the hotel in a caravan. Samin Haider, a 22-year-old Pakistani, would later describe that night to me as the first time he'd felt hope after arriving in Panama. Yates and Atencio weren't the only ones who showed the migrants kindness. There was the McDonald's cashier who offered them free ice cream, the mall employee who allowed the food court to stay open late, and the taxi drivers who didn't want to be paid.

In mid-March, I visited Hogar Luisa, a two-story house owned by a Catholic charity that Yates had approached and that now sheltered about a dozen of the migrants. Many more were sleeping at a school gym repurposed into a camp by Fe y Alegría, another Catholic charity Yates had enlisted. The migrants were finally free to come and go as they pleased, but so were reporters. They were a bit tired of us.

“Why do you ask so many questions?” a Nigerian woman asked me, laughing. “We all have the same story.” She asked me to withhold her name out of fear of reprisals against her son, who is still in Nigeria. She said she descends from a long line of priestesses in the local religion of her home region, but she didn't want to be one herself. Instead, she married a Christian and converted to Christianity. When her grandmother, the “priestess of the shrine,” found out, she pledged to kill her in punishment.

An Iranian woman I met had also converted to Christianity, in a Muslim country where apostasy can be punishable by death. (She asked to remain anonymous to protect her Christian relatives in Iran, and in case she is forced to return.) She'd owned a gym and was married to an electrical engineer. The police learned that the couple were hosting Christian services at their house, and so they'd fled.

A young Pakistani man named Syed Saqlain Badshah told me he'd led student protests in Parachinar in 2017. He'd been hiding from the Pakistani Taliban ever since. A woman named Dora Zhou didn't want to tell me why she and her two teenage daughters had left China. “It's too painful,” she wrote on her phone. “I had no choice but to leave.”

I spent perhaps the most time with a 21-year-old woman from Afghanistan who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Serwarah, out of fear of retaliation against her relatives still in the country. She grew up in Maymana, a small city in Faryab province, near the country's northern border with Turkmenistan. As a girl she'd read Napoleon Hill's bootstrapping best seller from 1937, Think and Grow Rich, and she'd planned to study accounting in college and launch her own clothing brand. That was before the Taliban took over. Then those avenues all closed, and her grandmother told her that a Talib with two wives who was many decades older had requested her hand in marriage. She'd known this man all her life—he was her mother's distant cousin—and she wondered when he'd begun thinking of her that way.

To escape this marriage, Serwarah fled Afghanistan in 2021, when she was 17. She settled first in Iran. From there, she tried to cross into Turkey by foot, only to be stopped at the Turkish border and raped by a Turkish border-police officer. She was sent back to Iran. In 2023, she was accepted to Near East University, in Northern Cyprus, one of the few places in Europe where Afghan nationals can get visas on arrival. But officials at Ercan Airport refused to admit her. She decided to make her way to the United States.

From the September 2022 issue: I smuggled my laptop past the Taliban so I could write this story

Serwarah acquired a fake visa for Brazil, where she landed in November 2024, and from there she took buses, trekked the Darién Gap, and took more buses all the way to the United States. Somewhere along the way, she learned that in her absence, the Talib had requested to marry her little sister. She thought about returning and marrying him so that her sister would be spared. But her favorite uncle told her over the phone, If you come back, the Taliban will stone you to death. And he'll still marry your sister.

The night Serwarah left Afghanistan, her sister had insisted she take one thing with her: their great-grandmother's ring, a ruby surrounded by tiny Afghan emeralds. It's the only possession she has kept—she attached it to her bra strap so it wouldn't get lost or stolen and told herself she'd put it on her finger when she reached America and applied for asylum.

When I met her in Panama, Serwarah was living in a shelter, but otherwise seemed in every way like the 21-year-old she was: She spent her days texting her boyfriend, an Afghan she'd met working in a perfumery in Iran, and taking the bus to the mall to buy makeup with money her uncle sent.

The heads of the charities hosting the migrants have years of experience. Panama is, after all, home to the Darién Gap, the treacherous stretch of jungle that separates South and Central America, which thousands of migrants have crossed by foot. But the migrants sent by plane from the United States presented challenges that even these professionals had never encountered, they told me.

From the September 2024 issue: Seventy miles in hell

Father Marco Tulio Gómez, the director of Fe y Alegría, and Jorge Ayala, of Hogar Luisa, normally work alongside government agencies. Both charities reached out to officials to talk about getting work permits for the migrants, and both told me that their calls went unanswered. The Apostolic Nunciature to Panama, the Pope's diplomatic mission in the country, also tried establishing contact with the authorities to no avail. Ayala told me he thought the Panamanian government might be putting off any decisions until it knows whether the Trump administration plans to send more migrants.

Father Gómez told me he was accustomed to working with migrants who were on their way north. “They still had a goal,” he said. Many of those flown to Panama from the United States, by contrast, seem not to fully understand that America is, for now, not an option. Ayala is still trying to get them work permits, but he told me that most of them don't really want to stay in Panama. He worried that they would try their luck again crossing the U.S. border. “Between eyebrow and eyebrow, all they have is thoughts of going back,” Ayala said. “All they want is America. All they have is Panama.”

The group of lawyers that joined Atencio's lawsuit went on to file another lawsuit over Panama's treatment of migrants. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights could take years to make a decision on it. The new lawsuit charges that Panama has not respected the rights of the migrants to seek asylum. Among other claims, it alleges that the Panamanian police obstructed some migrants from applying, and that those who did apply—the six women from Cameroon and Ghana—had no way to seek legal counsel, received immediate denials, and were told by Panamanian authorities not to appeal. “Everything indicates that the process sought to discourage access to protection rather than guarantee it,” Silvia Serna, one of the lawyers on the suit, told me.

After the lawsuits were filed—the lawyers suggest because they were filed—those migrants who wished to seek asylum were better able to do so. At least three more have been denied, and no one has received a positive answer yet. But the national refugee agency has called some migrants back for interviews, suggesting that their cases may be receiving appropriate consideration.

Whether or not they can, however, very few of the migrants seem to want to apply for asylum in Panama. Ayala knows of only nine between the two shelters who have done so. Those I spoke with told me that they thought their claims would be pointless, and that anyway, they didn't want to live in Panama.

“I don't trust anyone in Panama,” Narges, a reclusive Iranian woman, said when I asked her why she didn't want to apply for asylum. (Another Christian convert, she asked me to omit her last name to protect her relatives in Iran.)

“But do you have any other place to go?” I pressed.

“I don't trust anyone in Panama,” she said again.

After the 90-day permit expires, Panama may well deport those who never sought asylum. “The fundamental framing of this permit was as a deferred deportation,” Ian Kysel, a co-founder of the Global Strategic Litigation Council, told me. And yet, most of the people I spoke with in March either didn't understand this or had other plans they didn't share with me. When I spoke with migrants still in the shelters just this week, they told me that dozens had left since I was last there. Some, Serwarah texted me, have made it to Mexico.

The last day I went to the Fe y Alegría camp was sunny, with a nice breeze. Nigerian and Ghanaian women were braiding one another's hair under a tree, blasting Afrobeat. Eritreans and Ethiopians were playing Uno on plastic dining tables. Chinese kids had come to visit from the hotel and were running around, hiding behind some of the mattresses on the gym floor.

Serwarah wasn't there—she was staying at Hogar Luisa—but other Afghans had gathered around her closest friend in Panama, Suraiya Hussaini, a 25-year-old whose brother, Ali, had stayed behind in an ICE detention center and was now being deported to Afghanistan. As everyone around her looked forward to movie night, Suraiya looked numb. Serwarah, who heard the news from other Afghans, kept calling to ask for updates, but Suraiya had stopped answering her phone. Anxieties about deportation, which hadn't troubled Serwarah and other Afghans for a few days, had returned with vivid intensity, she later told me.

Before I left Panama, I attended one of President Mulino's Thursday press conferences in Palacio de las Garzas, the presidential office and residence. I asked him whether the migrants would be able to stay in Panama once their 90-day humanitarian permits expired in June.

“I haven't considered this,” Mulino answered. “The idea is that they leave before.”

“And they do want to leave,” he added. “They come from countries very, very far away.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","It Should Not Be Controversial to Plead for Gaza's Children","https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/05/gaza-children-starving-israel-aid/682902/","Fri, 23 May 2025 16:17:00 GMT","

Israel's limits on aid have put the region at “critical risk of famine.” Help is within reach. But it's not enough—and it's arriving too slowly.

Imagine a child at home, crying. She is inconsolable, screaming for food. A neighbor tries to offer some bread; the door is blocked. A grocery store down the road has plenty of supplies; no one can get to it. The clock ticks down and the child starves, her baby fat melting to nothing.

Multiply that possibility by thousands. In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian children are starving while food is sitting in trucks, just out of reach. Israel began a total blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza on March 2, the longest such stoppage since the current war began, putting the region at “critical risk of famine,” according to food-security experts. Israel finally agreed to ease the blockade on Sunday and said that 93 trucks had crossed the border on Tuesday and that an additional 107 had yesterday. Aid has begun to reach civilians after reported delays. But children continue to go hungry.

There is no question that the situation for children in Gaza is grave. The World Health Organization stated on May 13 that since Israel's blockade had begun, 57 children had reportedly died from malnutrition, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. More than 14,000 children under 5 are at risk of “severe acute malnutrition” in Gaza over roughly the next year, according to a recent food-security report. Tom Fletcher, a United Nations official, in a widely shared misstatement of that statistic, warned on Tuesday that 14,000 babies could die within 48 hours unless aid was delivered to them. A former Israeli-government spokesperson told The Times of Israel that Fletcher had caused “a global media panic about something totally made up.” Getting the facts straight in dire situations such as this is crucial. But the truth remains that children are starving, needlessly, while aid struggles to reach them.

Read: ‘In three months, half of them will be dead'

In response to the developments in Gaza, the children's entertainer Rachel Accurso, known to babies and toddlers the world over as “Ms. Rachel,” made an emotional plea in a video posted to her Instagram earlier this week. (The video, which referred to the inaccurate 14,000-babies stat, no longer appears on her page.) While holding her own round-cheeked baby daughter, she showed a disturbing photo of a gaunt Palestinian baby, whose each and every rib was visible under her skin. “Dear world leaders, please help this baby,” Accurso said. “Please, please look at her; just please look in her eyes for one minute.”

Accurso has been an outspoken advocate for Palestinian children, who have suffered at such a scale that in December 2023, UNICEF called Gaza “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.” Her focus on children is apt: Nearly half of Gaza's population is children—and children are especially vulnerable to malnutrition. Yet she has faced backlash for her statements; last month, a pro-Israel group called for the Department of Justice to investigate whether she was working for Hamas. (“This accusation is not only absurd, it's patently false,” she told The New York Times.) Online commenters have accused her of focusing on Palestinians to the exclusion of Israeli children. (She has not ignored Israeli children—she has shared sympathetic posts about the effects of Hamas's October 7 attacks on children. “I'm thinking not only of the Israeli children taken hostage,” she wrote recently, “but also those who witnessed horrific acts of violence that day—their innocence stolen in an instant.”) In an interview with the journalist Mehdi Hasan, Accurso said, “It's sad that people try to make it controversial when you speak out for children that are facing immeasurable suffering.”

That a person whose job is to care about children should be criticized for caring about children is ludicrous. It should not need to be said, and it should not be controversial to say it, but: Starving children is wrong. If pointing that out lands you in hot water, that is a symptom of something deeply broken in our culture. Everyone should care if children are needlessly suffering, wherever they are suffering.

If or when the aid sitting in those trucks reaches the Palestinian people, it will go only a fraction of the way toward addressing widespread hunger. What the food-security report released earlier this month actually stated is that the entire population of Gaza is food insecure. It also estimated that from May to September of this year, nearly 470,000 people will experience “catastrophic food insecurity,” meaning that more than 1 in 5 will face starvation if the situation doesn't change. Nearly 71,000 children under 5 and nearly 17,000 pregnant or breastfeeding women were projected to need treatment for “acute malnutrition” between April of this year and March 2026. (Of those 71,000 children, 14,100 cases—the figure that the UN official seems to have mis-cited—are projected to be “severe.”)

According to The New York Times, Israel has publicly claimed that its blockade in Gaza was not a threat to civilians. In a statement on Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had sent 92,000 aid trucks into Gaza since October 7, 2023. “More than enough food to feed everyone in Gaza,” he said. This claim contradicts statements from the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and multiple international aid organizations that hunger in the region is at crisis levels. And anonymous Israeli-military sources told the Times that, in private, some officials have admitted that food is running out. Israel has also said that it started the blockade in part because it believed Hamas was stealing aid and using it to fuel its fight—an accusation Hamas has denied. Netanyahu also asserted on Thursday that Israel had “devised a mechanism” with U.S. allies in which “American companies will distribute the food directly to Palestinian families,” in “safe zones secured” by the Israeli military. The UN has criticized the plan on the grounds that, among other things, it amounts to forced displacement, requiring Palestinians to relocate in order to access aid.

The grim reality that war is hell does not mean that anyone should accept mass starvation among children, anywhere, as inevitable. And we should certainly not accept it when available food is kept from children's reach. (We should be just as alarmed that the United States is contributing to global malnutrition in its own way: By gutting agencies such as USAID, the country has disrupted the flow of assistance that previously went to malnourished children around the world, including the supply of a vital nutritional paste. According to the WHO, nearly half of all deaths among children under 5 globally are attributed to malnutrition.)

Even before Israel's blockade of Gaza, getting lifesaving aid to starving children and their families in the Strip was difficult. The UN's former emergency-relief coordinator has described the task as “in all practical terms, impossible.” Trucks carrying supplies have had limited points of entry, faced long waits at the border and looting, and been unable to be sure of safe passage if they do get into the region. Israeli fire has hit aid convoys on multiple occasions and killed many humanitarian workers. (Earlier this year, Israel disputed the UN's figures on the rate at which aid was entering Gaza. But Israel's own numbers fell far short of the amount of aid required to meet basic food needs, as estimated by the World Food Programme.)

David A. Graham: A deadly strike in Gaza

The trucks let in so far are addressing only a drop in the ocean of need—and the decision to allow them through cannot be described as a good-faith effort to prevent a potential famine. Rather, comments made by Netanyahu suggest that this was a concession made to retain the support of Israel's allies, including the United States. The Washington Post recently reported that in a video of Netanyahu posted to social media, he said that “we cannot reach a point of starvation, for practical and diplomatic reasons.” His professed concern seemed to be not that people are starving, but that allies had told him they “could not ‘handle pictures of mass starvation,'” the Post reported.

In her Instagram post, Accurso asked viewers to think of children they knew and loved. She said of Gaza's children: “If you're not going to stand up for them, you might as well come out and say you don't see them like you see our kids.” Another icon of children's TV, the late, great Mister Rogers, famously said that when we see scary things in the news, we should “look for the helpers.” In Gaza, we know where the helpers are. They're right there at the gates, trying to get in.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

When interest rates outpace growth, very bad things can happen.

In 2019, Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, two of America's most influential economists, published an essay titled “Who's Afraid of Budget Deficits?” In it, they argued that Washington's long-standing worries about the national debt had been overblown. Other prominent experts, including the former head economist of the International Monetary Fund, an institution known for imposing harsh fiscal austerity on developing countries, came to similar conclusions. The reason: Deficit hawks had been fixated on the wrong number.

The debt, according to these economists, still mattered. But whether it would become a serious problem, they observed, depended not on how big and scary the number was (about $28 trillion at the time, and today closer to $36 trillion), but instead on a simple formula involving the variables r and g. As long as a country's economic growth rate (g) is higher than the interest rate (r) it pays on its national debt, then the cost of servicing that debt will remain stable, allowing the government to roll it over indefinitely without much worry. Given that interest rates had been close to zero for a decade, Furman and Summers concluded that the “economics of deficits have changed” and called on Washington to “put away its debt obsession and focus on bigger things.”

Annie Lowrey: The Republican's budget makes no sense

But what was true then is true no longer. The combination of Donald Trump's growth-inhibiting tariff crusade and the GOP's deficit-exploding tax bill is likely to push the relationship between r and g into extremely dangerous territory. “In a short amount of time, the fiscal picture has gone from comfortably in the green-light region to the red-light region,” Summers recently told me. In other words, now would be a very good time for Washington to bring back its debt obsession.

The “debt doesn't matter” consensus had a strong start. During the coronavirus pandemic, Congress spent trillions of dollars to keep the economy on life support without worrying about paying for it. The U.S. debt load reached new heights, but interest rates continued to fall. No bond vigilantes or debt spirals were to be seen.

In the years to follow, however, the Fed raised interest rates dramatically in an effort to tame inflation. As a result, government payments on debt interest soared to $881 billion in 2024, more than the United States spent on either Medicaid or national defense. The same economists who had helped usher in the new debt consensus, including Summers and Furman, began warning that America's fiscal picture had become concerning. Even so, the situation was far from a crisis. A post-pandemic economic boom had kept the relationship between g and r on a stable trajectory, and in the fall of 2024, with inflation waning, the Fed began to lower interest rates.

Then Donald Trump took office and threw the world economy into chaos.

The interest rate on government debt is ultimately determined by investors' confidence that the U.S. will eventually pay it back. (When fewer people want to buy your debt because they view it as excessively risky, you have to offer a higher return.) The mere possibility of a global trade war and a huge, unpaid-for tax cut has shaken that confidence. Last week, Moody's, one of the world's major credit agencies, downgraded America's credit rating from its premium Triple-A status, causing interest rates on long-term government bonds to rise to near their highest point in two decades (above even the “yippy” level that prompted Trump to recall his “Liberation Day” tariffs). Rates surged again yesterday morning, when House Republicans narrowly passed a version of their tax bill that would add more than $3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. If Trump signs that bill into law while expanding his global trade war, then investors may choose to dump their U.S. Treasury holdings en masse, causing interest rates to spike even higher. “For years, we lived in a world where there was basically zero risk premium on U.S. debt,” Jared Bernstein, the former head of Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, told me. “In four short months, Team Trump has squandered that advantage.”

David A. Graham: Congressional Republicans vs. reality

Rising interest rates might not be such a big issue if Trump's policies were simultaneously supercharging America's economic growth, so that g stayed ahead of r. Instead, almost every credible growth forecast this year has fallen significantly in response to those policies. With Trump proposing new tariffs seemingly at random—including, just this morning, a 50 percent tariff on the European Union and a 25 percent tariff on all imported Apple products—businesses face paralyzing levels of uncertainty, a fact will likely drag down growth even further. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans claim that the massive tax cuts promised in their budget reconciliation bill will spur an economic boom, but several independent analyses have found that they will hardly affect growth at all, let alone enough to overcome the negative impact of tariffs. In fact, many economists warn that the U.S. economy could be headed for something akin to 1970s-style stagflation.

In normal times, the Federal Reserve could step in and mitigate both of these problems by cutting interest rates to boost growth or buying up Treasuries to quell financial-market panic. That is highly unlikely, however, when the central bank is also worried about the possibility that both the tax bill and Trump's tariffs could set off an inflationary spiral. In the past week, multiple members of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting body have signaled that it is unlikely to lower interest rates for the time being.

This confluence of rising interest rates and slowing growth is the exact set of circumstances capable of turning America's national debt into a genuine crisis. When r remains higher than g for a sustained period of time, a vicious cycle emerges. Rising debt-servicing costs force the government to borrow more money to make its payments; investors, in turn, demand even higher interest rates, which pushes debt-servicing costs even higher, and so on.

In the best-case scenario, this process unfolds gradually, and the consequences are painful but not catastrophic. As more and more of the government budget is diverted to finance ever-growing debt-servicing costs, less room will be left to fund key social programs and productive investments; higher interest rates will mean less business investment and slower growth; and the government will be less capable of responding to a future economic crisis that requires heavy spending.  If, however, the debt snowball were to gather momentum quickly, the damage could be far worse. Investors might conclude that U.S. debt is no longer a safe investment, causing the equivalent of a bank run on the Treasury market as investors rush to sell their bonds for cash. Once that kind of psychological panic sets in, anything can happen. “This scenario is more serious than 2008,” Adam Tooze, an economic historian who wrote the definitive history of the financial crisis that triggered the Great Recession, argued recently on his Substack. “At some point, everything just goes parabolic,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told me. “That's when parts of the financial system might start to break.”

A version of this happened in the United Kingdom in 2022, when then–Prime Minister Liz Truss unveiled a tax-cut proposal that would have blown up the country's budget deficit. Bond markets freaked out, long-term interest rates soared, the pound plunged, and the entire British financial system appeared to be on the verge of collapse. The crisis ended only when the budget was scrapped and Truss was removed to restore confidence.

Until recently, the prospect of something so dramatic happening in the United States seemed exceedingly remote. Then, on April 9, Trump's Liberation Day tariffs went into effect and the American bond market nearly melted down, stabilizing only after Trump paused most of the tariffs. If something similar happened again—say, in response to the final passage of the Republican tax bill—averting a sustained panic might not be so easy. The U.S. would be left with terrible choices: Impose painful austerity measures to reassure the market, default on the debt (which would likely trigger a severe, possibly global economic crisis), or print money to pay it off (which would trigger rampant inflation).

None of these possibilities appears to concern Trump and his allies in Congress, who are barreling forward with their agenda, warnings be damned. Perhaps they are betting that economists, who for so long predicted debt crises that never materialized, will be wrong one more time. That is a very high-stakes gamble indeed.

A manifesto left by the bomber of a fertility clinic demands refutation.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

When a young man detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of a Palm Springs, California, fertility clinic last week, killing himself and injuring four others, I assumed the attack was related in some distorted way to pro-life politics. Despite the Trump administration's recent embrace of in vitro fertilization, some pro-lifers, especially conservative Catholics, are opposed to the practice because it can lead to the disposal of embryos. That fact, coupled with the historical association between extreme anti-abortion sentiment and clinic bombings, led me to anticipate a news cycle concerning radical efforts to restrict abortion.

I was wrong. The bombing, carried out by a 25-year-old California native named Guy Edward Bartkus, was an attempt to prevent couples from accessing IVF, not because the process produces some embryos that wind up dead, but rather because it produces some embryos that wind up alive. Bartkus, who left behind an online screed titled “Fuck you pro-lifers!” complete with an index of links and an .mp3 file explaining his agenda, was an avowed “pro-mortalist”—someone who objects to the creation of new people because, the reasoning goes, no one can consent to being conceived, and that initial unfairness only exposes new consciousness to the suffering of life and the inevitability of death. This is the mind virus that Bartkus was hoping to spread with his attack and its explanation. For that reason alone, it deserves refuting: Life is good and worth defending.

Bartkus's manifesto is arranged like a “frequently asked questions” section, in which he expresses his philosophy and addresses possible counterarguments. “Understand your death is already a guarantee, and you can thank your parents for that one,” he wrote. “All a promortalist is saying is let's make it happen sooner rather than later (and preferably peaceful rather than some disease or accident), to prevent your future suffering, and, more importantly, the suffering your existence will cause to all the other sentient beings.” In Bartkus's view, to have children is to act as “willing agents for a DNA molecule”—that is, to blindly submit to an animal urge to perpetuate one's genes. None of this is novel, as Bartkus himself pointed out when he cited his philosophy's kinship to negative utilitarianism, abolitionist veganism, and “efilism,” an evidently Reddit-based phenomenon that views humans as mere slaves to DNA. “Pro-mortalism” is a derivative riff on anti-natalism, a philosophy whose most learned proponent is the South African academic David Benatar. (Benatar has maintained a higher-brow version of the argument against reproduction for the past two decades.) But its most infamous proponent is Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, who sketched out an extremely dark version of the same morbid theory in his library of audio recordings and then enacted it.

Marc Novicoff: The loneliness of the conservative pronatalist

The FBI has classified Bartkus's attack, which devastated the clinic's offices, as terrorism, though he failed to actually destroy any embryos; the facility's lab is located offsite. Perhaps the spectacle was intended more to provoke a response from the public than to prevent any particular embryos from developing—and his death surely will be marshaled by both sides of American politics to represent our current failings. To many on the left, the bombing may register as another episode in the country's ongoing mental-health crisis, with Bartkus as the avatar of dangerously ill youth who could have benefited from early intervention to counter what appears to have been long-term suicidal ideation. For many on the right, the act may read as more overtly political—a sign of the anti-life left's derangement. Bartkus did address his missive to pro-lifers, and his philosophy is directly contrary to the kind of anti-abortion politics the Trump administration is very deliberately cultivating.

Both analyses contain elements of truth. Bartkus described himself as having borderline personality disorder, and his manifesto is at times rambling and incoherent (as in a subsection where he declares his preference for Satan over God). Although he wasn't clear about what kinds of suffering make life unworthy of living, he did provide an explanation of his timing by referring to the recent death of a long-distance friend, who he said had died after asking her boyfriend to shoot her in her sleep, which the boyfriend then did, multiple times. Bartkus also appears to have been under the influence of one of those toxic internet subcultures that acts like a transmissible mood disorder, imparting not only grim ideas but also a certain climate of mind. From that vantage, goodness and joy are rendered irrelevant, and all of life's pain and suffering are read as justifications for their chosen resentments. But sickness and grief don't negate the fact that the ideas behind Bartkus's manifesto are serious, deranged responses to current politics, as acts of terrorism frequently are. Attacks like his aren't representative of any mainstream tendency—but they do reveal what's simmering below the surface of society: in this case, angst and uncertainty about whether perpetuating human life is an altogether good thing for humans or the planet.

It's difficult to persuade someone convinced otherwise that human life is more of an affirmative good than a hazard. “Oh, what can you do with a man like that?” John Cheever once wrote. “How can you dissuade his eye in a crowd from seeking out the cheek with acne, the infirm hand; how can you teach him to respond to the inestimable greatness of the race, the harsh surface beauty of life; how can you put his finger for him on the obdurate truths before which fear and horror are powerless?”

You can't, it seems. But for anyone on the fence, or who finds themselves somewhat tempted by Bartkus's premises, I wish they could see that life is indeed good, even when it isn't easy or pleasurable. Humanity is capable of unique greatness—not only via the spectacular achievements of artists, scientists, and philosophers in which all of us share by nature of kinship, but also in moral terms: the daily miracle of individuals encountering complicated and frustrating situations and choosing to do the right thing anyway. The world is full of such people, though they may be overlooked by those cynical toward humanity's contributions to history. Their perseverance in goodness is sufficient argument for more of us, more human excellence, great and small. May the future always belong to humankind.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Rapid changes from AI may be coming far faster than you imagine.

by  Kelsey Piper

Let's imagine for a second that the impressive pace of AI progress over the past few years continues for a few more. 

In that time period, we've gone from AIs that could produce a few reasonable sentences to AIs that can produce full think tank reports of reasonable quality; from AIs that couldn't write code to AIs that can write mediocre code on a small code base; from AIs that could produce surreal, absurdist images to AIs that can produce convincing fake short video and audio clips on any topic.

Companies are pouring billions of dollars and tons of talent into making these models better at what they do. So where might that take us?

Imagine that later this year, some company decides to double down on one of the most economically valuable uses of AI: improving AI research. The company designs a bigger, better model, which is carefully tailored for the super-expensive yet super-valuable task of training other AI models. 

With this AI trainer's help, the company pulls ahead of its competitors, releasing AIs in 2026 that work reasonably well on a wide range of tasks and that essentially function as an “employee” you can “hire.” Over the next year, the stock market soars as a near-infinite number of AI employees become suitable for a wider and wider range of jobs (including mine and, quite possibly, yours).

This is the opening of AI 2027, a thoughtful and detailed near-term forecast from a group of researchers that think AI's massive changes to our world are coming fast — and for which we're woefully unprepared. The authors notably include Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher who became famous for risking millions of dollars of his equity in the company when he refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

“AI is coming fast” is something people have been saying for ages but often in a way that's hard to dispute and hard to falsify. AI 2027 is an effort to go in the exact opposite direction. Like all the best forecasts, it's built to be falsifiable — every prediction is specific and detailed enough that it will be easy to decide if it came true after the fact. (Assuming, of course, we're all still around.) 

The authors describe how advances in AI will be perceived, how they'll affect the stock market, how they'll upset geopolitics — and they justify those predictions in hundreds of pages of appendices. AI 2027 might end up being completely wrong, but if so, it'll be really easy to see where it went wrong.

It also might be right. 

While I'm skeptical of the group's exact timeline, which envisions most of the pivotal moments leading us to AI catastrophe or policy intervention as happening during this presidential administration, the series of events they lay out is quite convincing to me. 

Any AI company would double down on an AI that improves its AI development. (And some of them may already be doing this internally.) If that happens, we'll see improvements even faster than the improvements from 2023 to now, and within a few years, there will be massive economic disruption as an “AI employee” becomes a viable alternative to a human hire for most jobs that can be done remotely. 

But in this scenario, the company uses most of its new “AI employees” internally, to keep churning out new breakthroughs in AI. As a result, technological progress gets faster and faster, but our ability to apply any oversight gets weaker and weaker. We see glimpses of bizarre and troubling behavior from advanced AI systems and try to make adjustments to “fix” them. But these end up being surface-level adjustments, which just conceal the degree to which these increasingly powerful AI systems have begun pursuing their own aims — aims which we can't fathom. This, too, has already started happening to some degree. It's common to see complaints about AIs doing “annoying” things like faking passing code tests they don't pass.

Not only does this forecast seem plausible to me, but it also appears to be the default course for what will happen. Sure, you can debate the details of how fast it might unfold, and you can even commit to the stance that AI progress is sure to dead-end in the next year. But if AI progress does not dead-end, then it seems very hard to imagine how it won't eventually lead us down the broad path AI 2027 envisions, sooner or later. And the forecast makes a convincing case it will happen sooner than almost anyone expects. 

Make no mistake: The path the authors of AI 2027 envision ends with plausible catastrophe. 

By 2027, enormous amounts of compute power would be dedicated to AI systems doing AI research, all of it with dwindling human oversight — not because AI companies don't want to oversee it but because they no longer can, so advanced and so fast have their creations become. The US government would double down on winning the arms race with China, even as the decisions made by the AIs become increasingly impenetrable to humans. 

The authors expect signs that the new, powerful AI systems being developed are pursuing their own dangerous aims — and they worry that those signs will be ignored by people in power because of geopolitical fears about the competition catching up, as an AI existential race that leaves no margin for safety heats up.

All of this, of course, sounds chillingly plausible. The question is this: Can people in power do better than the authors forecast they will? 

Definitely. I'd argue it wouldn't even be that hard. But will they do better? After all, we've certainly failed at much easier tasks.

Vice President JD Vance has reportedly read AI 2027, and he has expressed his hope that the new pope — who has already named AI as a main challenge for humanity — will exercise international leadership to try to avoid the worst outcomes it hypothesizes. We'll see.

We live in interesting (and deeply alarming) times. I think it's highly worth giving AI 2027 a read to make the vague cloud of worry that permeates AI discourse specific and falsifiable, to understand what some senior people in the AI world and the government are paying attention to, and to decide what you'll want to do if you see this starting to come true.

This is what happens when you put a clownfish in hot water.

by  Benji Jones

During a severe heat wave in 2023, scientists scuba diving off the coast of Papua New Guinea captured clownfish to measure their bodies. Between February and August, they calculated the length of 134 of these iconic, orange and white fish once a month, taking a total of six measurements for each fish.

Those measurements revealed something peculiar: Most of the fish shrank.

This week, the researchers reported their findings in Science Advances, concluding that the fish got shorter — on the scale of a few millimeters, or a small, single-digit percent of their length — in response to the heat wave.

“We were so surprised to see shrinking in these fish that, to be sure, we measured each fish individual repeatedly over a period of five months,” said Melissa Versteeg, a doctoral researcher at Newcastle University, who led the study in collaboration with Mahonia Na Dari, an environmental organization, and Walindi Resort. “In the end, we discovered [that downsizing] was very common in this population.”

Versteeg and her colleagues don't know how, exactly, the fish are shrinking — one untested idea is that the fish might be reabsorbing some of their bone material or tissue. But getting smaller isn't a problem. In fact, the study found, it may be an adaptation to help clownfish survive hotter ocean temperatures.

Last year, the planet was about 2.65 degrees warmer than it was in the late 1800s. This level of warming impacts wild animals in a number of strange, mostly bad, ways, from fueling koala-killing wildfires to causing corals to bleach and then starve.

But rising temperatures also appear to be making many species smaller. One especially striking study, published in 2019, found that birds shrank by an average of about 2.6 percent between 1978 and 2016. More recent analyses have linked rising temperatures to a reduction in body size of small mammals in North America and marine fish. Most of these existing studies report that animals, on average, are simply not growing as large.

The new study on clownfish, however, suggests individual fish are shrinking over mere weeks in response to a heat wave, which, in the case of the Papua New Guinea event, pushed temperatures in the bay about 7 degrees (4 degrees Celsius) above average.

Being tiny has its advantages in a hot climate: Warm-blooded animals, like mammals, shed heat more easily when they're small and this helps them cool down. The benefits for cold-blooded creatures, such as clownfish, aren't as clear, though researchers think they may have an easier time meeting their bodies' energy requirements when they're small.

Regardless of the reason, being small seems to help clownfish when it's hot. The fish that shrank, the study found, had a much higher chance of surviving.

“It was a surprise to see how rapidly clownfish can adapt to a changing environment,” Versteeg said. “We witnessed how flexibly they regulated their size, as individuals and as breeding pairs, in response to heat stress as a successful technique to help them survive.”

The study adds a layer of complexity to what is otherwise a depressing tale about the world's oceans. Heat waves linked to climate change, like the one that occurred during this study, are utterly devastating coral reefs — and in severe cases, are nearly wiping out entire reef sections. These colorful ecosystems are home to countless marine animals, including those we eat, like snappers, and clownfish.

Amid that loss, animals are proving highly resilient. They're trying hard to hold on. Yet if warming continues, even the best adaptations may not be enough.

Why billionaires need to give more — and give faster.

by  Benjamin Soskis

For the last quarter-century, Bill Gates has been the donor behind what has long been one of the nation's largest private philanthropic foundations, a behemoth that has long dwarfed nearly all other charitable institutions. 

The Gates Foundation, in its commitment to a large, professionalized staff, driven by quantifiable data, and with its focus on global health, has served as a model for many other donors. And as an individual, Gates has long been the world's most recognized philanthropist, in terms of media attention, accolades, and public knowledge. As one of the co-founders of the Giving Pledge, the campaign to get the world's billionaires to donate more than half their wealth to charitable causes, he has also been the individual most closely identified with efforts to shape global philanthropic norms in an age of super-wealth. (Disclosure: I am an employee of the Urban Institute, which receives funding from the Gates Foundation.)

That, in fact, is the best context in which to understand the significance of Gates's recent announcement that he will give virtually all this wealth to the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, and that the foundation would “close its doors permanently” by the end of 2045, after all that money has been given away. With Gates's own wealth listed at north of $100 billion, and his foundation sitting on an endowment of more than $75 billion, Gates estimates that his foundation “will spend more than $200 billion between now and 2045.” As he explained it: “I have decided to give my money back to society much faster than I had originally planned.”

In sheer monetary terms, this pledge, if honored, would be a very big deal. It would require the foundation to maintain an unprecedentedly high level of annual spending, likely doubling its current $9 billion per year. And it would require contemplating a world in which the Gates Foundation no longer exists.

But the extent to which Gates's announcement might encourage important shifts in broader philanthropic norms may be an even bigger deal. To put it simply: It could galvanize billionaires to give more — and perhaps more importantly, to give more faster.

“You could say this announcement is not very timely,” Gates quipped to the New York Times in an interview accompanying his announcement. He meant by this that his new pledge was fueled by an optimism about philanthropy's power to dramatically improve global health that sits oddly with a prevailing sense that progress seems to be eroding. 

But looked at another way, what was most significant about Gates's announcement was not the sheer dollar figure that received so much attention, but its embrace of the importance of timeliness in philanthropy. By philanthropic timeliness, I mean that he's elevated his responsibility to the current moment, to contemporary needs, exigencies, and opportunities, as the driving motive in his giving.

In the rollout of his announcement, Gates has made clear that he is placing a premium on getting more money out the door now. He told the Times that “this is a “miraculous time,” ripe with all sorts of possibilities for astonishing advances in global health, like single-shot gene therapy for HIV/AIDS and new tools to prevent maternal and childhood mortality, like portable, AI-enabled ultrasounds. Given all these opportunities, Gates says, “It makes a big difference to take the money and spend it now versus later.” 

That might seem obvious. But for many philanthropists, foundations are instruments designed as much to warehouse wealth as to give it away. Gates is now putting his celebrity brand behind the latter, pushing for present-day concerns to be met by large-scale philanthropic contributions.

But there's obviously another reason why the current moment matters. Gates's announcement acknowledged that he's committing additional funds at a time when governments around the world, especially in the US, are slashing their own funding for global aid. He has maintained his insistence that philanthropy can never adequately stand in for government funding for global health — in 2023, USAID managed more than $35 billion in appropriations, for instance — and he's situating large-scale giving less as confirmation of the superiority of private philanthropy than as an urgent argument that Elon Musk's team got it wrong in gutting aid. 

“It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people,” he wrote in a blog post explaining his decision. “But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty.”

For this reason, Musk, who has bragged about “feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” has emerged as a sort of nemesis in the rollout of the announcement. “The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates commented to the Financial Times.

It's an uncharacteristic public feud for Gates, who until recently has studiously cultivated a public persona that avoided any hint of partisanship. Still, his comments did conjure up one inconvenient fact: Musk has actually signed the Giving Pledge (in 2012). But Gates took this on directly, and in doing so, offered an implicit critique of the system of philanthropic norms that he had taken the lead in developing. “The Giving Pledge — an unusual aspect of it [is] that you can wait until you die and still fulfill it,” he said in the New York Times interview.

And it's true that from its conception, the Giving Pledge was agnostic on the question of timeliness. The metric of success for the Pledge was getting “this set of billionaires to think earlier in their life about how they're going to give money back, whether it's during their lifetime or at their death,“ as Melinda French Gates said during a 2010 interview with Charlie Rose.

Gates is now signaling a call for donors to do more than start thinking about giving — and start actually giving more now. As he has explained it, he is now pushing the wealthy to increase not just the scale of their giving, but the pace of their giving too. 

It's something Gates learned from the example of Chuck Feeney, the co-founder of a duty-free shopping empire. Feeney gave significant amounts anonymously for years, only willingly embracing a public identity as a mega-donor as a means of spreading a gospel of “Giving while Living.” It's an ethic that Gates namechecked in his announcement as having “shaped how I think about philanthropy.” 

There are a host of reasons why donors have generally preferred to defer giving, from not having the time to devote to philanthropy, to the compulsion to get the gift exactly right, to a desire to maintain funds to address future problems, to the simple fact that for some, it's just hard to let go of wealth. On an institutional level, one of the main challenges is the commitment to perpetuity, which imposes a certain ceiling on spending levels so that the endowment isn't drained. 

For much of the final decades of the 20th century, and for the first decade of the new century, perpetuity was something of an implicit default in the philanthropic sector. In the deliberations over the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which established the regulatory regime under which foundations would operate for the next half-century, Congress considered imposing a 40-year time limit on foundations. The proposal, championed by Sen. Al Gore Sr., was ultimately rejected, and in its stead, a 6 percent (changed a few years later to 5 percent) annual payout requirement was passed, as part of a “Grand Bargain” that exchanged some commitment to “philanthropic timeliness” for the legitimation of perpetuity.

But over the last two decades, the tendency to treat perpetuity as the default mode of philanthropy has eroded. The reasons behind that shift are varied, from the urgency of the environmental crisis (several of the first wave of 21st-century spend-down foundations devoted themselves to the cause), to the propensity of young tech donors who had made their fortunes relatively quickly to look to spend their philanthropic resources quickly as well. 

This might very well be a pivotal moment for the norms surrounding philanthropic timeliness.

In a 2020 global survey, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors found that nearly half of the organizations established in the 2010s were founded as time-limited vehicles, up from around 20 percent in the 1980s. A 2022 survey found that, “Of the responding philanthropies established since 2000, almost one quarter (23 percent) were established as time-limited, representing an increase of 22 percentage points.”

In fact, Bill and Melinda French Gates had never really committed their foundation to perpetuity. Seven years after creating the foundation in 2000, they had pledged to shut it down 50 years after their deaths. At an event in 2022, Gates had suggested that the foundation would last another 25 years. But the new announcement of the 2045 date is a much more definite endorsement of “time-limited philanthropy.”

So this might very well be a pivotal moment for the norms surrounding philanthropic timeliness. We're living through a period defined by cascading crises — climate, racial justice, Covid, and now those related to the Trump administration's budget cuts. In response to each, a handful of foundations have significantly increased their spending rates; some have committed to spend down their assets. 

It's also been a period characterized by the proliferation of high-profile billion-dollar philanthropic pledges from individual donors. These are timely to the extent that they draw immediate public and media attention, but they have not necessarily translated into the commensurate timely disbursement of philanthropic funds. In recent years, MacKenzie Scott captured considerable attention, and for a moment rivaled Gates as the nation's most prominent public philanthropist, with the speed and urgency with which she embraced the challenge of directing her Amazon fortune to philanthropy, and with a commitment to “keep at it until the safe is empty.” She's given some $19 billion away in the last five years, though even she has struggled to keep up with the relentless pace of compounding interest and Amazon's surging stock price; her total wealth has barely budged since. 

Taking it all in, then, there hasn't yet been a definitive shift toward giving now in philanthropy. Might Gates's announcement help precipitate one? If it does, Gates will cast light on a whole other assortment of debates within the philanthropic sector. One of the most important of these relates to a chief paradox of contemporary criticisms of philanthropy, which boils down to the old joke: “The food here is terrible — and the portions are too small!” 

Alongside demands for more and faster giving sit concerns about the ways mega-philanthropy can warp democratic norms and institutions. Gates has not merely been one of the most recognized and celebrated philanthropists, but also one of the most criticized, on precisely those terms. 

Whether the surge of giving that will be coming from the Gates Foundation is compatible with democratic demands — whether, for instance, it can help shift power to local communities and institutions — will likely be as important a question to the construction of the next generation of philanthropic norms as those related to scale and pacing.

How to contend with an onslaught of guidance in an uncertain, lonely world.

by  Eliza Brooke

Illustrations by Rozalina Burkova for Vox

As the eldest daughter in a family of six siblings, with a brain wired for strong convictions, Amy Lentz was born to give advice.

Lentz is a 36-year-old with sea green eyes and wavy brown hair worthy of a shampoo commercial. She works as the chief people officer — the head of human resources — at Toms, the Los Angeles-based footwear company. To hundreds of thousands of followers on TikTok and Instagram, however, Lentz is known as @HackYourHR: a friendly face dispensing wisdom about career and workplace matters, from networking more effectively and receiving feedback without getting defensive to radiating “executive presence” and navigating lowball job offers. “As an older sister, I got called bossy,” she laughs, “and in real life, as an adult, I get called helpful!” 

For decades, this kind of public-facing life advice was popular in syndicated newspaper columns, then on blogs and websites, and now it's everywhere on social media. While scrolling your platform of choice, it's easy to find yourself immersed in a world of bite-sized videos that, like Lentz's, dole out tips for performing better at work, optimizing your potential, and navigating relationship issues. (Exercise and diet advice are a whole other can of keto-friendly worms.)

Some advice-givers are true subject matter experts, and others are ordinary people speaking from their personal experience. In either case, the creator's confidence and the gravity of the subject matter might make you pause your scroll. Here are the two books that will supercharge your business. Here's how to get over the fear that's stopping you from living the life you want. Did you know you can just wake up and have different standards for yourself?

When Lentz started consistently posting videos in early 2023, she discovered that people were eager for professional guidance. “The positive feedback really was kind of life-changing,” she says. “For the first six months, I replied to every single DM and email that I received from people asking for my advice.” People sent screenshots of offer letters, asking her how to respond, and Lentz, locking into big sister mode, would just write the email for them. Some of the messages she received were painful and personal. After the death of a family member, one person felt they couldn't take time off, for fear of letting their team down, and wondered what to do. “I think people are desperate to understand [whether] they're doing the right thing or not,” says Lentz.

This is something of a desperate moment. Politically and economically, Americans are living through a period of tremendous uncertainty, as well as a loneliness crisis. For anyone worried about the security of their job or savings — and for anyone who feels they don't have close friends to consult on life's myriad challenges — there's an obvious appeal to video creators who seem sure of the path forward. 

A willingness to hear advice is not only understandable, but smart, as it leads to better decision-making. “Research has overwhelmingly found that advice is really beneficial, and that people tend to under-utilize advice, usually causing them to make lower quality decisions,” says Lyn van Swol, a professor of communication science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies advice and information-sharing in groups. The catch, she notes, is that most of that research looks at advice from one, two, or three other people, not dozens, hundreds, or thousands of strangers on TikTok: “It's overwhelming — it's like a fire hose of advice.” 

When the right piece of wisdom reaches the right ears at precisely the right time, it can hit like a bolt of lightning. But for every earth-shaking revelation delivered on social media, you can spend hours scrolling through more mundane, but nevertheless urgent, guidance from self-assured individuals with varying levels of expertise. With so many voices on your screen, it would be reasonable to start feeling disoriented or anxious, unsure about your own decision-making skills. Short of deleting your apps, how are you supposed to wade through the morass, taking what's useful and discarding what isn't, as you make your way toward the better life that so many people already seem to be living?

There are many ways of delivering advice, some more effective than others. It will shock nobody to learn that uninvited advice tends to go over very poorly. “People are very resistant to taking unsolicited advice,” says Reeshad Dalal, a professor of psychology at George Mason University with a research background in decision-making and advice. Dalal then poses this question: Does a TikTok video qualify as unsolicited advice? Well, yes, in the sense that you didn't ask for that video to cross your feed. But then again, the algorithm did serve it to you based on your interests and viewing history — so could it be called semi-solicited advice?

Van Swol categorizes advice videos as “masspersonal.” They're interpersonal, but with mass reach; directed at the viewer, but not at you specifically. If part of the problem with unsolicited advice is that it feels judgmental, masspersonal advice smoothes away some of that unwelcome scrutiny and affords the viewer the buffer of anonymity. Offline, good advisers often employ the tactic of laying out a narrative around a problem before launching into their recommendation — a framework reflected on TikTok, where creators tend to blend advice with a personal story. Add in the parasocial element of social media, wherein influencers start to feel like your friends, and you have a recipe for advice that's surprisingly palatable, even though you didn't actively ask for it.

According to social media creators, there's something else at play, too: a very real sense of loneliness and a hunger for answers. Chelsea Anderson, the self-styled “Michael Jordan of babysitting” who shares hacks for child care and adult life on TikTok and Instagram, says that she has always consulted her female friends — “a group of mirrors” — when she needs to make a big life decision. She feels that TikTok now serves as a space for people to do that external processing, not because it's better than in-person bonds but because they don't necessarily have anywhere else to turn. “Community is disappearing, and I think that's why this content hits,” says Anderson. “That room full of mirrors is harder and harder to access in real life.” 

In a world of unknowns, simple and concrete statements are a comfort — and the urge to seek out other people's advice is painfully, sweetly human.

Americans are so lonely that the US Surgeon General's office released an advisory in 2023 stating that social isolation has an impact on mortality comparable to smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. Although the hacks Anderson features in her videos are often lighthearted and imaginative, she has received messages from followers that seem like a true cry for help. “Some of the questions people ask me make me really sad, because they're not questions you should be asking someone on the internet. They are questions you should be asking your best friend or your mom,” Anderson says, adding that she appreciates that people feel comfortable coming to her.

Lentz has noticed a similar undercurrent of distress in the questions she receives about nailing job interviews and landing raises. “I think people feel like they're getting left behind, for a number of reasons, and they desperately do not want to become irrelevant,” she says. Some of this fear is rooted in social comparison, but much of it is tied to daily concerns about funding retirement accounts and covering child care costs. “If I were to get this promotion, I could afford more day care. So there's so much pressure on this interview,” Lentz says. “There's so much weight to people's fears, and I think it's all justified based on our economy.”

Doris Chang, an associate professor at NYU's Silver School of Social Work and a licensed clinical psychologist, understands the appeal of short-form advice videos on TikTok. “There is a human attraction towards things that are really simplified,” she says. “I can see people going, ‘I feel like crap. This video is telling me something to do, and it's only two minutes long.'” She also notes that these videos aren't a substitute for therapy; professional counseling, however, can be expensive and difficult to access.

In a world of unknowns, simple and concrete statements are a comfort — and the urge to seek out other people's advice is painfully, sweetly human. Who among us, grappling with a major conundrum, hasn't reached out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor, hoping they'll shake a new solution loose or summon some wisdom we can't access yet? In these conversations, we lay ourselves bare, with our fears and insecurities on full display, and ask for help making sense of our mess. When we're meant to travel this life together, there's a deep loneliness in problems you don't feel that you can ask anyone about. So we do the next best thing — we go online.

Self-improvement via TikTok is complicated by the fact that time spent on the apps can be a drain on mental health. Passive use of social media — scrolling — has been shown to be associated with anxiety and depression in adolescents, says Jacqueline Sperling, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and co-program director of the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program at McLean Hospital. (Active participation through posting and commenting, however, can have a positive impact on people, helping them find community and foster connections with others.) It's not just young people who are affected by social media: Research has shown that older adults who use social media are more likely to report symptoms of depression. Any wisdom gleaned from short-form life advice videos sits on a balance with these potential downsides.

For people with anxiety in particular, looking at a lot of advice content on social media might end up exacerbating their worries. “It can actually have this harmful function of feeding the desire for reassurance,” says Chang. “There's an unlimited amount of information that can confirm or disconfirm your biggest fears and worries. For someone who's seeking certainty in the world, because that's what anxiety is really about, then being on social media a whole bunch is not going to be helpful.”

In the field of decision psychology, too, Dalal sees a vicious cycle with anxiety and advice-seeking behavior. “The finding is pretty robust: When people are anxious about a decision, they will seek out more advice. ... The reverse can be true as well,” says Dalal. “Anxiety leads to seeking out advice, but knowing that there's all this advice out there might, paradoxically, increase anxiety as well.”

Even among people who aren't particularly anxious, though, information overload can result in a feeling of overwhelm. “There's a classical idea called ‘the paradox of choice,'” says Dalal. “If you go into a grocery store, and I show you 30 varieties of jam and say you can have one for free, that might stress you out. But if I give you three varieties of jam, you would walk away happy that you made the right choice.” Advice, he says, will operate in the same way.

There is another way in which advice videos might affect viewers, and that is as a performance of confidence. In this corner of TikTok, creators are often the picture of self-assurance, speaking clearly and succinctly as they share their guidance, their eyes never straying from the camera. To a certain extent, advice videos are simply a vessel for the reality distortion that takes place across social media more broadly: People often present the most put-together versions of themselves online, leading viewers to feel badly about themselves in comparison. “The contrast is really stark,” says Chang. “You're like, my apartment doesn't look like that, and I'm not that confident, and I don't have the answers.” 

The most successful TikTok advisers may well be those who are most able to express self-confidence. “A huge problem in advice research is that people are very persuaded by confidence,” says van Swol. It doesn't matter whether the advice is great or subpar: “You have a lot of very confident people out there giving advice, and people cannot tell the difference.” (Meanwhile, people with a weak sense of self are especially prone to taking advice.)

“A huge problem in advice research is that people are very persuaded by confidence.”

Some of those confident people are, no doubt, offering solid guidance and attempting to do so in good faith. Lentz is well aware of the power that she holds as someone giving advice online. “I have high self-esteem, so if the person on the other end of the phone has a lower sense of self, sense of identity, they are susceptible,” she says. “I do think there's responsibility with what you put out.”

Still, when you're watching not one or two but dozens of advice videos, it's hard not to suspect that everyone has things figured out except for you — when, in fact, you're not as underqualified to navigate life as you might think. Nor is there a secret shortcut that nobody told you about. “There is this desire for a magic formula,” says Chang, “and if people are offering it with a lot of confidence, it does silence your own intuition about what might be best for you.”

Across the board, experts say that the best way to move through the sea of life advice on social media is to spend some time interrogating a creator's credentials, background, and expertise before taking their suggestions. Sperling recommends using intriguing videos as a jumping-off point for consulting trusted sources and experts off of those platforms: “The key thing is to not act immediately and to take that as an opportunity to learn more.”

Interestingly, content creators say essentially the same thing. “I think oftentimes, especially when it comes to people who post content, we assume they know something that we don't,” says Donavan Barrett, a 28-year-old tae kwon do teacher-turned-personal branding coach. “Sometimes they do, but oftentimes they're just a regular person who decided to pick up their phone and record their opinion.” 

Barrett studied psychology in college and says he has always been the “therapy friend” to those in his life. He now makes videos about mindset and motivation on TikTok, which reflect the type of work he does with private clients. In his videos, which often deal with overcoming self-doubt, he tries to show up as the person whose guidance he could have used as a young person. “I come from a background where I wasn't given the education, the resources, or the know-how to trust myself,” he explains.

Barrett knows how a green screen and a mini microphone can convey a sense of authority — he's made those kinds of videos, too. As a result, he recommends vetting creators before taking their advice and watching out for those who are overly prescriptive in their messaging, particularly when they've made it their business to issue guidance. “The coaching industry, the advice industry, is huge and seems to only be growing,” he says. “There are a lot of people who are going to project their experiences or shove you into their box.” 

Chang expresses a similar idea: “Therapy is all about excavating and reflecting on your unique situation, strengths, resources, and contexts.” If advice videos don't accommodate an individual's specificity and instead offer one-size-fits-all solutions, she says, “I think it's kind of a scam.”

People are generally alike, “ashamed of their needs and afraid to voice them, afraid to honor themselves, afraid to show their vulnerable hearts.”

When figuring out which sources of advice to trust, Dalal recommends looking at trustworthiness, which encompasses both expertise and good intentions — the latter of which can be difficult to judge. As part of that due diligence, it's worth considering someone's financial incentives, which may or may not be 100 percent aligned with your best interests. 

Indeed, life advice videos can be a strong marketing tool for creators, who make much of their money via brand deals and affiliate marketing, or an on-ramp to related business pursuits. “My entire business is from social media,” says Barrett; his clients find him through TikTok and similar platforms. Anderson is currently writing a book of child care and life hacks — she recently left her job at an advertising agency to become a full-time content creator — while Lentz looks at her online presence as a way of building trust and rapport with her audience. She's focused on her corporate career for the time being, but long-term, she would like to run for government office.

Despite the thorniness of navigating advice on the internet — of opening your arms wide to that digital fire hose — there is a certain beauty in the guidance of strangers. “A stranger and a friend can give the same advice, but when a friend gives it, it's easy to imagine that they have prejudices or limitations or resentments that will prevent them from being objective,” Heather Havrilesky, who has penned the advice column “Ask Polly” since 2012, writes to Vox in an email. “It's easy with a friend to think, ‘You're just saying that because you don't understand what it's like to be an artist and you never liked my husband and you think having kids is the most important thing anyone can do.' A stranger has the advantage of dropping down like a god and delivering a verdict without revealing their own prejudices and limitations.”

Havrilesky isn't familiar with TikTok advice, but writing “Ask Polly” for over a decade seems to have resulted in an approach to counseling strangers that is more complex — messier, perhaps — than what appears in some of those bite-sized videos. She used to feel that other people were usually the problem in her readers' lives: “The early days were all about encouraging people to stand up for themselves and to refuse to settle for people, places, and things that they tolerated out of guilt, perceived obligation, or compulsive people-pleasing.” Now, she understands that people are generally alike, “ashamed of their needs and afraid to voice them, afraid to honor themselves, afraid to show their vulnerable hearts.”

Here, as in real life, there are no quick tips, no shortcuts, no magic solutions. Haley Nahman, who writes an advice column for her popular Maybe Baby newsletter, says she is rarely looking to provide answers, but rather to help readers reframe their questions. “I find that you can wrestle with the wrong question for years,” she says, “and when you reframe it, it's actually much simpler to answer.” 

Havrilesky doesn't attempt to offer a concrete path forward, either. Her goal is to incite catharsis or a perspective shift. She doesn't always know where an answer is going when she begins writing, but while unearthing her own feelings and facing her own fears (because people are generally alike), she ends up harnessing an energy that she hopes to impart to the reader.

﻿Even other right-wing populists can't count on Trump's support.

by  Joshua Keating

Is President Donald Trump leading a vanguard of right-wing populist world leaders, working together to lay waste to the liberal international order while consolidating power at home? 

Possibly — but based on his recent foreign policy actions, he doesn't appear to think so. 

Establishment-bashing politicians around the world, from Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro to the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte to the UK's Boris Johnson, have drawn comparisons to Trump over the years. Some, notably Hungary's Viktor Orbán and Argentina's Javier Milei, have cultivated ties to the Trump-era American right, becoming fixtures at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and making the rounds on US talk shows and podcasts. In Romania's recent presidential election, the leading right-wing candidate somewhat confusingly described himself as being on the “MAGA ticket.”

Trump himself has occasionally weighed in on other countries' political debates to endorse right-wing politicians like France's embattled far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Some of Trump's senior officials have spoken openly of wanting to build ties with the global right. In his combative speech at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, Vice President JD Vance described what he sees as the unfair marginalization of right-wing parties in countries like Romania and Germany as a greater threat to Europe's security than China or Russia. Trump ally Elon Musk has been even more active in boosting far-right parties in elections around the world. 

But just because Trump and his officials like to see politicians and parties in their own mold win, that doesn't mean countries led by those politicians and parties can count on any special treatment from the Trump administration. This has been especially clear in recent weeks.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Just ask Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has spent years cultivating close ties with the US Republican Party, and with Trump in particular, and has followed a somewhat similar path in bringing previously marginalized far-right partners into the mainstream. All that has been of little use as Trump has left his Israeli supporters aghast by carrying out direct negotiations with the likes of Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran and being feted by Gulf monarchs on a Middle East tour that pointedly did not include Israel. 

India's Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, has likewise been compared to Trump in his populist appeal, majoritarian rhetoric, and dismantling of democratic norms. Trump has cultivated a massive coterie of fans among Hindu nationalist Modi supporters as well as a close working relationship with Modi himself. 

But after Trump announced a ceasefire agreement in the recent flare-up of violence between India and Pakistan, Trump enraged many of his Indian supporters with remarks that appeared to take credit for pressuring India to halt its military campaign and drew equivalence between the Indian and Pakistani positions. Adding insult to injury, Trump publicly criticized Apple for plans to move the assembly of American iPhones from China to India, a move that in other administrations might have been praised as a victory for “friendshoring” — moving the production of critical goods from adversaries to allies — but doesn't advance Trump's goal of returning industrial manufacturing to the US. 

Even Orbán, star of CPAC and favorite guest of Tucker Carlson, has appeared frustrated with Trump as of late. His government has described its close economic relationship with China as a “red line,” vowing not to decouple its economy from Beijing's, no matter what pressure Trump applies. Orbán's simultaneous position as the most pro-Trump and most pro-China leader in Europe is looking increasingly awkward. 

Overall, there's simply little evidence that political affinity guides Trump's approach to foreign policy, a fact made abundantly clear by the “Liberation Day” tariffs the president announced in April. 

Taking just Latin America, for example, Argentina — led by the floppy-haired iconoclast and Musk favorite Javier Milei — and El Salvador — led by Nayib Bukele, a crypto-loving authoritarian willing to turn his country's prisons into an American gulag — might have expected exemptions from the tariffs. But they were hit with the same tariff rates as leftist-led governments like Colombia and Brazil. 

Ultimately, it's not the leaders who see eye to eye with Trump on migration, the rule of law, or wokeness who seem to have his fear. It's the big-money monarchs of the Middle East, who can deliver the big deals and quick wins he craves. 

And based on the probably-at-least-partly Trump-inspired drubbing inflicted on right-wing parties in Canada and Australia in recent elections, it's not clear that being known as the “Trump of” your country really gets you all that much. Whatever his ultimate legacy for the United States and the world, he doesn't seem likely to be remembered as the man who made global far-right populism great again, and he doesn't really seem all that concerned about that.

The Republican justices draw a line in the sand – in an order that makes absolutely no sense.

by  Ian Millhiser

On Thursday evening, the Supreme Court handed down a brief order, which temporarily permits President Donald Trump to fire two federal officials who, by law, are shielded from being summarily terminated. That, in itself, is not particularly significant because, on April 9, Chief Justice John Roberts acted on his own authority to temporarily permit Trump to fire the same two officials. So the practical effect of Thursday's order in Trump v. Wilcox is simply to maintain the status quo.

That said, the Thursday order does contain some important new information from the Court's Republican majority. While the Republican justices have signaled for quite some time that they are eager to give the president broad authority to fire officials that Congress intended to insulate from presidential control, the order includes a paragraph signaling that they will not allow Trump to fire members of the Federal Reserve.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

From a legal perspective, the paragraph is difficult to parse. And, as Justice Elena Kagan writes in a dissenting opinion, is not supported by the legal authority it cites. But it is likely to reassure investors that, while the Supreme Court does appear eager to expand Trump's authority over previously independent parts of the federal government, it won't permit him to disrupt the Fed's ability to make technocratic decisions about interest rates. 

The immediate stakes in Wilcox involve a former member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which enforces labor laws and adjudicates union-related disputes, along with a former member of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which hears disputes claiming that a civil servant's employment protections were violated. Trump fired both shortly after taking office, despite the fact that federal law only permits them to be fired for some sort of neglect or malfeasance.

The NLRB and the MSPB, moreover, are just two of an array of “independent” agencies led by multi-member boards, whose members all enjoy similar employment protections – agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Federal Reserve.

For at least 15 years, when the Court handed down Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Board (2010), a majority of the justices have signaled that they are eager to strip Congress of its authority to create such independent agencies, and give the president full authority to fire these agencies' leaders at will. Many economists and investors, meanwhile, have warned that it would be particularly dangerous to strip the Federal Reserve — which is supposed to set interest rates based on delicate economic calculations and not based on what will benefit the sitting president — of its independence, as doing so could throw the US economy into chaos.

Thursday's order is a clear signal that the Court has heard these concerns and does not intend to eliminate the Fed's independence. It is unlikely to satisfy many constitutional scholars, as its explanation for why Federal Reserve leaders should be treated differently than the leaders of any other independent agency is so baffling that it appears contrived. 

Regardless of the underlying reasoning, however, the order does strongly suggest that this Court will not give Trump full control over the Fed.

Trump v. Wilcox is the culmination of a longstanding grudge many Republican legal elites hold against Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935), the Supreme Court case establishing that Congress may create independent agencies whose members may only be fired for cause. 

Though the leaders of these agencies are typically nominated by the president for a term of several years, and confirmed by the Senate, Humphrey's Executor explained that laws protecting them from being fired while in office are supposed to ensure that they “act with entire impartiality,” and “exercise the trained judgment of a body of experts.”

All six of the Court's Republicans, however, have made it clear they believe in a theory known as the “unitary executive,” which is incompatible with Humphrey's Executor.

The Constitution provides that “the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” In a 1988 dissenting opinion, which many legal conservatives now treat as if it were a holy text, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that “this does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power.” And thus, if a federal official is charged with executing federal laws in some way, they must be fully subject to presidential control.

If you take this unitary executive theory seriously, then there should be no doubt that Federal Reserve governors may be fired at will by the president. The Fed's authority over interest rates, after all, derives from federal statutes instructing it to pursue the dual goals of “maximum employment” and “stable prices.” So the Fed is charged with executing federal laws.

But the consequences of stripping the Fed of its independence could be catastrophic. 

In 1971, President Richard Nixon pressured Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates in advance of Nixon's reelection race — the idea was to juice the economy right while voters were weighing Nixon's record — and Burns complied. In the short term, this worked out great for Nixon. The economy boomed in 1972, and Nixon won reelection by a historic landslide. But Burns's action is often blamed for years of “stagflation,” slow economic growth combined with high inflation, in the 1970s.

The Fed, in other words, has the power to effectively inject cocaine into the US economy – giving it a temporary boost that can be timed to benefit incumbent presidents, at the cost of much greater economic turmoil down the road. It's not hard to see how presidents could abuse their power if they can fire members of the Federal Reserve who refuse to give the economy such a temporary and costly high.

One might think that these risks would be enough to caution the justices against overruling Humphrey's Executor. But the Republican justices appear quite committed to the unitary executive theory, and they have been that way for quite some time. (If you want to know more about why they feel this way, I can refer you to three separate explainers I've written on this subject.)

And so those justices spend the bulk of Thursday's Wilcox order laying out the process they are likely to use to formally overrule Humphrey's Executor. The order announces that the Trump administration is “likely” to prevail in its bid to fire NLRB and MSPB officials, and it temporarily blocks lower court decisions that reinstated the two officials at issue in this case. But the Court puts off the question of whether to formally repudiate Humphrey's Executor until after the ordinary appeals process plays out and the justices receive full briefing and oral argument on whether to do so — which could happen as soon as the Court's next term.

Embedded within all this language laying out the process to challenge Humphrey's Executor is the paragraph indicating that the Fed is safe. While the two fired officials “contend that arguments in this case necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market Committee,” the order states, “we disagree.”

The justices who joined the order then offer a single sentence explaining why: “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”

It's certainly possible to parse the components of this sentence. The description of the Fed as a “quasi-private entity,” for example, may refer to the fact that much of the Fed's authority is wielded through regional entities, which are themselves controlled by board members who are mostly selected by commercial banks. But it is hardly unusual for members of the private sector to be given a formal role within government — just ask Elon Musk. Indeed, the Supreme Court heard at least two cases this spring involving the role experts from the private sector may play in setting government policy.

The “First and Second Banks of the United States” are 18th- and early 19th-century predecessors to the Fed. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to create national banks in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), but the nation abandoned national banking under President Andrew Jackson, setting off a period of economic turmoil, including an economic depression shortly after Jackson left office.

But it's unclear what any of this has to do with the president's powers as outlined in the Constitution. If the theory of the unitary executive is correct, then no entity — regardless of whether it is “quasi-private” or is part of a “distinct historical tradition” involving banks — may execute federal laws, unless that entity is controlled by people who are themselves under presidential control. As a legal matter, the Court's explanation of why the Fed is special is nothing more than word salad.

The only legal authority that the Wilcox order cites to support its claim that the Fed is special is a footnote in its pro-unitary executive decision in Seila Law v. CFPB (2020). But nothing in that footnote provides any support for this claim.

As Kagan points out in her dissent in Wilcox, the only relevant language in that footnote is a throwaway line responding to her partial dissent in Seila Law. Kagan had argued that “federal regulators” historically have enjoyed some insulation from the president. The footnote dismisses this argument, stating that even “assuming financial institutions like the Second Bank and the Federal Reserve can claim a special historical status,” the agency at issue in Seila Law does not qualify.

The Court, in other words, waved away Kagan's argument that institutions like the Fed should be shielded from presidential control in Seila Law. Now, however, the justices in the majority appear to be signaling they believe there is some merit to Kagan's argument.

If the Court does formally overrule Humphrey's Executor in the coming months, the justices in the majority will likely elaborate on why a different rule should apply to the Fed. The best reading of the Wilcox order's one paragraph about the Fed is that a majority of the justices have already decided that they want to protect it, and they would now like some smart lawyers to file briefs coming up with an argument for that position — one that uses terms like “quasi-private” and that refers to the early history of national banking.

Of course, this is not how the law is supposed to work — judges are not supposed to start with the outcome that they want and then invite members of the bar to explain how to get there. But this also will hardly be the first time that the Roberts Court started with its intended outcome and reasoned backward to get there. It's just being more transparent this time around.

One of the GOP justices must have defected in a case about religious schools, but the Court didn't reveal who it was.

Libby v. Fecteau is an awful case about an anti-trans lawmaker who nonetheless needed to win.

The Supreme Court sided with Trump at the expense of Venezuelan immigrants.

The Birthright Citizenship argument wasn't the only significant news out of the Supreme Court on Thursday.

It's more complicated than it should be.

Much of the hearing focused on whether Richard Nixon can save Trump's tariffs.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shreya Mishra Reddy, a 33-year-old Visa technical program manager completing Harvard Business School's Program for Leadership Development. It has been edited for length and clarity. BI has verified her enrollment in the program.

I'm an international student at Harvard Business School's Program for Leadership Development, and I'm reeling from the news of the Trump administration blocking Harvard from enrolling foreign students.

I moved to the US from India in 2021 to do my master's at Duke University, and then got my dream job at Visa in Austin.

After I started working at Visa, I came across this program at Harvard, which is an alternative to their executive MBA. I applied to that program, and I absolutely did not think that I would get accepted, but I did. It was one of the best moments of my life.

When I told my parents, they were so excited. I went from being a first-generation immigrant in the US to being accepted to one of the best schools in the world.

I took out a loan to fund the $50,000 tuition fee, and now I'm on the verge of completing the course. I just have one module left, from May to July.

I was at home in the middle of a meeting when I saw the news pop up on my phone that Harvard had been banned from accepting international students.

I went numb for a minute because I knew my module was supposed to start in a few days, and I was supposed to travel to Boston in July. My tickets are all booked.

When I read the news, the first thing I did was text my father back in India, saying that I don't know if I'm going to be able to graduate from Harvard. I don't know if I will be allowed back on campus or able to travel to Boston at all, and I'm really worried.

I've emailed the university to ask what was happening and if they had an update for us, but I haven't heard back yet.

I hope to hear back soon because the program starts in just a few days.

I was excited to start classes again, meet all the professors back on campus, and see my batchmates again.

Harvard's program was one of the best experiences I've had so far. The professors were extremely invested in our growth, and the candidates in my program held C-suite positions in Big Tech companies. The class discussions were excellent.

With this news, I don't plan to enroll in another school for the executive program.

Getting into Harvard was not just about a degree; it was about studying in one of my dream schools. It does not make sense for me to try to pursue the same kind of degree from any other school or country.

I'm now on an optional practical training (OPT) visa that expires in January, and I've not had any luck getting picked for an H-1B visa. So, I'm planning to leave the country in January.

But I don't know where I'll go or what I'll do. It's all up in the air now.

Trump's Higher Ed Fight:

Harvard University won a temporary court order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing a ban on international students at the school, giving it a win in a high-stakes legal fight with broad implications for higher education in the US.

US District Judge Allison Burroughs ruled on Friday that the government can't enforce the ban, which it imposed the day before. Burroughs issued her ruling just hours after Harvard sued the US in Boston federal court. She granted the university a temporary restraining order, finding that it would sustain “immediate and irreparable injury” if the Department of Homeland Security directive went into effect.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Imposing legal requirements on tokens that mimic dollars is overdue. That means reining in the market's biggest player.

Desperate for attention.

Photographer: Camilo Freedman/Bloomberg

For more than a decade, federal policymakers stood by as the market value of stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to the dollar or another currency — ballooned to about $250 billion, overtaking the deposit bases of many regional banks. So it's encouraging to see Congress finally determined to establish some guardrails.

Well-regulated stablecoins could provide some helpful competition for existing cross-border and interbank payment technologies. The bills under consideration — the Senate's Genius Act and the House's Stable Act — aim to impose some useful limits. Many details remain to be ironed out. But the test for any final legislation should be a relatively simple one: Does it constrain overseas companies such as Tether Holdings SA, the industry's dominant issuer and biggest risk?","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Trump's Higher Ed Fight:

The Trump administration's sudden move to bar foreign students at Harvard University is seen as dealing a blow to the US's standing in business — and handing an advantage to elite rival colleges across the English-speaking world.

“I was shocked,” said Zheng Fang, a 1996 graduate of Harvard Business School whose Keywise Capital Management oversees about $2.5 billion in investments from Hong Kong. The decision “will not only jeopardize Harvard's academic strength, but also hurt US competitiveness,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

GOP Tax Bill:

Chances of a close brush with a US payment default are growing as the Senate plans for time-consuming revisions to President Donald Trump's sprawling, multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package.

Republican congressional leaders attached an increase in the US legal debt limit to the president's signature economic legislation. That gambit adds urgency to the enactment of a top-priority bill, but could put averting a default at the mercy of the complex legislative obstacle course that lies ahead.

The anti-missile shield that Donald Trump wants to put in the sky could protect North America from attacks. But it could also invite them.

The “Golden Dome” that is some day supposed to make North America safe from incoming enemy missiles has now made it into the One Big, Beautiful Bill wending its way through Congress, with a budget ask for a relatively small ante ($25 billion) into a pot that will eventually grow into the hundreds of billions. The idea sprung out of Donald Trump's own golden dome, and the president, in presenting it this week, seemed appropriately effulgent.

The question is whether this astronomically ambitious missile-defense shield — which will require sensors, interceptors, satellites, software, lasers and more, all of them stitched together seamlessly with artificial and human intelligence — is a good idea. I don't just mean financially, but strategically: Would it make America (and possibly Canada) safer?","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

A federal judge further blocked the Trump administration from sharply cutting jobs and reorganizing the structure of many major federal agencies as part of its so-called DOGE effort under billionaire Elon Musk.

The order issued late Thursday granted a preliminary injunction that pauses further reductions in force and ""reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit.""

The Trump administration on Friday morning appealed the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and is expected to ask that court to block the injunction from taking effect.

""Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,"" wrote Judge Susan Illston in her order in U.S. District Court for the District of Northern California.

""But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that — by statute — they must carry out,"" Illston wrote.

""Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a President may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.""

Illston's injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit challenging the effects of a Feb. 11 executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which said it ""commences a critical transformation of the Federal bureaucracy."" The order directed heads of federal agencies to prepare for large-scale reductions in force.

The suit was filed by a group of unions representing federal workers, as well as advocacy groups, and several cities, states and counties.

The Trump administration has already requested that the Supreme Court issue an emergency pause of Illston's initial temporary restraining order blocking its reorganization efforts.

""That far-reaching order bars almost the entire Executive Branch from formulating and implementing plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, and requires disclosure of sensitive and deliberative agency documents that are presumptively protected by executive privilege,"" wrote U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer in the May 16 application to the high court.

""Neither Congress nor the Executive Branch has ever intended to make federal bureaucrats 'a class with lifetime employment, whether there was work for them to do or not,'"" Sauer wrote. ""This Court should stay the district court's order.""

The mass firing of federal employees has been a pillar of Trump's domestic policy in the early months of his second term.

In this article

The once-solid relationship between President Donald Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook is breaking down over the idea of a U.S.-made iPhone.

Last week, Trump said he ""had a little problem with Tim Cook,"" and on Friday, he threatened to slap a 25% tariff on iPhones in a social media post.

Trump is upset with Apple's plan to source the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. from its factory partners in India, instead of China. Cook officially confirmed this plan earlier this month during earnings.

Trump wants Apple to build iPhones for the U.S. market in the U.S. and has continued to pressure the company and Cook.

""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday.

Analysts said it would probably make more sense for Apple to eat the cost rather than move production stateside.

""In terms of profitability, it's way better for Apple to take the hit of a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the US market than to move iPhone assembly lines back to US,"" wrote Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on X.

UBS analyst David Vogt said that the potential 25% tariffs were a ""jarring headline,"" but that they would only be a ""modest headwind"" to Apple's earnings, dropping annual earnings by 51 cents per share, versus a prior expectation of 34 cents per share under the current tariff landscape.

Experts have long held that a U.S.-made iPhone is impossible at worst and highly expensive at best.

Analysts have said that made in U.S.A. iPhones would be much more expensive, CNBC previously reported, with some estimates ranging between $1,500 to $3,500 to buy one at retail. Labor costs would certainly rise.

But it would also be logistically complicated. 

Supply chains and factories take years to build out, including installing equipment and staffing up. Parts that Apple imported to the United States for assembly might be subject to tariffs as well.

Apple started manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017 but it was only in recent years that the region was capable of building Apple's latest devices.

""We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note on Friday.

Other analysts were wary about predicting how Trump's threat ultimately plays out. Apple might be able to strike a deal with the administration — despite the eroding relationship — or challenge the tariffs in court. 

For now, most of Apple's most important products are exempt from tariffs after Trump gave phones and computers a tariff waiver — even from China — in April, but Apple doesn't know how the Trump administration's tariffs will ultimately play out beyond June.

""We're skeptical,"" that the 25% tariff will materialize, wrote Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.

He wrote that Apple could try to preserve its roughly 41% gross margin on iPhones by raising prices in the U.S. by between $100 or $300 per phone.

It's unclear how Trump intends to target Apple's India-made iPhones. Rakers wrote that the administration could put specific tariffs on phone imports from India.

Apple's operations in India continue to expand. 

Foxconn, which assembles iPhones for Apple, is building a new $1.5 billion factory in India that could do some iPhone production, the Financial Times reported Thursday.

Apple declined to comment on Trump's post.

U.S. travel to Portugal has boomed in recent years, and it's now the No. 1 country where Americans are hoping to move abroad.

That's according to a survey of 116,363 Americans who looked into leaving the U.S. throughout 2024 administered by Expatsi, a company that provides relocation tours and expat resources.

Visitors to Expatsi's website are invited to complete a 20-question assessment to see which country might suit them best, based on their lifestyle preferences (like weather and local policy), future plans (like studying or working), financial means and other factors.

Survey-takers are also asked about the countries they're most interested in learning more about. The top-requested countries include:

Portugal is also the No. 1 most recommended country to survey-takers based on the preferences they select in the assessment, followed by France, Spain, Greece and Switzerland.

The top reason people give for wanting to move out of the U.S. is for adventure, enrichment and growth, according to the survey. Some 56% of respondents say the U.S. is too conservative, while 53% feel the country is too divided. Roughly half of the expat-curious say they want to move for more or different freedoms, and to avoid the threat of gun violence; 41% say they hope to save money while living abroad.

Two-thirds of Expatsi's test-takers say they want to leave the U.S. by 2026, with 12% saying they hope to move in the next six months. Thirty percent hope to retire abroad, 18% are seeking a digital nomad visa, and 17% say they will move with a skilled worker visa.

More Americans have considered moving abroad since the 2024 presidential elections.

A CNBC analysis of U.S. Google search data showed a spike in users searching for terms related to ""how to move to X country"" beginning in June 2024. Site traffic to Expatsi spiked to nearly 51,000 visitors in the month of November, up from roughly 8,000 in October, following President Donald Trump's re-election.

Interest in Expatsi's resources tend to rise after contentious political events, says Jen Barnett, who co-founded the company with her husband Brett Andrews in 2022 and saw a first wave of interest after the Roe v. Wade decision was overturned that summer.

Now, their business is booming.

Expatsi's revenue is up 19,632% year-over-year, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, as the company sold a growing suite of products including relocation scouting trips, one-on-one consultations and tickets to events like a conference in San Antonio starting Friday and running through the weekend, where over 300 guests will hear from speakers to learn about the process of moving abroad: from obtaining a visa and moving your finances overseas, to choosing the right neighborhood and finding a job as a foreigner.

The company helped more than 200 people go on relocation tours in 2024, Barnett tells Make It. ""About 5% are fully moved, and another 25% are in the paperwork stage, meaning they've filed visa applications or have appointments to file,"" she says.

A federal judge in Boston on Friday temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, hours after the private school filed a lawsuit challenging that draconian action.

The order came a day after the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students under the F-1 visa program at the behest of Secretary Kristi Noem, saying the private school tolerated ""anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators"" on campus.

Judge Allison Burroughs, in issuing a temporary restraining order on Friday morning, allowed international students to remain enrolled at Harvard pending a court hearing, which she scheduled for Tuesday.

Burroughs said Harvard had shown that unless that TRO was granted, ""it will sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hear from all parties.""

""A TRO is justified to preserve the status quo pending a hearing,"" the judge wrote.

DHS said Thursday that Harvard was barred from enrolling future international students, and that current foreign students enrolled at the school had to leave the school or risk losing their legal status in the United States.

The ban affected more than 7,000 current visa holders studying at Harvard, which has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration for months.

Among the foreign students at Harvard is Princess Elisabeth, the future queen of Belgium, who is pursuing a master's in public policy there.

President Donald Trump last month said that Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status.

""With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,"" the school said in its lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.

""Harvard's certification is essential for each of Harvard's thousands of international students to lawfully remain in this country while they complete coursework, obtain degrees, and continue critical research,"" the suit said.

The lawsuit called the revocation a ""blatant violation of the First Amendment"" and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The school also said it was the ""latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said that Harvard's ""lawsuit seeks to kneecap the President's constitutionally vested powers under Article II"" of the Constitution.

""It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments,"" McLaughlin said.

""The Trump administration is committed to restoring common sense to our student visa system; no lawsuit, this or any other, is going to change that. We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.""

DHS on Thursday said it revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification because the Ivy League school's leadership ""has created an unsafe campus environment by permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including many Jewish students, and otherwise obstruct its once-venerable learning environment.""

Harvard's suit noted the Trump administration's action came days before graduation.

""Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,"" the complaint says.

Harvard President Alan Garber, in a letter to the school community on Friday, wrote, ""We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action"" by the Trump administration.

""The government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard's failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security,"" Garber wrote.

""In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department's requests as required by law,"" he wrote.

The suit says that Noem, in an April 16 letter to Harvard's International Office, demanded information about each student visa holder at Harvard's 13 schools within 10 business days, accusing Harvard of failing ""to condemn anti-semitism.""

The suit says Harvard produced the requested information on April 30 and provided additional information on May 14.

""Yet, on May 22, 2025, DHS deemed Harvard's responses 'insufficient' — without explaining why or citing any regulation with which Harvard failed to comply — and revoked Harvard's SEVP certification 'effective immediately,'"" the complaint said.

The suit notes that in recent weeks and months, the Trump administration's Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism has conditioned the continued issuance of ""numerous federal benefits"" to Harvard, including billions of dollars in grants and other funding, on the university ""accepting sweeping changes to Harvard's governance, admissions, hiring, and academic programs.""

""When, on April 14, 2025, Harvard refused to accede to these demands, the government's retribution was swift,"" the suit says.

""Hours later, the government froze more than $2.2 billion in federal funding critical to the support of ongoing cutting-edge research at Harvard,"" it says.

In his letter Friday, Garber addressed international students and scholars affected by the enrollment ban.

""Know that you are vital members of our community,"" Garber wrote. ""You are our classmates and friends, our colleagues and mentors, our partners in the work of this great institution.""

""We will support you as we do our utmost to ensure that Harvard remains open to the world.""

In this article

President Donald Trump said in a social media post Friday that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the United States.

""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

Shares of Apple fell about 2% on Friday after the post.

Apple's flagship phone is produced primarily in China, but the company has been shifting manufacturing to India in part because that country has a friendlier trade relationship with the U.S.

Some Wall Street analysts have estimated that moving iPhone production to the U.S. would raise the price of the Apple smartphone by at least 25%. Wedbush's Dan Ives put the estimated cost of a U.S. iPhone at $3,500. The iPhone 16 Pro currently retails for about $1,000.

This is the latest jab at Apple from Trump, who over the past couple of weeks has ramped up pressure on the company and Cook to increase domestic manufacturing. Trump and Cook met at the White House on Tuesday, according to Politico.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with Fox News on Friday that he was not part of the meeting at the White House but that the Apple situation could be part of the Trump administration's push to bring ""precision manufacturing"" back to the U.S.

""A large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors. So we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure,"" Bessent said.

Cook gave $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and attended the inauguration in January. Apple has announced a $500 billion spend on U.S. development, including AI server production in Houston.

Apple declined to comment for this story.

The company said during its May 1 earnings report that it expects about $900 million in additional costs for tariffs in the current quarter. Cook said on the company's earnings call that the tariff outlook was ""very difficult to predict"" past June.

Foxconn, one of Apple's main iPhone assembly partners, is spending $1.5 billion on expanding its India facilities, the Financial Times reported Thursday.

Trump has publicly criticized other major U.S. companies, including Walmart, during his trade war push, but the levies on a specific consumer product is a new step. The exact legal mechanism for the tariff is unclear.

Trump followed up his post about Apple with another one calling for a 50% tariff on products from the European Union. Taken together, the posts point to trade tensions increasing again after the U.S. had temporarily lowered many of its levies, including in an agreement with China.

Apple also had to navigate tariff threats during Trump's first term, when a 15% tariff on Chinese imports was being considered in 2019. At that time, Cook had a strong relationship with Trump and the final trade deal excluded core Apple products from the duties.

As Apple is caught in the U.S. president's crosshairs, the company is also seeing weak demand in China. On Friday the company hiked trade-in incentives for iPhones in China.

Nuclear power stocks surged Friday on a report that President Donald Trump will sign executive orders to speed the construction of reactors and secure key materials for the industry.

Advanced reactor companies Oklo and NuScale jumped more than 25% and 18%, respectively. Constellation Energy, the largest nuclear operator in the U.S., was up more than 1%. Cameco Corp., one of the biggest uranium miners in the world, rose about 8%.

Trump could sign the orders as early as Friday, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The president is scheduled to sign orders in the Oval Office at 1 p.m. ET, according to the White House schedule.

Trump will invoke the Defense Production Act to declare a national emergency due to U.S. dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium, nuclear fuel processing and inputs for advance reactors, according to a draft summary viewed by Reuters.

The president is also expected to direct federal agencies to permit and site new nuclear facilities, according to Reuters. He will also order the Departments of Energy and Defense to identify federal land and facilities where nuclear can be deployed and streamline the process to build them, Reuters reported.

In this article

Apple on Friday raised the amount of money people can get off their next iPhone in China by trading in their old device, rolling out further incentives to spur demand in a crucial market.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max now has a trade-in value of up to 5,700 Chinese yuan ($791), an increase from 5,625 yuan previously. For reference, a brand new iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at 7,999 yuan in China. The iPhone 15 Pro model can now be traded in for up to 4,750 yuan, up from 4,725 prior.

There are also trade-in value increases across other models too.

Apple has looked to offer discounts over the last year, especially around holiday periods in China. While the latest hikes are not huge, they signal Apple's ongoing desire to galvanize sales in the world's second largest economy, where it has faced falling market share and declining sales amid tougher competition from local rivals.

In the first quarter of the year, Apple's China shipments fell 8% year-on-year, while the company's share of the smartphone market in the country declined from 15% to 13%, according to data from Canalys. Apple also reported this month that sales in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell slightly on an annual basis.

But Apple's China headache goes beyond sales to questions over its supply chain and products. While U.S. President Donald Trump has paused most tariffs on China for now, there is still an ongoing discussion about whether chips and other electronics may receive a special duty.

Apple, which makes around 90% of its iPhones in China via its manufacturing partner Foxconn, has been looking to move more production to India — though Trump has also voiced displeasure with that. The White House leader said this month that he told Apple CEO Tim Cook he doesn't want the company building products in India and would rather them make devices in the U.S.

Apple's biggest challengers number Xiaomi and Huawei, with the latter seeing a stunning revival in its home market over the last 17 months thanks to breakthroughs in chips and aggressive launches of new devices.

Xiaomi, which was the biggest player by market share in China in the first quarter, has meanwhile been ramping up its presence in the high-end device space to directly compete with Apple. On Thursday, the company launched the Xiaomi 15S Pro smartphone that contains an in-house developed chip — something very few companies in the world have managed to do successfully.

Xiaomi has also committed nearly $7 billion to develop more chips over the next 10 years, signaling its ambition to compete with Apple and Huawei.

It's been rare for a string of positive economic news to emerge out of the U.K. in 2025 — but this week in particular has given Britain three reasons to be optimistic.

Data on Friday signaled unexpected positive momentum in the country's economy, with retail sales rising by a much better-than-expected 1.2% in April, and GfK's consumer confidence index showing an improvement in sentiment.

Sterling gained 0.6% against the U.S. dollar after the figures were published on Friday, to trade at around $1.35. 

The combination of the two positive figures on Friday bucked expectations, and logic, for some economists. Economic activity in April was widely expected to show a downtrend, in part thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war. 

""Well now, that challenges the idea of a cautious consumer,"" said Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding that a number of factors, some not influenced by politicians or businesses, were at play.

""That said, official sales growth looks too good to be true, likely as the seasonal adjustment fails to adequately control for the later Easter this year,"" Wood added. ""There's no doubt the weather helped a lot, with both March and April registering the most sunshine since records began.""

Taken in isolation, Friday's retail figures and consumer confidence data perhaps point to growth in the current quarter. However, British electricity regulator Ofgem added to the positive sentiment by declaring on Friday that electricity prices are set to decline by 7% in July. That could potentially fuel spending in other sectors in the coming months.

""This is certainly an improvement for household expenses, with monthly bills likely to fall on average by around £11,"" said Ellie Henderson, economist at Investec.

Meanwhile, the string of positive elements could potentially bump up U.K. economic growth for the second quarter as a whole, according to Allan Monks, chief U.K. economist at JPMorgan who is forecasting a 0.6% annualised gain.

""With the household savings rate so high, a continued improvement in confidence has the potential to unlock further consumer spending gains,"" JP Morgan's Monks said in a note to clients on Friday. ""High inflation, softer wage growth and weak employment argue against a continuation of that trend. But the rise in confidence in May was matched by a notable drop in unemployment fears, lower inflation expectations and a rise in spending intentions.""

The outlook for the U.K. has seesawed over the past year. The country has grappled with setbacks like unexpected economic contraction and mounting concern about fiscal spending plans, while also seeing some more positive data and the agreement of landmark trade deals with the U.S., India and the EU. 

Earlier this week, official figures showed the economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2025 — although that came as domestic inflation surged to 3.5% in April. Last week, another data print showed average earnings in the U.K. had grown by 5.9% on an annual basis.

The mix of data meant economists appeared divided on Friday about what the latest bout of data meant for the U.K.'s long term economic picture. 

Alex Kerr, U.K. economist at Capital Economics, warned that ""the sun won't shine on [Britain's] retail sector forever.""

""Although for the first time since 2015, excluding the pandemic, retail sales volumes have risen for four months in a row, April's impressive 1.2% m/m rise was largely driven by the unusually warm weather,"" he said in a note sent shortly after the figures were published.

""That boost won't last. So even though consumer confidence ticked up slightly in May, we suspect retail sales growth will slow over the coming months.""

While most economists viewed the small increase in consumer confidence in May as a positive signal for next quarter's economic growth, others suggested that as overall sentiment remains below pre-pandemic levels, the link between spending and sentiment may be broken instead.

""Depressed British consumers have resorted to retail therapy to cope with their economic and financial woes,"" said Andrew Wishart, senior UK economist at Berenberg.

Instead, Wishart said a combination of the pandemic, and the ensuing inflation and interest rate hikes led consumers to shore up their finances.

""Households have increased their saving rate (the share of household income not spent) to a level previously unseen outside of periods of mass unemployment,"" Wishart added.

Having stabilized their bank balances and secured pay rises, consumers are now spending in anticipation of a more stable interest rate and price environment, according to the economist. 

Counter intuitively, the additional spending means the Bank of England was more likely to hold rates for the rest of the year, than cut, he added.

Janet Mui, head of market analysis at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin, said in an email on Friday morning that with wage growth now outpacing inflation, U.K. households are spending more generously. However, she cautioned that the state of Britain's public finances ""remain a constraint.""

""With higher borrowing costs, more tax rises and departmental spending cuts may happen,"" she explained. ""This poses some medium-term growth risks for the U.K amid ongoing uncertainty with how the global trade situation will settle.""

Twin Cities Suburbs

According to an investigator's affidavit, the Twin Cities man clicked a phishing link, then quickly opened his Coinbase app “and saw his digital assets were being moved out of his wallet” with no ability to stop it.

By Paul Walsh

A Twin Cities man opened an email, realized his mistake and watched as more than $2 million was drained from his Bitcoin account in a phishing scam, according to a state investigation.

An investigator working with the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) financial crimes task force laid out the Anoka County man's reverse windfall in a search-warrant affidavit filed this week. It seeks to gather information from the prime suspect's social media account.

The filing said the task force investigator in recent weeks has been communicating with the suspected cryptocurrency thief, who possibly has ties to Nigeria.

As of Friday, there have been no arrests or charges in connection with the case, said Brooklyn Park police Inspector Matt Rabe. The suburban department's cyber unit supervisor, Sgt. Jake Tuzinski, is heading up this investigation. 

Once the investigation is complete, the case will be sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office for consideration of charges, Rabe said. The Minnesota Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged.

Tuzinski said Friday that everyone needs to “take a pause while reading these emails. Verify who the email is coming from. Check not just the name of the header such as ‘From: Coinbase,' but also drop it down and look at the full email domain it is coming from.”

 According to the search warrant affidavit:

The man, identified only as J.S. in the filing, told Tuzinski in September 2024 that “he was on his phone when he received an email from what he thought was Coinbase support. J.S. said he kept all his digital assets, which included over 40 Bitcoin, on his Coinbase Wallet app.”

J.S. continued that “after he clicked on a link contained within the email, he realized the email was not legitimately from Coinbase and suspected it was a phishing attack. J.S. then went to his Coinbase Wallet app and saw his digital assets were being moved out of his wallet.”

The man estimated that the sum of his digital assets in various accounts totaled $2.4 million, nearly all of it in Bitcoin. 

J.S. reached out to Coinbase in an effort to stem the fiscal bleeding. But Coinbase said its exchange — which helps users make transactions — and the Wallet app are “two different things, [and] they were unable to stop any transactions.”

Tuzinski unearthed each suspicious transaction and “noted the movement of the Bitcoin was consistent with money laundering and obfuscation,” the investigator wrote in the search-warrant affidavit.

The investigator said he then turned to cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance and identified the suspect “through Nigerian documents and a self portrait.”

The suspect explained in an email the Bitcoin was given to him anonymously, but “I believe [him] to be more involved than just simply receiving an anonymous donation,” Tuzinski wrote.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who “mine” them by lending computing power to verify other users' transactions. They receive Bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies. 

Bitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators — and criminals.

The long-running con known as phishing is one of many scams plaguing U.S. consumers in an onslaught that can feel relentless, with criminals targeting individuals via mail, email, phone, text and social media.

Experts in protecting cryptocurrency offer numerous tips on protecting assets from theft. They include:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Kentucky's Bitcoin Boom Has Gone Bust","https://www.wired.com/story/kentuckys-bitcoin-boom-has-gone-bust/","Fri, 23 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

If you drive outside the city of Campton, population less than 400, the low industrial noise of crypto mining rises from the trees. Step closer, and the source comes into view: squat metal buildings that look like shipping containers arrayed in a semicircle, thrumming with fans and processors. There's chain-link fencing, security cameras, and two guards sitting in pickup trucks just beyond the wire.

There are steel shipping containers like this all over these hills, right where the old coal mines once stood. And inside, specialized computers race to solve complex math problems—competing to verify bitcoin transactions and earn slivers of digital currency as a reward.

For a brief moment, in 2021, it felt like the region had found its next boom—and it had Bitcoin written all over it. At its peak, Kentucky accounted for some 20 percent of the collective computing power dedicated to proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining in the US.

But booms, here, have a history. And so do busts. Local officials say it is hard to pin down the exact number of crypto mines still active in eastern Kentucky because state regulations are light and there's a general lack of transparency in the industry. But what is clear, locals say, is that the boom has begun to recede.

“ They'd constructed on someone else's land, or they would be paying a host company to provide the physical plant,” alleges Anna Whites, a lawyer who represented a roster of crypto mining clients. “So they'd pay the down payment or they would convince the landowner to pay the down payment, and then they would mine the first three months and then they'd go into the next billing set cycle, go almost to the end of it and then disappear.”

In early 2022, when Mohawk Energy initiated a crypto mining project in Jenkins, Kentucky, local officials said this time it would be different. Cofounded by Kentucky senator Brandon Smith, Mohawk purchased a sprawling 41,000-square-foot building and the 8 acres around it. It leased most of it to a Chinese crypto mining company, and the rest of the building included classrooms and hands-on training centers that were supposed to teach locals how to repair iPads, maintain Bitcoin rigs, and build skills for a digital economy. It was a big deal for Jenkins. A local PBS station ran a story about the launch. The images showed tool kits, workers, and smiling officials.

“The plan with Mohawk was to employ retired coal miners and disabled veterans who were back in eastern Kentucky and couldn't find work, and train them,” said Whites, who counts Mohawk as one of her clients. Among other things, the project promised near-six-figure salaries and a vow to put some of the mining proceeds into the training program, to help grow it. And for a time, it worked.

Whites said that for a brief moment—about 18 months—things looked promising. Twenty-eight families saw real gains: One person from each family landed a permanent job, and about 30 more relatives found work nearby. But when we asked where things stood now, she paused. “I believe most of them are unemployed again.”

The unraveling came quickly. The Chinese partner sued for breach of contract. Mohawk counter-sued. And the shared crypto profits never materialized. Now, as some Kentucky residents have soured on bitcoin mining, they've started to speak about AI data centers in the same way they used to talk about coal seams and hash rates: with a kind of cautious hope. AI, they say, could bring jobs, fiber optics, and permanence.

Colby Kirk runs a nonprofit called One East Kentucky, focused on bringing economic development to the region. He remembers the moment the conversation shifted, back in April when he was in Paducah for the Kentucky Association for Economic Development's spring conference.

“They had some site selection consultants that were on the panel, and they were talking about data centers,” he recalls. “And they talked about this I-81 corridor up through Pennsylvania where there's all kinds of these big data centers. And they talked about whether our communities could prepare for some of these kinds of investments? And the consultant was like, here's kind of what it takes.”

What it takes, it turns out, is no small feat: flat land, lots of power, fiber connectivity, and a workforce that can wire and weld. As fate would have it, the number of welders in the area, according to regional economic development organization One East Kentucky, is about twice the national average, which stands to reason, because wherever there's metal and stress—and there's a lot of both in coal mines—welders are the people who keep it all from falling apart.

The old infrastructure is still there too; substations, hardened ground, cooling systems, and power-hungry hardware just waiting to be switched back on. “Maybe a data center or something is a part of the puzzle,” Kirk said.

So, at the conference, when the panel ended and the floor opened to questions, Kirk says he asked the one he couldn't stop thinking about.

“You know, 50, 60 years ago it would take a room bigger than my office to power a computer, and now I've got a computer I carry around in my pocket that's more advanced than what we sent astronauts to the moon with,” he recalls asking. “Are these data centers going to keep taking up million-square-feet buildings with 30- and 40-foot ceilings, or are we gonna be left with an abundance of warehouse or industrial-scale buildings that we won't be able to keep up?”

The consultant, he claims, didn't have a good answer. “And that's the thing,” Kirk says. “We don't know what the future's going to hold when it comes to this stuff.”

That kind of ambiguity doesn't sit well with Nina McCoy. She's a former high school biology teacher from Inez, a coal town made famous in 1964 when President Lyndon Johnson used it to generate support for his War on Poverty.

“This is going to sound awful,” she says, “but if they're putting it here, then that means it's bad. We've lived here long enough to see that that is how it works. You put those things that you don't want in your neighborhood in a place like this.”

Her skepticism is rooted in lived experience: In October 2000, a massive coal slurry spill from a mine site upstream poisoned the Coldwater Fork stream, which runs behind her house. People in Inez couldn't drink water from the tap for months.

“Those of us living downstream didn't hear about it for a while, but the school system had to close down for about a week until they got an alternate water source,” she says.

To this day, many in Inez still don't trust the tap water.

So when McCoy hears the hype about AI, she hears something else: another promise that comes with a cost. “We've allowed these people to be called job creators,” she said. “And I don't care if it's AI or crypto or whatever, we bow down to them and let them tell us what they are going to do to our community because they are job creators. They're not job creators, they're profit makers.”

And the profit leaves a footprint.

AI data centers demand staggering amounts of energy—a ChatGPT search uses up to 10 times more energy than a regular Google one—and they run hot. To keep them cool, these facilities consume billions of gallons of water every year. Most of that evaporates, but residents are wary because they have had problems with facilities and their runoff in the past, so they worry these new facilities could affect fish and disrupt the land. The very things the residents of Kentucky hope to preserve.

Still, some locals see potential, even progress.

“AI is in everything that we do,” said Wes Hamilton, a local entrepreneur who did his fair share of crypto mining in Kentucky in its heyday. “Siri, ChatGPT, robotics—everything you can imagine has to have AI,” he said. “Bitcoin is a one-trick pony. You create it. The only person that gets paid is the owner of the machines.”

Hamilton claims there is a path forward where data centers bring in investors, engineers, maybe even companies willing to stay. All the AI people in the world would be steaming into Kentucky, Hamilton says. And while he admits to losing a fortune in crypto ventures in the past, he claims this is different.

When Bitcoin first arrived, lawmakers offered generous tax breaks to lure miners. Companies investing more than $1 million were exempted from paying sales taxes on hardware and electricity. And then, in March 2025, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear took all that and went a step further by signing a “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law.

The legislation, cast as a defense of personal financial freedom, is designed to enshrine the right to use digital assets in Kentucky. An earlier draft went further, aiming to bar local governments from using zoning laws to restrict crypto mining operations—a provision that drew resistance from environmental groups. That language was eventually tempered, but the intent remains: to signal that, in Kentucky, digital extraction can keep humming.

Which is why we found ourselves outside this facility in Campton, staring at this semicircle of metal buildings nestled in the trees. The mines run all night and all day, even Sundays. And the question some are asking now, with bitcoin hovering around $100,000 and big miners talking about pivoting to AI, is whether bitcoin mining gets a second wind in Kentucky.

Mohawk's bitcoin mining may even make a comeback. Anna Whites said the parties are supposed to go into arbitration May 12th. “I'm hopeful,” she told us. “I'm very hopeful that they sit down and say, ‘Mighty nice plant you have there. Let's just go ahead and turn it on.'”

What was setting up to be a somewhat sleepy session ahead of the holiday weekend is no more as President Trump woke up and chose to reignite what had been cooling trade tensions.

""The European Union ... has been very difficult to deal with,"" said the president in a Truth Social posting. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the EU, starting on June 1.""

The leader of the free world also took aim at Apple (AAPL) and its CEO Tim Cook. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the U.S. will be manufactured and built in the U.S., not India or anyplace else. If that's not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple.""

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) continue to show signs of strength heading into the weekend, with bullish sentiment lifting prices. BTC is holding steady above $111,000 as traders eye the long-awaited $120,000 milestone. Meanwhile, ETH and XRP prices found support at their key levels, suggesting the uptrend may carry ETH toward $3,000 and XRP toward $3.

Bitcoin's price rallied and broke above its all-time high of $109,588 on Wednesday. It continued its rise, setting a new ATH of $111,980 the next day. At the time of writing on Friday, it stabilizes at around $111,000.

BTC enters a price discovery mode: if it continues its upward trend, it could extend the rally toward a key psychological level of $120,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 76, above its overbought level of 70, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, traders should be cautious as the chances of a pullback are high due to its overbought condition. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator also showed a bullish crossover on Wednesday, giving buy signals and indicating an upward trend.

BTC/USDT daily chart

If BTC faces a pullback, it could extend the correction to retest its key support at $105,000.

Ethereum price has retested and found support around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $2,446 since last week. On Wednesday, it recovered nearly 5% by the next day. At the time of writing on Friday, it continues to trade higher at around $2,700.

If ETH continues its upward trend, it could extend the rally to retest its key psychological level at $3,000.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 74, above its overbought level of 70, indicating strong bullish momentum. However, traders should be cautious as the chances of a pullback are high due to its overbought condition. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator also showed a bullish crossover on Thursday, giving buy signals and indicating an upward trend.

ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if ETH declines and closes below its 200-day EMA at $2,446, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychological level at $2,000.

XRP price rebounded after retesting its 50-day EMA at $2.30 last week and recovered slightly.

However, as of this week, it again declined and rebounded from this level, recovering 3%. On Friday, it continues to recover, trading at around $2.46.

If XRP continues to recover, it could extend the recovery to retest its next resistance at $2.72 before heading toward the $3 mark.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 58, above its neutral level of 50 and pointing upward, indicating bullish momentum. The MACD indicator is also about to flip a bullish crossover. It could further support the bullish thesis if it successfully completes a bullish crossover.

XRP/USDT daily chart

If XRP breaks and closes below its 50-day EMA on a daily basis, it could extend the correction toward its next key support at $2.23.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The blockchain forgets nothing, but it sometimes bounces back with unexpected elegance. While some observers relegated Ethereum to slow stagnation, the Pectra affair has rewritten the script. 3.8 billion dollars injected into the ecosystem later, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is getting a new breath of life. Is it just a flash in the pan or the beginning of a revival? Analysis.

There are technical updates that go unnoticed. And then there is Pectra. Deployed on May 7, this upgrade did not just refine the network: it awakened billions of dormant dollars.

Realized capitalization — an indicator that measures an asset's value based on the last price paid for each ETH crypto — rose from 240.8 to 244.6 billion dollars.

This jump of 3.8 billion, although modest on a global scale, reflects renewed confidence. Unlike market capitalization, often inflated by speculation, Realized Capitalization (Realized Cap) offers a truer mirror of investors' commitment. It's concrete capital invested at a given price, not algorithmic fluff.

This trend reversal, after three months of massive capital outflows, marks a sharp break. Technical signals become tangible: capital is flowing, and the ETH crypto is regaining strength. Is it Pectra that charmed? Or a market, tired of its wait-and-see attitude, looking for an excuse to relight the fuse? Maybe a bit of both.

Money is coming back. But users, they seem to remain at the door. This is one of the paradoxes highlighted by Glassnode. Since the update, active addresses — new or reactivated — have slightly decreased: -1.8% for the former, -8.4% for the latter.

A naive interpretation would see this as a sign of fatigue. But looking closer, this decline can also be read as consolidation. Less noise, but more conviction. The blockchain tourists are gone. Only the builders, the believers, those for whom ETH is not just a ticker to trade but an infrastructure to inhabit, remain.

And the numbers confirm this hypothesis: the disengagement rate drops by 8.5%. In other words, active users stay longer, interact more, get involved. It is not a gold rush, it is a slow digital colonization.

With a price flirting again with 2,500 dollars, Ethereum seems determined to become the main stage of the crypto ecosystem again. But it will all depend on what comes after Pectra. The update played its role as a catalyst, but it is not an end. It is a promise.

If Realized Capitalization continues to grow, supported by a loyal user base, ETH could well stabilize at a higher plateau. But if this capitalization increase is only the result of a passing euphoria, without concrete adoption in the background, then the awakening could be brutal. According to Arthur Hayes, Ethereum could defy all predictions.

Bitcoin and most altcoins pulled back on Friday, erasing some of the gains they made earlier this week.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $107,300, down by 4.12% from its highest point this week. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) fell by over 8% from its weekly high, while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, fell from this week's high of $1.28 trillion to $1.19 trillion. 

The ongoing crypto crash coincided with the sell-off in the stock market. Futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 fell by over 1%, continuing a sell-off that has been going on since Monday.

Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market retreated as trade concerns resumed. In a TruthSocial post, President Donald Trump said that trade talks with the European Union were going nowhere, and warned that the US will apply a 50% tariff on all goods from the region.

The statement meant an escalation at a time when market participants have been hoping for a deal between the two allies. 

Europe has hinted that it will respond by hiking tariffs on US goods, including Boeing jets. In a statement this week, Ryanair's CEO warned it would consider cancelling a $33 billion order from Boeing and switching to Airbus if Boeing planes were hit with tariffs. Ryanair is Boeing's biggest customer. 

These trade concerns are coming a week after Moody's sent shockwaves in the financial market by downgrading the US credit rating. It also came as the House of Representatives voted for the Big Beautiful Bill that will increase US debt by over $3.8 trillion in a decade.

This is not the end of the crypto market bull run for three main reasons. First, the 50% tariff on European goods is a negotiating tactic as Trump did with China. After pushing tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, he pared them back to 30% earlier this month. 

Second, Bitcoin has become a safe haven asset. Most recently, it outperformed the stock market after the Liberation Day tariffs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have added over $8 billion in inflows since April. 

Bitcoin's appeal as a safe-haven asset is mostly because of its demand and supply metrics. Demand from institutions continues to rise as supply on exchanges and over-the-counter venues continues to fall. Also, Bitcoin has proven itself as a worthy asset in the last 16 years as it jumped from near zero to $111,900 this week.

Third, these pullbacks in Bitcoin and altcoins are normal. Just recently, Bitcoin fell from $109,300 in January to $75,000 in April and then bounced back to a record high. In 2024, it peaked at $73,340 in March, fell to $49,390 in August, and rebounded to a record high in November.

There have been major developments this week in the crypto landscape:

These developments signal growing institutional interest and a maturing regulatory environment for digital assets. For investors, this could highlight fresh opportunities in the altcoin market.

With a ‘Greed' indicator of 76 and the market cap rising, the evidence of a ‘risk-on' sentiment is clear. This is particularly clear when you note the rise of altcoins like $MIND of Pepe, which have raised over $10M in their presale.



Let's delve into some of the best altcoins that could see an uptrend given these encouraging signs.

With MIND of Pepe ($MIND), a new era of meme coin intelligence appeared, a unique fusion of the iconic Pepe culture and cutting-edge AI.

$MIND is your gateway to AI alpha, offering a winning edge in the fast-paced crypto markets. Its sophisticated AI will scour on-chain data, social sentiment, and emerging trends to reveal key insights and signals to give you a running start in the market.



Holding $MIND unlocks your access to these exclusive, AI-generated reports and analytics, designed to sharpen your strategies.

We predict $MIND could hit $0.00535 (a 72.52% increase from the start of the presale) by the end of 2025. And this seems ever more likely with the positive regulatory shifts increasing market sentiment.

It's about democratizing alpha by combining the market-moving power of Pepe with the deep analytical skills of AI. Get ready to think smarter, not just harder.

Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) represents much more than a popular NFT collection. It's a rapidly expanding global IP and symbol of positivity, known for its ‘Pugdy Power.'

This beloved brand has successfully bridged Web3 and the mainstream with its adorable characters appearing as actual toys in major retail stores and an expanding content universe.

The $PENGU coin invites you to join the ‘Huddle,' the passionate community at its heart, and participate in its growth.



$PENGU is central to this ecosystem, potentially offering governance, exclusive access, and rewards, allowing holders to ‘Waddle to Wealth' by sharing in the brand's expanding success.

Swivel into the CEO's chair with Hamster Kombat ($HMSTR), the record-shattering Telegram game phenomenon captivating 300M players globally.



The $HMSTR token is the lifeblood of the ecosystem, designed not just for the largest crypto game ever, but for a future that extends far beyond that.

Having already broken records like achieving the largest Telegram channel (52M+ subs) and the fastest 100M+ player onboarding (2 months), Hamster Kombat is set for potentially crypto's largest airdrop from its 100B token supply.

But $HMSTR is more than an airdrop; it's a community-driven token set to power a burgeoning game publishing platform and seamlessly onboard the next billion users into Web3.

Your in-game strategy and engagement directly translate into your stake in this ecosystem. The Hamsters could be the new whales!

It's time for a radical shift with SUBBD ($SUBBD), moving beyond simple disruption and into creator liberation. This platform is set to dismantle traditional barriers content creators face, offering real autonomy and ownership.



Picture an ecosystem where you fully control your content, your audience data, and your monetization, free from high platform fees and restrictive policies.

The $SUBBD token fuels that revolution, facilitating transparent transactions, community governance, and access to tools designed for direct creator-to-fan engagement and value exchange.

It's about empowering artists, writers, musicians, and all creators to build sustainable careers on their own terms, fostering creative and financial freedom, making it one of the best presales.

It's the dawning of the age of authentic creator empowerment with $SUBBD.

As the crypto industry matures and becomes more welcoming, it opens the space to crypto innovation and investment.

Especially with the positive regulatory signals we've seen this week, unique projects offering real value will naturally catch the eye of investors looking to navigate the space.

Coins like $SUBBD and $MIND, with their bold visions and cutting-edge approaches, are great examples of the exciting opportunities popping up in the altcoin market.

While the innovation, potentially being supported by clearer regulations, is exciting, it's still essential to do your homework. Crypto is a rollercoaster, so do your own research to see if an investment fits with your goals and finances.

Attention is turning to major tokens as bitcoin BTC$109,495.30 set fresh highs earlier this week, with some pointing out that institutional demand and a clear regulatory environment pave the way for strong moves among the top coins.

Bitcoin was hovering just under $111,000 during the Asian morning hours on Friday, seeing a slight pullback on profit-taking as is expected after upward moves. Cardano's ADA$0.78602, dogecoin DOGE$0.23673 and Solana's SOL$182.56 added as much as 4%, while ether ETH$2,575.93, XRP$2.38, and BNB Chain's BNB$672.58 rose less than 1.5%.

The broad-based CoinDesk 20(CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, rose 1.2% in the past 24 hours.

Bitget Research's Chief Analyst Ryan Lee told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that a potential dip in bitcoin dominance could kick off a broader alt season, with high-profile names like XRP and Solana in prime position to benefit.

Lee pointed to XRP's improving regulatory clarity and recent technical breakout patterns as reasons traders are eyeing a move toward $3–$8 in the medium term.

XRP recently formed a golden cross against BTC on the weekly chart — a historically bullish signal suggesting a long-term trend reversal may be underway. The ratio has been locked in a sideways channel since late 2020, but that may now be breaking after last month's SEC decision not to pursue further appeals against Ripple.

SOL could climb toward $220–$300 on ETF speculation, while ADA shows potential for a breakout between $1 and $3, Lee added.

Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast that the latest BTC move confirmed a robust trend supported by improved structural fundamentals and relatively low volatility.

""This rally feels more structurally sound than the last with less frothy momentum-chasing and stronger fundamental underpinnings,” the firm said, adding that the brief dip following BTC's initial record high break triggered put-side profit-taking, but buyers were “quick to reload on the upside.”

Still, broader macro risks remain in play. Renewed tariff concerns, rising U.S. yields, and a stronger dollar could all inject volatility into the system, especially for altcoins, QCP said. Traders are urged to stay selective, focusing on assets with strong fundamentals and clear regulatory narratives.

Meanwhile, FxPro's Alex Kuptsikevich shared in an email that bitcoin's sentiment index is hovering just below “extreme greed” as of Friday, a sign that the rally may still have room to run in the coming days.

Crypto analyst Astronomer has provided insights into when the altcoin season will likely begin following the Bitcoin price's rally to a new all-time high (ATH). His analysis indicated that BTC's dominance is about to top, which will pave the way for altcoins to outperform the flagship crypto. 

Altcoin Season To Begin Soon As Bitcoin Price Hits New ATH

In an X post, Astronomer predicted that the altcoin season is imminent, seeing as BTC's dominance (BTC.D) has hit 65% following the Bitcoin price rally to a new ATH. The analyst remarked that BTC's dominance will roll over slowly first, before dropping rather quickly after the flagship crypto loses momentum. 

He is also confident that the altcoin season is coming soon because BTC.D is up seven weeks in a row and all green from the bottom, which means the Bitcoin price-led move is stretching long. From a counting perspective, Astronomer remarked that BTC is coming to the end of the transition period, and altcoins will likely make their bigger moves soon. 

The analyst noted that BTC.D has also nicely retested the quarterly breaker open. For now, he believes sentiment is certainly not ready for an altcoin season, seeing as only the Bitcoin bulls are loud. Astronomer added that the ETH bulls are quiet and that only coins that are Bitcoin liquidity-driven are talked about, including HYPE, WIF, and the Bitcoin price itself. 

He is confident that 65% is the top for the BTC.D despite calls for 67% and 70%. With the Bitcoin price dominance currently at almost 63%, Astronomer affirmed that he is well-positioned for the top, with altcoin season coming after. The analyst stated that soon, these altcoins will put in their big moves until they are forced to become the narrative again, where they top out. 

Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto is also confident that the altcoin season is imminent amid the Bitcoin price's rally to a new ATH. In an X post, he stated that where the market is headed in the coming months, every lagging altcoin is an opportunity to be thankful for, not a problem to be frustrated about. 

BTC Is Forming A Top At Current Price Levels

In an X post, crypto analyst CryptoVerse stated that the Bitcoin price is likely forming a top at its current levels. He admitted that the flagship crypto could still rally to between $112,000 and $118,000 but warned that it could mark the cycle peak. The analyst also stated that he is not expecting an altcoin season before the fourth quarter of this year. 

CryptoVerse remarked that based on global liquidity trends, the altcoin season should begin in the fourth quarter and wrap up by the second quarter of next year. He noted that there could be short-term bounces, but a full-blown rally is unlikely to happen before then.

 As the US Senate advances the GENIUS Act and lawmakers reintroduce the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, Washington is finally stepping up to the plate on crypto. 

In this week's episode of Byte-Sized Insight, on Decentralize with Cointelegraph, we break down a pivotal moment for US crypto legislation. 

In a 66–32 procedural vote on May 19, the US Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.

The GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.

“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week's interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn't stop at definitions. 

By this, he's referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.

This bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. 

“There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven't had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”

On the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don't custody customer funds.

“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That's the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”

With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.

Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert's advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”

The San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken is bringing tokenized versions of popular US-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETF) to its clients in select non-US markets.

In a statement, Kraken says it partnered with the tokenized stocks and ETF issuer Backed to launch xStocks on the Solana (SOL) blockchain.

xStocks, a tokenized equities brand developed by Backed, taps blockchain technology to offer tokenized versions of US-listed equities.

Says Kraken Global Head of Consumer Mark Greenberg,

“Access to traditional US equities remains slow, costly and restricted. With xStocks, we're using blockchain technology to deliver something better – open, instant, accessible and borderless exposure to some of America's most iconic companies. This is what the future of investing looks like.”    

Kraken says xStocks assets will be issued as SPL tokens, the standard token format on the Solana blockchain, and will be available to eligible clients through its app.

“These xStocks assets can be traded both on our platform as well as onchain through compatible wallet providers, allowing users to leverage their xStocks as collateral in ways that simply is not possible through TradFi.”

Kraken says Solana is selected as the launch chain for xStocks because of the blockchain's performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem.

The exchange says that it plans to expand the range of tokenized assets and the jurisdictions where xStocks is supported.

 Blockchain's rigidity limits Web3. Web3's scalability and future lie beyond traditional blockchains. Expect a shift toward flexible, verifiable systems prioritizing efficiency over rigid total ordering 

Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.

While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. 

Mobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.

Some will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. 

While Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through ""blobs,"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.

Like in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.

There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.

This doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. 

Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and ""Ethereum killers"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point.

R3 and Solana Foundation have partnered to bring regulated real-world assets onto a public blockchain.

This collaboration will bring together R3's private enterprise blockchain, which is used by regulated financial institutions, and the Solana public mainnet, the organizations said in a Thursday (May 22) press release.

The combination of their capabilities will help regulated financial institutions meet the demand for tokenized real-world assets, according to the release.

The R3 ecosystem of permissioned real-world asset networks currently has over $10 billion in regulated assets on-chain across its platforms, the release said.

The Solana blockchain serves a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments and gaming, per the release.

Solana Foundation President Lily Liu said in the release that the collaboration of the two organizations “signifies that the future of capital markets will be built on public infrastructure.”

“This is a major step forward for the institutional adoption of public blockchain,” Liu said. “R3's decision to bring its regulated financial network onto Solana is a powerful validation that public blockchains have reached institutional readiness.”

R3 Founder and CEO David E. Rutter said in the release that connecting the TradFi and DeFi ecosystems will make for “a strategic realignment for the entire industry.”

“This is about adapting to deliver real-world utility, institutional-grade readiness and shaping the long-term future of regulated markets,” Rutter said.

The tokenization of real-world assets is driving an on-chain revolution across capital markets, with blockchain technology enabling greater efficiency, liquidity and automation, PYMNTS reported in April.

Tokenized real-world assets have the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient while enhancing transparency, security and global reach. Representing real-world assets on the blockchain — such as real estate, private equity and venture investments, fine art and collectibles, physical commodities like gold, fixed income instruments, intellectual property assets, and stocks and equities — can transform the way ownership of assets is recorded and enable new functions.

It was reported Thursday that cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is set to start rolling out tokenized equities that will be available to customers in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia in the coming weeks.

These xStocks will trade on the Solana blockchain, will be backed by shares held by Backed Finance and will be redeemable for the cash value of the underlying securities.

Share this article

Alchemy has acquired HeyMint, a user-first NFT launchpad, to accelerate and strengthen Alchemy's mission to simplify and scale user onboarding in web3 through its Smart Wallets solution, the company announced Friday.

Unveiled earlier this year, Alchemy Smart Wallets are enterprise-grade, programmable smart contract wallets that enable frictionless onboarding, gasless transactions, enhanced security, and flexible authorization methods for web3 users and developers. 

Alchemy noted that HeyMint's shared emphasis on accessibility and ease of use makes it a strong complement to Smart Wallets. Alchemy and HeyMint did not disclose the deal terms.

HeyMint's products, such as its Launchpad and Allowlist tools, reflect a strong track record in reducing barriers to entry and enhancing accessibility, goals that directly support the expansion of Alchemy's Smart Wallet ecosystem.

“HeyMint's focus on creating the most accessible and user-friendly experience aligns perfectly with Alchemy's vision of onboarding the next generation of users and technology companies to web3, and we are excited to welcome their team into ours,” said Joe Lau, co-founder and President of Alchemy, in a statement. “Together, we will continue to improve and evolve Alchemy's Smart Wallets.”

Alchemy added that incorporating HeyMint's proven SDK and embeddable web3 engagement tools will empower developers to seamlessly integrate Smart Wallet functionality into a variety of platforms, including apps, games, marketplaces, and loyalty programs.

HeyMint's no-code tools have served over 1 million users and supported more than 40,000 creators in generating $38 million in NFT sales. The platform has powered web3 campaigns for global brands including MasterCard, Ubisoft, Universal Music Group, and The Sandbox.

To date, HeyMint tools have saved creators an estimated $9 million on allowlists and over $29 million in NFT launch costs, as noted in the announcement.

The acquisition also brings on HeyMint co-founder and CTO Flor Ronsmans De Vry, a veteran web3 developer and founder of blockchain automation firm Fuse Robotics.

“We built HeyMint to make web3 accessible to anyone,” said Ronsmans De Vry. “Joining Alchemy gives us the scale and reach to take that vision further — and make secure, user-first onboarding available to every developer and project.”

This is Alchemy's second strategic acquisition this month. Just last week, the company acquired DexterLab, a top Solana infrastructure provider trusted by firms like Google and the Solana Foundation.

The move is expected to enhance Alchemy's infrastructure portfolio and accelerate innovation as it expands support beyond Ethereum.

 HeyMint is Alchemy's second acquisition this month, joining the recently announced Solana ecosystem company Dexter Lab. 

Web3 developer platform Alchemy has acquired HeyMint, a California-based non-fungible token (NFT) launchpad, in a move designed to enhance the company's smart wallet infrastructure. 

The undisclosed funding deal will see HeyMint's infrastructure embedded within Alchemy as it seeks to simplify user onboarding for Web3 applications, the company disclosed on May 23. HeyMint's co-founder and chief technology officer, Flor Ronsmans De Vry, joins Alchemy as part of the deal. 

While not a household name in crypto, HeyMint attracted more than 1 million users over its first two years of operations. It was the launchpad behind $38 million in NFT sales and supported the Web3 efforts of major brands, including The Sandbox, Universal Music Group and Ubisoft. 

In 2023, HeyMint facilitated NFT sales for the Partnership for Central America, a private sector coalition that included Mastercard.

The HeyMint acquisition is Alchemy's second funding deal this month. The company recently acquired Dexter Lab, a real-time data infrastructure provider for Solana, for an undisclosed amount.

2025 is shaping up to be a more active year for crypto mergers and acquisitions (M&As), especially in the United States, where regulatory clarity and a pro-industry administration are encouraging dealmaking.

There has been a flurry of high-profile deals in recent weeks, including Robinhood's acquisition of Canadian digital asset operator WonderFi for $179 million and Coinbase's $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said his crypto exchange is eyeing more M&A opportunities.

One of the biggest acquisitions was completed in April when Ripple purchased prime brokerage Hidden Road for $1.25 billion — a deal the payments company said would expand its horizons within institutional finance. 

Beyond M&As, crypto venture capital funding has also been on the rise. PitchBook data revealed that, while the number of deals declined last quarter, the value of investments more than doubled compared to a year earlier.

Web3 developer Alchemy has announced the acquisition of NFT launchpad HeyMint, the startup behind the web3 initiatives employed by MasterCard, Ubisoft and many more.

According to a press release sent to crypto.news, the blockchain infrastructure designer aims to accelerate the development of its smart wallets solution through its latest acquisition. 

By bringing the HeyMint and HeyMint Quest teams into the fold, the firm hopes to expand its developer support, simplify integrations and further expand on developing the project's Smart Wallet solutions. Alchemy hopes to one day turn Smart Wallets into the default way for onboarding new users into the web3 space.

According to data from analytics site BundleBear, Alchemy (ACH) is currently the number one smart wallet in the ERC-4337 ecosystem, having deployed more than 13 million smart wallets.

Through the integration of HeyMint into Alchemy's corporate structure, HeyMint's co-founder and CTO, Flor Ronsmans De Vry and other members of the HeyMint team will join the company.

De Vry is known in the crypto space as a renowned web3 developer who also established the U.K.-based blockchain automation company Fuse Robotics. The HeyMint co-founder is prepared to contribute SDK knowledge and years of experience in scaling critical blockchain applications.

“Joining Alchemy gives us the scale and reach to take that vision further — and make secure, user-first onboarding available to every developer and project,” said De Vry in his statement.

De Vry founded the NFT-focused startup alongside Mai Akiyoshi and Ben Yu. With more than 1 million users, HeyMint is known for creating various tools that require no coding experience. Over 40,000 creators have used HeyMint's tools, generating around $38 million in combined NFT sales.

Not only that, the team has also helped support a number of web3 initiatives for major companies, including Mastercard, Ubisoft, Universal Music Group, and The Sandbox.

President and co-founder of Alchemy, Joe Lau, said that the company is looking forward to onboarding the HeyMint team. He hopes the integration will help to improve and accelerate innovation for the firm's smart wallets.

“HeyMint's focus on creating the most accessible and user-friendly experience aligns perfectly with Alchemy's vision of onboarding the next generation of users and technology companies to web3, and we are excited to welcome their team into ours,” said Lau.

Transparency is the cornerstone of accountability, and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) is designed to increase transparency. But this legislation isn't just about responding to requests; public authorities must also publish information proactively. This allows the public to routinely access information that is in the public interest and is safe to disclose. 

The ICO's Upstream Regulation team is here to support public authorities to be open and accountable with the public you serve. In my blog last summer, I mentioned that compliance with the duty to proactively publish information is an area we intended to look at. This is an update on where we're up to with that work. 

The Freedom of Information Act requires all public authorities to have a publication scheme, to publish information in accordance with it, and to regularly review it.  

We looked at whether more than 70 public authorities - from sectors including health, education and local government - had publication schemes. We identified 18 that didn't have one published on their website and made further enquiries with them all. Following our work, all have now taken steps to comply with this requirement and publish more information proactively. We have also been made aware of other public authorities who have heard about our work in this area and have then updated their publication schemes. 

It's worth remembering that public authorities shouldn't just look at publication schemes as a legal requirement - they help people to find, or be directed to, relevant information that has already been published. We asked our stakeholders whether they agree or disagree that proactively publishing information has helped their ability to manage FOI request volumes. More respondents agreed (33.5%) than disagreed (23.5%). You can read how proactive publication has helped the London Borough of Camden free up staff time to concentrate on other FOI requests as a result of being able to handle more enquiries as “business as usual”. 

In order to put a publication scheme in place, you should adopt our model publication scheme and use our definition documents to publish a guide (or index) to help requesters locate the published information. Both the guide and the linked content need to be kept up to date. You'll also need to know what you want to publish. Last year we worked with WhatDoTheyKnow to understand what people were looking for when submitting FOI requests. You can read our findings in this blog which helps public authorities across a range of sectors to consider whether proactive publication of this information would benefit their organisation and help to reduce information requests. 

As part of our work on proactive publication, we also looked at whether the same public authorities were publishing their compliance statistics, which is set out as good practice in part 8.5 of the code of practice issued under section 45 of FOIA. We found 13 that did not and, following our engagement with them, all now do so. 

Since publishing our FOI and Transparency regulatory manual public authorities, and all have begun doing so, helping build a greater culture of transparency and accountability. Our data collection template can help you compile these compliance statistics. 

We understand that managing large volumes of FOI requests can be challenging, and our focus in this area hasn't solely been on what public authorities can do. We have also published tips for those making requests to help them access information already available before making a request. If your organisation has FOI resources online, are you providing similar advice to requestors? 

We will continue to build an evidence base of the benefits of proactive transparency and include proactive publication as part of our overall approach to supporting public authorities with their compliance of FOIA. If you've noticed that proactively publishing information has had an impact on your caseloads, please tell us about your experiences.

According to financial industry sources on May 23, Rhee recently visited six major banks -- KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, NH Nonghyup, and IBK Industrial Bank of Korea -- holding individual meetings lasting around 30 minutes with each CEO. On May 21, he met with Shinhan Bank CEO Jung Sang-hyuk, followed by meetings with Woori Bank CEO Jung Jin-wanand NH Nonghyup Bank CEO Kang Tae-young. A series of one-on-one meetings, conducted outside of official events like those organized by the Korea Federation of Banks, are considered highly unusual.

All the banks visited by Rhee are participants in “Project Agora.” Led by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Project Agora is a global experiment involving central banks and international financial institutions that aims to explore improvements to cross-border payment systems by linking institutional-use CBDCs with tokenized commercial bank deposits. Rhee is said to have emphasized that if the project progresses according to the BIS's goals, participating commercial banks could significantly reduce operational costs in areas such as foreign exchange transactions and regulatory compliance.

Rhee also sought attention and collaboration for a separate domestic initiative, “Project Hangang,” which is being led independently by the BOK. This project is testing the use of tokenized commercial bank deposits linked to CBDC as a means of payment in everyday transactions. The central bank began recruiting participants from the general public last month, and about 100,000 people are currently involved in the pilot.

Building on these one-on-one meetings, Rhee is scheduled to hold a group discussion on May 26 with the CEOs of the six banks. Also attending will be Timothy Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), who is visiting South Korea. The meeting will include updates on Project Agora and discussions on the changing landscape of global payments and financial stability issues.

A financial industry official familiar with the BOK's internal affairs stated, “Project Hangang hasn't received as much market attention or evaluation compared to its actual progress. In fact, the BOK has been preparing the necessary infrastructure steadily since 2017. Governor Rhee's recent personal involvement seems aimed at showcasing those efforts and capabilities both at home and abroad.”

 Michigan lawmakers introduced four crypto bills in one day, covering crypto in state retiree funds, CBDCs and Bitcoin miners operating at abandoned oil and gas sites. 

Michigan lawmakers have introduced four crypto-related bills covering crypto mining, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and crypto in state retirement funds.

Republican state Representative Bill Schuette introduced House Bill 4510 on May 21, which would amend Michigan's Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act to allow the state treasurer, currently Rachael Eubanks, to invest in cryptocurrencies that have averaged a market cap above $250 million over the last calendar year.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are the only cryptocurrencies that currently meet that threshold. The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company.

A similar bill was introduced in February, permitting the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Michigan's Budget Stabilization Fund into crypto.

Republican Representative Bryan Posthumus led the introduction of the second bipartisan crypto bill on May 21, HB 4511, which would prohibit Michigan from banning crypto or imposing licensing requirements on crypto holders. It would also prohibit state officials from advocating or supporting a proposed CBDC from the federal government.

The bill defines advocating or supporting a CBDC to involve issuing a memorandum or official statement endorsing a CBDC proposal related to its testing, adoption or implementation.

HB 4512, the third crypto bill introduced by a bipartisan group led by Democratic Representative Mike McFall, would create a Bitcoin mining program allowing operators to set up at abandoned oil and gas sites. 

A supervisor would be assigned to determine how much oil or gas could reasonably be expected to be produced from the site, who the last operator of the site was and how long it has been left unused.

Those seeking to participate in the program would need to submit legal documents outlining their organizational structure, demonstrate their ability to operate as a Bitcoin mining entity and provide estimates of the breakeven price for a profitable venture.

The fourth bill, HB 4513 — also filed by a McFall-led bipartisan group — would amend Michigan's income tax laws to include income obtained from the proposed Bitcoin mining program.

Four new cryptocurrency-related bills were introduced in the Michigan legislature this week, covering public pension investments in crypto, mining, income tax exemptions, and restrictions on CBDC support.

As of May 23, four new proposed legislations, House Bills 4510, 4511, 4512, and 4513, have been introduced in the Michigan legislature, marking a coordinated push to define the state's approach to cryptocurrency.

House Bill 4510, introduced by Representative Bill Schuette, seeks to amend Michigan's Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act to allow the state treasurer to invest in cryptocurrencies.

The bill restricts eligibility to digital assets with an average market capitalization of at least $250 billion over the past calendar year. Currently, only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) meet this threshold. These investments must be made through exchange-traded products issued by a registered investment company.

House Bill 4511, sponsored by Representative Bryan Posthumus, proposes prohibiting the state and its subdivisions from banning the holding of digital assets or imposing licensing, permitting, or discriminatory tax requirements based solely on digital asset usage. 

It also bars state agencies from advocating for or supporting any federal CBDC by issuing memoranda or official endorsements.

Additionally, the bill protects blockchain participants by preventing restrictions on node operations, asset transfers, and staking, while shielding validators and node operators from civil liability.

Meanwhile, House Bill 4512, introduced by a bipartisan group led by Representative Mike McFall, outlines a Bitcoin mining partnership programme targeting abandoned oil and gas wells.

Under the proposed programme, participants would receive temporary rights to use the wells for energy generation in return for assuming responsibility for plugging, site restoration, and response activity.

The bill requires the supervisor of wells to identify eligible sites, publish detailed assessments, and manage a competitive bidding process. Selected participants must provide financial assurances, submit environmental and production data, and report annually.

Mining rights are contingent on adherence to these obligations and capped plugging costs.

McFall also led the introduction of House Bill 4513, which would amend Michigan's Income Tax Act to exempt income earned through the proposed Bitcoin mining programme from state income tax.

The amendment defines the scope of exempt income and aligns it with the programme framework established under HB 4512, providing clarity for both individual and corporate taxpayers participating in the initiative.

In addition to these four bills, Michigan is also considering the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Introduced on Feb. 13 as House Bill 4087, this earlier proposal,  backed by Representatives Posthumus and Ron Robinson, would authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of the general fund and Budget Stabilization Fund for crypto investments.

Twin Cities Suburbs

According to an investigator's affidavit, the Twin Cities man clicked a phishing link, then quickly opened his Coinbase app “and saw his digital assets were being moved out of his wallet” with no ability to stop it.

By Paul Walsh

A Twin Cities man opened an email, realized his mistake and watched as more than $2 million was drained from his Bitcoin account in a phishing scam, according to a state investigation.

An investigator working with the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) financial crimes task force laid out the Anoka County man's reverse windfall in a search-warrant affidavit filed this week. It seeks to gather information from the prime suspect's social media account.

The filing said the task force investigator in recent weeks has been communicating with the suspected cryptocurrency thief, who possibly has ties to Nigeria.

As of Friday, there have been no arrests or charges in connection with the case, said Brooklyn Park police Inspector Matt Rabe. The suburban department's cyber unit supervisor, Sgt. Jake Tuzinski, is heading up this investigation. 

Once the investigation is complete, the case will be sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office for consideration of charges, Rabe said. The Minnesota Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged.

Tuzinski said Friday that everyone needs to “take a pause while reading these emails. Verify who the email is coming from. Check not just the name of the header such as ‘From: Coinbase,' but also drop it down and look at the full email domain it is coming from.”

 According to the search warrant affidavit:

The man, identified only as J.S. in the filing, told Tuzinski in September 2024 that “he was on his phone when he received an email from what he thought was Coinbase support. J.S. said he kept all his digital assets, which included over 40 Bitcoin, on his Coinbase Wallet app.”

J.S. continued that “after he clicked on a link contained within the email, he realized the email was not legitimately from Coinbase and suspected it was a phishing attack. J.S. then went to his Coinbase Wallet app and saw his digital assets were being moved out of his wallet.”

The man estimated that the sum of his digital assets in various accounts totaled $2.4 million, nearly all of it in Bitcoin. 

J.S. reached out to Coinbase in an effort to stem the fiscal bleeding. But Coinbase said its exchange — which helps users make transactions — and the Wallet app are “two different things, [and] they were unable to stop any transactions.”

Tuzinski unearthed each suspicious transaction and “noted the movement of the Bitcoin was consistent with money laundering and obfuscation,” the investigator wrote in the search-warrant affidavit.

The investigator said he then turned to cryptocurrency exchange giant Binance and identified the suspect “through Nigerian documents and a self portrait.”

The suspect explained in an email the Bitcoin was given to him anonymously, but “I believe [him] to be more involved than just simply receiving an anonymous donation,” Tuzinski wrote.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously. The coins are created by users who “mine” them by lending computing power to verify other users' transactions. They receive Bitcoins in exchange. The coins also can be bought and sold on exchanges with U.S. dollars and other currencies. 

Bitcoins are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next. Transactions can be made anonymously, making the currency popular with libertarians as well as tech enthusiasts, speculators — and criminals.

The long-running con known as phishing is one of many scams plaguing U.S. consumers in an onslaught that can feel relentless, with criminals targeting individuals via mail, email, phone, text and social media.

Experts in protecting cryptocurrency offer numerous tips on protecting assets from theft. They include:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Protestors accuse Trump of corruption as he hosts crypto dinner","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74nn4ppdvdo","Fri, 23 May 2025 09:22:18 GMT","

US President Donald Trump has hosted top purchasers of the cryptocurrency that bears his name at a gala dinner, in an event that protesters and his Democrat opponents branded as ""corrupt"".

$TRUMP was launched shortly before his inauguration in January, initially rocketing in value before falling sharply afterwards.

""It's fundamentally corrupt - a way to buy access to the President,"" Democrat senator Chris Murphy wrote on X.

Protesters gathered outside the event on Thursday night, which was held at a golf course near Washington DC, some carrying signs reading ""stop crypto corruption"" and ""no kings.""

The White House has rejected the accusations, and in a video of the dinner posted on social media, Trump is seen saying ""I always put the country way ahead of the business.""

""The Biden administration persecuted crypto innovators and we're bringing them back into the USA where they belong,"" Trump is also recorded as saying.

The event took place as Bitcoin - the leading cryptocurrency - was hitting a fresh record high price in dollar terms of almost $112,000 (£83,000) per coin, before falling back slightly.

$TRUMP is what is known as a meme coin - a type of cryptocurrency inspired by internet memes or viral online trends. 

Its price peaked at $75 in January before plummeting to less than $8 in April - it was trading at around $12.50 at the time of writing.

""This is something that doesn't have obvious utility. It's not being used for payments. It's not being used as a store of value,"" said Rob Hadick, General Partner of Dragonfly, a crypto venture fund.

The dinner was advertised on the website gettrumpmemes.com as ""the most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World.""

The top 220 purchasers of the meme coin, viewable on a leaderboard, received invitations to the ""black-tie optional"" event.

The top investor in the $TRUMP meme coin is billionaire crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun who was charged with fraud and market manipulation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration.

In February, the Trump administration paused the case.

Sun said this week on the social media platform X that he planned to attend the dinner, calling himself Trump's ""TOP fan!""

Sun then made a series of posts on Thursday night on X, including one that said it was an ""honour"" to attend the dinner.

Earlier in the day, Democrat senators held a press conference to denounce the event and to call for disclosure of who would be attending.

Calling the dinner ""an orgy of corruption,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed Trump for ""using the presidency of the United States to make himself richer through crypto.""

Trump's views on cryptocurrency have undergone radical change in recent years.

In 2021, he called Bitcoin a ""scam.""

Now, he's not just in charge of regulating cryptocurrencies in the US - he and his family are active industry participants.

In addition to the meme coin, the Trump family also holds a majority stake in the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which was launched just prior to the election.

Trump expressed his desire to be the nation's first ""Crypto President"" while campaigning for his second term, and was a major beneficiary of campaign contributions from the crypto industry in the 2024 election.

According to a report by the group State Democracy Defenders Action, Trump's investments in crypto have helped boost his net worth by as much as $2.9bn.

""As a stakeholder in crypto assets, President Trump will likely profit from the very policies he is pursuing,"" the report states.

Three days into his term, Trump issued an executive order to establish a regulatory framework that promotes the growth of digital currencies.

A Trump administration official told the BBC that the meme coin has nothing to do with the White House.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly pushed back on concerns about potential conflicts.

""The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself,"" Kelly said in a statement. 

But one former financial regulator likened the meme coin to gambling.

""It's like selling membership cards for his personal fan club which are then traded,"" said Timothy Massad, Director of the Digital Asset Policy Project at Harvard. 

""They have no value. But people speculate on the price and those purchases and that trading enriches him.""

At a Senate committee hearing this week, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy grilled Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the lack of transparency regarding who would attend Thursday night's dinner.

Murphy cited reports that many of the attendees at the invite-only event were expected to be foreigners.

""There's clearly a way around the State Department for foreign individuals of significant influence and wealth to be able to directly lobby the president of the United States,"" he said.

""I don't have any concern that the president having dinner with someone is going to contravene the security of the United States,"" Rubio responded, adding that he was unaware of the dinner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Why bitcoin has touched all time high of $110k following a key crypto bill in US","https://indianexpress.com/article/business/bitcoin-all-time-high-us-crypto-bill-10023531/","Fri, 23 May 2025 05:23:09 GMT","

Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high as it breached the $110,000 cap for the first time, following the advancement of a key crypto bill in the United States Senate, which has received bipartisan support, and is expected to aid those running crypto businesses.

The bill, called the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, has advanced in the US Senate, after some Democrat members who had initially opposed it, joined their Republican colleagues in supporting the bill, which regulated primarily stablecoin.

Bitcoin has fallen last month briefly over geopolitical uncertainties following Trump's tariff-induced assault on many countries, triggering fears of a global economic turmoil. However, with some of those concerns reducing, after events like the US signing a trade deal with China, the digital currency has been gaining momentum. The GENIUS Act played a further role in its upward surge.

While the bill has received support from some Democrat members because of which it moves forward in the US Senate, there are growing concerns that US President Donald Trump — once a crypto sceptic — and some of his supporters from the crypto and tech industry could personally benefit from it. Trump and his wife Melania have issued their own meme coins and have an active interest in the crypto market going up.

At its core, the GENIUS Act focuses on regulating stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to more predictable assets like the US dollar. Among others, it also allows big tech companies to issue stablecoins, in what is being seen as a big win for many of Trump's supporters from the industry, who threw their weight behind him in the run-up to the Presidential bid and have continued their support to him since his reelection.

The bill says that issuers must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorism regulations, as well as privacy requirements under existing banking laws. It requires that crypto issuers must fully back stablecoins with fiat currency or high-quality liquid assets at a 1:1 ratio. They would also have to maintain reserves separate from operational funds and disclose these reserves publicly, with regular third-party audits.

Mark R Wright, Democrat Senator from the state of Virginia, who has supported the bill said that while many lawmakers have concerns about the Trump family's use of crypto technologies to “evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans”.

“But,” he said in justification of his support to the bill, “we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay. If American lawmakers don't shape it, others will – and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values. Innovation in this space is happening, with or without us. We have a responsibility to ensure it happens safely, transparently, and in a way that advances U.S. economic and national security interests. The GENIUS Act will help get us started”.

Even though the GENIUS Act received bipartisan support in the US Senate, some Democrat members came down heavily against it.

As per a fact sheet released by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ranking Member of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said, “A strong bill would ensure that consumers enjoy the same consumer protections when using stablecoins as they do when using other payment systems, close loopholes that enable the illicit use of stablecoins by cartels, terrorists, and criminals, and reduce the risk that stablecoins take down our financial system. The GENIUS Act does not meet those minimum standards”.

Warren said that while industry estimates suggest that  passing the GENIUS Act could help the stablecoin market grow 10-fold over the next three years to a $2 trillion market, Scaling up the stablecoin market without adequate safeguards risks increasing the “illicit use of stablecoins, which already account for over 60% of unlawful crypto transactions”.

There are also concerns around potential conflict of interest for US President Donald and his growing cryptocurrency firm, could inappropriately benefit from crypto. “This bill provides even more opportunities to reward buyers of Trump's coins with favors like tariff exemptions, pardons and government appointments,” Warren said in a speech ahead of the vote.

Another concern in the legislation is that it allows big tech companies to issue stablecoins. Companies like Meta had previously tried to make an unsuccessful foray into the crypto industry. As per the New York Times, some changes have been made to the bill to assuage concerns around the involvement of tech companies, requiring that they seek approval from a regulatory committee before issuing their own stablecoins.

While that appeared to assuage concerns of some Democrat members, not everyone was on board. “Despite new language on this issue, the final bill fails to prohibit Big Tech companies from issuing stablecoins. By tearing down the 200-year separation between banking and commerce, this bill undermines competition, threatens financial stability, and erodes financial privacy. While the bill purports to place restrictions on some Big Tech companies' ability to issue stablecoins, those restrictions are riddled with straightforward and easily identifiable loopholes,” Warren said in her fact sheet.

                    The top 25 investors, according to an event website, will get a private session with Trump beforehand and a White House tour [File]
                                          | Photo Credit: REUTERS
                                      

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday will host a private event for hundreds of top investors in his crypto memecoin, with leaders of the Democratic opposition blasting it as ""an orgy of corruption.""

The unprecedented melding of U.S. presidential power and personal business will take place at Trump's golf club outside Washington, where the 220 biggest purchasers of the $TRUMP memecoin will have dinner with the president.

The top 25 investors, according to an event website, will get a private session with Trump beforehand and a White House tour.

Trump launched the memecoin three days before his January inauguration, quickly increasing his net worth by billions and raising major ethics concerns, including over possible foreign influence.

Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and colleagues called Thursday for Trump to disclose who is attending the dinner.

Calling the dinner ""an orgy of corruption,"" Warren told a press conference that Trump ""is using the presidency of the United States to make himself richer through crypto.""

Data analytics firm Inca Digital has confirmed that many transactions occurred through international exchanges unavailable in the United States, suggesting foreign buyers.

Chinese-born crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun claims the top investor position, having committed $20 million to the memecoin as part of his $93 million total investment in Trump-linked crypto ventures.

Sun, founder of top 10 cryptocurrency TRON, was under investigation by U.S. authorities for market manipulation, but regulators, now controlled by Trump appointees, agreed in February to a 60-day pause to seek a settlement.

According to the website Popular Information, a few weeks before that decision, Sun purchased $30 million in digital assets from a venture backed by Trump and his family.

""Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation to attend President Trump's Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!"" Sun wrote Tuesday on X.

Justin Unga of advocacy group End Citizens United described the crypto dinner as a blatant example of Trump profiting from the presidency while roiling the U.S. economy.

""Some say this is a back door to corruption,"" Unga said.

""I would argue it's the front door with valet parking, and it's got a red carpet... and a slap in the face of hard working Americans.""

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the allegations of impropriety Thursday, telling a briefing that Trump is attending the dinner in his ""personal time"" and abiding by applicable conflict of interest laws.

The dinner comes as the U.S. Senate is pushing through legislation to more clearly regulate cryptocurrencies, a long-sought request of the industry.

Senators on Monday advanced a landmark bill known as the GENIUS Act that proposes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of crypto token seen as more predictable for investors as its value is pegged to hard currencies like the dollar.

That legislation had faced roadblocks in part because of Trump's dabbling in cryptocurrencies; a rising sector he once dismissed as a scam.

His stance reversed during the 2024 presidential campaign when crypto tycoons, frustrated by perceived unfair treatment under the Biden administration, became major contributors to his campaign.

Bitcoin's price hit a new all-time high on Thursday, climbing above $111,000 before falling slightly.

Trump's newfound enthusiasm for digital currencies has expanded into multiple ventures led primarily by his eldest sons.

Their growing portfolio includes investments in Binance, a major crypto exchange whose founder seeks a presidential pardon to re-enter the U.S. market.

This investment flows through World Liberty Financial, a Trump family-backed venture launched last September with significant Mideast deals. 

The company's founding team includes Donald Jr. and Eric Trump alongside Zach Witkoff, son of Trump's diplomatic adviser.

President Trump has taken concrete steps to reduce regulatory barriers, including an executive order establishing a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" for government holdings of the leading digital currency.

Crypto traders betting on a steady bitcoin BTC$109,495.30 rally got a sharp reminder of headline risk from Donald Trump's latest tariff threats.

Over $300 million worth of leveraged derivatives positions were liquidated across centralized exchanges in the past four hours, according to CoinGlass data, as crypto prices plunged following the news.

Nearly all liquidations came from long positions—traders betting on higher prices. BTC longs accounted for $107 million of the total, while Ethereum's ether ETH$2,575.93 followed with close to $87 million. Other tokens, including Solana's SOL SOL$177.61, dogecoin DOGE$0.23673, and SUI SUI$3.63 saw liquidations ranging between $10 million and $18 million.

""Nice aggregate flush of long leverage and de-risk selling from spot,"" well-followed crypto trader Skew noted in an X post early Friday. ""All driven by headlines once again.""

The sell-off came after Trump proposed a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting next month, along with a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S., reigniting fears of an escalating trade war.

As a result, BTC and major altcoins such as Ether ETH$2,575.93, XRP XRP$2.38, and Cardano ADA$0.78602 fell 3% to 4%, while smaller-cap tokens like Uniswap UNI$6.18 and SUI SUI$3.63 dropped 5% to 7% over the past 24 hours.

Crypto trader named James Wynn, who gained attention recently opening a $1.1 billion BTC long bet with 40x leverage on the Hyperliquid exchange, also slipped underwater on the massive position. Currently, the trader is sitting on $7.5 million of unrealized losses, and the position could be liquidated if BTC slips to $102,000, according to a screenshot shared on X.

Interestingly, the long liquidations came amid a recent unusual tilt toward short positions in BTC derivatives despite record prices, CoinDesk reported on Thursday.

The last time Justin Sun set foot in the U.S. he was Grenada's WTO ambassador and was navigating the rocky waters of former President Biden's crypto crackdown.

Times have changed. Now, he's dining at an event hosted by President Donald Trump for the largest holders of his TRUMP memecoin and celebrating a regulatory breakthrough, as issuers eye a potential Tron ETF, signaling a striking reversal in crypto's American fortunes.

Speaking exclusively with CoinDesk after the Presidential dinner, which was met by protestors, the Tron founder dismissed allegations that the token is a vehicle for bribery. He called skeptics short-sighted, arguing Trump's embrace of crypto could spark a new era of digital asset innovation in America.

""All the haters need to really pay attention,"" Sun told CoinDesk, describing Trump's support for crypto as one of the President's best decisions.""There are positive things happening in the industry.""

Sun's relationship with Trump's affiliated crypto ventures stretches back to just after last year's election, when he bought up to $75 million worth of World Liberty Financial tokens across multiple tranches.

Shortly after Trump took office, his Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paused a civil fraud case against Sun, alongside crypto exchange Binance; the SEC also withdrew from or dropped a dozen other cases, though it just filed a fresh civil fraud lawsuit against Unicoin earlier this week. And earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice, which pursues criminal cases, had been investigating the Tron founder since 2021.

He described the dinner as a clear sign the U.S. is regaining its status as the crypto's global hub, marking a sharp reversal from the Biden administration's war on the industry, which had previously prompted crypto firms to consider offshore moves.

""At the Trump dinner, some supporters told me they were thinking of leaving the U.S. because of the Biden administration, moving to places like Hong Kong or Singapore,"" Sun said. ""Even Consensus started holding events outside of the United States."" 

""But now they've changed their minds. It brings everybody back into the U.S.,"" he continued.

Criticism of Trump's decision to launch a memecoin has come fast and furious from mainstream media, including attempts to link holders of the token to white nationalism.

Sun dismissed this criticism by emphasizing that critics have every right to express their views under the First Amendment.

While protesters met the memecoin faithful who attended the TRUMP dinner, skepticism about meme coins isn't limited to outsiders. 

At a fireside chat during Consensus 2025, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy described meme coins as essentially ""gambling,"" questioning their longevity.

""I get why people like it,"" Portnoy said. ""It's a form of gambling, it's a Ponzi scheme. I don't mean that in a negative way.""

Sun disagrees. Rather than viewing meme coins as gambling or Ponzi schemes, he positions them as legitimate segments of digital asset markets.

Sun pointed to tokens like DOGE and SHIB as examples of success stories that have helped onboard users into crypto. He emphasized that Tron's goal is to support ""every single piece in crypto to grow and become mainstream.""

""I totally think memecoins have merit,"" Sun told CoinDesk. ""It's just like doing business. Some succeed, some go to zero. That's entrepreneurship.""

UPDATE (May 23, 06:15 UTC): Adds details on Sun's previous investigations and additional background.

Attention is turning to major tokens as bitcoin BTC$109,495.30 set fresh highs earlier this week, with some pointing out that institutional demand and a clear regulatory environment pave the way for strong moves among the top coins.

Bitcoin was hovering just under $111,000 during the Asian morning hours on Friday, seeing a slight pullback on profit-taking as is expected after upward moves. Cardano's ADA$0.77852, dogecoin DOGE$0.23673 and Solana's SOL$177.61 added as much as 4%, while ether ETH$2,555.48, XRP$2.38, and BNB Chain's BNB$672.58 rose less than 1.5%.

The broad-based CoinDesk 20(CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, rose 1.2% in the past 24 hours.

Bitget Research's Chief Analyst Ryan Lee told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that a potential dip in bitcoin dominance could kick off a broader alt season, with high-profile names like XRP and Solana in prime position to benefit.

Lee pointed to XRP's improving regulatory clarity and recent technical breakout patterns as reasons traders are eyeing a move toward $3–$8 in the medium term.

XRP recently formed a golden cross against BTC on the weekly chart — a historically bullish signal suggesting a long-term trend reversal may be underway. The ratio has been locked in a sideways channel since late 2020, but that may now be breaking after last month's SEC decision not to pursue further appeals against Ripple.

SOL could climb toward $220–$300 on ETF speculation, while ADA shows potential for a breakout between $1 and $3, Lee added.

Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Thursday broadcast that the latest BTC move confirmed a robust trend supported by improved structural fundamentals and relatively low volatility.

""This rally feels more structurally sound than the last with less frothy momentum-chasing and stronger fundamental underpinnings,” the firm said, adding that the brief dip following BTC's initial record high break triggered put-side profit-taking, but buyers were “quick to reload on the upside.”

Still, broader macro risks remain in play. Renewed tariff concerns, rising U.S. yields, and a stronger dollar could all inject volatility into the system, especially for altcoins, QCP said. Traders are urged to stay selective, focusing on assets with strong fundamentals and clear regulatory narratives.

Meanwhile, FxPro's Alex Kuptsikevich shared in an email that bitcoin's sentiment index is hovering just below “extreme greed” as of Friday, a sign that the rally may still have room to run in the coming days.

 Leveraged speculation in the Bitcoin futures market is at peak levels as traders hope for new highs. 

Bitcoin futures open interest (OI) has hit record levels on crypto derivatives exchanges as traders anticipate the cryptocurrency will continue and reach new all-time highs. 

Bitcoin (BTC) futures open interest reached a peak of just over $80 billion on May 23, according to CoinGlass. It's an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.

Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.

When OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. 

If Bitcoin's price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.

However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.

Bitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange. There is also more than $1 billion in OI at strike prices of $115,000, $125,000, and $130,000.

Around $2.76 billion worth of notional value contracts are due to expire on May 23 with a put/call ratio of 1.2%, meaning there are more short (put) sellers than longs (call), and a max pain point of $103,000, where most losses will be made on expiry, according to Deribit. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin has slightly lost its recent gains and briefly slipped below $111,000 on Coinbase,  according to TradingView. 

The asset has now gained almost 20% since the beginning of the year and almost 50% since its crash to $75,000 on April 7 following US President Donald Trump's announcement of global tariffs. 

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $112,000 on May 22 and had mostly traded just above $111,000 over the last 24 hours, but had again slipped below the level at 4:15 am UTC on May 23.

 From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is showing some signs of overheating, but onchain data suggests otherwise. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22, but retraced to $110,700, with analysts noting mixed signals on market overheating.

Funding rates and other metrics suggest a “healthy upward phase.”

Bitcoin's (BTC) price recorded a new all-time high of $111,970  on May 22. However, BTC price retraced shortly after to trade at $110,700 at the time of writing. 

Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. 

Bitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.

“Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. 

Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin's funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets. However, these bets “remain much smaller compared to previous peaks,” suggesting “futures market overheating is negligible.”

A spike in Bitcoin funding rates can sometimes cause worry among market participants about increased Bitcoin volatility and liquidation risks.

Still, the funding rates are moderately positive, signaling that traders are optimistic about Bitcoin's price and buyers are willing to pay sellers a fee to hold their positions.

Meanwhile, the short-term holder (STH) Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric reveals that despite STHs returning to profit, few have taken profits during the recent rise. 

This indicator is currently valued at 1.02%, suggesting that STHs are realizing some profits at much lower rates.

“In March 2024, there was significant profit-taking and a prolonged correction, but currently, profit-taking is much lower than in November 2024,” the analyst explained, adding that despite the price at all-time highs, whales' profit-taking activity remains relatively subdued.

CryptoQuant's Crypto Dan expected Bitcoin to continue rising higher, noting:

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score value — a metric that compares BTC's market value to its realized value and adjusts for volatility — has seen a notable surge over the last month. 

Historically, all previous Bitcoin bull runs started with a notable surge in MVRV Z-score and ended with the metric entering the red zone (see chart below) to signal that Bitcoin is significantly overvalued.

At 2.8, the MVRV Z-score is still significantly below the red zone, suggesting that the market top is not yet in.

Bitcoin's relative strength index, or RSI, displays overbought conditions in two out of five timeframes. Bitcoin's RSI is now at 70 in the 12-hour timeframe and 75 on the daily chart. Other intervals show near-oversold RSI values on the weekly and four-hour timeframes. 

Data from TradingView shows BTC's RSI at 75, 71, 68 and 66 on daily, 12-hour, weekly and four-hour timeframes, respectively. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is 78, indicating “extreme greed” conditions.

When investors get too “greedy,” the market is often overdue for a correction. The last time this index was at similar levels was at the height of the Trump-driven pump in December 2024, just before BTC dropped down from its then-all-time high of around $108,000 and tumbled toward $74,000 in March.

Even though these metrics are cautioning market participants to manage risks, it is important to note that RSI conditions do not guarantee a trend reversal. Crypto prices are highly volatile, and BTC could continue to rally, fueled by increasing spot ETF demand and easing trade war tensions.

 Trendspotting in crypto means more than luck. By using tools like Dune Analytics, Santiment and onchain data, you can uncover promising projects before the crowd catches on. 

Spotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.

Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they're still under the radar.

So, how do they do it? 

Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.

This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.

When Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana's proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.

Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. 

Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).

Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.

Chainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn't have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.

By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.

Let's not pretend memes don't matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.

That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn't promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.

So, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here's how serious trendspotters approach it.

Public blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:

Daily active wallets

Transaction volume

Tokenholder growth

Liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

TVL (for DeFi projects).

If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that's a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.

Ask questions like:

What's the total supply? How much is circulating?

Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?

Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?

Is there utility? Does the token do anything?

Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.

Is the team actually building?

GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.

You don't need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.

Are other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?

Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it's often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.

X, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it's noisy. But it's also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:

Are people actually using the product?

Are devs answering questions?

Is the tone constructive or just hype?

Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.

Here's a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:

Top tip: Don't just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.

A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. 

Steady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that's usually a sign of substance. You'll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.

Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.

More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn't all locked up by the top five wallets — it's a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.

New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.

Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it's usually organic.

Sudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there's no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It's likely a coordinated shill.

Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that's a signal someone's trying to manufacture buzz.

No dev activity or roadmap: If there's no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn't shipping anything, it's probably just a hype machine.

Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you're likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.

Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you're looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That's when it's worth a closer look.

Some projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:

High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn't take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.

Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn't been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.

No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there's no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That's a gamble.

Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you're holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.

Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.

The best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who's actually shipping. 

Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.

Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you'll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.

It's not easy. But it's doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.

Hypervelocity Stars Hint at a Supermassive Black Hole Right Next Door

Some stars streaking through the Milky Way at millions of kilometers per hour probably trace back to a supermassive black hole in a neighboring galaxy

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

An astonishing fact only known for the past few decades is that every big galaxy in the universe has a supermassive black hole at its heart. This was suspected in the 1980s, and observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, which has peered deep into the cores of galaxies all across the sky, confirmed it. The “normal” kinds of black holes made when stars explode range from five to about 100 times the mass of the sun, more or less. But these central galactic monsters are millions of times more massive, and some have grown to the Brobdingnagian heft of billions of solar masses.

A lot of mysteries still remain, of course, such as how they formed early in the history of the universe, how they grew so humongous so fast and what role they played in their host galaxy's formation. But one odd question still nagging at astronomers is: What's the galaxy size cutoff where this trend stops? In other words, is there some lower limit to how massive a galaxy can be and still harbor one of these beasts?

The inklings of an answer are emerging from a surprising place: studies of rare stars moving through our own galaxy at truly ludicrous speeds.

Orbiting our Milky Way galaxy is a menagerie of smaller “dwarf” galaxies, some so tiny and faint you need huge telescopes to see them at all. But two are so large and close that they're visible to the unaided eye from the Southern Hemisphere: the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the bigger and closer of the two, and it's not clear if it harbors a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If such an SMBH exists there, it must be quiescent, meaning it's not actively feeding on matter. As material falls toward such a black hole, it forms a swirling disk of superheated plasma that can glow so brightly it outshines all the stars in the galaxy combined. No such fierce luminescence is seen in the LMC, so we don't know if an SMBH is there and not actively feeding or if the LMC is simply SMBH-free.

But a recent study published in the Astrophysical Journal offers strong evidence that an SMBH does lie at the center of the LMC—based on measurements of stellar motions in our own Milky Way!

The study looked at hypervelocity stars, ones that are screaming through space at speeds far higher than stars around them. Some of these stars are moving so rapidly that they have reached galactic escape velocity; the Milky Way's gravity can't hold them. In the coming eons, they'll flee the galaxy entirely. And we have good reason to believe these runaway stars were launched by SMBHs—but how?

Such a situation starts with a binary system, two stars orbiting each other. These systems contain a substantial amount of orbital energy, the sum of the kinetic energy of the two stars—their energy of motion—and their gravitational potential energy, the amount of energy released if they were to move closer together.

If the binary star approaches a third object, some of that energy can be swapped around. One star can become bound to the third object, for example, while the other star can get a kick in its kinetic energy, flinging it away. The amount of the kick depends in part on the gravity of the third object. A massive black hole, of course, has an incredibly strong gravitational field that can fling the star away at high speed.

And I do mean high speed; such a star can be flung away from the black hole at a velocity greater than 1,000 kilometers per second. S5-HVS1, for example, was the first confirmed such hypervelocity star, and it's moving at more than 1,700 kilometers per second. Feel free to take a moment to absorb that fact: an entire star has been ejected away from a black hole at more than six million kilometers per hour. The energies involved are terrifying.

We have seen a few of these stars in our galaxy, and careful measurements suggest they're moving away from the center of the Milky Way, which is pretty convincing evidence that Sagittarius A*, our own Milky Way's SMBH, is to blame.

But not all of the high-velocity stars that have been detected appear to come from our galactic center. Fortunately, Gaia, the sadly now decommissioned European Space Agency astronomical observatory, was designed to obtain extremely accurate measurements of the positions, distances, colors and other characteristics of well more than a billion stars—including their velocity.

There are 21 known hypervelocity stars at the outskirts of the Milky Way. Using the phenomenally high-precision Gaia measurements, the astronomers behind the new research examined the stars' 3D velocities through space. They found that five of them have ambiguous origins, while two definitely come from the Milky Way center. Of the 14 still left, three clearly come from the direction of the LMC.

The trajectories of these stars effectively point back to their origin, and based on our current knowledge, that origin must be a supermassive black hole. Even better, although the remaining 11 stars have trajectories that are consistent with both Milky Way and LMC origins, the researchers found that five are more likely to have come from our home galaxy and the other six are more likely to have come from the LMC.

So there could be nine known hypervelocity stars plunging through our galaxy that were ejected by a supermassive black hole in another galaxy.

Using some sophisticated math, the team found that the most likely mass of the black hole is 600,000 or so times the mass of the sun. This isn't huge for an SMBH—it's very much on the low end of the scale, in fact—but then, the LMC is a small galaxy, only 1 percent or so the mass of the Milky Way. We know that the mass of a black hole tends to scale with its host galaxy's mass (because they form together and affect each other's growth), so this lower mass is consistent with that.

If this is true, then our satellite galaxy is shooting stars at us! And there may be more of them yet to be found, hurtling through space unseen on the other side of our galaxy, or so far out that they're difficult to spot and even harder to study. And all this helps us get a clearer—but still quite hazy!—sense of just how far down the galactic scale we can expect to find big black holes.

Black holes are funny. Most people would worry about falling into one, as well as a host of other terrors, but now you can add “having to dodge intergalactic stellar bullets” to that list.

The Creepy Calculus of Measuring Death Risk

Meet micromorts and microlives, statistical units that help mathematicians to calculate risk

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

People are generally bad at assessing probabilities. That's why we have irrational fears and why we overestimate our odds of winning the lottery.

Whenever I have to travel by plane, for example, my palms sweat, my heart races and my thoughts take a gloomy turn. I should be much more worried when I get on my bike in Darmstadt, Germany, where I live. Statistically, I'm in much greater danger on the road than in the air. Yet my bike commute doesn't cause me any stress at all.

Recently, a friend told me about a concept within decision theory that is supposed to help people get a better sense of hazards and risks. In 1980 electrical engineer Ronald Arthur Howard coined the micromort unit to quantify life-threatening danger.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

One micromort corresponds to a one-in-a-million chance of dying during a certain activity. Do you want to run a marathon? The risk is seven micromorts. Are you going under general anesthesia? That's 10 micromorts. To arrive at these figures, you first need detailed statistics. How many people engaged in these activities and died in the process? And the results depend heavily on the group of people being studied (their age, gender, and so on), as well as the geographic location.

Surprisingly, the history of statistics doesn't go back very far. In the 17th century, British demographer John Graunt pioneered mortality statistics by analyzing records of deaths and baptisms. But it would take another 200 years for society to recognize the social benefits of these approaches.

Today the utility of this mathematical subfield is undisputed. Insurance companies and banks use statistics to carry out risk assessments. Statistical surveys make it possible to investigate psychological and sociological phenomena. Physical research would be unthinkable without statistics.

Thanks to Howard and the micromort, the risks in our everyday lives can also be estimated with the help of statistics. By examining the proportion of people who die while undertaking a particular activity, he was able to create a general mortality risk for those activities.

But more recently, mathematician David Spiegelhalter noticed something missing in Howard's analysis: the micromort unit merely indicates how likely it is that a very specific action will kill us. This may make sense for a one-off activity such as climbing a mountain. But for long-term habits, such as regularly eating fast food, the measure is of only limited use.

For example, smoking a cigarette causes just 0.21 micromort and would therefore be significantly less risky than getting out of bed in the morning at the age of 45 (which results in six micromorts). Smoking, however, has long-lasting negative consequences for the body that getting up in the morning does not. The long-term risk is therefore not recorded.

So Spiegelhalter introduced the “microlife” measure to take into account the long-term effects of different activities. This quantifies how much life you lose on average by carrying out an activity. Each microlife that is lost reduces your life expectancy by half an hour. Two hours of watching TV each day might cost one microlife, for instance.

One of the most significant differences between micromorts and microlives is that one of the two types of units compounds over time, and the other does not. If I survive my morning bike ride to the Darmstadt train station, my micromort count for that ride drops back to zero. The next day I start the journey again with the same risk.

It's different with microlife data: if I smoke a cigarette and then a second one an hour later, the time I've lost adds up. And of course, the mere ticking of the clock also shortens my available years of life. Every day 48 microlives are lost.

But unlike micromorts, I can regain microlives. For example, a 20-minute walk provides me with around two microlives—that is, an extra hour of life expectancy. And eating a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables could gain you four microlives daily.

All these facts and figures are entertaining to read about and can make for interesting conversation starters—“Hey, did you know that this beer shortens your life by about 15 minutes?”—at least with the right crowd. But how do you calculate the microlives you lose as a result of an action?

First, you have to compare the life expectancy of different people. For example: How does the life expectancy of smokers and nonsmokers differ? By taking this difference and dividing it by the average number of cigarettes smoked, we can calculate the average amount of time that each cigarette robs us of.

This result is clearly inexact. The difference in life expectancy will also depend on factors such as a person's gender, place of residence and age. These data can still be captured, but when it comes to general lifestyle factors, things get complicated. For example, studies show that many smokers generally have an unhealthier lifestyle and exercise less.

Such correlations cannot always be calculated and accounted for. When it comes to smoking, however, there have been long-term studies that followed many people, some of whom stopped smoking at some point in their life, over several decades.

These data make it easier to isolate the effect that smoking has on a person's life expectancy. Such research suggests that a single cigarette is likely to rob a person of slightly less than the originally calculated 15 minutes of life if they have the other lifestyle habits of a nonsmoker. So should we be consulting statistics at the start of every day to maximize our lifespan? Perhaps we should be studying these analyses to engage in activities with as few micromorts as possible and try to gain, rather than lose, microlives?

Not exactly. Micromorts and microlives can help you better assess risks. But you shouldn't attach too much importance to them. After all, our world is complex. You may gain back two microlives during a walk, but you could also get in an unlucky accident along the way and be hit by a car. Ultimately, micromorts and microlives are just too simple a tool to evaluate the full range of consequences associated with an action. Exercise can improve your state of mind, which has a positive effect not only on your quality of life but also on your lifespan.

That said, it can still be a source of comfort to turn to statistics—particularly when we want to understand if our fear is rational or not. For my part, I will try to remind myself of how few micromorts are associated with flying. Maybe that will help.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Social connection is still underappreciated as a medically relevant health factor","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250522133530.htm","Fri, 23 May 2025 00:46:26 GMT","

Research confirms that social isolation and loneliness significantly impact health and mortality, even if not listed on death certificates. BYU psychology and neuroscience professor, Julianne Holt-Lunstad, has published extensively on the topic, including a landmark 2010 meta-analysis and a 2023 framework on assessment and treatment. She also served as lead scientist on the 2023 Surgeon General Advisory and is advising the World Health Organization on an upcoming report that addresses the pressing health threat of loneliness and isolation and a global agenda on social connection.

Social connection is now a legitimate health factor, but Holt-Lunstad and doctoral student, Andrew Proctor, recently published two studies showing that most of us -- the general population and medical providers -- still don't think social connection affects physical health. And even the professionals who recognize the importance report that they don't have time or tools to help patients address social concerns.

Proctor, who authored a study recently published in Springer Nature, explained that before the study, they had been watching how the pandemic was influencing internet searches around the topics of isolation and loneliness.

""I have a marketing background, so I thought that maybe the public perception had changed since COVID. Social distancing, isolation and loneliness were huge buzzwords on the internet as seen through Google Trends and BuzzSumo (an online trend analyzer). Everything around these search terms was super viral during that time, and so we wondered if perceptions about social connection had changed,"" said Proctor.

With loneliness and isolation trending on the internet, the researchers set up a study. In a nationally representative sample of US adults, as well as samples from the UK and Australia, they surveyed 2,392 people about their perceptions of health risks associated with isolation and loneliness. The data showed that, despite the pandemic and other campaigns, people still underestimate the importance of social connection for physical health. And the underestimation exists equally among the lonely and the socially connected.

""The study identified blind spots in medical care,"" said Proctor. ""Social connection is like a vital sign. What if we didn't care about high blood pressure? Or what if we never knew smoking was bad for us? Social connection is like a key vital sign. We just don't tend to recognize it.""

In a closely connected study, Holt-Lunstad and Proctor, along with coauthors from top research medical centers, surveyed 681 healthcare providers (primarily doctors) about perceptions of health risks associated with poor social connection. Similar to the general population from the first study, healthcare providers underestimated social connection as a medically relevant health factor.

The researchers gleaned some unexpected insights due to an unintentional time lag in data collection in the second study.

""We completed the data collection at two different time points because we were waiting for institutional approvals. Our first cohort was healthcare providers through the University of Utah Health System. Slightly later, we had a second major cohort of University of California San Francisco (UCSF) physicians,"" said Holt-Lunstad. ""What was interesting is that the perceived importance of social factors was a bit higher among the UCSF group.""

The authors attribute the higher awareness at UCSF to the University's Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network as well as the publication of the 2023 Surgeon General's Advisory, which came out just before the second cohort was surveyed. This suggests that social initiatives as well as institutional support make a difference in the perceived importance of social connection.

""What I hope is that these studies can spur recognition that there is a body of evidence showing social connection as medically relevant,"" said Holt-Lunstad. ""Together these papers make a really compelling case that not only does the general public underestimate this, but so do healthcare providers who should know this information.""

""Awareness can make a difference,"" says Holt-Lunstad. ""It's the first step, but awareness isn't enough.""

The research brings to light the need for education and strategies for healthcare providers as well as the need for a revised K-12 healthcare curriculum and public health campaigns. Future research includes how to address perceived barriers to integrated medical treatment and actionable strategies such as ""social prescribing.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Different phases of evolution during ice age","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250523120447.htm","Fri, 23 May 2025 16:15:37 GMT","

A new study has provided fresh insights into how animals such as the woolly mammoth, musk ox and arctic fox evolved to survive the cold during the ice age.

A team of palaeontologists and palaegeneticists studied ancient fossil and DNA evidence for the nature and timing of changes animals and plants in the Northern Hemisphere.

They have shown that cold-adapted animals started to evolve 2.6 million years ago when the permanent ice at the poles became more prevalent. There followed a time when the continental ice sheets expanded and contracted and around 700,000 years ago the cold periods doubled in length. This is when many of the current cold-adapted species, as well as extinct ones like mammoths, evolved.

The findings have been published in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution.

""The cold-adapted species are amongst the most vulnerable animals and plants to ongoing climate change. Therefore, an understanding of how species evolved in the past is essential to help us understand the risks faced by endangered species today,"" explained John Stewart, Professor of Paleoecology at Bournemouth University, who led the study.

During their research, the team compared the evidence for evolution in plants and beetles with that for mammals and suggested that ideas that some organisms had evolved earlier in the polar regions need to be tested. This means that the way the modern Arctic ecologies assembled needs to be resolved as it is not clear when and how the animals and plants who live there came together.

The study found evidence for early occurrences of true lemmings and reindeer in the Arctic where they may have evolved as climates cooled in the early Pleistocene period, between one and two million years ago. The polar bear and arctic fox on the other hand may have joined them more recently within the last 700,000 years -- colonising from the South. Some of the ice age cold species like the woolly rhino are different and may have evolved in the steppe grasslands to the south with the earliest occurrences in the Tibetan Plateau.

""This is the first concerted effort to compare the evolution of cold-adapted animals and plants since modern methods of palaeogenetics appeared,"" Professor Stewart said. ""We can now build on these findings to understand more about how more cold-adapted species evolved and how the Arctic ecologies arose in the past and use this to help conservation efforts in the future,"" he concluded.

Metrics details

The development of biosensors that can detect specific analytes continuously, in vivo, in real time has proven difficult due to biofouling, probe degradation and signal drift that often occur in vivo. By drawing inspiration from intestinal mucosa that can protect host cell receptors in the presence of the gut microbiome, we develop a synthetic biosensor that can continuously detect specific target molecules in vivo. The biomimetic multicomponent sensor features the hierarchical nano-bio interface design with three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoporous structure, polymer coating and aptamer switches, balancing small-molecule sensing and surface protection in complex biological environments. Our system is stable for at least 1 month in undiluted serum in vitro or 1 week implanted within the blood vessels of free-moving rats, retaining over 50% baseline signal and reproducible calibration curves. We demonstrate that the implanted system can intravenously track pharmacokinetics in real time even after 4 days of continuous exposure to flowing blood within rat femoral vein. In this way, our work provides a generalizable design foundation for biosensors that can continuously operate in vivo for extended durations.

The increasing digitization of microscope slides is making pathology more amenable to advances in AI.Credit: Getty

If you've ever had a biopsy, you — or at least, your excised tissues — have been seen by a pathologist. “Pathology is the cornerstone of diagnosis, especially when it comes to cancer,” says Bo Wang, a computer scientist at the University of Toronto in Canada.

But pathologists are increasingly under strain. Globally, demand is outstripping supply, and many countries are facing shortages. At the same time, pathologists' jobs have become more demanding. They now involve not only more and more conventional tasks, such as sectioning and staining tissues, then viewing them under a microscope, but also tests that require extra tools and expertise, such as assays for genes and other molecular markers. For Wang and others, one solution to this growing problem could lie in artificial intelligence (AI).

AI tools can help pathologists in several ways: highlighting suspicious regions in the tissue, standardizing diagnoses and uncovering patterns invisible to the human eye, for instance. “They hold the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility and also efficiency,” Wang says, “while also enabling new research directions for mining large-scale pathological and molecular data.”

ChatGPT for science: how to talk to your data

Over the past few decades, slides have increasingly been digitized, enabling pathologists to study samples on-screen rather than under a microscope — although many still prefer the microscope. The resulting images, which can encompass whole slides, have proved invaluable to computer scientists and biomedical engineers, who have used them to develop AI-based assistants. Moreover, the success of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek has inspired researchers to apply similar techniques to pathology. “This is a very dynamic research area, with lots of new research coming up every day,” Wang says. “It's very exciting.”

Scientists have designed AI models to perform tasks such as classifying illnesses, predicting treatment outcomes and identifying biological markers of disease. Some have even produced chatbots that can assist physicians and researchers seeking to decipher the data hidden in stained slices of tissue. Such models “can essentially mimic the entire pathology process”, from analysing slides and ordering tests to writing reports, says Faisal Mahmood, a computer scientist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. “All of that is possible with technology today,” he says.

But some researchers are wary. They say that AI models have not yet been validated sufficiently — and that the opaque nature of some models poses challenges to deploying them in the clinic. “At the end of the day, when these tools go into the hospital, to the bedside of the patient, they need to provide reliable, accurate and robust results,” says Hamid Tizhoosh, a computer scientist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “We are still waiting for those.”

The earliest AI tools for pathology were designed to perform clearly defined tasks, such as detecting cancer in breast-tissue biopsy samples. But the advent of ‘foundation' models — which can adapt to a broad range of applications that they haven't been specifically trained for — has provided an alternative approach.

Among the best-known foundation models are the large language models that drive generative-AI tools such as ChatGPT. However, ChatGPT was trained on much of the text on the Internet, and pathologists have no comparably vast resource with which to train their software. For Mahmood, a potential solution to this problem came in 2023, when researchers at tech giant Meta released DINOv2, a foundation model designed to perform visual tasks, such as image classification1. The study describing DINOv2 provided an important insight, Mahmood says — namely, that the diversity of a training data set was more important than its size.

By applying this principle, Mahmood and his team launched, in March 2024, what they describe as a general-purpose model for pathology, named UNI2. They gathered a data set of more than 100 million images from 100,000 slides representing both diseased and healthy organs and tissues. The researchers then used the data set to train a self-supervised learning algorithm — a machine-learning model that teaches itself to detect patterns in large data sets. The team reported that UNI could outperform existing state-of-the-art computational-pathology models on dozens of classification tasks, including detecting cancer metastases and identifying various tumour subtypes in the breast and brain. The current version, UNI 2, has an expanded training data set, which includes more than 200 million images and 350,000 slides (see go.nature.com/3h5qkwb).

A second foundation model designed by the team used the same philosophy regarding diverse data sets, but also included images from pathology slides and text obtained from PubMed and other medical databases3. (Such models are called multimodal.)

Like UNI, the model — called CONCH (for Contrastive Learning from Captions for Histopathology) — could perform classification tasks, such as cancer subtyping, better than could other models, the researchers found. For example, it could distinguish between subtypes of cancer that contain mutations in the BRCA genes with more than 90% accuracy, whereas other models performed, for the most part, no better than would be expected by chance. It could also classify and caption images, retrieving text in response to image queries and vice versa, to produce graphics of the patterns seen in specific cancers. However, it was not as accurate in these tasks as it was for classification. In head-to-head evaluations, CONCH consistently outperformed baseline approaches even in cases where very few data points were available for downstream model training.

UNI and CONCH are publicly available on the model-sharing platform Hugging Face (see go.nature.com/44g24w2). Researchers have used them for a variety of applications, including grading and subtyping neural tumours called neuroblastomas, predicting treatment outcomes and identifying gene-expression biomarkers associated with specific diseases. With more than 1.5 million downloads and hundreds of citations, the models have “been used in ways that I never thought people would be using them for”, Mahmood says. “I had no idea that so many people were interested in computational pathology.”

Other groups have developed their own foundation models for pathology. Microsoft's GigaPath4, for instance, is trained on more than 170,000 slides obtained from 28 US cancer centres to do tasks such as cancer subtyping. mSTAR (for Multimodal Self-taught Pretraining), designed by computer scientist Hao Chen at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and his team, folds together gene-expression profiles, images and text5. Also available on Hugging Face (see go.nature.com/3ylmauf), mSTAR was designed to detect metastases, to subtype cancers and to perform other tasks.

Now, Mahmood and Chen's teams have built ‘copilots' based on their models. In June 2024, Mahmood's team released PathChat — a generalist AI assistant that combined UNI with a large language model6. The resulting model was then fine-tuned with almost one million questions and answers using information derived from articles on PubMed, case reports and other sources. Pathologists can use it to have ‘conversations' about uploaded images and generate reports, among other things. Licensed to Modella AI, a biomedical firm in Boston, Massachusetts, the chatbot received breakthrough-device designation from the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this year.

Similarly, Chen's team has developed SmartPath, a chatbot that Chen says is being tested in hospitals in China. Pathologists are going head to head with the tool in assessments of breast, lung and colon cancers.

Beyond classification tasks, both PathChat and SmartPath have been endowed with agent-like capabilities — the ability to plan, make decisions and act autonomously. According to Mahmood, this enables PathChat to streamline a pathologist's workflow — for example, by highlighting cases that are likely to be positive for a given disease, ordering further tests to support the diagnostic process and writing pathology reports.

Foundation models, says Jakob Kather, an oncologist at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, represent “a really transformative technological advancement” in pathology — although they are yet to be approved by regulatory authorities. “I think it'll take about two or three years until these tools are widely available, clinical proven products,” he says.

Not everyone is convinced that foundation models will bring about groundbreaking changes in medicine — at least, not in the short term.

One key concern is accuracy. Specifically, how to quantify it, says Anant Madabhushi, a biomedical engineer at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Owing to a relative lack of data, most pathology-AI studies use a cross-validation approach, in which one chunk of a data set is reserved for training and another for testing. This can lead to issues such as overfitting, meaning that an algorithm performs well on data similar to the information that the model has encountered before but does poorly on disparate data.

“The problem with cross-validation is that it tends to provide fairly optimistic results,” Madabhushi explains. “The cleanest and best way to validate these models is through external, independent validation, where the external test set is separate and distinct from the training set and ideally from a separate institution.”

Why tumour geography matters — and how to map it

Furthermore, models also might not perform as well in the field as their developers suggest they do. In a study published in February7, Tizhoosh and his colleagues put a handful of pathology foundation models to the test, including UNI and GigaPath. Using a zero-shot approach, in which a model is tested on a data set it hasn't yet encountered (in this case, data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, which contains around 11,000 slides from more than 9,000 individuals), the team found that the assessed models were, on average, less accurate at identifying cancers than a coin toss would be — although some models did perform better for specific organs, such as the kidneys.

Face it: Being bad feels pretty good sometimes. Who amongst us hasn't wanted to enjoy the spoils of a ne'er-do-well's criminal enterprises? Should you desire those things and be able to acquire them without doing all the crimes, WIRED has prepared a little shopping list for you. If you've ever craved a kitchen worthy of Hannibal Lecter, a stereo perfect for Hans Gruber, boots befitting Darth Vader, a chair perfect for Doctor Doom, or a toy box The Joker would be envious of, you've come to the right place.

Dry Ager

While Buffalo Bill liked to “store” his victims for later in the bottom of a well, Hannibal generally preferred to dig in right then and there (just ask Paul Krendler). But when he demands the most tender possible cuts for his guests, we expect only dry aging will do. This high-class meat store combines ancient dry-aging methods with state-of-the-art humidity-controlled technology to take the effort, risk, and odor from hanging meats, all from a plug-and-go appliance. The result is a blackened steak with thick crust—but cut away the exterior and you'll be rewarded with the most tender, buttery piece of meat imaginable. Price on request.

Dragon Riot

Amazon

Whether you're looking to spatchcock a chicken, debone a carcass, or neatly remove your own polydactyly finger, these poultry shears will effortlessly cut through gristle and bone. With non-slip micro-serrated German stainless steel blades they're easy to wield, the non-slip ergonomic grip and lockable blades prevent unwanted accidents, and while they're dishwasher safe, keep in mind that blood stains are easier to remove with cold water.

Bialetti

Amazon

WIRED is fully aware that Mads Mikkelsen's Lecter used a gloriously expensive $22,000 Royal Coffee Maker. Sadly, it doesn't come in red, so here's a beautifully simple, hugely effective stovetop espresso maker from alternative coffee royalty Bialetti. It works just like the classic Moka Express, but the collector is replaced by a plate with room enough for two espresso cups. Although in Lecter's kitchen, you're doing well if you make it past dessert…

Riedel

Amazon

Williams Sonoma

Sur La Table

If you've gone to the trouble of cooking liver and fava beans, that nice chianti had better be aired to perfection. Launched in 2006 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of both Riedel and Mozart, this hand-blown decanter is shaped like a lyre—a lute-style stringed instrument—and pours deliciously. Handmade using the finest clear crystal glass, it holds a single bottle of wine within a curved shape that helps to naturally capture any sediment without the need to add filtration.

Wüsthof

Williams Sonoma

Sur La Table

Dr. Lecter enjoyed the versatility of his unserrated Spyderco Harpy knife, but when the guests arrive he's going to want something a little less murderous on the kitchen counter. Now available in a red wine-inspired shade of Tasty Sumac, this classic knife set and oiled ash block from Wüsthof features riveted handles, full-forged stainless steel blades with a Rockwell Hardness Scale rating of 58, and classic precision-cut focused blade grind-angle of 29 degrees.

Sirman

ACityDiscount

When you “prefer to eat the rude” nothing prepares them for the plate as elegantly as this 132-pound example of flesh-slicing perfection. Sirman's polished and painted aluminium manual flywheel slicer has a 12-inch blade and patented motion system that has no visible mechanical parts, while its double-articulating arm holds your victim cured meat securely in place. It's easy to clean, disassembles without the need for tools and, despite the retro aesthetic, is an all-modern design for demanding, precision butchery.

Pro-Ject

Turntable Lab (Pre-order)

Few people realise that the $640 million in negotiable bearer bonds Hans so desperately wanted was needed to fund his vinyl addiction. It's a financial pain analog enthusiasts know only too well, but turntable stalwarts Pro-Ject have at least found a way to keep, and restore, a priceless collection. This dedicated vinyl-flattening machine features two 12-inch sized hot plates that heat and press any precious-but-warped long players back into shape. It maintains a temperature of 136.4°F (58°C) and gently irons out those unwanted wobbles.

In 1988, George Michael's album Faith ruled the US charts, but something tells us Hans Gruber wasn't about to be whistling “I want your sex” in a Nakatomi Plaza elevator. It's classical all the way—”Ode to Joy” in this case—and to make the most of Beethoven's final symphony, he'll be wanting a pair of headphones with a rich, traditional playback. These stylish ANC-enabled hybrid Bluetooth cans feature the latest voice control and digital wizardry, but sonic duties are handled deftly through a built-in vacuum tube preamp that offers traditional analog warmth and rich midrange.

Vicoustic

B&H

With Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3. on heavy rotation—that and a proclivity for semi-automatic weapons—Gruber's tastefully decorated apartment would benefit from a little audio control. This bi-dimensional diffusion panel provides audio multi-reflection on both vertical and horizontal planes, and works especially well on mid and high frequencies, helping to enhance musical definition. Each panel measures 23.4 x 23.4 x 5.8 inches and can be installed easily by any blond henchman.

T+A

House of Stereo (Turntable)

House of Stereo (Receiver)

Hailing from precision German audio engineers T+A, we consider this slick setup the perfect cold-steel color-match for Hans' (and Arafat's) John Phillips suit. The belt-driven turntable has an MC-2 moving coil cartridge and a crystal-controlled synchronous motor for exceptional stability, while the decidedly retro-modern all-in-one features a precision CD drive, FM/DAB/internet radio, a 25-watts-per-channel AB amplifier, and comprehensive G3 streamer with native DSD playback and a quadruple PCM DAC with eight 32-bit Burr-Brown chips, ensuring exceptional sound quality.

Cassina

Design Within Reach

As an iconic Euro Villain, Hans Gruber's choice of chair would be of equally high standing, and as utterly uncompromising as the man himself. Designed by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, and Charlotte Perriand in 1928, the LC2 Armchair combines generously proportioned cushions and a tubular chrome frame to create an instantly recognizable piece of furniture. Shown here in classic black Scozia leather, the chair is said to embody the principles of rationalism, which rather aptly deal with order, structure, proportionality, and symmetry, while rejecting unnecessary detail or overly emotional design. That's so Hans!

Transparent

Transparent

Weighing a hefty 26.5 pounds and standing at more than 23 inches tall, this Brutalist architecture-inspired speaker is made from 70 percent post-consumer recycled aluminum. Inside, there's a 6.5-inch side-mounted woofer and dual 3-inch tweeters, placed rather strikingly at elevated 90-degree angles. It's a bold audio offering, but with up to 24-bit/192-kHz hi-res, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.3, AirPlay 2, Tidal Connect, and Spotify support it would have made the perfect farewell gift for Hans, when he was kindly asked to leave Volksfrei, his old West German terrorist group.

Alpacka

Bouncing down rapids in a 5.5-pound inflatable packraft might not compare to a “dance with the devil in the pale moonlight,” but if he needs a distraction from taunting Batman, maybe the Joker could take a paddle. We're not sure if Gotham River has any white water, but at least he'll be prepared with this nylon-hulled craft designed for beginner and intermediate paddlers and rated for up to Class III waters. And, even if he does fall out, the self-bailer automatically drains any water that gets in, so he won't need to come ashore. Price varies.

H Henriksen

The Joker loves his razor-sharp playing cards, acid flowers, and cyanide pies—but he secretly craves just a few of Batman's toys. Now he can join in the wall-scaling fun with the Grapnel Launcher, which can shoot a rope and grappling hook up to 115 feet, or 53 feet with a rope ladder. This device for first responders isn't sold to the public, so he'll have to pull some strings. Price on request.



iStyles

When you really need to get a message out of Arkham Asylum and you can't find a convict willing to have a phone stitched inside them, try a drone like the virtually uncrashable DJI Mavic 3. The Joker can dress up his stock quadcopter with a set of laser-cut, color-matched, UV-resistant, and goo-free stickers from iStyles.

Muc-Off

When the Joker isn't filling balloons with Smylex, he should use this palm-size, battery-powered pump that can bring any inflatable up to 100 psi in seconds.

Sharkbanz

If the Joker wants to enter another surfing contest, he should wear Sharkbanz. The battery-free wearable uses magnets to confuse a shark's sensitivity to electric fields, making them swim away.

Rolls-Royce

Let's just call this “Vapour Violet” beauty what it is: the Jokermobile. Rolls-Royce raided its toy box for this highly exclusive version of its Spectre EV, adding light-up grilles and number plates, a dark-finish interior, and—Joker's favorite—a boost button on the steering wheel. Price on request.

Cult

Albe's

What sport would a fiercely intelligent maniacal lunatic lean toward? With its mix of adrenaline, speed, and high probability of bruising your nether regions, BMX would seem a natural fit. This top-tier ride from Cult Devotion has been designed for street, freestyle, and park riding, and it features a classic cassette hub for direct power transfer. It also has a classic fast-stopping 990 U-Brake—not that Joker would ever use it.

Waiting For Ideas

Basic.Space

When Victor von Doom regales his cloned grandkids with tales of narrow defeat at the hands of the Fantastic Four, he'll have swapped his throne for the gentle rocking of this precision-engineered, all-aluminum design. Created by Jean-Baptiste Anotin for his Paris-based studio Waiting For Ideas, the sharp lines and tight curves were inspired by the speed and aerodynamics of Formula 1, which sits beautifully at odds with a product designed to move so gently. It's the perfect combination of sculptural, practical, and threatening.

Rolex

Rolex

This year's watch releases held good news for Victor Von Doom, as Rolex decided to go green with its GMT Master-II, and any worthwhile designs on ruling humanity with an iron fist naturally requires perfect timing on the wrist. The upgraded case material, now in white gold, befits Doom's status, of course, but the real Doom boon is the new green dial made of Cerachrom, Rolex's own patented ceramic alloy, that perfectly matches the bezel made from the same material. The bi-tone bezel, incidentally, is the key to keeping track of dastardly deeds in two different time zones simultaneously. Meanwhile, a 70-hour power reserve should help keep even the best-laid plans from falling foul—and no, your eyes do not deceive you, this is a lefty (though righties are welcome).

Stone Espresso

TattaHome

Pro Espresso

Nobody can be expected to tackle the complexities of the Multiverse without a decent coffee, and while the idea of Doom sitting down for breakfast feels farcical, deftly extracting the perfect two ounces of espresso feels on-brand, and this small-but-mighty coffee machine fits the bill brilliantly. It has zero plastic parts and is just 14 inches tall, but still weighs a solid 45 pounds. Temperature is accurately controlled with a 6.6-pound solid brass group head and PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) heating system which, unlike traditional thermostats, constantly monitors and adjusts the heat, maintaining the ideal temperature with greater precision and stability.

Ferm Living

Ferm Living

Made from plate aluminum, rather than the nuclear-powered titanium used in Doom's battle armor, this carry-all trolley from Danish homeware deities Ferm Living blends the industrially sculptural with a blast of Brutalism. Useful as a bar cart (although Lager translates as “warehouse,” rather than anything beer-related), side table, or arcane gauntlet storage device, it's 27 pounds of uncompromising design.

iFi Audio

iFi Audio

One imagines that full titanium headgear (curse you, Richards!!!) plays havoc with a Bluetooth connection, so traditional wired headphones are the order of the day for Doom. And to make the most of his high-resolution playlists, he's going to need a dedicated amplifier. The iFi Audio iCAN Phantom is built to cope with the sonic demands of the most sensitive and difficult-to-run headphones. As such it can deliver 15,000mW at 16Ω and 640V for electrostatic models and, in a novel twist, the listener can switch between solid-state and tube modes to find the perfect tone.

Porsche

Porsche

From e-bikes and dental chairs, to door handles and basins, Porsche's design division has a habit of elevating the everyday, and nowhere is this more evident than with this elegant gaming monitor. Borrowing design elements from the Porsche 911 S 2.4 Targa, the 49-inch, 5K resolution QHD-OLED display has a seriously quick 240Hz refresh rate, 1,000-nit brightness, and 1,800R curvature for full immersion. And, when Victor puts down the controller, the USB-C connectivity and hub means it can transition seamlessly back to the daily grind of world domination.

Iquinix

Iquinix

Machined from aluminum, this hot-swappable retro-style Bluetooth keyboard is a world away from cheap plastic clickety-clack options (which no doubt abound in Four Freedoms Plaza). It uses a desktop-space-saving 65 percent layout, but still squeezes in Bluetooth 5.1, Wireless 2.4GHz, and USB-C connectivity, meaning you can switch between up to three (doomsday) devices with ease. Available for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android, it even comes in Doom's signature green.

Chasseur

Le Chameau

What they don't tell you on Wookieepedia is that while Anakin Skywalker grew an impressive six inches by becoming Darth Vader, his shoe size remained the same. Sadly, Anakin's favorite black boots met the same fiery fate as his legs on Mustafar, but at least we've found him the perfect replacements. These handcrafted, leather-lined wellies come with a full-length side zip and eight separate calf fittings for a near-bespoke fit. The Chamolux rubber is all-natural too, and the in- and outsoles offer protection and cushioning for all the miles clocked up marching around the Death Star. There's even a neoprene-lined version for those chilly trips to Hoth.

Avolt

Avolt

When the Power of the Dark Side doesn't quite reach far enough, we recommend the Avolt Square 1, possibly the most Star Wars-looking gadget on this list. Available in EU, US, and UK plug configurations—the Tatooine version is still TBC—it is the most beautifully minimalist multi-socket extension lead you'll find, and comes with a generous 5.9-foot cord and two USB-C ports, each supporting 30W fast charging.

Kartell

Kartell

Even the most morally conflicted Jedi Knight needs decent storage options, and this classic by Italian designer Anna Castelli Ferrieri for Kartell ticks all his black boxes. First launched in 1967, it is made from glossy ABS plastic for a seam-free aesthetic, and is available in two, three, and four-compartment configurations. And no, before you ask, it's not the same plastic used to make that iconic helmet, because everyone knows that is an alloy composed of durasteel, plasteel, and obsidian. But, you know, it looks pretty close…

George Lucas has provided differing origin stories to how the name ""Darth Vader"" originated, but he has mentioned the phrase ""Dark Water"" as inspiration. Which, by coincidence, is precisely what he'd get if he put that filthy cloak in the wash. This suitably obsidian appliance can blitz through an 11-pound load in just 39 minutes and, thanks to its use of steam, 99.99 percent of allergens are removed and creases reduced by 30 percent. It's Wi-Fi enabled too, and the AI Wash cycle can adjust the motion of the drum depending on the fabric. New and troublesome stains, meanwhile, can be custom-cleaned by downloading upgraded wash-cycle data.

Northern

Despite being on the site of a Dark Side locus and just a stone's throw from where Obi-Wan left him for dead, Fortress Vader is surprisingly homely. Yes, it's a towering display of evil, but look closer and you might just spot a 3PO droid giving it a quick once-around with the Northern Cane magnetic broom set. Designed by studio Gridy, the powder-coated steel dustpan has a level front edge that maintains close contact with the floor, while the waist-height handle makes sweeping up lava dust a breeze.

Dreame

Dreame

While primarily used to guide Stormtroopers around the half-finished corridors of the Death Star, the MSE-6 series “Mouse” droid was also capable of repairs and even domestic chores. It's no match for the new X50 Dreame—though sadly for US readers, this class-leading next-generation self-cleaning robotic vacuum and mop isn't yet available in the States. It uses the latest 360-degree DToF (Direct Time of Flight) LIDAR-style navigation to avoid Imperial clutter, and the new ProLean system can lift the unit high enough to clear doors, steps and dividers up to 2.36 inches high. It can even reduce its height to just 3.5 inches, for a quick scooch under your low furniture, and can even search the house for your pets while you're away, and transmit a live feed to your smartphone.

I've made no secret about my love for coffee makers from the Portland-based company Ratio, ever since it came out with the Ratio Eight model a decade ago. Two of WIRED's favorite drip coffee makers on earth are made by Ratio, in fact.

As well as anybody, the Portland company has managed to take the finicky techniques of third-wave barista pour-over and merge them with automatic drip coffee to create some of the most full-bodied and aromatic cups of coffee I've had the pleasure of trying. To taste it, all I have to do is press a single button. The machine does the work, not me. The Ratio Four (8/10, WIRED Recommends) remains my favorite single-serve drip coffeemaker made by anyone, anywhere. It's a masterclass in simplicity.

But it all began a decade ago with the Ratio Eight, which helped change the conversation around what a home drip coffeemaker could be, adopting the aesthetics and a lot of the techniques surrounding barista café pour-over but applying them to an automated home coffee machine— using locally hewn wood and the shapely curves of a Chemex-style pour-over coffeemaker.

Well, now the Ratio Eight has gotten a makeover, for the new world of drip coffee it helped inspire—informed by all the coffee makers that Ratio has developed in the meantime (and even one they haven't released). The new 8-cup Ratio Eight Series 2, slated for release in September, is now available for presale on Ratio's website.

For a limited time, preorders are discounted to $639. But by September, when the Eight Series 2 is projected to go on sale for real, that price will shoot up to $799. That's among the highest prices I'm aware of for a drip or pour-over coffee maker.

Is it worth it? I can say I got to try out the new Ratio Eight Series 2 at Ratio's offices this week, just before preorders launched. I was very impressed by what I saw, and even more impressed by what I tasted. I won't know everything until I get to play around with the device at home. But the coffee I had was full-bodied, full-flavored, and delicious. And it's a beautiful machine.

Here are the specs on the upcoming Ratio Eight Series 2—and my early thoughts based on trying the device.

Ratio

Ratio (pre-order)

If you're a fan of the original Ratio Eight, chances are you were drawn in first by the aesthetics. That includes the walnut wood accents. And that pretty hourglass shape of the blown-glass carafe, with the conical brewing filter best known from café pour-over.

The sturdy walnut trim stayed. But Ratio has learned a few things since making the original Eight, said Ratio founder and CEO Mark Hellweg, at a meeting this month that also included the Eight's designer, James Owen. One of the things Ratio learned is that using a closed, flat-bottom brewing chamber leads to much more consistent coffee than conical glass. It's easier to control both in terms of water flow and brewing temperature, and is more forgiving if you don't have a super-expensive grinder. (That said, you know, we like expensive grinders and recommend a few.)

“Once we went flat, we realized, ‘This is the way,'” said Hellweg.

I'll admit, I'll miss that pretty glass carafe, just on the visual level. Hellweg says they'll indeed keep making the Chemex-style carafe as an option. But the Series 2, by default, will look much different, though it still has its hourglass shape as a link to the past.

Instead, the new brewing basket will make use of technology that Ratio developed when making two of my favorite coffeemakers, the Ratio Four and the Ratio Six Series 2, which consistently feel like magic tricks to me when I use them at home. I often find new homes for coffee makers I test. I keep my Ratios. Few others can manage such full-bodied, consistently thick extraction on automatic drip or pour-over-style coffee, while being so simple to use.

The Ratio brewing method is somewhere between what a barista does in a third-wave café and a classic drip machine. First, there's the “bloom,” which is a poetic name for pre-infusing coffee grounds with a small amount of hot water. This releases the carbon dioxide trapped in fresh beans, which would otherwise interfere with extraction when the hot water begins flowing in earnest.

Another thing that makes café pour-over coffee express flavor so well is agitation. Basically, if you drop water onto coffee, or shake it, or spin it, the coffee will release its secrets better. It's like shaking an interrogation subject. (Actually, on second thought, don't do this.)

One of Ratio's signal technologies from the beginning has used a “Fibonacci-inspired” spiral showerhead, a shape and mathematics often touted as a means of maintaining water efficiency. On the Eight Series 2, when Hellweg brewed a batch at Ratio's Portland headquarters, this meant that water extracted evenly across the entire brew basket, with no obvious channeling. So the falling water droplets extract both faster and evenly.

Temperature control is a more interesting and complex conversation. Ratio is one of a small number of coffee-maker companies who've had their devices certified by the international Specialty Coffee Association as hewing to a very tight set of criteria, which includes holding temperatures within a tight 4-degree (Celsius) range during the entire brewing process.

But even this doesn't tell the whole story. I can attest from experience that not all SCA-certified coffee makers produce great coffee—and that great coffee definitely can come from noncertified coffee makers. Ratio does a lot of sophisticated firmware rejiggering to play around with temperature curves during brewing—what chief operating officer Bradley Walhood, in an excitable moment, called “a literal crapload” of testing and firmware updates.

In the Eight, this means that they mess around with wattage to change how the heating element works. Though the Ratio Eight Series 2 is a 1,400-watt device, they intentionally don't use all of it at all times, changing energy consumption in order to change how the heating element works over time and get the best-tasting brew.

Like Ratio's previous Four, the Eight Series 2 will have two different brew modes for small and large batches of coffee, to further refine temperature curves and keep them in optimal ranges.

One of the biggest selling points on the Eight was always minimal plastic. There's a lot of interest in plastic-free everything, in these days when new and frightening revelations about microplastics seem to come once a week.

But it's difficult, and very expensive, to make a truly plastic-free automatic coffee machine. Plastic-free brewing is a bit of a holy grail, achieved mostly by much older, lower-tech methods like French press, moka pot, and pour-over.

The Eight Series 2 comes as close as any automatic drip machine to achieving this. The cold-water reservoir is a BPA-free Tritan copolymer. The base is also made of polymer. And there's a bit of BPA-free plastic used in the heating element that doesn't come into contact with hot water, said Hellweg.

But the tubing, inside the device, is made of glass. The pipe connectors are silicone. The chassis is stainless steel, and so is the brewing basket. The thermal carafe is stainless steel, while the nonthermal option is borosilicate glass. What all this means is that heated water or coffee never touches plastic.

This also has the side effect of giving each part on the Eight a truly satisfying heft. “Check this out,” said Hellweg, with evident pride, handing me a small and weighty piece of steel that could double as a stress fidget. It was the lid to the water reservoir. It actually did feel good, the weight of this lid. Plastic makes you forget the satisfying solidity of cast metal. These more expensive materials are reflected, of course, in the price.

The preorder window offers a quite substantial discount on the anticipated retail price, but it's still not low. The $639 preorder price for the Eight Series 2, and the $799 anticipated retail price in September, are at the very highest end of drip coffee machines on the market. They're also double the price of Ratio's own Six and Four.

Will the coffee alone justify this higher price? It's hard to know based on one delicious carafe of coffee. That's the sort of thing I'll only learn over time, when testing side-by-side. Compared to the Ratio Six, the Eight Series 2 offers the same 40-ounce batch size but some new programming and new technology—including the ability to optimize its brewing program for small batches of 20 ounces or less.

But really, as with a lot of luxury goods, much of the cost is likely going into luxury: intangibles, style, loveliness, and of course, more expensive materials. In the case of the Eight Series 2, these costs will have a lot to do with the steps Ratio took to avoid plastic: the double-walled stainless steel, the borosilicate glass tubing, the American walnut wood. The new thermal carafe, with its stainless steel construction, is sturdy and lovely.

Ratio's owners and designers also cited instability surrounding tariffs, which is almost certainly a factor in announcing a price that'll first take effect six months from now. The Eight Series 2, like a large portion of products from small companies in the United States, is manufactured in China because American factories aren't set up for custom tooling on small production runs.

All I can say is that it's pretty, and it brews delicious coffee, and it feels in my hand like a thing that costs what it does—in a year when a lot of things suddenly cost a bit more. And that based on past experience with Ratio, the Eight Series 2 will probably remain the best-tasting cup of drip coffee I can get by just pressing a single button.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Helicopter, Halibut, and ‘Y.M.C.A': Inside Donald Trump's Memecoin Dinner","https://www.wired.com/story/a-helicopter-halibut-and-ymca-inside-donald-trumps-memecoin-dinner/","Fri, 23 May 2025 17:11:07 GMT","

As US president Donald Trump left the stage at his golf club near Washington D.C. on Thursday night, he pointed to the crowd, brought his index finger to his temple—as if to say: you know what's coming—then began to dance. To the beat of “Y.M.C.A” by The Village People, Trump shimmied, gyrated, and pumped his arms above his head.

Looking on were more than 200 people who had been invited to the Trump National Golf Club for a private gala dinner. They had won their seats by purchasing large quantities of Trump's own crypto coin—TRUMP—some holding millions of dollars' worth.

On the menu for the evening was pan seared halibut with a citrus reduction, a filet mignon with demi glaze—and, the attendees hoped, a chance to speak to the US president. Four of the guests agreed to tell WIRED about their experience.

By late afternoon, the dinner guests had started to filter through the gates of the golf club. By comparison to Trump's previous banquets, thronging with D.C. insiders and members of the Silicon Valley elite, the crypto dinner attracted a mismatched collection of oddballs: independent traders rubbed shoulders with crypto executives, diehard Trump fans and even professional sportspeople—former NBA player Lamar Odom towered overhead. A handful wore bowties in Bitcoin orange; others sported gold Trump sneakers.

Just after 7 pm, the dinner guests gathered at the window to watch Trump descend in Marine One, his presidential helicopter. A short while later, he appeared from behind a blue velvet curtain to whoops and applause from the crowd. Had they seen the helicopter, Trump asked. “Yeah, super cool!” somebody yelled.

From behind a lectern at one end of the dining room, backdropped by four US flags, Trump delivered a characteristically winding and digressive speech that sources say lasted around 25 minutes. At some point, he got round to crypto.

“We've got some of the smartest minds anywhere in the world right here in this room,” said Trump. “You believe in the whole crypto thing. A lot of people are starting to believe in it … This is really something that may be special—who knows, right? Who knows—but it may be special.”

When Trump first promoted his memecoin in January, three days before the inauguration, the limited amount released into circulation rose in value to $14 billion. The remaining 80 percent of the supply is controlled by CIC Digital LLC—a subsidiary of a conglomerate owned by the Trump family—and Fight Fight Fight LLC, formed by long-time Trump ally Bill Zanker. With little more than a social media post, Trump had added billions of dollars to his paper net worth. (The value of the circulating coins has since slumped to roughly $3 billion.)

The team behind the TRUMP coin announced the presidential dinner for the top 220 holders on April 23, promising the top 25 a close-quarters reception with Trump. The attendees would be selected based on who had held the most coins and kept them the longest between the announcement date and May 12, the website explained.

The dinner competition revived objections among critics who feared that the memecoin could be used as a vector for bribery. Theoretically, by making a large investment in TRUMP, driving up the price, critics worried that a politically-motivated actor could discreetly curry favor with the president. The dinner, critics argued, compounded that risk by making the unsavory arrangement explicit: a large investment in return for an encounter with Trump.

“What's happening tonight at Trump's golf course is, in effect, putting a ‘for sale' sign on the White House. It's auctioning off access,” claimed Democrat senator Richard Blumenthal on Thursday morning at a press conference hosted by non-profit Accountable.US.

After the competition deadline, a few of the dinner attendees identified themselves publicly, including the largest TRUMP holder: crypto magnate Justin Sun. The China-born entrepreneur has become increasingly entangled in the Trump family's expanding web of crypto ventures; in addition to investing in the memecoin, Sun previously disclosed a combined $75 million investment in a separate crypto coin issued by World Liberty Financial, a company affiliated with the Trump family and promoted by Eric and Donald Trump Jr. In early May, Eric Trump announced a partnership between World Liberty Financial and TRON, a crypto network developed by Sun.

Under the Biden administration, US regulators had charged Sun and several of his companies with market manipulation and offering unregistered securities. In February, after Trump had returned to the White House, a district judge granted a joint request to stay the case in order for both sides to negotiate an out-of-court resolution.

The event organizer did not respond immediately to a request for comment. In a statement to WIRED, Anna Kelly, deputy press secretary for the White House, said, “The president is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public, which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media.”

The identities of most of the remaining attendees were concealed behind leaderboard usernames and alphanumeric crypto wallet addresses. But those who spoke to WIRED provided a sense of their motivations for seeking a place.

For some, the dinner represented a chance to network with other deep-pocketed crypto figures, and to hear directly from Trump about his plans to bring an end to the regulatory uncertainty that crimped the industry's expansion under Biden.

“You don't get to meet the president easily,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at trading firm

Kronos Research, told WIRED a few days before the dinner. “To be able to hear his message on crypto directly—I'm definitely looking forward to that.”

Others hoped to run into famous members of Trump's inner circle—perhaps Elon Musk or David Sacks, the venture capitalist now serving as crypto and AI czar to the White House. “If it's someone from the PayPal Mafia, I'll probably tell them that Peter Thiel's book changed my life,” said 25-year-old TikTok prankster Nicholas Pinto, who purchased around $300,000 in TRUMP to earn his seat at the dinner.

To celebrate winning a place at the dinner, Pinto had spraypainted “Hold $Trump” onto the chassis of his blue Mercedes G-Wagon. But hoping to win credit with the cryptoheads, rode his Lamborghini Urus to D.C. instead.

One independent crypto trader, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity, didn't really intend to win a place at the dinner at all. They bought into TRUMP with the aim of profiting by a potential uplift in price brought about by the competition, but currently faced with a loss on their trade if they were to sell, instead chose to settle for a lavish dinner.

The dining room chosen for the crypto event looks out across the golf course fairway towards the Potomac River, shrouded on Thursday evening by grey clouds.

As the guests filed in, they were greeted by a blown-up copy of the leaderboard that ranked the TRUMP coin holders throughout the competition. Some signed their respective leaderboard usernames in marker pen.

Others made their way towards circular tables, each seating 10 people, arrayed beneath a set of crystal chandeliers. Waiting on the chairs were gift bags containing Fight Fight Fight-themed hats and posters, and a collectible plastic card (some allege that they didn't receive merch at their seats.) The four largest coin holders—along with two other attendees selected by raffle, sources say—received a gem-encrusted Trump gold watch.

Between mouthfuls, the attendees discussed trading and investment strategies—and Trump's speech. “To feel his personal charisma to me was very inspiring,” says Liu. But others complained about the brevity of Trump's appearance: After his speech, Trump had departed immediately in a golf cart bound for his helicopter. “Trump could have at least given the top people their watches himself,” says Pinto. “He didn't.”

The food itself had left a bitter taste in the mouth, too. “It was the worst food I've ever had at a Trump golf course,” says Pinto, who added he left hungry. “The only good thing was bread and butter.” Another attendee described the meal as “Okay, but not top-class.”

During the dessert course, the organizers invited Sun to make a speech of his own as the largest coin holder. He toasted the other attendees—and Trump—and declared a new dawn for the crypto industry in the US. “I appreciate like everything the Trump administration done for our industry [sic],” said Sun.

As the dinner dwindled to a natural close, many of the guests took shuttle buses to an afterparty at a rooftop hotel bar in central Washington put on by one of the other large coin holders, which ran into the early hours of the morning. Others called it a night.

The presiding memory for one attendee remains the “warm welcome” that they received at the start of the evening. As they made their way through the security checkpoint at the front gate, they were greeted by a horde of protesters, brandishing signs reading “Stop Crypto Corruption” and “Don the Con” emblazoned with the orange bitcoin logo. “Shame on you,” the protesters shouted.

More than a decade ago, researchers at antivirus company Kaspersky identified suspicious internet traffic of what they thought was a known government-backed group, based on similar targeting and its phishing techniques. Soon, the researchers realized they had found a much more advanced hacking operation that was targeting the Cuban government, among others.

Eventually the researchers were able to attribute the network activity to a mysterious — and at the time completely unknown — Spanish-speaking hacking group that they called Careto, after the Spanish slang word (“ugly face” or “mask” in English), which they found buried within the malware's code. 

Careto was never publicly linked to a specific government. But TechCrunch has now learned that the researchers who first discovered the group were convinced that Spanish government hackers were behind Careto's espionage operations.

When Kaspersky first revealed the existence of Careto in 2014, its researchers called the group “one of the most advanced threats at the moment,” with its stealthy malware capable of stealing highly sensitive data, including private conversations and keystrokes from the computers it compromised, much akin to powerful government spyware today. Careto's malware was used to hack into government institutions and private companies around the world.

Kaspersky avoided publicly blaming who it thought was behind Careto. But internally, according to several people who worked at Kaspersky at the time and had knowledge of the investigation, its researchers concluded that Careto was a hacking team working for the Spanish government. 

“There was no doubt of that, at least no reasonable [doubt],” one of the former employees told TechCrunch, who like other sources in this story agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

Careto is one of only a handful of Western government hacking groups that has ever been discussed in public, along with U.S. government units such as Equation Group, widely believed to be the U.S. National Security Agency; the Lamberts, believed to be the CIA; and the French government group known as Animal Farm, which was behind the Babar and Dino malware. In a rare admission, Bernard Barbier, former head of the French intelligence service DGSE, publicly confirmed the French government was indeed behind Babar. 

The Spanish government now joins this small group of Western government hacking groups.

Early in its investigation, Kaspersky discovered that the Careto hackers had targeted a particular government network and systems in Cuba, according to a second former Kaspersky employee. 

It was this Cuban government victim that sparked Kaspersky's investigation into Careto, according to the people speaking with TechCrunch.

“It all started with a guy who worked for the Cuban government who got infected,” the third former Kaspersky employee, with knowledge of the Careto investigation, told TechCrunch. The person, who referred to the Cuban government victim as “patient zero,” said that it appeared the Careto hackers were interested in Cuba because during that time there were members of the Basque terrorist organization ETA in the country.

Kaspersky researchers noted in a technical report published after their discovery that Cuba had by far the most number of victims per country at the time of the investigation into Careto's activities, specifically one unnamed Cuban government institution, which the report said showed “the current interest of the attackers.” 

This Cuban government victim would prove key to link Careto to Spain, according to the former Kaspersky employees.

“Internally we knew who did it,” the third former Kaspersky employee said, adding that they had “high confidence” it was the Spanish government. Two other former Kaspersky employees, who also had knowledge of the investigation, said the researchers likewise concluded Spain was behind the attacks. 

The company, however, decided not to disclose it. “It wasn't broadcast because I think they didn't want to out a government like that,” a fourth former Kaspersky researcher said. “We had a strict ‘no attribution' policy at Kaspersky. Sometimes that policy was stretched but never broken.”

Apart from Cuba, other Careto targets also pointed to Spain. The espionage operation affected hundreds of victims in Brazil, Morocco, Spain itself and — perhaps tellingly — Gibraltar, the disputed British enclave on the Iberian peninsula that Spain has long claimed as its own territory.

Kaspersky declined to answer questions about its researchers' conclusions.

“We don't engage in any formal attribution,” Kaspersky spokesperson Mai Al Akkad told TechCrunch in an email.

The Spanish Ministry of Defense declined to comment. The Cuban government did not respond to emails sent to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

After Kaspersky discovered the group's malware in 2014 and, as a result, learned how to identify other computers compromised by it, the researchers found evidence of Careto infections all over the world, compromising victims in 31 countries spanning several continents. 

In Africa, the group's malware was found in Algeria, Morocco, and Libya; in Europe, it targeted victims in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In Latin America, there were victims in Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Venezuela. 

In its technical report, Kaspersky said that Cuba had the most victims that were being targeted, with “all belonging to the same institution,” which the researchers perceived as of significance to the hackers at that point in time. 

Spain had its own particular interest in Cuba in the preceding years. As an exiled Cuban government official told the Spanish daily El Pais at the end of 2013, there were around 15 members of the terror group ETA who lived in Cuba with the approval of the local government. In 2014, a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable noted that Cuba had given refuge to ETA terrorists for years. Earlier in 2010, a Spanish judge ordered the arrest of ETA members living in Cuba.

When covering the news of the discovery of Careto, the Spanish online news outlet El Diario noted that targeting countries such as Brazil and Gibraltar would favor the Spanish government's “geostrategic interests.” The Spanish government had been pushing for a consortium of government-owned and private companies to win a bid to build a high-speed railway in Brazil from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo. 

Aside from targeting government institutions, embassies, and diplomatic organizations, Kaspersky said the Careto group also targeted energy companies, research institutions, and activists. 

Kaspersky researchers wrote that they were able to find evidence that the Careto malware existed as far back as 2007, and found subsequent versions of Careto capable of exploiting Windows PCs, Macs, and Linux computers. The researchers said they found possible evidence of code capable of targeting Android devices and iPhones.

While Kaspersky didn't make its internal attribution public, its researchers left clear hints that pointed to Spain. 

First, the company researchers noted that they found a string in the malware code that was particularly interesting: “Caguen1aMar.” That string is a contraction for the popular Spanish expletive, “me cago en la mar,” which literally means “I sh–t in the sea,” but roughly translates to “f—k,” a phrase typically used in Spain, and not in other Spanish-speaking countries.  

When Kaspersky announced its discovery of Careto in 2014, the company published a map showing all the countries that the hacking group had targeted. Along with the map, Kaspersky included an illustration of a mask with bull's horns and a nose ring (the bull is a national symbol of Spain), castanets or clackers (an instrument used in Spanish folk music), and the red and yellow colors of the Spanish flag. 

A detail in the map revealed how important Cuba was for Careto. For certain countries, Kaspersky added icons specifying what type of targets it was able to identify. The map showed Cuba had a single hacked victim, marked as a government institution. Gibraltar, Morocco — whose proximity and territorial disputes make it a strategic espionage target for Spain — and Switzerland were the only other territories with a government victim.

Kaspersky said in 2014 that the Careto group's malware was one of the “most advanced threats” of the time for its ability to grab highly sensitive data from a victim's computer. Kaspersky said the malware could also intercept internet traffic, Skype conversations, encryption (PGP) keys, and VPN configurations, take screenshots, and “fetch all information from Nokia devices.”

The Careto group relied in large part on spearphishing emails that contained malicious links impersonating Spanish newspapers like El País, El Mundo, and Público, and videos about political subjects and food recipes. One of the former Kaspersky employees told TechCrunch that the phishing links also included references to ETA and Basque news, which Kaspersky's report omitted. 

When clicking on these malicious links, the victim would get infected using an exploit that hacked the user's specific device, then redirected to a legitimate web page so as to not raise suspicions, according to Kaspersky's report. 

The Careto operators also took advantage of a since-patched vulnerability in older versions of Kaspersky's antivirus software, which the company said in its 2014 published report was how it first discovered the malware. 

The ubiquity of Kaspersky's software in Cuba effectively made it possible for Careto to target almost anyone on the island with an internet connection. (By 2018, the Russian antivirus company controlled some 90% of the island's internet security market, according to Cuba Standard, an independent news website.) The antivirus is so popular across the country that the company's name has become part of the local slang. 

But soon after Kaspersky published its research, the Careto hackers shut down all of its operations discovered by the Russian firm, going as far as wiping its logs, which researchers noted was “not very common” and put Careto into the “elite” section of government hacking groups.

“You can't do that if you're not prepared,” one of the former Kaspersky employees told TechCrunch. “They systematically, and in a quick manner, destroyed the whole thing, the whole infrastructure. Boom. It was just gone.”

After Careto went dark, neither Kaspersky nor any other cybersecurity company publicly reported detecting Careto again — until last year. 

Kaspersky announced in May 2024 that it had found Careto's malware once again, saying it saw the group target an unnamed organization in Latin America that was “previously compromised” by the hacking group most recently in 2022, again in 2019, and on another occasion more than 10 years ago.

Careto also hacked a second unnamed organization, located in Central Africa, said Kaspersky.

In a blog post later in December 2024, Kaspersky's researchers attributed the new hacks to Careto “with medium to high confidence,” based in part on filenames that were “alarmingly similar” to filenames found in Careto's activities from a decade ago, as well as overlapping tactics, techniques, and procedures, or TTPs, a cybersecurity expression that refers to the unique behaviors of a certain hacking group.

Kaspersky researchers Georgy Kucherin and Marc Rivero López, who wrote a paper and presented their research at the Virus Bulletin security conference in October 2024, said Careto “has always conducted cyber attacks with extreme caution,” but still “managed to make small but fatal mistakes during their recent operations” that matched activity from Careto a decade earlier.

Despite that, Kucherin told TechCrunch that they don't know who, or which government, is behind the Careto hacking group. 

“It's likely a nation state,” said Kucherin. “But what entity it was, who developed the malware? From a technical perspective, it's impossible to tell.”

According to Kaspersky's most recent report, this time the Careto hackers broke into the unnamed Latin American victim's email server and then planted its malware. 

In one of the hacked machines the researchers analyzed, Kaspersky found that Careto's malware could surreptitiously switch on the computer's microphone (while hiding the Windows icon that normally alerts the user that the mic is on), steal files, such as personal documents, session cookies that can allow access to accounts without needing a password, web browsing histories from several browsers, and more.

In the case of another victim, according to the report, Careto hackers used a set of implants that work as a backdoor, a keylogger, and a screenshot-taker. 

Despite the fact that they got caught, and compared to what Kaspersky found more than a decade ago, Kucherin said that the Careto hackers are “still that good.”

Compared to the larger and more well-known government-backed hacking groups, like the North Korean Lazarus Group and China's APT41, Kucherin said Careto is a “very small [advanced persistent threat] that surpasses all those large ones in complexity.”

“Their attacks are a masterpiece,” said Kucherin.

California is preparing to sue the federal government to recover its right to set vehicle emissions standards, Rob Bonta, the state's attorney general, told TechCrunch in a statement.

Senate Republicans voted on Thursday 51 to 44 to overturn a waiver that allowed California to set stricter air pollution standards for vehicles. The state has received waivers more than 100 times since federal laws granted the right some 50 years ago.

“The weaponization of the Congressional Review Act to attack California's waivers is just another part of the continuous, partisan campaign against California's efforts to protect the public and the planet from harmful pollution,” Bonta said. “As we have said before, this reckless misuse of the Congressional Review Act is unlawful, and California will not stand idly by.”

Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia follow California's emissions standards, and most of them have implemented fossil fuel vehicle phase-outs. Other Senate votes Thursday repealed waivers that allowed California to set stricter emissions standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.

California's EV mandate is actually a zero-emissions standard. Beginning in 2026, the state was to begin requiring increased sales of zero-emissions cars and passenger trucks until 2035, when automakers would have to sell only zero-emissions vehicles. 

Currently, two technologies qualify: hydrogen fuel cells and battery electric vehicles. Given the growing pains that fuel cells and hydrogen filling networks have experienced, EVs quickly became the de facto approach to meeting California's 2035 deadline.

Last year, 25.3% of new light-duty vehicles in California qualified as zero emissions, and nearly all of them were EVs. The state's mandate required 35% of new sales to be ZEV in 2026, something automakers have said would be “impossible.”

ZEV sales growth in California was flat in 2024, though previous years were different, with the share rising from 7.8% in 2020 to 25% in 2023.

The vote Thursday bucked precedent by going against the advice of the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, which both had ruled that the waiver could not be revoked under the Congressional Review Act. The CRA allows a simple majority vote on a resolution to overturn a regulation, allowing a Senate vote to proceed without threat of filibuster.

Previously, California's attorney general Rob Bonta was “prepared for” Republican efforts to repeal the emissions waiver via the CRA. “We don't think it's an appropriate use of the Congressional Review Act, and we're prepared to defend ourselves if it's wrongfully weaponized,” he told Politico in early March.

Digg, the Web 2.0-era link aggregator that's now being given a second chance at life, is open to buying Mozilla's read-it-later app, Pocket.

On Thursday, Mozilla announced it would shut down Pocket on July 8, saying that the way people use the web has evolved, and it needed to focus on new areas of development. Shortly after, Kevin Rose, Digg's original owner, now co-founder of the new Digg alongside Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, posted on X that his company would be interested in acquiring Pocket from Mozilla.

Tagging both Mozilla and Pocket on the post, Rose wrote, “we love Pocket at @Digg, happy to take it over and continue to support your users for years to come!” The post additionally tagged Betaworks founding partner Peter Rojas, previously the founder of Gizmodo and Engadget.

.@mozilla @Pocket — we love Pocket at @digg, happy to take it over and continue to support your users for years to come! cc: @peterrojas :)

Neither Digg nor Mozilla has yet to respond to a request for comment on the news. However, the deal could be interesting if it went through, as Digg could leverage Pocket's existing user base to fuel interest in its relaunch. Digg could potentially even integrate Pocket's reading list with Digg, making it easier for users to find and share engaging content directly to the news aggregator. This could provide an initial pipeline for feeding news and articles into Digg while it worked to grow its user base. 

Digg's comeback has attracted attention, as it pairs Digg's original founder, Rose, with Ohanian, who helped create the longtime Digg competitor, Reddit, now an internet giant of its own. Digg recently announced it has also brought on Christian Selig, the founder of the third-party Reddit app Apollo, as an adviser. Selig's Apollo app had been one of the best ways to interact with Reddit, but the company cut off the app's access by raising its API pricing to the point that it would have put Selig out of business.

In the startup world, access to cutting-edge tools isn't the biggest obstacle — it's knowing how to wield them with precision. At TechCrunch Sessions: AI, taking place on June 5 at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall, we're digging into the frameworks and decisions that determine whether an AI startup can scale — or stall. We're excited to welcome one of the most tactical voices in that conversation: Iliana Quinonez, Director of North America Startups Customer Engineering at Google Cloud.

Impactful conversations are better shared — get up to $300 off your pass and 50% off a guest ticket. Register now to lock in this limited-time deal and secure your seat for pioneer-led discussions like this one.

Quinonez leads a technical team that partners with high-potential startups across the U.S. and Canada, offering hands-on support as they integrate Google Cloud and AI tools from pre-seed through IPO. Her approach is deeply technical and grounded in the realities of startup velocity — she knows time, capital, and clarity are in short supply — and she helps founders maximize all three.

Startups building with AI agents today face a layered set of questions. What's the right architecture for scaling intelligent behavior? How do you structure data pipelines to train agents that don't just react but reason? Where do APIs end and core IP begin? Quinonez will tackle these questions head-on in a session designed to help founders cut through noise and make defensible decisions about infrastructure, model orchestration, and collaboration.

What sets Quinonez apart is her range. With over two decades of leadership experience at Salesforce, SAP, and BEA Systems, she's helped both enterprise giants and early-stage startups map product ambition to practical execution. Her team also partners closely with accelerators, VCs, and developer ecosystems — giving her a panoramic view of what's working in AI … and what's not.

Expect a clear-eyed discussion on the risks and rewards of building with AI agents, the tools startups are relying on, and what it really takes to democratize access to advanced machine learning — without compromising on speed or security.

This is just one of many conversations happening at TC Sessions: AI — where the focus isn't just on the future of AI, but also on how to build it right now. You'll hear from leaders at OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and Google Cloud, in sessions that span everything from foundational model strategy to data stack design.

If you're building in this space — or planning to — you won't want to miss it. Tickets are currently $300+ off, and for a limited time, you can get 50% off a second one. Bring your co-founder, your head of product, or your favorite skeptic.

Register your ticket today. AI is moving fast. Founders need to move faster.

It made me step back and think about how some of these AI products are named and  I honestly prefer when a product isn't named like a person. Just to think of two: you have ""Claude"" and ""Alexa"" which gives the impression you are speaking to a person when you very very much are not.I gotta say I kind of prefer the name ""ChatGPT"" that OpenAI went with. It doesn't try to pretend it's a human with it's naming and also describes what it is in it's name.

Plus: states and cities' calls for aid after extreme weather events are going unanswered 

This is today's edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what's going on in the world of technology.

Meet Cathy Tie, Bride of “China's Frankenstein”

Since the Chinese biophysicist He Jiankui was released from prison in 2022, he has sought to make a scientific comeback and to repair his reputation after a three-year incarceration for illegally creating the world's first gene-edited children.One area of visible success on his come-back trail has been his X.com account. Over the past few years, his account has evolved from sharing mundane images of his daily life to spreading outrageous, antagonistic messages. This has left observers unsure what to take seriously.Last month, in reply to MIT Technology Review's questions about who was responsible for the account's transformation into a font of clever memes, He emailed us back: “It's thanks to Cathy Tie.”

Tie is no stranger to the public spotlight. A former Thiel fellow, she is a partner in a project which promised to create glow-in-the-dark pets. Over the past several weeks, though, the Canadian entrepreneur has started to get more and more attention as the new wife to He Jiankui. Read the full story.

Anthropic's new hybrid AI model can work on tasks autonomously for hours at a time

Anthropic has announced two new AI models that it claims represent a major step toward making AI agents truly useful.

AI agents trained on Claude Opus 4, the company's most powerful model to date, raise the bar for what such systems are capable of by tackling difficult tasks over extended periods of time and responding more usefully to user instructions, the company says.

They've achieved some impressive results: Opus 4 created a guide for the video game Pokémon Red while playing it for more than 24 hours straight. The company's previously most powerful model was capable of playing for just 45 minutes. Read the full story.

The FDA plans to limit access to covid vaccines. Here's why that's not all bad.

This week, two new leaders at the US Food and Drug Administration announced plans to limit access to covid vaccines, arguing that there is not much evidence to support the value of annual shots in healthy people. New vaccines will be made available only to the people who are most vulnerable—namely, those over 65 and others with conditions that make them more susceptible to severe disease.The plans have been met with fear and anger in some quarters. But they weren't all that shocking to me. In the UK, where I live, covid boosters have been offered only to vulnerable groups for a while now. And the immunologists I spoke to agree: The plans make sense. Read the full story.

One more thing

The iPad was meant to revolutionize accessibility. What happened?On April 3, 2010, Steve Jobs debuted the iPad. What for most people was basically a more convenient form factor was something far more consequential for non-speakers: a life-­changing revolution in access to a portable, powerful communication device for just a few hundred dollars.But a piece of hardware, however impressively designed and engineered, is only as valuable as what a person can do with it. After the iPad's release, the flood of new, easy-to-use augmentative and alternative communication apps that users were in desperate need of never came.Today, there are only around half a dozen apps, each retailing for $200 to $300, that ask users to select from menus of crudely drawn icons to produce text and synthesized speech. It's a depressingly slow pace of development for such an essential human function. Read the full story.

Evidence-based medicine: good. Taking away vaccines from people who might benefit: not so much.

This week, two new leaders at the US Food and Drug Administration announced plans to limit access to covid vaccines, arguing that there is not much evidence to support the value of annual shots in healthy people. New vaccines will be made available only to the people who are most vulnerable—namely, those over 65 and others with conditions that make them more susceptible to severe disease.

Anyone else will have to wait. Covid vaccines will soon be required to go through more rigorous trials to ensure that they really are beneficial for people who aren't at high risk.

No vaccine is perfect, but these medicines are still saving millions of lives.

The plans have been met with fear and anger in some quarters. But they weren't all that shocking to me. In the UK, where I live, covid boosters have been offered only to vulnerable groups for a while now. And the immunologists I spoke to agree: The plans make sense.

They are still controversial. Covid hasn't gone away. And while most people are thought to have some level of immunity to the virus, some of us still stand to get very sick if infected. The threat of long covid lingers, too. Given that people respond differently to both the virus and the vaccine, perhaps individuals should be able to choose whether they get a vaccine or not.

I should start by saying that covid vaccines have been a remarkable success story. The drugs were developed at record-breaking speed—they were given to people in clinical trials just 69 days after the virus had been identified. They are, on the whole, very safe. And they work remarkably well. They have saved millions of lives. And they rescued many of us from lockdowns.

But while many of us have benefited hugely from covid vaccinations in the past, there are questions over how useful continuing annual booster doses might be. That's the argument being made by FDA head Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Both men have been critical of the FDA in the past. Makary has long been accused of downplaying the benefits of covid vaccines. He made incorrect assumptions about the coronavirus responsible for covid-19 and predicted that the disease would be “mostly gone” by April 2021. Most recently, he also testified in Congress that the theory that the virus came from a lab in China was a “no-brainer.” (The strongest evidence suggests the virus jumped from animals to humans in a market in Wuhan.)

Prasad has said “the FDA is a failure” and has called annual covid boosters “a public health disaster the likes of which we've never seen before,” because of a perceived lack of clinical evidence to support their use.

Makary and Prasad's plans, which were outlined in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday, don't include such inflammatory language or unfounded claims, thankfully. In fact, they seem pretty measured: Annual covid booster shots will continue to be approved for vulnerable people but will have to be shown to benefit others before people outside the approved groups can access them.

There are still concerns being raised, though. Let's address a few of the biggest ones.

At the moment, a lot of people in the US opt to get a covid vaccination around the time they get their annual flu jab. Each year, a flu vaccine is developed to protect against what scientists predict will be the dominant strain of virus circulating come flu season, which tends to run from October through March.

But covid doesn't seem to stick to the same seasonal patterns, says Susanna Dunachie, a clinical doctor and professor of infectious diseases at the University of Oxford in the UK. “We seem to be getting waves of covid year-round,” she says.

And an annual shot might not offer the best protection against covid anyway, says Fikadu Tafesse, an immunologist and virologist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. His own research suggests that leaving more than a year between booster doses could enhance their effectiveness. “One year is really a random time,” he says. It might be better to wait five or 10 years between doses instead, he adds.

“If you are at risk [of a serious covid infection] you may actually need [a dose] every six months,” says Tafesse. “But for healthy individuals, it's a very different conversation.”

There are reports that pediatricians are concerned about the impact on children, some of whom can develop serious cases of covid. “If we have safe and effective vaccines that prevent illness, we think they should be available,” James Campbell, vice chair of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told STAT.

Data show that older adults and people with underlying illness need the vaccine most.

This question has been on my mind for a while. My two young children, who were born in the UK, have never been eligible for a covid vaccine in this country. I found this incredibly distressing when the virus started tearing through child-care centers—especially given that at the time, the US was vaccinating babies from the age of six months.

My kids were eventually offered a vaccine in the US, when we temporarily moved there a couple of years ago. But by that point, the equation had changed. They'd both had covid by then. I had a better idea of the general risks of the virus to children. I turned it down.

I was relieved to hear that Tafesse had made the same decision for his own children. “There are always exceptions, but in general, [covid] is not severe in kids,” he says. The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunology found that the benefits of vaccination are much smaller for children than they are for adults.

“Of course there are children with health problems who should definitely have it,” says Dunachie. “But for healthy children in healthy households, the benefits probably are quite marginal.”

It's a good argument, says Tafesse. Research suggests that people who are vaccinated against covid-19 are less likely to end up transmitting the infection to the people around them. The degree of protection is not entirely clear, particularly with less-studied—and more contagious—variants of the virus and targeted vaccines. The safest approach is to encourage those at high risk to get the vaccine themselves, says Tafesse.

Tafesse doesn't buy this argument. “I know they are safe, but even if they're safe, why do I need to get one?” People should know if they are likely to benefit from a drug they are taking, he says.

Having said that, the cost-benefit calculation will differ between individuals. Even a “mild” covid infection can leave some people bed-bound for a week. For them, it might make total sense to get the vaccine.

Dunachie thinks people should be able to make their own decisions. “Giving people a top-up whether they need it or not is a safe thing to do,” she says.

It is still not entirely clear who will be able to access covid vaccinations under the new plans, and how. Makary and Prasad's piece includes a list of “medical conditions that increase a person's risk of severe covid-19,” which includes several disorders, pregnancy, and “physical inactivity.” It covers a lot of people; research suggests that around 25% of Americans are physically inactive.

But I find myself agreeing with Dunachie. Yes, we need up-to-date evidence to support the use of any drugs. But taking vaccines away from people who have experience with them and feel they could benefit from them doesn't feel like the ideal way to go about it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Meet Cathy Tie, Bride of “China's Frankenstein”","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/23/1117373/cathy-tie-he-jiankui-china-crispr-x-twitter-feed/","Fri, 23 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The creator of CRISPR babies is flirting again with infamy, this time through a mysterious alliance with an Internet-savvy entrepreneur.

Since the Chinese biophysicist He Jiankui was released from prison in 2022, he has sought to make a scientific comeback and to repair his reputation after a three-year incarceration for illegally creating the world's first gene-edited children. 

While he has bounced between cities, jobs, and meetings with investors, one area of visible success on his comeback trail has been his X.com account, @Jiankui_He, which has become his main way of spreading his ideas to the world. Starting in September 2022, when he joined the platform, the account stuck to the scientist's main themes, including promising a more careful approach to his dream of creating more gene-edited children. “I will do it, only after society has accepted it,” he posted in August 2024. He also shared mundane images of his daily life, including golf games and his family.

But over time, it evolved and started to go viral. First came a series of selfies accompanied by grandiose statements (“Every pioneer or prophet must suffer”). Then, in April of this year, it became particularly outrageous and even troll-like, blasting out bizarre messages (“Good morning bitches. How many embryos have you gene edited today?”). This has left observers unsure what to take seriously.

Last month, in reply to MIT Technology Review's questions about who was responsible for the account's transformation into a font of clever memes, He emailed us back: “It's thanks to Cathy Tie.”

You may not be familiar with Tie, but she's no stranger to the public spotlight. A former Thiel fellow, she is a partner in the attention-grabbing Los Angeles Project, which promised to create glow-in-the-dark pets. Over the past several weeks, though, the 29-year-old Canadian entrepreneur has started to get more and more attention as the new wife to (and apparent social media mastermind behind) He Jiankui. On April 15, He announced a new venture, Cathy Medicine, that would take up his mission of editing human embryos to create people resistant to diseases like Alzheimer's or cancer. Just a few days later, on April 18, He and Tie announced that they had married, posting pictures of themselves in traditional Chinese wedding attire.

But now Tie says that just a month after she married “the most controversial scientist in the world,” her plans to relocate from Los Angeles to Beijing to be with He are in disarray; she says she's been denied entry to China and the two “may never see each other again,” as He's passport is being held by Chinese authorities and he can't leave the country.

CRISPR will get easier and easier to administer. What does that mean for the future of our species?

Reached by phone in Manila, Tie said authorities in the Philippines had intercepted her during a layover on May 17 and told her she couldn't board a plane to China, where she was born and where she says she has a valid 10-year visa. She claims they didn't say why but told her she is likely “on a watch list.” (MIT Technology Review could not independently confirm Tie's account.) 

“While I'm concerned about my marriage, I am more concerned about what this means for humanity and the future of science,” Tie posted to her own X account.

The romance between He and Tie has been playing out in public over the past several weeks through a series of reveals on He's X feed, which had already started going viral late last year thanks to his style of posting awkward selfies alongside maxims about the untapped potential of heritable gene editing, which involves changing people's DNA when they're just embryos in an IVF dish. 

“Human [sic] will no longer be controlled by Darwin's evolution,” He wrote in March. That post, which showed him standing in an empty lab, gazing into the distance, garnered 9.7 million views. And then, a week later, he collected 13.3 million for this one: “Ethics is holding back scientific innovation and progress.” 

In April, the feed started to change even more drastically. 

He's posts became increasingly provocative, with better English and a unique sensibility reflecting online culture. “Stop asking for cat girls. I'm trying to cure disease,” the account posted on April 15. Two days later, it followed up: “I literally went to prison for this shit.” 

This shift coincided with the development of his romance with Tie. Tie told us she has visited China three times this year, including a three-week stint in April when she and He got married after a whirlwind romance. She bought him a silver wedding ring made up of intertwined DNA strands. 

The odd behavior on He's X feed and the sudden marriage have left followers wondering if they are watching a love story, a new kind of business venture, or performance art. It might be all three. 

A wedding photo posted by Tie on the Chinese social media platform Rednote shows the couple sitting at a table in a banquet hall, with a small number of guests. MIT Technology Review has been able to identify several people who attended: Cai Xilei, He's criminal attorney; Liu Haiyan, an investor and former business partner of He; and Darren Zhu, an artist and Thiel fellow who is making a “speculative” documentary about the biophysicist that will blur the boundaries of fiction and reality.

In the phone interview, Tie declined to say if she and He are legally married. She also confirmed she celebrated a wedding less than one year ago with someone else in California, in July of 2024, but said they broke up after a few months; she also declined to describe the legal status of that marriage. In the phone call, Tie emphasized that her relationship with He is genuine: “I wouldn't marry him if I wasn't in love with him.”

Years before Tie got into a relationship with He, she was getting plenty of attention in her own right. She became a Thiel fellow in 2015, when she was just 18. That program, started by the billionaire Peter Thiel, gave her a grant of $100,000 to drop out of the University of Toronto and start a gene testing company, Ranomics. 

Soon, she began appearing on the entrepreneur circuit as a “wunderkind” who was featured on a Forbes “30 Under 30” list in 2018 and presented as an up-and-coming venture capitalist on CNN that same year. In 2020, she started her second company, Locke Bio, which focuses on online telemedicine.

Like Thiel, Tie has staked out contrarian positions. She's called mainstream genomics a scam and described entrepreneurship as a way to escape the hidebound practices of academia and bioethics. “Starting companies is my preferred form of art,” she posted in 2022, linking to an interview on CNBC. 

By February 2025, Tie was ready to announce another new venture: the Los Angeles Project, a stealth company she had incorporated in 2023 under her legal name, Cheng Cheng Tie. The company, started with the Texas-based biohacker and artist Josie Zayner, says it will try to modify animal embryos; one goal is to make fluorescent glow-in-the-dark rabbits as pets.

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

The Los Angeles Project revels in explicitly transgressive aims for embryo editing, including a plan to add horn genes to horse embryos to make a unicorn. That's consistent with Zayner's past stunts, which include injecting herself with CRISPR during a livestream. “This is a company that should not exist,” Zayner said in announcing the newly public project.

Although the Los Angeles Project has only a tiny staff with uncertain qualifications, it did raise $1 million from the 1517 Fund, a venture group that supports “dropouts” and whose managers previously ran the Thiel Fellowship. 

Asked for his assessment of Tie, Michael Gibson, a 1517 partner, said in an email that he thinks Tie is “not just exceptional, but profoundly exceptional.” He sent along a list of observations he'd jotted down about Tie before funding her company, which approvingly noted her “hyper-fluent competence” and “low need for social approval,” adding: “Thoughts & actions routinely unconventional.” 

He first gained notoriety in 2018, when he and coworkers at the Southern University of Science & Technology in Shenzhen injected the CRISPR gene editor into several viable human embryos and then transferred these into volunteers, leading to the birth of three girls who he claimed would be resistant to HIV. A subsequent Chinese investigation found he'd practiced medicine illegally while “pursuing fame and fortune.” A court later sentenced him to three years in prison.

He has never apologized for his experiments, except to say he acted “too quickly” and to express regret for the trouble he'd caused his former wife and two daughters. (According to a leaked WeChat post by his ex-wife, she divorced him in 2024 “because of a major fault on his side.”)

Since his release from prison, He has sought to restart his research and convince people that he should be recognized as the “Chinese Darwin,” not “China's Frankenstein,” as the press once dubbed him. 

But his comeback has been bumpy. He lost a position at Wuchang University of Technology, a small private university in Hubei province, after some negative press. In February 2024, He posted that his application for funding from the Muscular Dystrophy Association was rejected. Last September, he even posted pictures of his torn shirt—which he said was the result of an assault by jealous rivals.

One area of clear success, though, was the growing reach of his X profile, which today has ballooned to more than 130,000 followers. And as his public profile rose, some started encouraging He to find ways to cash in. Andrew Hessel, a futurist and synthetic biologist active in US ethics debates, says he tried to get He invited to give a TED Talk. “His story is unique, and I wanted to see his story get more widespread attention, if only as a cautionary tale,” Hessel says. “I think he is a lightning rod for a generation of people working in life sciences.”

Here's what the country's big bet on robots might mean for the rest of the globe.

Later, Hessel says, he sent him information on how to join X's revenue-sharing program. “I said, ‘You have a powerful voice. Have you looked into monetization?'” Hessel says.

By last fall, He was also welcoming visitors to what he called a new lab in Beijing. One person who took him up on the offer was Steve Hsu, a Michigan State physics professor who has started several genetics companies and was visiting Beijing. 

They ended up talking for hours. Hsu says that He expressed a desire to move to the US and start a company, and that he shared his idea for conducting a clinical trial of embryo editing in South Africa, possibly for the prevention of HIV. 

Hsu says he later arranged an invitation for He to give a lecture in the United States. “You are a little radioactive, but things are opening up,” Hsu told him. But He declined the offer because the Chinese government is holding his passport—a common tactic it uses to restrict the movement of sensitive or high-profile figures—and won't return it to him. “He doesn't even know why. He literally doesn't know,” says Hsu. “According to the law, they should give it back to him.”

Despite any plans by He and Tie to advance the idea, creating designer babies is currently illegal in most of the world, including China and the US. Some experts, however, fret that forbidding the technology will only drive it underground and make it attractive to biohackers or scientists outside the mainstream. 

That's one reason Tie's simultaneous connection to two notable biotech renegades—He and Zayner—is worth watching. “There is clearly a triangle forming in some way,” says Hessel.

With Tie stuck outside China and He being kept inside the country, their new gene-editing venture, Cathy Medicine, faces an uncertain future. Tie posted previously on Rednote that she was “helping Dr. He open up the U.S. market” and was planning to return to the US with him for scientific research. But when we spoke on the phone, she declined to disclose their next steps and said their predicament means the project is “out of the window now.”

Even as the couple remain separated, their social media game is stronger than ever. As she waited in Manila, Tie sought help from friends, followers, and the entire internet. She blasted out a tweet to “crypto people,” calling them “too pussy to stand up for things when it matters.” Within hours, someone had created a memecoin called $GENE as a way for the public to support the couple. 

On May 20, Tie posted on X claiming that the amount donated to them is now worth almost $2 million. “I may need to retract my last statement about crypto,” she wrote. 

He's X account also retweeted to express support: “I only want to reunite with my wife @CathyTie, and continue my gene editing research.” He added the hashtag $GENE. 

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI.

Even during a huge tech sale event like Memorial Day Weekend, this portable charger from Anker really should cost more than the mere $35 you can get it for at Best Buy. But if that's how low they're willing to go on the 20,000 mAh Anker Power Bank, which brings 30W of charge to your laptop, smartphone, or tablet, who are we to say no?

The Anker Power Bank is all about portability, down to the ingenious wrist loop that doubles as the USB-C cord you use to charge your device or recharge the Power Bank. The 6-inch length probably disqualifies it from being called pocket-sized, but it's a little under 3 inches wide and just an inch thick, and weighs in at just 1 pound. If you don't have a reliable charger in your travel bag for your summer trip plans, this is the one you want.

See at Best Buy

The Anker Power Bank has two USB-C ports, one of which does double-duty as the input port to recharge the Power Bank, and one USB-A port. All of your tech gear from your smartwatch up to your laptop can get a rapid and reliable top-off wherever and whenever you need it.

It's also a safe charge for your devices, since the Power Bank is equipped with Anker's intelligent temperature monitoring system to prevent your devices from being damaged by overheating, keeping them at least 10 percent cooler than international safety standards, and also keep the Power Bank itself from becoming overly hot to the touch.

The Anker Power Bank is also platform-agnostic — your Apple devices and MacBooks will charge just as readily as a Samsung smartphone or Galaxy Buds, Google devices, or most other leading brands.

See at Best Buy

The USB-C cord that doubles as the wrist loop to carry the Anker Power Bank is one of our favorite perks. The cord snaps securely into the innovative holder that attaches to the Power Bank so it doesn't break free from your wrist, yet the cord is also very easily removed from the holder for use. Another great perk — never losing your cord.

The regular retail price of $46 was already a great deal for a compact 30W portable charger that's made to power up devices large and small and across brands and platforms, but this Best Buy offer dropping the price to just $35 makes this one of the better Memorial Day Weekend deals to cash in on. Head to Best Buy now to buy the Anker Power Bank in person, or order it online.

When you put your hand out the window of a moving car, you feel a force pushing against you called drag. This force opposes a moving vehicle, and it's part of the reason why your car naturally slows to a stop if you take your foot off the gas pedal. But drag doesn't just slow down cars.

Aerospace engineers are working on using the drag force in space to develop more fuel-efficient spacecraft and missions, deorbit spacecraft without creating as much space junk, and even place probes in orbit around other planets.

Space is not a complete vacuum—at least not all of it. Earth's atmosphere gets thinner with altitude, but it has enough air to impart a force of drag on orbiting spacecraft, even up to about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers).

As an aerospace engineering professor, I study how drag affects the movement of spacecraft in orbit. Aerobraking, as the name suggests, is a type of maneuver that uses the thin air in space to apply a drag force in the direction opposite to a spacecraft's motion, much like braking in a car.

In space, aerobraking can change the orbit of a spacecraft while minimizing the use of its propulsion system and fuel. Spacecraft that orbit around Earth do so in two types of orbits: circular and elliptical. In a circular orbit, the spacecraft is always at the same distance from the center of the Earth. As a result, it's always moving at the same speed. An elliptical orbit is stretched, so the distance from Earth− and the speed the craft moves at− changes as the spacecraft travels along the orbit.

The closest point in an elliptical orbit around Earth, where the satellite or spacecraft is moving fastest, is called the perigee. The farthest point, where it's moving slowest, is called the apogee.

The general idea behind aerobraking is to start in a large circular orbit and maneuver the spacecraft into a highly elliptical orbit, so that the lowest point in the orbit− the perigree− lies in the denser part of the upper atmosphere. For Earth, that's between about 62 and 310 miles (100 and 500 kilometers), with the choice depending on time required to complete the orbit change.

As the spacecraft passes through this lowest point, the air exerts a drag force on it, which reduces the stretch of the orbit over time. This force pulls the craft toward a circular orbit smaller than the original orbit.

The first maneuver to put the spacecraft in an elliptical orbit so that drag can take effect does require using a propulsion system and some fuel. But once it's in the elliptical orbit, drag from the atmosphere slows the craft, and it doesn't need to use much, if any, fuel.

Aerobraking brings a craft from a large orbit to a small orbit and is not reversible− it can't increase the size of an orbit. Increasing the size of an orbit or raising the spacecraft to a higher orbit requires propulsion and fuel.

A common case where spacecraft controllers use aerobraking is when changing the craft's orbit from a geostationary orbit− GEO− to a low Earth orbit, LEO. A GEO orbit is a circular orbit with an altitude of roughly 22,236 miles (35,786 km). In GEO, the spacecraft makes one orbit around Earth in 24 hours, so the spacecraft always stays above the same point on Earth's surface.

Before aerobraking, the spacecraft's onboard propulsion system thrusts in the opposite direction of the GEO orbit's motion. This thrust puts it into an elliptical orbit. The craft passes through the atmosphere multiple times, which eventually circularizes the orbit.

Once it makes it to LEO, the spacecraft may need to use a little bit of fuel to propel itself up into its target orbit. Usually, the lowest point of the original elliptical orbit is lower than the final target circular orbit.

This process is conceptually similar to how the U.S. Space Force's X-37B used aerobraking in early 2025. The U.S. Space Force reported that its unmanned spaceplane, X-37B, used aerobraking. This test demonstrated the craft's agility and maneuverability.

Another application for aerobraking is to make a spacecraft deorbit− or reenter the atmosphere− after it has stopped working. This way, the company or agency can dispose of the spacecraft and avoid creating space junk, since it will burn up in the lower atmosphere.

A few Mars missions, including the Mars reconnaissance orbiter and the Mars Odyssey orbiter, have used aerobraking to reach their target orbits around the red planet.

For interplanetary missions like these, scientists use aerobraking in conjunction with the craft's onboard propulsion system. When a spacecraft arrives at Mars, it does so in a hyperbolic orbit.

Unlike a circular or an elliptical orbit, the spacecraft's path in hyperbolic orbit won't keep it orbiting around Mars. Instead, it would fly through and depart Mars− unless it uses thrust from its propulsion system to get “captured” into a closed elliptical orbit.

As the spacecraft arrives at Mars, the onboard propulsion system fires to provide the force necessary to capture the spacecraft into a highly elliptical orbit around Mars. Once captured, scientists use aerobraking over several orbital passes through the atmosphere to achieve the final orbit, generally a circular one.

Aerobraking maneuvers can result in significant fuel savings. As humans get closer to landing on the surface of the red planet, the fuel savings enabled by aerobraking could save mass and allow each spacecraft headed to Mars to take more supplies.

In the grand arc of space exploration, aerobraking is not just a maneuver. It has a crucial role to play in the future of space operations and planetary missions and colonization.

Birds continue to be amazing. Crows can use tools and hold grudges against specific people. Magpies can recognize themselves in mirrors. And now, hawks are using traffic signals to hunt down prey, according to a study published today in the journal Frontiers in Ethology. 

The story starts with Vladimir Dinets, a zoologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and the study's author, and an intersection in West Orange, New Jersey, near his home. As a zoologist, he had long been interested in animals' perspective on and understanding of urban environments—and in birds' relationship with cars, in particular. Scientists have previously observed ravens patrol American highways waiting for roadkill and songbirds using cars to hide from predators.

Dinets was on the lookout for these interesting interactions when a young Cooper's hawk migrated into his neighborhood and started doing something brilliant.

The intersection wasn't particularly busy, even during rush hour, Dinets wrote in a guest editorial for Frontiers in Ethology. But sometimes, a pedestrian would cross the street, causing cars to pile up all the way to a small, bushy tree down the block. The pedestrian “walk” signal would also make a sound that indicated it was time to walk.

One morning, Dinets saw the hawk emerge from the tree, fly very low above the line of cars, cross the street between the cars, and then dive to get something near one of the houses.

Then the same thing happened again. And again.

It turns out that the family that lived in that house near the bushy tree liked to have dinner in their front yard. In response, birds—like sparrows and doves—would flock there to claim the leftover crumbs.

That made for easy pickings for the hawk, who would swoop down into the yard to catch said sparrows and doves. But, curiously, the hawk only did this when cars were lined up along the block all the way to the tree.

Dinets eventually figured out that the line of cars provided cover for the hawk, and that the hawk had learned to recognize the sound of the pedestrian “walk” signal. As soon as a pedestrian pressed the button, the hawk would fly from wherever it had been hanging out and into the small, bushy tree. It would then wait for cars to pile up before using the line of cars as cover to sneak up on its prey.

The hawk had, apparently, learned to use the pedestrian signal as a cue to start heading over to the house crowded with defenseless birds, according to Dinets.

“That meant that the hawk understood the connection between the sound and the eventual car queue length,” Dinets explained. The hawk also apparently had a good mental map of the neighborhood.

The hawk (or what Dinets thinks was the same hawk) returned the next year and used the same strategy to hunt. Eventually, though, the family moved away and the signal stopped working, so Dinets hasn't seen any super smart hawks hunting near his home since.

Life is tough for birds in cities—they have to avoid windows, weave through cars, and deal with noise. But this study shows at least one way that they've adapted to urban living.

“I think my observations show that Cooper's hawks manage to survive and thrive there, at least in part, by being very smart,” Dinets wrote.

Eric Kripke teases the deaths to come in The Boys‘ final season. The next Evil Dead movie adds a few more mystery cast members. Plus, showrunner Terry Matalas teases where Vision Quest sits in the MCU timeline. Spoilers, away!



Reacher‘s Alan Ritchson will star in the next movie from Minecraft writers Neil Widener and Gavin James at Skydance, an action-adventure described as “Memento meets Raiders of the Lost Ark.”

Deadline reports Hunter Doohan (Wednesday), Luciane Buchanan (The Night Agent), and Tandi Wright (Pearl) have joined the cast of Evil Dead Burn in undisclosed roles. 

Deadline also has word Patrick Gibson (Dexter: Original Sin) has joined the cast of Jaume Collet-Serra's mysterious next film, Play Dead.

Toxie takes on an environmentally destructive “monstercore” band in a gory new teaser for The Toxic Avenger.

 

Disney has also released a new trailer for Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires.

A K-Pop group must stop demons from stealing the souls of their adoring fans in the trailer for KPop Demon Hunters, coming to Netflix this June 20.

According to Deadline, Josh Hartnett is attached to star in a currently untitled series at Netflix as “a hard-bitten fisherman [who] must fight to protect his family, his community, and his vanishing way of life” from “a mysterious sea creature” terrorizing Newfoundland. Black Mirror‘s Jessica Rhoades will co-produce the new series alongside Hartnett, himself.

During a recent appearance on Katee Sackhoff's podcast, showrunner Terry Matalas offered a brief tease of when Vision Quest will be set.

The timeline is definitely navigated. At the end of WandaVision, the original Vision was rebuilt and weaponized, and then had a moment of discovery and acceptance of who he was. Then [he] flew off… [Vision Quest] is following that character, and that character's journey.

 

Speaking to Deadline, showrunner Eric Kripke teases plenty of carnage to come in the show's final season.

There will probably be lots of death… there's no guarantee of who's gonna survive.

Finally, Summer gets bullied in a new clip from Rick and Morty‘s eighth season.

It's the final day of Computex 2025, and things are winding down here. We'll still be bringing you updates, pictures from the floor, and more, and some recaps of all the biggest and best announcements.

In the meantime, sit back, relax, and wind down with us as we close out another year of Computex.

With Computex 2025 wrapped up, we turn our attention to Memorial Day sales. It's a great time to score some new hardware at bargain prices, and the deals are already coming thick and fast. Here are some of the highlights so far!



Over at Antec's booth, we saw the Vortex View AIO cooler, which features a 360 mm radiator and a 5-inch display. While screens have been popping up on a lot of cooling pumps, this one stands out; the large screen is connected to the pump via a ball joint, allowing you to rotate it and angle it exactly how you want. It even gives you the option to place it either horizontally or vertically.The cooler works with both Intel and AMD processors, including LGA 1851, LGA 1700, AM4, and AM5 sockets.

Computex 2025 is coming to a close. Its organizers have announced that next year's show will run from June 2 - June 5, 2026.



This year's show started on May 20, a bit earlier than usual. Next year, it's returning to a more standard timeframe.That gives you about a year to come up with your Computex 2026 bingo card. And for our intrepid editors on the ground to recover from the jet lag.

— Andrew E. Freedman



Our favorite RAM module from Computex is this V-Color Xfinity Manta DDR5 RAM that features a full-color LCD screen you can use to show stats like voltages, clock speeds, and more.



Thermaltake's MineCube 360 is a 360mm AIO cooler with a 720 x 720 resolution screen that will show you delightful Minecraft screens.



Another incredible monitor we saw this year is the 610 Hz overclocked Asus ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG, sporting 1080p resolution.



MSI's X50 Gaming Monitor is a QD-OLED panel with a 500Hz refresh rate and 1440p resolution, and even has an AI sensor than can power down the panel when it senses you've walked off.



Lian Li's $110 case has two glass panels, touch controls, and a massive 8.8-inch screen embedded in the bottom chamber.



Cooler Master's case line-up stands out so much we have the whole lot an award. Each should cost less than $100, even the eye-catching curved glass models.



The ROG Falcata is a split layout gaming keyboard with HFX V2 magnetic switches, and our limited hands on time had us massively intrigued.



Seasonic's Prime Power Supplies feature sensors to detect voltage problems and even shut down your system to prevent damage, overheating, and dreaded melting connectors.



A highlight of the whole show and massive hit with our readers, SilverStone's FLP02 is a throwback case that even has faux floppy drives on the front.



Corsair's Air 5400 case is an eye-catching design with a triple-chamber layout that dumps CPU heat directly out of the case via a 360mm AIO radiator.



The Triton 14 AI weighs 3.5 pounds and features a 14.5-inch 2880 x 1800 OLED screen. Under the hood there's a Lunar Lake Core Ultra 9 288V CPU with RTX 5070 graphics.



The new T710 promises 28 percent read speed increases and 42 percent faster write speeds over the T705, the best SSD for speeds right now.



Asus wins for this creative take on the RTX 5080, accented with wood in a way that makes the card really stand out. After a week filled with wooden cases, a wooden GPU housing is a breath of fresh air.



Phison's new E28 SSD controller delivers big efficiency gains thanks to a 6nm process note, but still delivers 14.8 GB/s of sequential read/write performance and 2.5 / 3.0 million random read/write IOPS. A wave of E28-powered SSDs are expected later this year.



The new AMD RX 9060 XT starts at $299 for the 8GB version, or $349 for the 16GB model. It has Navi 44 architecture and even beats the RX 9070 in boost clock speed (3,130 MHz). Could this be the value GPU of 2025 we've been waiting for?



The new AMD Ryzen Threadripper 9000 Series is here. The flagship Ryzen 9 9995WX boasts 96 cores and 192 threads, with peak boost clocks of 5.4GHz and 300W TDP.

Computex is in the books, and it's the moment you've all been waiting for. Let's take a look at our winners in the Tom's Hardware Best of Computex 2025 Awards. Starting with AMD...



If 3,000W is a little over your requirements, how about this Lian Li offering with a rotatable power outlet for maximum flexibility...



3,000 W power supplies are taking over Computex. First we saw a 3,000 Asus PSU earlier in the week. Then we saw two from Super Flower.



Maxsun has unveiled one of its wildest graphics card yet, a concept RTX 50-series with liquid cooling and a full RGB LED shroud.

Good morning and welcome to the final day of Computex 2025 live from Taipei. Things are winding down here, so stay tuned for some more floor shots, recaps, and our awards.



Worried about where to mount the power supply in your case? Lian Li's new RS series has you covered. The power supplies have outlets that can rotate, allowing you to put them in from either the back or the side.

These power supplies also have dual 24-in and 8-pin connectors on the front and left so you can choose to plug in from either location. There's also a mount below the rear connector set (CPU, PCIe, SATA connectors) that can hold a bundled USB hub.

The hub has both USB and fan controller ports so you can plug internal devices and coolers into it.

How does nearly a petabyte of storage sound to you? Although I'm probably going to sound like the 640K remark often (and probably mistakenly) associated with Bill Gates, I don't think I could ever come close to filling the 976GB of storage that's possible with the HighPoint RocketStor 6542AW.



Even though the RocketStor 6542AW is relatively compact (measuring 9.25 x 927 x 4.84 inches), it is home to eight 2.5-inch NVMe bays with hot-swap support. If you're considering throwing in garden variety M.2 SSDs, slow your roll; it only supports U.2 and U.3 SSDs. To demonstrate the full power of the RocketStor 6542AW, Highpoint installed Solidigm D5-P5336 122TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs. Each SSD is rated for 7,400 MB/s reads and 3,200 MB/s writes. Although the external storage has a CDFP port that offers sustained transfer rates of up to 32 GB/s, the D5-P5336 SSDs are limited to “just” 28 GB/s.

If you want a RocketStor 6542AW, the price for the external storage solution is $1,799. However, if you max out at 976GB, you'll need to add eight Solidigm D5-P5336 priced at roughly $16,000 each.



Zotac has taken the covers off its new Zone 2 handheld, replete with a 7-inch AMOLED display and AMD Ryzen AI HX 370 APU. While we expect this to be the second iteration of its Zone handheld, it's officially a prototype at this stage and there's no pricing or launch info.



Enermax's immersion-cooled workstation can support four Nvidia RTX 5090s and up to 3,300 watts of power, using two-phase liquid immersion to keep temperatures under control. It looks incredible and surely performs, but the privilege will cost you $50,000 before you add any components.

Thermal Grizzly has unveiled a new bench table made in partnership with overclocking royalty der8auer. The ""der8enchtable"" is a modular, user-friendly benchtable is designed to facilitate fast and efficient PC hardware testing. Maybe we should get one of those...





Seems like everyone is adding wood to their PC components these days, and the latest manufacturer to jump on the trend is Zalman with its new ATX and micro-ATX cases.



Tryx's new Arcvision case features an embedded, curved display in the lower-left corner. The panoramic illusion is some of the most impressive stuff we've seen in case innovation at this year's event!



Seasonic has unveiled new Prime power supplies that seek to solve overheating and melting power connectors by using sensors, a microcontroller, and firmware to keep on top of things, letting you monitor voltage output and current, as well as shutting down the system automatically if things get out of hand.



New technology from AMD brings a major update to FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR). Dubbed Redstone, it has new features it hopes to rival Nvidia's DLSS using three new features: neural radiance caching, machine learning ray regeneration, and machine learning frame generation.



MSI has unveiled plenty of new incredible tech at Computex, but the pick of the bunch might be the return of its iconic TwinFrozer and Cyclone cooling platforms, which have been deployed on a new RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060, respectively.

Good morning and welcome to Thursday live from Taipei, it's a little after five local time and we've been pacing the trade floor. Stephen here for the next eight hours to take you through everything we've find. But first, we'll catch you up on what you may have missed overnight.

As usual, Thermaltake's booth was filled with case mods from some of the leading modders. The company hosts an invitational where artists from around the world turn its cases into all kinds of neat things. This year, the Black Myth Wukong case was the most impressive.

Here's what we saw.



Look at this! It's almost as good as having a Chicken Jockey ride on top of your CPU.

Thermaltake has a Minecraft-themed, 360mm AIO cooler on display at its booth and it's called the Minecube 360 ARGB. The cooler has four, 3.95-inch displays surrounding the pump. In the display, each of these had a Minecraft scene, but it seems like you could put any image you want on there.

The 360mm radiator has three Thermaltake SWAFAN EX12 ARGB fans on it that use magnetic quick connections and daisy-chain together. The entire thing is controlled by TT RGB software.

We don't have more details about the Minecube so we don't know the pricing or availability. We also don't know if it comes with any addition Minecraft-themed parts. One of the two units on display had some plastic Minecraft trees and blocks on the case, but we don't know if they come with the cooler.



The next-gen of Seasonic Prime power supplies will have a feature that deals with the problem of melting 12VHPWR connectors. As you may know, many people with RTX 40 and 50 series cards have had problems with melting connectors because their 12VHPWR connectors weren't plugged in properly. Then the GPU calls for an unbalanced power load and the cables melt and disaster ensues.

At Computex, Seasonic showed a prototype PSU with a set of sensors that alerts PC users of a malfunction if there's an abnormal voltage output. There will be an external device that connects to the PSU and shows this alert. The PSU will also power down to prevent melting. The PSUs with this tech, unfortunately, aren't due out until 2026.



Many of us use AIO (All-in-One) coolers that have a pump on top of the CPU that circulates coolant through a radiator where a fan blows the heat away. At Computex, Noctua is showing off a different kind of AIO, one without a pump at all.

Noctua's protoype thermosiphon cooler has liquid on top of the CPU where the heat from the CPU causes the coolant to boil. When the coolant turns into a gas it naturally moves through the pump up to the radiator where it is cooled and turns back into a liquid again.

Once it's a liquid again, the coolant flows downward back to the water block on top of the CPU and the cycle continues. Noctua is demonstrating this with a 360mm radiator.

So what's the point? By eliminating the pump, you cut the noise. Is the noise from your AIO's pump significant? I guess it depends on the product and how sensitive you are to noise and how much other noise there is in your system. Even the thermosiphon cooler still needs fans (3x 120mm fans actually).



A new range of cases and more from Lian Li reveal that the company is embracing tempered glass on its front panels, eschewing the mesh that has served it well in previous years.

We got a look at the new Lancool 4, Lancool 217 INF, O11D Mini V2, DAN Case B4, Vector V100, and Vector V200 cases, along with the HydroShift III AIO.



be quiet! showed off the latest it has to offer including new keyboards, coolers, and PC cases. There are awesome new wooden bases for the 900 series, and an upgrade to the Pure Loop 3.

Every trade show seems to have its own shop of overpriced merch. I've seen them at CES, GTC, IFA, and elsewhere, and never really been tempted to buy anything – until today. When I arrived at the Nangan Convention Center this morning, a half hour before the trade show opened to press, I wandered down the narrow entrance area, looking for the giant inflatable Guai Guai bag that's typically there every year. What I found was not only the big bag advertising the tech-protecting snacks, but a whole table of Guai Guai-themed merchandise. And I knew instantly that I couldn't walk away without buying something – or, more likely, some things.



But the shop wasn't open yet, so a couple of hours later, when I had a half hour between meetings, I returned and snapped up a green glass coffee mug, two omamori magnets (the actual omamoris were sadly already sold out), and a small travel bag. At checkout, I was also given a bag of Computex 2025 Guai Guai and a foldable fan as free gifts with my purchase.



Was it the most sensible 2,644 NTD I've ever spent? Probably not. But I knew if walked away from this very specific trade show swag, that I would regret it. And hey, who couldn't use something else in their lives these days that “keeps everything alright?”If I make it back to Computex next year, I'll consider that a success for my lucky Guai Guai Computex swag. But if I am here again in a year (Computex 2026 is scheduled to run from June 2-5), maybe I'll skip the Computex shop for the sake of my wallet.–Matt Safford



We got a demo of Phison's Apex RAID setup, and it did not disappoint. Using 32 new PCIe Gen 5 SSDs in a RAID configuration, they clocked read and write speeds of 113.6 GB/s and 104.6 GB/s, respectively...



New from Zotac at Computex is this low-profile RTX 5060. They carry the same GPU and VRAM as the full-sized boards, but offer only three display outputs and a neat single-fan setup.

The Nvidia CEO dropped by and added his mark to the flagship ZOTAC Gaming GeForce RTX 50 Series on display:

A new innovation from V-Color adds a programmable LCD screen to its DDR5 DIMM modules. According to V-Color, the screen can be used to display information like capacity, speed bin, temperature, and voltage, all controlled through the company's app. The screen is on the side, so there are some obvious limitations, including how much capacity the format supports, but it still tops out at 48GB and also features programmable RGB LEDs.



The highlight overnight was the AMD keynote. The company unveiled its new Radeon RX 9060 XT and Ryzen Threadripper 9000, as well as the new Radeon AI Pro R9700, a PCIe 5.0 GPU for workstations and pro users.

The new RX 9060 XT launches on June 5, priced at $299, priced squarely in the firing line of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 which launched earlier this week.



The AMD livestream broke before the keynote finished, but you can catch up on all of our coverage up to that point as it happened.

Day 2 is well underway here in Taipei and we have got a packed schedule to bring you. Stephen here taking you through the next eight hours, but first, a look at some of the things you may have missed overnight...



AMD's Jack Huynh, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics, is delivering the company's Computex keynote. He started his presentation by talking about gaming and FSR. We're blogging the whole event at a separate AMD Computex live blog.



Adata is known for its SSDs and RAM, particularly under the XPG gaming sub-brand. Now the company is launching a new sub-brand aimed at enterprise customers.

Trusta (we guess they want you to trust it) will launch with two SSD lines: the T7 and the T5. We covered these in greater detail in our article about Trusta.

The T7P5, Trusta's flagship SSD, boasts sequential read and write speeds of 13,500 and 10,400 MB/s and uses either a U.2 interface or connects via E3.S or E1.S, all enterprise standards.

The T5 series has the T5P4B, T5S3B and T5S3 models. These connect weither via PCIe Gen 4 M.2 or 2.5-ich SATA connections.



At Computex, Thermaltake is showing off its latest cases, which have Nordic, wood-grain accents. You could almost say that it's like going to Ikea, but hopefully with much easier building.

The new designs are available on several case lines, including the Tower 600, TR100, View 380/ 380 XL, View 270 and View 170 lines. The wood accents are either in light or dark wood.

No word yet on exact pricing or availability.



As we talked about in our article on TeamGroup's new Computex offerings, the company is showing a new SSD cooler that uses Peltier technology aka thermoelectric cooling. The company says that its AI-Flow X cooler will offer better cooling thanks to both this technology and to AI.



This looks very promising, but thermoelectric cooling has been known to have some drawbacks, such as generating heat. We'll have to see how this implementation fares.



Earlier this week, we reported about the Crucial T710 SSD, which uses an SMI SM2508 SSD controller and boasts 2.2 million and 2.3 million read and write IOPS respectively. However, Phison seems ready to power drives which could close the T710 out of the water, thanks to its E28 controller.

We just reported that the Phison E28 controller promises 3 million read IOPS and 2.6 million write IOPS. That's along with 14.8 GB/s and 14 GB/s sequential reads and writes.

The controller is made using TSMC's 6nm process and it supports up to 32GB of TLC NAND. The E28 also boasts an eight channel layout that runs at 4200 MT/s and support for AES-256, TCG Opal and Pyrite encryption.



We visited Phison at Computex 2025 and grabbed a picture of a test system running CrystalDiskMark. In the pic above, you can see that the sample drive on display returned a 14,942 MB/s sequential read and a 14,149 MB/s write.



New from Corsair, the Air 5400 is the company's first triple-chamber design that can accomodate up to 360mm AIO cooling solutions, dumping the heat from the CPU directly out of the case.



One definite sleeper announcement from Computex 2025 is Elgato's new Virtual Stream Deck app, which lets you turn any device into a Stream Deck...

The new Cooler Master MasterFrame 360 Panoramic is more fish tank than PC case, with a three-sided glass design that gives you unparalleled viewing of your internal hardware. There's also a new budget version of the QUBE 500, and more...



Keeping on top of time zones during Computex is always a challenge - next on the agenda is AMD, who will host their Computex livestream and keynote tonight/tomorrow. It kicks off at 11 am UTC+8 on May 21, or 11 pm ET on May 20 if you're stateside. You can watch along over on YouTube!

NZXT has revealed not one but two stunning new cases, the H9 Flow and the H3 Flow. The former is a dual-chamber chassis with built-in fans and a controller hub, while the H3 is a Micro-ATX case. Despite this, it still features capacity for 10 fans!

MSI drops some insane gaming laptop artwork:

Alongside three others, Cherry has unveiled its brand new IK inductive switch, using patented inductive sensing technology it claims yields no mechanical wear and 50% less power consumption than magnetic switches.



Hyte's 2025 offering is a new X50 computer case that stands out thanks to its loud, vibrant colorway and design language reminiscent of a Smeg fridge. Check out the full details...



The new Asus Pro Workstation is a 3000W power supply capable of powering four Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 cards by itself. It's so powerful you can even plug it into a standard U.S. outlet...

InWin is celebrating 40 years with this insane ChronoMancy case. It looks a bit like a prosthetic leg, is over 1 meter tall, and opens up like Iron Man's suit when you wave a magic wand at it. Standard...

The Asus Ascent GX10 costs around $2,999 for the privilege of Nvidia GB10 packed into a tiny form factor. How much the markup is on this one is anyone's guess...

Razer has unveiled its new Blade 14 laptop at Computex. Sporting the Nvidia RTX 50-series (either the 5060 or 5070), it's the thinnest-ever Razer laptop of this size. There's also a new 5060 option for the larger Razer Blade 16.



Good morning and welcome back to day two (one) of Computex 2025! Stephen here for the next eight hours, keeping you posted with everything going on at Computex, including live insight from the floor here in Taipei! While you were sleeping, here's what you missed...

Teamgroup is known for its radical cooling concepts that it demos at Computex every year, and 2025 is no exception. This year the company had a triple-M.2 all-in-one liquid cooler for those of you that simply can't cram enough storage into your rig. The company also had a new dual M.2 SSD and CPU cooler on display, too. Yes, the cooled liquid flows from the rad to the SSD first, thus preventing it from getting pre-heated liquid flowing from the CPU.



At the moment, the Crucial T705 is the fastest consumer SSD on the market, hitting random reads and writes of 1.55 and 1.8M IOPS respectively. However, today at Computex, Crucial announced its successor, the T710 which promises to be 28 percent faster in reads and 42 faster in writes.

We have a full article with lots of details on the Crucial T710 right here.



The T710 will be available at an undetermined price in 1TB, 2TB, 4TB and 8TB capacities. It will come with and without a heatsink. The heatsink itself will be a slim 11mm thick.

The drive is one-sided and also promises low enough power to work well in a laptop, without massively draining the battery. It uses an SMI SM2508 SSD controller and 276-layer G9 TLC NAND to achieve these results.



Wood grain trim isn't usually associated with PC components, let alone graphics cards. But that's exactly what we have in store with the Asus RTX 50 Series ProArt series. All the graphics cards have a wood grain finish for the fan shroud, giving them a classy look over the more exhaustive use of RGB that we see in many high-end graphics cards.

But it goes beyond the wooden aesthetics; all four members of the ProArt RTX 5080 family include USB-C ports for connecting monitors of peripherals to offer “better versatility for content creation workflows.” The ProArt GeForce RTX 5080 OC goes one step further by including an M.2 slot for plugging in an SSD.

If you're looking for a top-performing graphics card that offers more than just good looks as a side dish, the ProArt family seems like a good option to pursue – that is, if Asus can keep pricing in check.

The ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG is the latest among the growing trend of 500 Hz+ gaming monitors. Asus is targeting the 24.1-inch ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG at the esports gaming crowd, and you'll need one of the best graphics cards for gaming to get the most out of its insane 610 Hz refresh rate.

While Asus touts the 610 Hz refresh rate, it is achievable through overclocking – the panel has a native refresh rate of 600 Hz. Another thing to note is that this monitor uses a TN panel. TN panels aren't known for their prowess in color reproduction, brightness, or viewing angles. However, Asus says that the ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG uses the latest iteration of its “Super TN” panel to combat some inherent deficiencies; notably improved color and boosted brightness levels (up to 370 nits).



Although the ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG doesn't have RGB lighting effects that we typically expect from ROG products, it does have an attractive design, and is adjustable for height, tilt, and swivel. As for connectivity, you'll get DisplayPort 1.4, two HDMI 2.1 ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.

The RTX 5060 (and the long-awaited RTX 5060 driver) are now here, as is Asus' new RTX 5060 laptop lineup.



Computex 2025 isn't all motherboards and silicon; here are some snaps of the locale here in Taipei.



Check out ASUS' new Noctua triple-fan RTX 5080, as well as it's new external GPU dock, which we've been having a look at over on the floor.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says there is no evidence of AI chip diversion to blacklisted nations, in response to questions at Computex. Huang said countries and companies understand the rules and want to continue doing business with Nvidia.



As promised, MSI has unveiled its new EdgeXpert MS-C931 supercomputer, powered by Nvidia DGX Spark and capable of 1,000 TOPS FP4 performance.

Nvidia announced at Computex that it would be working with Foxconn to build an AI supercomputer in Taiwan featuring 10,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.

Alongside the aforementioned new Intel Arc Pro offerings, there's a brand new partner card from Maxsun that jams two Arc Pro B60 chips onto a single graphics card, replete with 48GB of total VRAM, or 96GB in a two-card configuration.





MSI's new X50 is a QD-OLED monitor and a 500 Hz refresh rate, but the headline is actually its new AI Care Sensor, which can detect when you're not looking at the monitor, powering down accordingly to reduce burn-in.

Intel has just unveiled its brand new Arc Pro B50, a compact graphics card for workstations with 16GB of VRAM and a starting price of $299. There's also a new Pro B60 with a hefty 24GB with a price tag of roughly $500 per unit.





We've all seen broken McDonald's order consoles running Windows 98 or some other such monstrosity, but how about this Computex display board that appears to have malfunctioned, revealing Windows 7 underneath.



Samsung has announced that it is finally adding support for Nvidia G-Sync in its 2025 OLED TV lineup, starting with the S95F.

Acer has unveiled the new Nitro PG271K monitor, featuring 4K at 72Hz, with DFR for 1080p at 144Hz, 0.5ms response time (GTG), USB-C, and HDMI ports.

There's also a new 32-inch ProCreator and a new portable PD163QT. Gamers will love the new Nitro GA341CUR W0, a 34-inch UWQHD display with a 240Hz refresh rate.

Morning folks, Stephen here picking up the live blog until 1pm ET - we're all over the Computex trade floor bringing you the latest insights and news, so stay tuned!



One of Nvidia's biggest announcements at Computex 2025 is a new NVLink Fusion program which allows customers and partners to use NVLink in their own custom rack-scale design. Here are all the details...



Day 1 of Computex 2025 is in full swing, and Intel is demoing working Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 silicon for its laptops, the first to use its 18A process node. We've been shown real-time rendering and AI applications ahead of its early 2026 launch.



The Nvidia keynote is underway and most of what CEO Jensen Huang is talking about has to do with AI development, not desktop computing. However, he just showed off the new RTX 5060 on stage, flashing an Asus-branded RTX 5060 GPU and an MSI laptop with RTX 5060 inside.

Huang didn't share any details about the cards, but lots of information has already come out. For example, we reported yesterday that the RTX 5060 is 25% faster than the 4060 with frame generation enabled.

While he spoke, Huang stood in front of a digital scene of a pond in a European city (it looked like Italy). He said that an RTX card (perhaps the 5060) was rendering only 1 out of every 10 frames in the scene, which showed candles floating over water. Instead, he said DLSS was generating 9 out of every 10 frames.



This is probably all we'll hear about PC gaming during this keynote.

""You know, when you're CEO, you have many children, and GeForce is here, and now all of our keynotes are 90% not GeForce,"" Huang said. ""But it's not because we don't love GeForce. GeForce RTX 50 series just had its most successful launch ever, the fastest launch in our history. And PC gaming is now 30 years old. So that tells you something about how incredible GeForce is.""



I've been on the ground (and sweating) in Taipei for a few days now, and one of the first things that always strikes me here is the plethora of billboards and signs for various laptops and PC components.



Sure, a lot of this gets ramped up ahead of Computex, and many are in and around the Guang Hua Digital Plaza area, where there are dozens (perhaps hundreds) of shops and storefronts that sell pretty much everything PC related, from high-end gaming laptops to obscure PC cases, and entire stores dedicated to MSI, Asus, Aorus – there's even a store that pretty much only sells Transcend storage devices and media.

But the ads exist away from the main tech district as well. Today I was walking to a record shop in an arts district, looked up and saw, of all things, a slim vertical billboard for power supply maker, Seasonic.



And later, as I was headed into an MRT (subway) station, making my way back to my hotel, there was a big banner for AMD's Ryzen 9000 CPUs above the train platform.



The only other place I've seen ads like this for PC components and the latest laptops is in Tokyo's famous Akihabara neighborhood during a visit in 2015 – where I bought a random wafer of chips at the back junk tech store that, sadly, was far too fragile to survive the trip home.



On the one hand, it's cool to see the PC hardware we obsess over getting the kind of treatment and attention that is more typically afforded to the latest attempt at a blockbuster movie or a tech startup flush with cash and looking to build brand recognition. And I certainly find ads for components more interesting and less annoying than most ads I see walking around our office neighborhood in Midtown Manhattan.But considering how much I already spend on PC hardware and related tech, I am not sure I'd want to be regularly be surrounded by ads reminding me that the Ryzen 9 9950X3D exists, making my perfectly capable 7950X feel outdated and inadequate, or that my RAM or storage isn't as fast as it could be.

Sure, signs and billboards that are more targeted to my PC interests are cool to see here in Taipei, but I really don't need any more “help” deciding when it's time to upgrade. After all, if I spend all my money on new tech, I won't have any left over to buy old records.

-Matt Safford



There are plenty of tasty and interesting snacks to be had at Taipei's night markets or the many (many) convenience stores. But I could help but pick up a couple of bags of spicy Guai Guai when I saw them today.For those not in the know, this brand of Cheetos-like (but usually sweet) snack is part of a tradition or superstition (take your pick) where engineers and tech workers place the snacks in and around important machines to help assure they function without problems. The phenomenon is so widespread that we've seen both TSMC- and AMD / Lisa Su-branded versions of the snacks debut (and reportedly quickly get bought up) in the last couple of years. And of course, both companies have seen new levels of success in the past several years. Maybe someone should tell Intel's new CEO to invest in some blue Guai Guai.Unsurprisingly, I couldn't find any of the TSMC or Ryzen varieties of the snacks, so these spicy ones will have to do. I'm going to leave them sitting on my laptop overnight, because it has a bad habit of blue-screening every week or so. Maybe the snacks will keep that from happening until I get home (or at least until I'm done reporting from Computex). If it doesn't work, I may have to ask AI for some help with my crash dumps.

-Matt Safford



Taipei is great for a lot of reasons. But as a bit of a coffee addict and snob, I really appreciate the abundance of coffee shops and roasters here. And the coffee (like most food here) is pleasantly affordable.

This iced Americano (unfortunately, the cold brew was sold out) from one of my favorite spots, Coffee Moon, was the equivalent of about $3. And that's on the expensive end. Major chains, like Louisa Coffee (I recommend the egg and peanut butter breakfast sandwich), tend to be cheaper. There are a lot of Starbucks here as well, but I'm not a fan – especially when there are so many other options.



I picked up some fresh-ground coffee for my travel-friendly Aeropress at Ikari Coffee (I like to think this chain is the Ikari Warriors retirement plan) for about $6 – enough for a week's worth of early mornings and late nights, and then some. It's going to be hard to go back to the $5 Dunkin' cold brew when I get back home, even if the sizes are much bigger.

Well, an early EVT3 sample of a Gen6 SSD.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


There are dozens of solid-state drives with a PCIe 5.0 interface over at Computex 2025, and they no longer surprise us; however, we have seen a drive that features a PCIe 6.0 x4 interface and can potentially boast a 30.25 GB/s sequential read and write speed at the trade show.

Micron's 9650 Pro SSD with a PCIe Gen6 interface will unlikely launch anytime soon, but for now, the unit is an important test vehicle for companies like Astera Labs, which plays an important role in developing next-gen AI platforms. At the show, Astera Labs used Micron's PCIe 6.0 SSD to demonstrate its Scorpio PCIe 6.0 4x16 switch, Aries Bandwidth-matching Gearbox software, and Aries 6 timers.



Although Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs feature PCIe 6.0 x16 connectivity, no CPU platforms formally support PCIe 6.0. Nonetheless, PCIe Gen6 SSDs like the Micron 9650 Pro can be quite useful when utilized with platforms featuring PCIe 6.0 switches. For example, PCIe 6.0 switches can enable peer-to-peer communications between AI GPUs and SSDs, bypassing the CPU. In addition, when paired with Astera's Gearbox software and hardware, they can reduce the number of PCIe 6.0 lanes required to work with PCIe 5.0 hosts (e.g., to achieve a PCIe 5.0 x8 performance only for PCIe 6.0 lanes are needed) and therefore enable instalation of more drives into a box, which can be critical for some AI systems.



Certification of PCIe 6.0 devices by PCI-SIG was delayed from mid-2024 to the second half of 2025, so while GPUs like Nvidia's Blackwell support the technology, they have not passed official interoperability tests. As for Micron's 9650 Pro SSD, the unit used by Astera is marked as EVT3, so this is the third revision of the Engineering Validation Test. Generally, this means that the product has undergone at least two prior engineering validation builds (EVT1 and EVT2), and the third build is undergoing further validation and testing.



While EVT3 is still considered pre-production, by the third revision, most hardware issues should be resolved, and firmware/software should be approaching maturity. Just as a reminder, EVT1 is used for initial hardware bring up, EVT2 fixes all major hardware issues, and can be used for firmware development, and EVT3 features near-final hardware and therefore can be used for performance validation, thermals, compatibility and interoperability testing, and demonstrations at trade shows.

There are two iterations to go through: DVT (Design Validation Test) to validate the design under production conditions, and PVT (Production Validation Test) for full qualifications by customers. We do not know whether Micron will wait for the PCI-SIG to initiate interoperability tests in the second half of this year or will first start qualifications of its 9650 Pro PVT drive with select customers interested in PCIe 6.0 storage, but technically, EVT3 can be used for PCI-SIG's compatibility validation.

Despite the show's AI theme, the best products offered more traditional functionality.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Each spring, most leading PC hardware vendors gather in Taiwan for Computex, a huge showcase of everything from giant laptops to mini PCs, monitors, cooling, storage, CPUs and graphics cards. If you love PCs like we do, this show is the most important one of the year.

This year's expo was dubbed “AI Next,” because every computer and component has to at least claim to benefit from AI. However, many of the most innovative products were iterating on tried-and-true formulas that are either unrelated to or tangentially related to the training and inference features we commonly associate with AI.

This year's standouts include a Minecraft-themed cooler, a blazing fast SSD, even-faster SSD controllers and a case that makes us all wish we were back in 1989. These are the 16 best products of Computex 2025.



The Ryzen Threadripper 9000 ‘Shamida Peak' series builds on the company's commanding lead over Intel's competing workstation processors, stretching the performance advantage up to a ludicrous 2.2X faster than Intel's fastest chip. That performance comes courtesy of the move from the Zen 4 architecture to Zen 5, along with the use of the faster TSMC 4nm process node.

The flagship Ryzen 9 9995WX touts 96 cores and 192 threads, with peak boost clocks of 5.4 GHz and a 300W TDP, delivering what should be devastating performance in threaded workloads when the chips arrive in July. As with the last generation, AMD introduced both WX-Series Threadripper chips for higher-end workstations, while the non-Pro Threadripper models slot into the HEDT segment.

The new Threadripper 9000 series drops into the same sTR5 motherboard platforms as the previous-gen Threadripper processors, making upgrades as simple as a BIOS update. The new processors deliver up to 22% more performance in threaded workloads than their predecessors. AMD does expect a few motherboard refreshes as part of the launch, but most vendors will stick with their existing platforms. That's a win for upgraders, especially given that all existing sTR5 CPU coolers will also be compatible.

The Ryzen Threadripper 9000 series solidifies AMD's already commanding lead in the workstation market through the virtues of the Zen 5 microarchitecture and an upgraded TSMC 4nm process node. We expect these chips to thoroughly beat Intel's competing Xeon W-series chips in nearly every facet when they arrive for our review in June.

Now that Nvidia has dropped its mid-range level cards, AMD used Computex as a stage to set up its competitors. AMD's Radeon RX 9060 XT comes out in a few short weeks, and we're very interested to see how it compares to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti.The card starts at $299 for an 8GB version and $349 for a 16GB model, though that assumes you'll be able to find them at retail price (a caveat we're seeing a lot with GPUs lately).The 9060 XT will use AMD's new Navi 44 architecture with 32 Compute Units (CUs), and it boasts a 3,130 MHz boost clock, even higher than the Radeon RX 9070 series. In some charts, AMD had the 9060 XT beating the 5060 Ti, though it compared a 16GB AMD card to an 8GB Nvidia card. That being said, the 16GB 9060 XT's $349 starting price does put it on better price footing.We're hoping this card will deliver in the value segment where it's desperately needed.

Phison pioneered the PCIe 5.0 SSD transition with its award-winning E26 SSD controllers that powered nearly every one of the new speedy SSDs when they first arrived, but now the Phison E28 promises to take performance and efficiency to new heights.

The original E26 controller was powerful, but it traded off higher power consumption for extreme performance, thus resulting in higher heat generation that not only required robust cooling solutions but also hampered its use in laptops.

The Phison E28 delivers huge efficiency gains by using a smaller 6nm process node that cuts power consumption dramatically. At Computex 2025, Phison demoed its new controller handily beating the competing SMI 2508 in power consumption during nearly every type of operation. That equates to lower heat generation, meaning these SSDs won't require bulky coolers, and will also help PCIe 5.0 SSDs finally make their way into mainstream OEM laptops.

Phison didn't skimp on performance to reduce the power consumption, though. The Phison E28 delivers up to 14.8 GB/s of sequential read/write performance and a blistering 2.5 / 3.0 million random read/write IOPS, speeds which were unthinkable a mere few years ago.

Phison says we'll see a wave of E28-powered SSDs coming later this year, with a likely CES 2026 launch date. In fact, we saw plenty of E28 SSDs scattered throughout the Computex show floor at all of the main SSD vendors, proving that we won't have to wait much longer for SSDs with extreme speeds coupled with excellent power efficiency.

Asus's take on the RTX 5080 for creatives has a woodgrain finish, which we've seen a lot on cases, but not as much on GPUs. But that's not the only way the ProArt RTX 5080 ProArt stands out.Some variants of this GPU also have an M.2 slot for PCIe 5 SSDs so you can expand storage on the card. There's also a USB Type-C port on the back to add another port to the PC.

There are two versions of the card with ""reference"" specs, while the other two will have overclocks. We don't see a ton of aftermarkets that impress us by being classy, but this card will look great in a lot of trendy cases with wood. Hopefully it performs as well as it looks.

At the moment, the fastest consumer SSD around is Crucial's T705, which delivers an impressive 1.55M IOPS of random reads and 1.8M IOPS of random writes. But Crucial is debuting a massive upgrade in the T710.

The T710 promises to be 28 percent faster at random reads and 42 percent faster at random writes. The optional heatsink is about half the thickness of the one on its predecessor, saving space.

The M.2 chip is single-sided where the T705 was double-sided. The drive also uses 67 and 80 percent less power per IOPS random read and random write. Both of these features make it viable for use in a laptop where the prior model was not.

At 3.5 pounds and 0.68 inches thick, with a snazzy haptic touchpad and a pretty, 14.5-inch 2880 x 1800 OLED screen, Acer's Predator Triton 14 AI looks to take on the best of what Razer has to offer, while appealing to both gamers and creators on the go.It also has an oddball pairing of a lower-power Lunar Lake Core Ultra 9 288V CPU with RTX 5070 graphics. Time (and testing) will tell how this affects frame rates. But it also might mean significantly better battery life for those times when you aren't gaming. I look forward to getting this ultraportable gamer in for testing to see how it compares to the also-new Razer Blade 14.

I saw dozens of cases at Computex, but Corsair's Air 5400 stands out because it combines the popular curved glass front and side panels with a fair bit of innovations and firsts. Rather than churning out another dual-chamber chassis, Corsair added a third chamber, isolating the 360 mm radiator by basically putting it outside the rest of the case, pulling in air from the front and venting it out the side.

To cool the GPU and other components, a duct funnels the bottom intake (provided by a trio of reverse-blade fans) directly over the motherboard area, while heat gets exhausted out of the top. And back-connector motherboards are supported for the cleanest interior possible.The Air 5400 is also the first case I've seen with three USB-C ports on the top panel. But while I appreciate the more modern move here, I still would have preferred at least one USB-A port.

This case makes us want to party like it's 1989! If you're old enough to remember (or have spotted in your parents' garage) a PC from the late 1980s or early 1990s, SilverStone's FLP02 will take you back to a time when beige cases were all the rage and floppy disks were still at the top of the storage food chain.

This mid-tower case has all the classic design elements we loved when George H. W. Bush was president of the United States and most people weren't using Windows yet. There are three 5.25-inch bays that have covers which look like 5.25-inch floppy drives but don't function. You can remove the fascia and place an optical drive or set of ports or other internal drive inside.

There's a hard power switch, a turbo button and a key lock. The key lock actually works in that it prevents you from turning the PC on or off if you have it turned. The turbo button controls your fan speed.

There are also a series of modern front ports that are hidden under a magnetic panel. These include two USB Type-A ports, a USB-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack.

With the FLP02, you can get the best of both worlds: a bold beige look that brings feelings of nostalgia and room for modern parts like an ATX motherboard, a long graphics card and plenty of fans.

The biggest problem in PC building over the past couple of years has been the infamous melting power connector problem. If you use a graphics card with a 12VHPWR connector like the RTX 4090 and there's a problem with how well it's plugged in, the connector could melt and take your GPU with it.

Seasonic's next-gen Prime power supplies attempt to solve this problem using sensors that detect if there's a voltage problem, connect to an external device and alert the user. If the user is not around to act on the alert, the power supply shuts down to prevent damage to your equipment.

Look, I'm not sure there's a huge market for a high-end, split keyboard for gamers. But I have definitely had moments playing FPS and RTS titles where I only needed half the keyboard and the other was cramping my mouse game. For those who have that feeling often, or who also prefer a split layout for more comfortable typing, Asus has delivered the Falcata. It features pre-lubed HFX V2 magnetic switches that feel smooth, and the whole keyboard feels built like a tank – albeit one that has been split down the middle and held together by a braided USB-C cable.

After a brief time with it, I was left wanting to spend more time with Falcata, both for gaming and productivity. I probably don't want to know how much it's going to cost, though, because the Falcata is clearly a niche product, and it feels nearly as premium as the company's $500 ROG Azoth Extreme.

In a climate where everything feels like it's lurching toward unaffordability, I was shocked when Cooler Master told me that all of its Elite PC case lineup is expected to sell for less than $100, and that at least one of the curved glass models should sell for just $70. That doesn't include tariffs, though, so there's a good chance the prices will be at least somewhat higher in the U.S. But even if you tack on an extra $20 or so, these still look to be some nice-looking mainstream cases that would have cost significantly more a couple of years ago. Sure, you might not be able to afford a GPU, and inflation is still inflicting pain on our wallets elsewhere. But it's nice to know we can look forward to some decent sub-$100 PC cases later this year from Cooler Master.

Not to be outdone by anyone on the affordable case front, Lian Li's V200 is somehow expected to sell for $110, complete with two glass panels, touch controls on the front for power and fan speeds, and a big 8.8-inch screen embedded in the side of the bottom chamber. That screen will also be sold separately – for $85. So if you really want to feel like the V200 is a bargain, think about it like you're buying the screen and getting the rest of the case for $25. Again, I would expect this case to sell for at least a little more when it comes to the U.S., but even for $130, this case seems like a bargain when Corsair wants to charge $249 for its case screen alone.

Granted, Corsair's screen is much larger and supports touch input, but it's hard not to be impressed by a pretty $110 PC case with a big screen on the side and other fancy features. Lian Li even angled the bottom intake area so the fans do a better job of blowing cool air at your GPU while also giving you a better look at the RGB in your fans.

OLED panels are all the rage nowadays with gaming monitors, especially QD-OLED panels, because of their increased brightness levels and superior color. MSI combines QD-OLED technology's fantastic color reproduction and responsiveness with an ultra-rapid refresh rate of 500 Hz with its MPG 271QR QD-OLED X50.

The monitor boasts a 2560 x 1440 resolution and a response time of 0.03 ms. It's also DisplayHDR True Black 500 and VESA ClearMR 21000 certified. MSI even uses an AI Care Sensor to intelligently determine if a human is sitting in front of the monitor and adjust brightness levels or power down the monitor completely to improve panel longevity and reduce power consumption.

In addition to the AI Care Sensor, which is part of MSI's broader OLED Care 2.0 protection suite, the MPG 271QR QD-OLED X50 also comes with a 3-year burn-in warranty.

When it comes to gaming hardware, a lot of the marketing around monitors involves bragging rights, and Asus definitely has that covered with the world's first and only 610 Hz gaming monitors. While Acer was technically the first to hit the 600 Hz mark last year, the new Asus ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG manages to squeak by with 610 Hz overclocked (600 Hz native).

To reach that lofty mark, Asus had to go with a tried-and-true TN panel, which it has enhanced and now dubs ""Super TN."" Super TN technology aims to improve color reproduction and brightness, both sticking points with this older (and seldom used technology for modern gaming monitors).

With that said, the ROG Strix Ace XG248QSG sports a 1920 x 1080 resolution (Full HD), AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compliance, DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1 support, and covers 90 percent of DCI-P3.

If you can't ride your PC like a chicken jockey, you can at least get a Minecraft-themed cooler. Thermaltake's MineCube 360 is a 360mm AIO cooler with a twist: it has a cube on top of the CPU that shows scenes from Minecraft.

Four sides of the cube hold separate, 3.95-inch, 720 x 720 resolution screens. Presumably you can put images other than Minecraft scenes on these, but why would you want to?

The cooler also features a 360mm radiator and SWAFAN EX12 ARGB fans. The fans attach to each other using magnetic quick connections and you control the whole thing using TT RGB software.

We've seen all kinds of RAM modules with different aesthetics. There are DIMMs with RGB and others with 3D printable toppers. Thermaltake even makes a full-color LCD screen you can attach to the top of your memory.

However, we've never seen anything like V-Color's Xfinity Manta. This DDR5 RAM features a programmable LED screen on the front of the module. This monochrome screen can show anything from the amount of RAM to your CPU speed.

The Manta DDR5 modules also features RGB lighting on top.

The need for data comes with a need for data storage.

Just like cryptocurrency put a new strain on the GPU market, AI is starting to push into the demands of data storage companies. Recently, at Computex 2025, Seagate came forward with a panel showcasing new developments for the upcoming year. According to Digitimes, Seagate also used the opportunity to express growing concern about the impact AI is having on the tech industry and potentially developing into what they describe as a ""carbon crisis"".

Seagate also provided some figures for those interested in exactly how big the impact appears to be. It claims the hard drive industry as a whole is only able to create 1 to 2 zettabytes of storage each year, with 1 zettabyte being the equivalent of 1 trillion GB. However, this is only a small portion of how much data is expected to be created.

Digitimes explained how Seagate surveyed 1,000 IT professionals, 72% of whom are planning to use or are already using artificial intelligence in their respective fields. 90% of those who claim to currently use AI also believe that data storage is critical for improving the performance of AI. Seeing the rising demand, Seagate responded with research and found that HDDs have lower carbon footprints than your typical SSD.

As such, Seagate had a demo set up at its booth showing off prototype hard drives. The demo featured hard drives fixed up with NVMe interfaces. They connected directly to Nvidia GPUs using data processing units (DPU). This represents just one of many potential avenues that can be taken to change how storage is handled for data centers and more, potentially making systems easier to manage.

It's hard to tell exactly how things will shake out in the world of data storage, but there's definitely change on the horizon. As demands increase for lower carbon footprints, data centers will need to respond in a way to meet legal requirements while also providing the hardware support needed to cater to growing AI demands.

Karin de Punder, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria, has conducted research on how chronic stress accelerates the aging of the immune system and its connection to depression. Traditionally, depression has been diagnosed on the basis of self-reported symptoms; however, reliable clinical biomarkers are lacking.

de Punder and colleagues have explored new potential biomarkers in ongoing studies. She recently presented her findings at the German Congress for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy in Berlin from March 12 to 14, 2025, during a session titled “Stress and Aging: A Biological Basis of Trauma and Depression Symptoms?”

de Punder stated, “Chronic stress affects the immune system by accelerating its aging,” highlighting the important implications of the study.

The molecular toxic properties of chronic stress promote these processes, including:

Telomeres, which are the protective caps of chromosomes, shorten during cell division. Stress accelerates this process. When the telomere length falls below a critical threshold, cell death and senescence occur. Senescent cells cannot divide but continue to secrete pro-inflammatory signaling molecules. Accelerated telomere shortening has been linked to a shorter lifespan and various diseases, including coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and mental disorders, such as depression.

In studies examining how stress contributes to disease risk, researchers often measure the telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

If leukocyte aging and telomere length are associated with depression, they could serve as potential biomarkers, aiding the identification of depression through physical parameters.

To identify these biomarkers, researchers analyzed blood samples from 22 patients diagnosed with depression, all of whom received inpatient treatment. Age-matched women without depression, with an average age of 58 years, served as controls. The severity of depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II, and traumatic stress was assessed using the Essen Trauma Inventory.

Blood samples were isolated to measure telomere length, and serum was used for mass spectrometry–based omics analysis to generate the biochemical profiles. In total, 682 metabolites were identified and evaluated for their association with depression and telomere length.

Further investigation focused on glyceraldehyde, revealing that blood levels were significantly correlated with the severity of depression and trauma and with the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, which is often elevated in patients with depression. Notably, higher glyceraldehyde levels were associated with shorter telomeres, particularly in CD8+ cells. These findings remained significant even after adjusting for age and body mass index.

Glyceraldehyde is a triose monosaccharide and an intermediate in carbohydrate metabolism. This highly reactive molecule can modify and bind proteins, resulting in the formation of advanced glycation end products. Glyceraldehyde-modified proteins exert cytotoxic effects by reducing glutathione levels, which protects cells from damage and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby promoting inflammatory responses.

“These are precisely the processes that negatively affect telomere length,” said de Punder.

Glyceraldehyde, with other markers, could serve as a biomarker for a subtype of depression linked to immune system activation.

The study also suggested that a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level above 1 mg/L may not always indicate infection but could reflect low-grade chronic inflammation.

“This would give physicians a testing option to determine whether this form of depression is present,” said de Punder.

To validate these results, the study requires duplication in a larger cohort with a longitudinal design, a broader age range, and inclusion of both sexes. Further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanisms linking glyceraldehyde to depression, trauma, and telomere biology.

“If we have multiple biomarkers available in the future, we can not only improve the detection of depressive disorders but also better tailor treatment,” de Punder emphasized.

Although most clinicians caring for youths aged 17 years or younger reported screening for substance use disorders, many did not do so at every checkup, and 36.9% did not use a standardized screening tool — falling short of recommended screening practices.

“Identifying youths with SUDs [substance use disorders] and referring them to treatment remain crucial components to reduce substance use–related morbidity and mortality, including overdose,” the authors wrote.

“Screening offers opportunities for clinicians to engage in primary prevention of SUDs through anticipatory guidance, refer patients who use substances to appropriate care, and offer interventions to reduce adverse outcomes to all at-risk youth[s],” they added.

This study was led by Kathleen Ragan-Burnett, MSPH, of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. It was published online on May 20, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The results of this study may not apply to all clinicians because only those with a greater chance of responding were contacted first. There were limited details available about screening behaviors, including the motivations for and barriers to specific practices.

No sources of funding were reported in this study. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 May 23, 2025  

LOS ANGELES — Saffron may help treat sexual dysfunction related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), new research suggests.

Results of a preliminary new review found saffron, a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the “saffron crocus,” reduced erectile dysfunction in men and boosted arousal in women.

“Considering our limited toolbox for addressing sexual side effects in patients, it's important to continue assessing and researching potential treatments,” study author Jeremy Wolfe, MD, third-year psychiatry resident, Chicago Medical School, Chicago, told Medscape Medical News.

“A large proportion of patients who experience these side effects will ultimately fail the few adjunctive treatments we have available, and saffron may be an alternative for these patients.”

The findings were presented on May 17 at the American Psychiatry Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of SSRIs, with some 14% of patients self-reporting the condition. However, Wolfe noted this “sensitive topic” is frequently underreported.

He noted that when patients are directly asked, the proportion of those who report experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction is closer to 58%.

He noted that sexual dysfunction is a significant concern not only with antidepressants but also with many other classes of medications. It is also a common symptom of certain mental health conditions, including depression.

Switching medications might help alleviate the issue, but therapists are often reluctant to make a change if the SSRI is effectively treating the depression, as “we may not find another one that works,” said Wolfe.

Currently, physicians may attempt to address the sexual dysfunction by lowering the SSRI dose or by prescribing medications such as bupropion, buspirone, or a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor like sildenafil (Viagra).

Saffron has been used since ancient times to treat melancholy and insomnia, as well as to enhance sexual well-being. After hearing anecdotal reports that saffron might help with sexual dysfunction in patients with psychiatric disorders, Wolfe decided to explore the research to see what evidence he could find.

After conducting a literature search, Wolfe and his colleagues included five studies in their review, all conducted in Iran between 2009 and 2017. Wolfe noted that Iran is the world's leading exporter of saffron, producing about 90% of the global supply. It has long been used there both in cuisine and for medicinal purposes, he added.

Four of the studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while the fifth was a single-group clinical trial.

The studies investigated saffron capsules, gels, or tablets compared with placebo. Wolfe noted capsules are “by far” the most common form of saffron, although it's also available in teas, liquid extracts, and powders in addition to tablets and gels.

Three studies focused on men with erectile dysfunction; one enrolled women with sexual dysfunction, and another included both men and women with sexual desire disorder. Participants were matched for depression severity and any concurrent treatments for sexual dysfunction.

A 4-week, double-blind RCT included 30 men with a mean age of 32.5 years, whose depressive symptoms were stabilized on fluoxetine (an SSRI) but who reported sexual dysfunction.

The results showed significantly greater improvement in erectile function among participants taking 5 mg of saffron twice daily compared with those receiving a placebo (mean difference on the International Index of Erectile Function scale, 7.0; 95% CI, 4.2-9.7; P < .001). They also reported higher intercourse satisfaction (mean difference, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .001).

A randomized, double-blind trial involving 34 women stabilized on fluoxetine showed significant improvements by week 4 on the Female Sexual Function Index. Participants taking 30 mg of saffron daily showed greater improvements in arousal (mean difference vs placebo: −0.72; 95% CI, −1.36 to −0.08; P = .028) and lubrication (mean difference, −1.08; 95% CI, −2.02 to −0.08; P = .035) and experienced less pain during intercourse (mean difference, −1.34; 95% CI, −2.42 to −0.26; P = .016). 

Since depressive symptoms did not differ significantly between groups, the improvement in sexual function was likely attributable to saffron rather than a reduction in depression, said Wolfe.

The exact mechanism by which saffron affects sexual dysfunction remains unclear, said Wolfe. It may influence multiple neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonin, and also appears to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis-regulating effects. Additionally, it may act on nitric oxide pathways to enhance blood flow.

The frequency of side effects did not differ significantly between the saffron and placebo groups in the studies. However, Wolfe noted that other reports have documented side effects that should be considered before recommending saffron to a patient.

These may include gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, changes in blood pressure, and anxiety. In rare cases, saffron may trigger manic episodes in susceptible individuals or cause allergic reactions. There is also some evidence that saffron may stimulate uterine contractions, posing a potential risk during pregnancy, he added.

“Many of these side effects make sense from the perspective of [saffron's] serotonergic effects,” he said.

Wolfe also cautioned that it is possible to take too much saffron. “From what I've read, dosages above 5 g are considered unsafe,” he said.

Symptoms of overdose may include vomiting, severe dizziness, jaundice, and serotonin syndrome — a group of symptoms that can include hypertension, accelerated heart rate, and agitation.

“As with other antidepressant medications, use should be monitored, with annual labs at a bare minimum including blood count, electrolytes, liver function, renal function, and thyroid function,” Wolfe noted.

Uma Naidoo, MD, an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of Nutritional and Lifestyle Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, commented on the research for Medscape Medical News. She described the findings as both interesting and promising and said she was pleased to see the APA highlight this work — particularly given that this year's meeting focused on lifestyle approaches to improving mental and physical health.

Research on the topic is needed as SSRI-related sexual dysfunction is “a massive issue,” said Naidoo. “The potential impact on libido is a reason many young people don't want to start an SSRI,” she added.

However, Naidoo noted the studies were confined to Iran, and the sample sizes were small, so the generalizability of the results is limited.

She said she would like to see the researchers collaborate with other groups, including academic centers, to conduct larger studies in order to confirm the findings.

No relevant conflicts of interest were disclosed.

 May 23, 2025  

HELSINKI, Finland — Less intensive monitoring of patients with acute ischemic stroke who have undergone thrombolysis appeared to be safe in new findings that challenge current guidelines.

The large international OPTIMISTmain trial showed that less frequent monitoring of vital signs and neurologic function during the first 24 hours did not compromise recovery or increase the risk for serious adverse events compared with standard protocols.

“The key message from our study is that it is safe to relax the monitoring of these patients, and this will allow nurses to be freed up from taking constant measurements so they can spend more time on delivering direct interventions and generally providing better care of the patients,” study investigator Craig Anderson, MD, George Institute for Global Health, Sydney, Australia, told Medscape Medical News.

“Another benefit will be less disruption to patients, which is especially important if they are trying to sleep.”

The trial also showed that less intensive monitoring was feasible outside of an intensive care unit (ICU), which the researchers said would have benefits such as flexibility in nursing workflow and the release of intensive care resources.

“This trial result has wide applicability and is relevant all around the world, and we believe that hospitals could consider incorporating this approach to improve systems of care for acute stroke,” Anderson said.

Anderson presented the results of the OPTIMISTmain trial on May 21 at the European Stroke Organization Conference (ESOC) 2025. The trial was also simultaneously published online in The Lancet.

Anderson noted that this was a nurse-driven study and was the idea of co-lead author Debbie Summers, MSN, a senior nurse practitioner at Saint Luke's Hospital of Kansas City, Missouri, who questioned whether the high-intensity monitoring of patients with stroke after thrombolysis administration was necessary, given its high burden on nurses and level of disruption to patients.

Current guidelines recommended 37 assessments within the first 24 hours after thrombolysis, including vital signs — such as heart rate and blood pressure — and neurologic checks using the Glasgow Coma Scale or the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). These are conducted every 15 minutes for 2 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours, and then hourly.

The low-intensity monitoring protocol tested in the study involved 17 assessments over the same 24-hour period, with vital signs and neurologic checks conducted every 15 minutes for 2 hours, every 2 hours for the next 8 hours, and then every 4 hours. Investigators were also encouraged to implement the protocol in a stroke unit rather than an ICU, where hospital infrastructure allowed.

Anderson explained that high-intensity monitoring was put in place when thrombolysis was first used in routine clinical practice, as this was the protocol used in the initial randomized clinical trial of alteplase for acute ischemic stroke in the mid-1990s.

“There was concern that use of thrombolysis in this setting could cause intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and the trial, therefore, included a careful monitoring strategy to detect any deterioration in the patient as quickly as possible.

“In addition, thorough monitoring and reporting was necessary in the evaluation of a new drug. Then, because this high-intensity monitoring program had been used in the trial, it was adopted after alteplase was approved for use in acute ischemic stroke and rolled out into clinical practice,” Anderson said.

However, this high-intensity monitoring protocol has never been tested in a major study to determine if this intensive monitoring is actually necessary, he added.

Guidelines often recommend ICU monitoring for these patients due to the high level of nursing care required. While some countries have relaxed this requirement, others — such as the United States, where medicolegal concerns are more prominent — continue to manage these patients in the ICU.

OPTIMISTmain was an international, cluster-randomized trial conducted at 114 hospitals across eight countries: Australia, Chile, the United Kingdom, the United States, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and Vietnam.

It was designed to test the noninferiority of a new low-intensity monitoring protocol to the standard high-intensity monitoring protocol in patients with acute ischemic stroke who were clinically stable with mild to moderate neurologic impairment (NIHSS score < 10) within 2 hours of initiation of thrombolysis.

The trial enrolled 4922 patients, with 2789 participants assigned to the low-intensity monitoring group and 2133 to the standard monitoring group.

The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with an unfavorable functional outcome defined by a Modified Rankin Scale score from 2 (indicating some disability) to 6 (death) at 90 days.

This occurred in 31.7% of patients in the low-intensity monitoring group and 30.9% of those in the standard monitoring group, giving a relative risk of 1.03 (95% CI, 0.92-1.15), satisfying the noninferiority criteria (P noninferiority = .057).

Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in five (0.2%) patients in the low-intensity group and eight (0.4%) patients in the standard monitoring group, a nonsignificant difference.

The number of participants with a serious adverse event was similar between the low-intensity monitoring group (11.1%) and the standard monitoring group (11.3%).

The low-intensity monitoring protocol was associated with lower rates of ICU admission, with 12.8% in the low-intensity group admitted directly to an ICU compared with 16.8% of patients in the standard monitoring group.

These figures and the differences between the protocols were much greater in the United States, where immediate ICU admission occurred in 47.1% of patients in the low-intensity monitoring group vs 77.1% of those in the standard monitoring group.

“This was a large trial with hard, accepted, patient-centered outcomes, and the results should be applicable across the world,” Anderson said.

He pointed out that the trial also included process evaluations from the nurses and physicians involved, which he said were “pretty much uniformly comfortable with the less intensive monitoring protocol.”

“It is not for us to recommend what guidelines do,” he added. “But we have suggested that hospitals should consider implementing this intervention according to local circumstances to improve the efficiency of their care.”

While a cost analysis has not yet been published, Anderson said the less intensive monitoring protocol is expected to save costs.

“Just the observation that there was a significant reduction in the use of ICU beds, especially in the United States, will result in significant cost savings,” he noted.

“This trial shows that we can use our nurses in a more efficient manner, and we don't need to send all our patients to the ICU; we can use our regular beds or stroke unit beds better and be a bit smarter,” he added.

Anderson added that over the many years of using thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in clinical practice, it has become apparent that the incidence of ICH is low and that such strict monitoring might not be required. “We have become more confident about how to use thrombolysis and which patients are at higher risk.”

However, he cautioned that the low-intensity protocol would not be appropriate for all patients.

“This study only included patients who had a moderate level of disability when they presented. Patients also had to be alert, with good blood pressure control, heart rate, and respiration, and without other complicating health problems. We estimate that this would account for at least a third, maybe half, of all the stroke patients that come through hospitals around the world,” said Anderson.

Commenting on the OPTIMISTmain trial, Valeria Caso, MD, PhD, professor of neurology and consultant neurologist at Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy, and a past president of the European Stroke Organisation, said she was “very impressed” with the study.

She pointed out that nurse-led trials are important as so much of stroke care is carried out by nurses.

“This trial is another example of ‘less is more' that we are seeing in several aspects of stroke medicine,” said Caso.

“I think we will implement this lower-intensity monitoring protocol for less severe stroke patients in Italy. Nurses are in high demand, and we need to prioritize the resources we have. These results will allow us to prioritize the nursing resources regarding intensive monitoring in the first 24 hours for patients with severe strokes.”

The OPTIMISTmain trial was funded by grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia; the New South Wales Health Investigator Development Grant; the University of New South Wales Medicine Non-Communicable Diseases Theme Early and Mid-Career Research Seed Grant Scheme; the Medical Research Future Fund (for conduct in Australia); and Genentech (for conduct in the USA). Professor Anderson had received grants from the NHMRC and Medical Research Futures Fund of Australia, the Medical Research Foundation of the United Kingdom, and AstraZeneca, Australia.

 May 23, 2025  

Many breastfeeding mothers experience menopause-like symptoms of the postpartum condition recently designated genitourinary syndrome of lactation (GSL) in a systematic review reported in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

The term was proposed in 2024 after interdisciplinary discussions among obstetricians, gynecologists, and urologists and following recognition of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).

Though common, this lactation-associated syndrome is a blind spot in postpartum care — underrecognized and undertreated, according to the review's lead author, Sara Perelmuter, MPhil, an MD candidate at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, and colleagues. They found a strong association between lactation and a spectrum of symptoms encompassing vaginal atrophy and dryness, urinary issues, dyspareunia, and sexual dysfunction.

Pooled analysis revealed that vaginal atrophy was prevalent in almost two thirds of postpartum lactating individuals, with breastfeeding women being 2.34 times more likely to experience atrophy than their non-breastfeeding counterparts.

The impetus for this review came from the increasing recognition of GSM. “Yet silence still existed around postpartum lactating individuals who are essentially going through the same physiological experience of a lack of estrogens and androgens,” Perelmuter told Medscape Medical News. “I was constantly frustrated by how many postpartum patients — especially lactating individuals — experienced debilitating vaginal and urinary symptoms, yet no one named it, asked about it, and very few providers treated it.”

This is a physiologic, hormonal, and wholly real condition affecting millions, and it was time it had a name and clinical recognition, she added.

Despite its high prevalence, consistent screening at postpartum visits and treatment guidelines are not available. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, has issued no guidance on GSL.

The authors urged clinicians to prioritize awareness, screening, and personalized care to address these underrecognized symptoms and improve quality of life of lactating mothers.

During postpartum lactation, high levels of prolactin inhibit estrogen and androgen secretion. “If you're not lactating, your hormones are able to rebalance faster, whereas if you're lactating, the hormonal shifts are more dramatic due to sustained suppression of estrogen and androgen,” Perelmuter said, noting that exclusively lactating individuals reported a higher burden of symptom severity in all domains.

US and international investigators examined 65 eligible studies, of which almost 80% were of high quality.

Among the specific findings in postpartum lactating individuals:

“Honestly, we were shocked by how widespread and underrecognized these symptoms are,” Perelmuter said. “GSL is a hormonal mirror of GSM, but it's happening during what we culturally frame as a joyful and healthy time — early motherhood — but which is also defined by a massive lifestyle shift.”

The investigators were also struck by the finding that more than 70% never seek or receive care. “These symptoms are not a niche problem. They're systemic, frequent, and deeply impactful. The data validated what many of us have seen in clinic but felt powerless to name.”

If your postpartum patient is lactating and reporting dryness, pain, or sexual dysfunction, offer treatment, she advised. “A simple question, a brief explanation, and an offer of vaginal estrogen or pelvic floor therapy can be life-changing. It's time we bring this into mainstream training for primary care, Ob/Gyns, midwives, lactation consultants, and even pediatricians. Our patients are already experiencing it — we just need to catch up.”

Commenting on GSL but not involved in the review, Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine and a clinical professor of urology at University of California San Diego, also stressed the urgent need to raise awareness in the medical community and the public.

While it's “normal” to have low levels of reproductive hormones in both menopause and GSL, this normal state “leads to unwanted and bothersome and distressing symptoms, which, if appreciated, can be treated,” he told Medscape Medical News. “The safest hormonal treatment would be intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone. Its mechanism is intracrinologic [within cells], and it does not enter the bloodstream.” 

For Perelmuter, GSL is part of a larger pattern in which women's pain — especially postpartum — is being ignored and normalized. “We need to reframe postpartum care as a time of active healing, not passive endurance,” she said. “This study is just the beginning. Let's build a future where every lactating person has their symptoms taken seriously, their options explained clearly, and their bodies respected fully.”

This study had no specific funding. The authors had no conflicts of interest to disclose. Goldstein previously disclosed having relationships with multiple private-sector companies not relevant to his comments on the review.

 May 23, 2025  

At its May 2025 meeting, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) gave a conditional marketing authorization in the European Union for obecabtagene autoleucel (Aucatzyl) to treat adults from 26 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B ALL).

A conditional marketing authorization is granted to a medicinal product that fulfils an unmet medical need when the benefit to public health of immediate availability outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

B ALL is a fast-growing and life-threatening cancer. Despite multiple available therapeutic options, it is associated with significant mortality and a poor survival rate.

Aucatzyl, whose active substance is obecabtagene autoleucel, is an antineoplastic cell and gene therapy. The autologous immunotherapy consists of the patient's own T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor that recognizes and binds to CD19 on target cells. This results in activation of the immunological effect of the T-cell releasing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, killing CD19-expressing cells. 

The CHMP said that the benefits of obecabtagene autoleucel were its ability to induce remission with a relevant duration in adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The positive decision by the CHMP was based on the results of the FELIX study, a single-arm, open-label phase 1b-2 multicenter study of obecabtagene autoleucel in adults aged 18 years and over with relapsed or refractory B ALL.

In the study, around 64% of patients had a durable response — a period without disease signs or symptoms after treatment — with a median duration of 14 months. Around 49% showed a complete response, meaning the signs of cancer disappeared.

Aucatzyl will be available as a 410 x 106 cells dispersion for infusion. 

The drug's most common side effects include cytokine release syndrome, infections, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and hemorrhage.

To confirm the safety and efficacy of Aucatzyl, the manufacturer has been requested to submit long-term follow-up results of the FELIX study and to conduct a non-interventional study based on a patient registry.

In the meantime, in its overall assessment of the available data, the Committee for Advanced Therapies — the EMA's expert committee for cell- and gene-based medicines — found that the benefits of Aucatzyl outweighed the possible risks in patients with ALL, and thus the marketing authorization was granted.

 May 23, 2025  

LOS ANGELES — The novel phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor known as CPL'36 (Celon Pharma) is effective and generally safe in acute exacerbations of schizophrenia, new research suggested.

In a phase 2 trial of 189 patients with acute schizophrenia, compared with the placebo group, the groups receiving CPL'36 20 or 40 mg once daily both met the primary endpoint of a significant improvement from baseline to day 28 in scores on the positive subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Both active treatment groups also showed a significant improvement in total scores on the PANSS, and the 40-mg group showed a significant improvement in scores on the negative subscale of the PANSS.

The most commonly reported adverse events for all groups included anxiety, insomnia, and somnolence. In the active treatment groups, no significant increases were observed in the levels of glucose and total cholesterol or in hepatic parameters.

“The drug is effective, and it has a very mild safety profile, with no metabolic side effects and limited extrapyramidal effects,” study co-investigator Maciej Wieczorek, MD, CEO of Celon Pharma, Łomianki, Poland, told Medscape Medical News.

Asked to comment, John Torous, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Boston, told Medscape Medical News that this study “felt more substantial and more convincing” than other phase 2 trials he typically sees.

“I think these were very impressive results. We're always looking for things with new mechanisms of action in schizophrenia, and it had a favorable safety profile. So it was impressive they brought all that evidence to bear at once,” said Torous, who was not involved with the research.

The findings were presented on May 18, 2025, at American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

PDE10A hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate “and is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs),” the investigators wrote. Its inhibition can lead to a modulation of MSN activity, upping the drug's potential as a treatment for psychosis, they added.

“It's completely different from other drugs. We don't block dopamine receptors; rather, we modulate the release of dopamine. And from the molecular point of view, it's very selective,” Wieczorek said.

After CPL'36 showed good safety and tolerability in a phase 1 clinical trial they conducted, the investigators sought to assess its safety and efficacy in a phase 2 study. Although top-line results were released by the drug development company last year, more detailed findings were presented at this year's APA meeting.

Interesting, the drug is also being developed for levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.

In the current double-blind, dose-ranging, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 189 adult patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either a 20-mg (n = 58; mean age, 41.3 years; 55% men) or a 40-mg (n = 66; mean age, 42.1 years; 62.1% men) dose of CPL'36 once daily as powder in a hard gelatin capsule or matching placebo (n = 65; mean age, 41.5 years; 70.8% men). All treatments were taken over 28 consecutive days.

For inclusion in the study, all participants had to have experienced exacerbation of psychotic symptoms within the previous 2-month period and have a total score of ≥ 80 on the PANSS. At baseline, the mean total score on the PANSS for all participants was 105.

Safety measures included ECG; the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale; and various physical, neurologic, and dermatologic exams.

Results showed a significantly greater improvement from baseline to day 28 in scores on the positive subscale of the PANSS for CPL'36 20 mg/d (reduction, 3.7 units; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.73) and 40 mg/d (reduction, 6.3 units; P < .001; Cohen d, 1.38) vs placebo.

In addition, significant improvements in scores on this subscale were seen for both doses as early as week 1 and continued through weeks 2, 3, and 4.

Compared with the placebo group, both active treatment groups also had a greater improvement in total scores on the PANSS at all timepoints (day 28 reductions, 9.7 and 16.4 units, respectively; P < .001 for both).

There was a 2.6 unit reduction in scores on the negative subscale of the PANSS for the 40-mg/d group vs the placebo group (P < .001) at day 28, with a significant improvement starting at week 2 and continuing through weeks 3 and 4.

Plasma testing showed that levels of glucose and total cholesterol remained constant throughout the study.

Somnolence was the most common adverse event, reported by 15.8% of the 20-mg group, 12.3% of the 40-mg group, and none of the placebo group.

In addition, anxiety was reported by 10.5%, 13.8%, and 9.2% of the groups; insomnia by 7.0%, 7.7%, and 7.7% of the groups; and worsening of schizophrenia symptoms by 7.0%, 10.8%, and 3.1% of the groups, respectively.

Additionally, five members in the 20-mg group, eight in the 40-mg group, and none in the placebo group reported extrapyramidal symptoms, which could include akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, dystonia, or tremor and were considered by the researchers to be mild to moderate. They added that extrapyramidal symptoms are “typical side effects for already marketed antipsychotics.”

Treatment-emergent adverse events of any type were reported by 51% of the 20-mg group, 57% of the 40-mg group, and 34% of the placebo group. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported by one member in each of the 20-mg and placebo groups and by two members in the 40-mg group.

There was also one episode of status epilepticus in the 40-mg group, but the investigators were unsure if it was treatment-related.

“This is the first study in the world demonstrating robust efficacy of PDE10A inhibition in the treatment of schizophrenia with positive primary and secondary endpoint readouts,” the company noted in their statement last year.

Wieczorek said they are now preparing for a meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year about creating a phase 3 trial. The current plan is to include both the 20-mg and 40-mg doses, but flexible dosing may be included in other future studies.

Torous noted that the field went years without a new schizophrenia medication before the FDA's approval of xanomeline/trospium chloride (Cobenfy, Bristol Myers Squibb) last year.

However, as reported at the time by Medscape Medical News, its company announced in an April statement that the drug fell short as an add-on therapy in the phase 3 ARISE trial.

Torous said that, overall, there is still a real need for more options when it comes to treating patients with schizophrenia.

“It makes me think that for patients who haven't responded to classical treatments, [CPL'36] is something that is different and has a different mechanism. That certainly could provide a lot of hope,” he said.

Asked whether he'd consider adding this drug to his medical toolbox if further research is as impressive and if it gets approved, Torous answered “definitely.”

“The field is hungry, if not desperate, for new treatments that have favorable side effect profiles and that would work for people who are in a more agitated state. So this could have real importance if it bears out,” he concluded.

The study was funded by the drug's developer Celon Pharma, and Wieczorek is the CEO of the company. Torous reported having no relevant financial relationships.

 May 23, 2025  

The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) approval decision about a new treatment for non–muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) hinges on whether a single-armed trial can be trusted to adequately demonstrate risks and benefits.

The issue came to a head May 21 when the agency asked its Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) to weigh in on UGN-102 (UroGen Pharma), an intravesical mitomycin formulation meant to be an alternative to transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for recurrent low-grade intermediate-risk NMIBC.

UroGen presented results from its ENVISION trial in 223 patients with recurrent lesions on day 2 of a meeting of the FDA advisory committee. After 6 weekly 75 mg instillations, the complete response rate at the 3-month checkup was 77.6%. Twelve months after a complete response, almost 80% of subjects remained recurrence-free; at 18 months, just over half were still recurrence-free.

UroGen highlighted the convenience of UGN-102, which can be instilled in a urologist's office, over TURBT, which is a surgical procedure usually done under general anesthesia. The company said UGN-102 “can reduce the burden of repeated TURBTs” in elderly, comorbid patients.

However, there was no control arm in ENVISION, so outcomes vs TURBT, the current standard of care, are unclear.

“The lack of a concurrent control in the single-arm ENVISION trial makes interpretation of efficacy challenging,” the FDA said in a meeting document.

Although the complete response rate indicates drug activity, the agency said the durations of response found in the study could simply be due to the fact that some patients with NMBIC recur, while others do not.

The same holds true for safety. Most of the adverse events in the trial were genitourinary and low grade, but it's unclear if there are fewer than with TURBT. For one, patients were at risk for adverse events throughout the entire 6-week treatment window, whereas the duration of side effects with TURBT, as a single procedure, is generally shorter.

“The applicant has not demonstrated that treatment with UGN-102 is safer or more tolerable than TURBT,” the FDA said in the document.

The FDA wanted UroGen to run a head-to-head randomized trial against TURBT. UroGen started one, but there was disagreement with the agency about how it should be conducted, and the trial ended early.

On day 2 of the ODAC meeting, the FDA said the preliminary findings can't be used to compare the two approaches due to methodological issues.

Richard Pazdur, MD, head of FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence, said there are also larger issues at play.

If the agency approves UGN-102 for such a condition as common as NMIBC based on a single-arm study, “guess what? Nobody's going to do a randomized trial. It goes to the lowest denominator for companies,” Pazdur said.

The FDA didn't ask ODAC's opinion on approving UGN-102. Instead, it simply wanted committee members to vote on whether the overall benefit-risk of UGN-102 is favorable for recurrent, low-grade, intermediate-risk NMIBC based on the data.

Five panelists voted “no,” and four voted “yes.”

Radiation oncologist Daniel Spratt, MD, a prostate cancer specialist at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, was one of the “no” votes.

Without the randomized trial, he said, “It's very hard to determine the true benefit of this, and there is toxicity.” Plus, “this is a $140,000 treatment that might not change how many follow-up TURBTs you need after 3 months.”

Another “no” vote, Heidi McKean, MD, a community oncologist in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, said that “in this population, a randomized control trial is feasible and would have really helped us understand the clinical meaningfulness of the intervention.”

Surgical oncologist Mark Ball, MD, a kidney cancer specialist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, voted “yes” in favor of UGN-102.

The complete response rate at 12 months and beyond, “even though there are differences in the interpretation of the data, is quite encouraging. I don't find the toxicity profile alarming, and therefore,” Ball said, “the benefit-risk ratio is favorable.”

Isla Garraway, MD, PhD, a urologic surgical oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, also voted “yes,” saying it would be ideal to have a less invasive, in-office alternative to TURBT for the older patients most often affected by NMIBC.

In the end, Pazdur said, “This a relatively split vote, so we will be meeting with the sponsor to look at future directions.”

ODAC was also asked for its thoughts on whether the FDA should require randomized trials for future low-grade, intermediate-risk NMIBC approval submissions.

Committee members generally agreed, as long as the requirement doesn't delay the approval of promising treatments.

Disclosure: Melissa Walton-Shirley, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

“Do something every day that scares you” is a favorite motto of 36-year old World Champion kayaker and freestyler Nicholas Troutman. 

As an extreme athlete, he is accustomed to risk-taking; whether it's running white water rapids or navigating an 80-foot waterfall drop in Washington State. His GoPro videos attest to his undeniable thirst for adrenalin-producing life experiences. 

No one would have predicted his closest brush with death would be from a heart attack as a result of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) earlier this year. 

After 4 days of “6/10 chest discomfort” occurring mostly during inclines on Nick's typical 4-mile runs, his wife asked him to get checked out. But he napped, blamed it on too much caffeine, and wondered if he had panic disorder, a condition he'd never experienced. He even “tested” himself by going for more runs. When he had to lay on the floor until his pain remitted and took yet another nap, his wife insisted again, and he finally drove himself to the local hospital. 

“I was told my ECG looked pretty good,” he said. He was also initially reassured that his athleticism and young age placed him in a super low risk category for heart attack…but his troponin level returned in the thousands. A coronary angiogram revealed 100% occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. “There was a 36 mm tear” in the vessel wall proximal to the obstruction. He was placed on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol and discharged. 

“Not much information was given to me so I did what I probably should not have done,” he told me. “I researched it on my own, online.” That's how he found Jessica Duran, MD, who runs the SCAD clinic at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, one of only a smattering of such programs across the country. 

Nick says his ejection fraction is now 50%. He is scheduled for a “head-to-tail” CT scan to evaluate for fibromuscular dysplasia, one of the possible etiologies of SCAD. He has been advised repeatedly to retire from extreme kayaking, but that advice isn't compatible with a happy life for him. 

I had the pleasure of hearing Duran speak on SCAD at the Vanderbilt Women's Heart and Neurology Symposium in Franklin, Tennessee. She pointed out that SCAD accounts for about 4% of all cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and most of these are in women. Men typically present with SCAD after extreme physical exertion whereas for the usually premenopausal women with SCAD it's more likely an emotionally traumatic experience. SCAD represents about 40% of myocardial infarction events in women younger than 50 years and between 15%-40% of pregnancy associated ACS cases. 

During her presentation, Duran flashed a slide demonstrating three distinct SCAD patterns as described by the Yip-Saw classification: In Type I, radiographic contrast penetrates the false lumen and gives the impression of “dye hanging up” during angiography after the contrast has cleared. It carries a lower risk of progression and fewer complications if mechanical intervention is required. 

Type 2a is described as a long smooth stenosis with normal distal vessel appearance. In Type 2b the stenosis continues to the distal area of the vessel. Type 3 is more typical angiographically of atherosclerosis but in the absence of traditional risk factors and lack of atheroma in other vessels. A high index of suspicion is required, and intravascular imaging may be necessary to classify. Total coronary occlusion, as experienced by Nick, is called SCAD Type 4 by some since it doesn't easily fit into the other categories. 

There are two main theories for SCAD: A hematoma spontaneously arises between two of the layers of the coronary artery or a rent occurs within the arterial wall. Patients better understand the phenomenon when I compare the walls of the coronary artery to the layers of an onion. As the walls separate, the inner most layer is displaced centrally inside the lumen limiting blood flow or obstructing it completely producing ischemia, myocardial infarction, and in some instances sudden death from ventricular fibrillation. 

Over 10 years ago, my friend Lisa (then age 40) experienced a SCAD-associated ventricular fibrillation arrest during an exercise class. Her ongoing ischemia and chest discomfort bought her a “full-metal jacket” of stents in her right coronary artery. Fortunately, she's doing great. In counter distinction to Lisa's therapy, Duran pointed out that medical therapy is the optimal treatment, including aspirin for a minimum of 1 year, “ideally life-long”, dual anti-platelet therapy for 4-6 weeks, and beta blockers to reduce recurrence. Indications for percutaneous intervention include left main dissection, ongoing ischemia, TIMI 0-1 flow, hemodynamic instability, and refractory angina. Coronary artery bypass grafting should be reserved for extensive dissections involving the left main coronary artery. 

Underlying conditions to consider according to Duran include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos IV, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, systemic inflammation, migraine disorder, or drug use (cocaine, meth, and THC). Inflammatory disorders associated with SCAD include systemic lupus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and sarcoidosis 

Because the condition is complex and occurs in a younger population, Duran admitted that “SCAD office visits are long visits.” It also takes time to carefully assess for a family history of fibromuscular dysplasia, extracoronary findings, or multivessel involvement — any of which are indications for genetic testing, as is recurrent SCAD and male sex. 

Then there is the required lifestyle discussion.

In women who've experienced SCAD, Duran recommends against pregnancy altogether but pointed out that this is based on “limited data.” “For women who decide to conceive, care should be delivered by a multidisciplinary cardio-obstetrics team throughout the pregnancy with delivery ideally at a level III/IV maternal care center,” she told me. “Planned vaginal deliveries are typically recommended.” 

I asked Duran about advice for very active SCAD patients. “Moderate aerobic exercise, interval training and strength training using lower resistance and higher repetitions are recommended,” she said. However, patients are advised to avoid competitive sports, high-intensity exercise, heavy isometric exercises that require straining or prolonged Valsalva, and extreme head and neck positions. 

She is fully transparent with athletes who wish to return to competitive sports. “Athletes need to know that physical activity, particularly extreme or unconventional has been identified as a trigger in a fair number of SCAD cases and thus at present the current expert consensus advises against the return to competitive sports.” 

The rate of recurrence is between 10%-20% with recommendations to avoid known triggers such as risky yoga poses, chiropractic manipulation, and roller coaster rides. She clarified further by email, “Ultimately I strongly believe that patients want to know the unfiltered truth and receive guidance as to how to proceed with their lives. And my job as their doctor is to help guide them on their journey and empower them with the information they need to make well-informed decisions about their future and enjoy a long, healthy life,” she said. 

Which brings me back to Nick Troutman. 

Nick is doing well. However, against medical advice and with a bottle of nitro in his pocket, he entered yet another Kayaking competition and won. “Does Dr Duran know that you competed in March?” I asked. “Uh….no,” he said after which he further explained his risk-taking, “I'm not trying to be a daredevil. I've got two kids and I'd like to live a long life and watch my kids grow up, but I'm not ready to sit on the couch for the next 60 years.” 

Nick's persona revolves around being an athlete, and he doesn't want that to end with SCAD. I suggested that if he keeps competing, he should make certain EMS is available on location at all of his events. 

But, I worry. 

As physicians, we must accept that it's up to the individual to judge what risks they will take. Nick lives his life as the ultimate free-styler pushing boundaries and gambling that SCAD will remain in his rear-view mirror. But given the substantial rate of recurrence, his return to competitive kayaking poses a high risk. 

In the end, all we can do is help our patients if they fall, even if that's 80 feet over the edge of a breathtaking waterfall in Washington State.

Maximum tumor diameter (MTD) showed a strong association with the risk for relapse in patients with limited-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) achieving PET negativity, with each centimeter increase in MTD linked to a 21% higher risk for relapse.

“This international validation study confirms MTD is strongly associated with relapse risk in patients with LS-HL [limited-stage HL] achieving PET− and informs decision-making around risk-adapted application of radiotherapy...Treatment modality and MTD were independent risk factors; patients with higher MTD receiving chemotherapy alone had the greatest relapse risk,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Elizabeth H. Phillips, PhD, Division of Cancer Sciences, The University of Manchester and Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, England. It was published online on May 13 in Blood Advances.

According to the authors, this study lacked centralized radiology review, which may have affected the consistency of MTD measurements across different imaging planes. Additionally, baseline PET assessment was not mandatory in either trial, limiting the ability to compare tumor diameter measurements with advanced PET metrics such as metabolic tumor volume.

This study received support from the National Institute for Health Research and Social Care, the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering at King's College London, and the National Institute for Health Research Manchester Biomedical Research Centre.

 May 23, 2025  

Medscape Medical News spoke with Karen B. Mitchell, MD, vice president of Student & Resident Initiatives at the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), about the effort. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Medscape Medical News: Some of these challenges have been apparent for many years. What problems are this new initiative attempting to address, and why is it imperative now?

Mitchell: The challenge we're facing is that it's harder for applicants to go find the program that they really want. So, we are aiming to have applicants find programs that are the right programs for them, while having programs also be able to find those applicants who are really interested in them. In family medicine, because of the high number of residency programs, that has become even more challenging for applicants to find us. We want to reduce the barriers that applicants may be facing.

We have the highest number of residency programs — over 800 — which also means increased challenges for the applicants to find the residency programs. Most programs have about seven slots, but some have as few as four. That is why we're looking at this now.

Medscape Medical News: What has been the trend in the number of medical students looking to enter primary care? The shortage of primary care physicians would lead us to think the numbers are down. Is that the case for family medicine?

Mitchell: It's not so much a decline. We were down this year in the main Match by 21 people — which when you're talking about 5000 matches, that's pretty stable. Meanwhile, the number of available positions in family medicine has grown. And that growth is happening in the locations we need for the future training of our primary care workforce.

Medscape Medical News: The initiative stresses the importance of “geographical distribution” of trainees in family medicine. Can you tell us a bit more about this goal — is it really a synonym for “rural” or is the term more expansive?

Mitchell: It is rural and more, in that what we aim for in family medicine is to be serving the communities across the country. We also know that our family medicine residents tend to stay in the areas and the settings where they do their training. And so, it becomes very important that family medicine residencies are designed to be based in the communities where we need the future workforce to be. So yes, it is rural, but we still would say there's community settings even in urban areas, where we also need more primary care physicians.

Medscape Medical News: What is your approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion issues now? Are you finding fewer diverse students going into family medicine? 

Mitchell: We know that a diverse physician workforce that reflects the population results in better health outcomes. We are concerned about legislation that bans any race-based mandates in medical schools and accreditations, and anything that's cutting off federal funding in medical schools could have a detrimental effect on training. So, we are quite concerned about that and we are committed to protecting these programs because they are essential in correcting historical underrepresentation in medicine and important to improve health outcomes in underserved communities.

Medscape Medical News: Some students go into medical school thinking they really do want to become a primary care physician or a family physician, and then somewhere along the way they change their mind. So, is the issue attracting people to begin with or keeping them on the track?

Mitchell: It's both. Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges tell us that around 4% or 5% of medical students entering medical school say they want to do family medicine. Those matching into family medicine in the first round of the Match represent about 11% of the total US seniors and graduates, with about 8% coming from US medical schools specifically. By the end of Match week, family medicine fills about 13% of all residency positions available. The fact that we get a much higher percentage out of that by the time they graduate says we are gaining students along the way. 

What we also know from our data about factors that influence the students' choice about family medicine is that creating deep and early relationships makes a difference. Having mentorship and then having positive family medicine experiences, especially in their third year, their clerkship year, those are all things that make a difference in choosing family medicine. And the AAFP is committed to strengthening all of those factors.

Part of the reason we're taking this broader look at the whole process is to be able to identify the bright spots where things are working. But we also recognize that, if you've seen one family medicine program, you've seen one family medicine program. They are so different, and that means what works really well for one program may not translate to work for other programs. We want to be able to identify where there may be an approach that really helped some programs that may be applicable to others.

Medscape Medical News: How might the Trump administration's efforts to cut loan forgiveness programs affect family physicians in particular?

Mitchell: The Public Service Loan Forgiveness [PSLF] program has been very important to our primary care physicians. We know AAFP members have enrolled in these student loan repayment programs and specifically in PSLF; 86% of our primary care workforce is enrolled in those kinds of programs.

We very much support that kind of loan repayment. It becomes very important as an incentive to pursue primary care. AAFP also supports some of the other loan repayment programs, such as the National Health Service Corps, which are very important for addressing some of the issues with physicians choosing to practice in primary care.

We also support the Resident Education Deferred Interest Act that was reintroduced earlier this year and allows medical students to defer their student loan interest during residency.

Medscape Medical News: What's the timeline like for this effort?

Mitchell: We are in the process of putting together a group of stakeholders from residency programs, including program directors and coordinators, advisors from medical schools, and learners themselves. We plan to have an in-person convening to bring together the ideas, and that's scheduled for this fall. What we're aiming for is that by the time we hit next year's Match day, in March of 2026, we have a good sense of where we're going for family medicine because we also know that any changes that we plan to implement will take at least another 1-2 years.

Mitchell reported having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

 May 23, 2025  

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted an exceptional circumstances positive opinion for Maapliv, a solution of amino acids intended for the treatment of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) in patients presenting with an acute decompensation episode from birth and who are not eligible for an oral and enteral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)-free formulation.

MSUD is a rare genetic disorder of BCAA metabolism. In this condition, buildup of toxic metabolites from BCAAs produced from protein breakdown leads to significant and potentially irreversible developmental effects. It may cause metabolic derangements, cerebral edema, seizures, coma, and respiratory failure, and it may be fatal. It affects fewer than 0.1 in 10,000 people in the EU, equivalent to fewer than 5000 people.

This is below the ceiling for orphan drug designation (5 in 10,000). In 2020, the EMA granted orphan designation to a solution of amino acids not containing any BCAAs, intended to be given by infusion to replace other sources of amino acids. At the time, the EMA said, there were no suitable treatments authorized in the EU for MSUD, and patients were managed with strict diets to control the amount of BCAAs taken in from proteins. Some forms of the disorder also responded to vitamin B supplements. Some patients needed hospitalization for enteral feeding or procedures to filter BCAAs directly from the blood. Other patients were judged suitable for liver transplantation, which restores the ability to break down BCAAs.

Maapliv, manufactured by Recordati Rare Diseases, is a combination of amino acids free of BCAA. It is used as a solution for infusion in combination with carbohydrate and lipid supplementation to prevent or reverse protein catabolism and promote anabolism in patients with MSUD decompensation, thereby reducing harmful alpha-keto acid levels.

The CHMP said that leucine normalization had been shown in patients with MSUD decompensation who are given Maapliv in five scientific publications that reported on parenteral use of BCAA-free solutions with the same formulation as Maapliv. Treatment with Maapliv should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of MSUD disease.

Detailed recommendations for the use of Maapliv will be described in the summary of product characteristics, which will be published on the EMA website in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorization has been granted by the European Commission.

In children undergoing cardiac surgery by thoracotomy, paravertebral blocks with ropivacaine reduced opioid consumption by nearly half within 24 hours after surgery compared with local anesthetic, while also reducing pain scores at 6 and 12 hours after the operation. However, the approach did not speed recovery from the procedure.

“Paravertebral blocks reduced sufentanil consumption and pain during the initial 18 hours after pediatric cardiac surgery but did not speed recovery or shorten ICU stays or the duration of hospitalization,” the researchers reported.

This study was led by Jingfei Guo and Yuan Jia, from Fuwai Hospital in Beijing, China. It was published online on May 14, 2025, in Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine.

Sufentanil was administered by nurses, which may not have been titrated precisely as per the needs of the patient. The researchers did not differentiate between pain evoked by movement, which is usually worse, from pain at rest.

This study received support from National High-Level Hospital Clinical Research Funding from Fuwai Hospital. The authors declared having no competing interests.

 May 23, 2025  

Alex Jahangir, MD, was thrilled 16 years ago to land a job as an orthopedic trauma surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. But between the time he was hired and the time he started his job, turmoil erupted within the department leaving him without much support.

One of the partners in the practice became ill, and “a lot of extra hands” were needed, Jahangir said. Yet several other surgeons had left. When he arrived for his first day of work, he didn't have an office space or a parking badge, and he was the only doctor taking calls for the team.

“What have you gotten yourself into?” he recalls his wife asking him.

Once a physician completes residency or fellowship training and becomes an attending physician, “the buck stops with you,” Jahangir told Medscape Medical News. Even for physicians entering jobs without the turmoil Jahangir experienced in his department, the transition to attending is not easy. “Truly…it's scary, it's hard, it can be very lonely…,” he said.

“As an attending, all of a sudden you realize people will listen to you and…maybe you're not fully sure that's the right thing to do or say, but you recognize ‘Hey…this is what I have to do,'” Jahangir said.

Residency training is generally done in a stepwise fashion with increasing levels of responsibility over the years, said John Allen, MD, assistant dean of student affairs at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. Most young attendings are “very well prepared and able to jump right in,” he said. Still, becoming an attending is a transition.

“The biggest difference to me was things that felt routine when I was a resident — when I had that safety net — suddenly felt like much higher stakes when I was an attending,” Allen said.

What are the best ways to navigate the transition from resident to attending with the accompanying shifts in responsibility and accountability? Medscape Medical News reached out to experts in the field to get their take.

“The first year is so hard because we all have complications. We all feel the stress of everything, thinking you should have all the answers,” said Jahangir, who now serves as vice chair in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and senior vice president for Provider Network Development at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Young doctors need to recognize what they don't know, Allen said, adding that this self-awareness is important at all levels of training but becomes even more key when doctors become attendings.

It's important to realize that mistakes can happen, Jahangir said.Don't think you're the only one who has ever had this happen, he said.

Staying up to date on medical guidelines and research becomes more self-driven as an attending, Allen said. Continuing medical education is more “curated” during training years and that changes as an attending.

“Make sure that you're reading. Staying current becomes more of something you have to deliberately do as an attending,” Allen said.

At the same time, a little grace is good. Recognize that it is normal to feels self-aware that you don't have much experience as a new attending. Imposter syndrome is real, Allen said.

“A lot of people do experience that when they're a new attending,” he said. “As you settle in and realize that you're making good decisions, you are helping, that imposter syndrome does tend to lift over time.”

Only after 16 years of practice can Jahangir finally say that when a student or resident approaches him to discuss a patient case, based on his breadth of knowledge in orthopedic trauma surgery, “I probably have seen it or have heard about it or could have an intelligent conversation about it,” he said.

Not only the practice of medicine but also people skills matter, Jahangir said. For example, if early career surgeons don't learn certain skills — like how to manage an operating room — well in the first year or two of practice, “I think it leads to a cascade of bad stuff that can happen in one's career that may eventually lead you to quit medicine, or to have a bad patient outcome, or to have a bad professional or liability outcome,” Jahangir said.

There are also steps a resident or fellow can take before becoming an attending to help ease the transition, such as being proactive when job searching, experts said.

“It's good to get a sense of the partners you're joining,” Jahangir advised and to see what the general “gestalt” is at the practice.

“Because if you have a bunch of partners that obviously aren't, don't care and only see you as a source so they have to take less calls, that may not result to a long-term successful practice,” he said.

Before signing on, early-career doctors should also ask about how the practice supports a new physician, Jahangir advised. Try to find out how many doctors have left the practice within the first 2 years of joining, he suggests. “Practices that have physicians that stay there 20, 30 years are probably a good, functional group of people.”

It's also crucial to read your employment contract carefully before accepting your first job out of residency or moving to a new one, said Maria Phillis, MD, an Ohio physician who is also chair of the Young Physician Section at the Ohio State Medical Association, Columbus, Ohio, a lobbying group. Phillis also has a law degree.

“Like really read it,” she said of the contract. “Really understand what [malpractice] coverage you are being offered. If it doesn't explain in your contract what that looks like, then ask for supplemental documents or policies that exist,” she said.

“Have a really clear understanding of what it is that the hospital is willing to cover for you, whenever you leave that position,” Phillis said.

Many early-career doctors change jobs within a couple of years, so it's important to make sure that you have a tail coverage that's either covered by your employer or that you're covering, Phillis said. Tail coverage applies to malpractice claims made after the physician's policy ends regarding services rendered during the policy coverage.

Once in the job, make sure to cultivate a solid support network, experts said.

Just like a newly hired chief executive officer might hire a professional coach, new attending doctors should seek out support too, Jahangir said. “It's a big job. Anytime there's a big transition into a big job, it's good to have that.”

Early-career doctors might be hesitant to ask colleagues to talk through a patient case or ask for help if needed, but they should do it anyway, experts suggested. Asking for help is a sign of strength, Allen said.

“If you genuinely are not confident, phone a friend. Like ask for help. That help is still there,” Allen said. “You may think it's not, but there are lots of ways that you can curbside a friend or run a case with a mentor.”

“It's ok to feel overwhelmed and get help,” Jahangir said.

He was able to survive the chaotic start to his job in large measure because a mutual friend introduced him to someone who became a mentor — the healthcare group's deputy chief executive officer Wright Pinson, MD. Pinson saw that Jahangir was drowning, “and he took me under his wing, and he gave me the support and he would check in on me,” Jahangir said.

The job is not the only thing that will change after becoming an attending. There are also personal transitions that go along with it.

“Recognize that you're transitioning not only to a new career, but your life changes such as your tax bracket changes and people approach you differently,” Jahangir said, adding that some who approach don't always do so with the greatest intent, he said. “Like, all of a sudden every financial advisor wants to come hang out.”

Make sure you have a good financial plan in place to stay secure, he advises. For example, Jahangir never thought about life insurance or disability insurance as a resident.

Early-career physicians are often paying back loans and potentially have lots of credit card debt from trying to survive on a resident's salary, Phillis said. “Now you're out of training, and you're trying to figure out what to do with your salary so that you are financially stable,” she said.

Before he was invited to lead his division 8 years ago, Jahangir observed that every year there would be turnover in his department.

“And I realized that the reason people were coming and going was because nobody was thinking about the other part of it,” he said, referring to work-life balance. “So now when we hire someone, I'm like, what is it that you, what excites you outside of medicine?”

To protect personal time, Jahangir changed journal club from evening to early morning hours. He also supported team members in pursuing their outside interests. One colleague ran for political office, while another who had an interest in agriculture took a more active role on his farm.

It shows “that if you build a supportive system that people — the work's hard, but people know they come here and we'll support them professionally and personally,” Jahangir said.

 May 23, 2025  

An analysis of more than 21,000 people worldwide suggested that 56% used the snooze function on their alarm regularly, interrupting sleep patterns researchers said are important for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Women had significantly longer snooze durations than men (11.5 vs 10.2 minutes), with heavy users averaging 20.2 minutes of daily snoozing, investigators found.

“The hours just before waking are rich in rapid eye movement sleep. Hitting the snooze alarm will interrupt these critical stages of sleep and typically only offer you light sleep in between snooze alarms. The best approach for optimizing your sleep and next day performance is to set your alarm for the latest possible time, then commit to getting out of bed when your first alarm goes off,” lead investigator Rebecca Robbins, PhD, Division of Sleep Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, said in a press release.

This study was published online on May 19 in Scientific Reports.

This study's sleep duration likely overestimated actual sleep due to unmeasured sleep latency and awakenings. Data reflected time in bed, not true sleep time. Snooze alarm data were objective, but users may have been awake during snooze periods, potentially inflating snooze estimates. Data on age and self-reported feelings on waking up were not available. Additionally, wake time variability and self-reported sleep quality were not assessed.

President Donald Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.

The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants — often children — regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.

But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.

The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.

The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.

Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.

Two of the states — Utah and Illinois — have ""trigger"" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.

The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.

Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding — about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.

California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.

“We need to stand our ground,"" he said. ""California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.

“Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,” Newsom said.

In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.

Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.

Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.

""We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,"" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.

Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.

Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.

""There are no great alternatives, politically,"" he said. ""It's a prisoner's dilemma — a move in either direction does not make much sense.""

Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.

Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.

""This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,"" Slonaker said.

In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.

Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. ""It would be a hard situation, obviously,"" she said.

Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.

She said the provision shows Republicans' ""hostility against immigrants"" and that ""they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.""

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as ""an open doormat,"" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.

A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.

The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, helping reduce the national uninsured rate to a historic low.

The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.

In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.

By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.

The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.

Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to ""support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.""

Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a ""red herring"" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.

The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.

The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.

The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.

The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.

The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.

With funding from the Spencer Foundation, a private foundation focused on funding education studies, a Wayne State University research team is examining the long-term effects of bullying and mental health on social and academic progress in adolescents.

Hannah L. Schacter, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and an affiliate faculty at the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute, received the grant alongside her co-principal investigator, Adam Hoffman, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences.

The one-year grant for nearly $50,000 is funded through the Foundation's Small Research Grants on Education program and will benefit their study, ""Understanding the Effects of Peer Victimization and Mental Health in High School on College Persistence.""

The grant focuses on how adolescents' peer experiences during high school affect their long-term outcomes, specifically their academic persistence during college. We have quite a bit of evidence that kids who are bullied by their peers not only do worse in terms of their mental health, but they also experience negative academic effects. In middle and high school, they show worse classroom engagement, get lower grades, and feel less motivated.""

Hannah L. Schacter, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Wayne State University

Schacter said that researchers know much less about how such effects linger beyond high school, particularly on young people's academic progress.

""We have an ongoing longitudinal study that we started in the fall of 2020 with a cohort of ninth graders,"" Schacter said. ""We've been doing surveys and follow-up surveys with this group throughout their four years of high school. This grant allows us to continue to observe this cohort in college and see if their previous experiences with bullying are affecting them academically or socially after high school.""

Schacter hopes to continue the study moving forward to observe a wider range of students exposed to different circumstances to see if their results are consistent.

""The current cohort started ninth grade during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Schacter said. ""I'd like to recruit another larger cohort in the future to compare some of what we are seeing among students who weren't in high school during COVID.""

""This funding from the Spencer Foundation will allow Dr. Schacter and her research team to gain valuable insight into the long-term effect that bullying has on our younger generation,"" said Ezemenari M. Obasi, Ph.D., vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. ""I look forward to seeing the impact of this important work.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Living in disadvantaged neighborhoods linked to earlier menopause","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250522/Living-in-Disadvantaged-Neighborhoods-Linked-to-Earlier-Menopause.aspx","Fri, 23 May 2025 01:17:00 GMT","

A new study led by the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute highlights the significant impact of living in disadvantaged neighborhoods on the onset of menopause. The research followed 691 women from pregnancy to midlife and found that those residing in highly vulnerable neighborhoods, particularly within 10 years of perimenopause onset, experienced menopause approximately two years earlier than those in less vulnerable areas.

The study, ""Neighborhood Vulnerability and Age of Natural Menopause and Menopause Symptoms Among Midlife Women"" was published May 22 in JAMA Network Open.

Women experiencing more intense menopausal symptoms have demonstrated lower quality of life and cognitive performance. Additionally, women who undergo menopause at an earlier age face a higher risk of developing long-term health issues; specifically, a 1-year decrease in menopause age is linked to 2-3% higher risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality. At present, there are significant gaps in understanding how neighborhood contexts may affect reproductive aging in midlife women.

Identifying risk factors for earlier menopause is important for public health, potentially informing strategies to reduce the potential for adverse outcomes. Our research indicates that living in less vulnerable neighborhoods may be a key factor in preventing earlier menopause and reducing future disease risk.""

Izzuddin Aris, Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor of Population Medicine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and senior author of the study

The study included nearly 700 women from Project Viva, a prospective cohort in eastern Massachusetts, followed from April 1999 to August 2021. Researchers used geocoded residential addresses to assess neighborhood vulnerability and its effects on menopause onset and symptoms. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was used to measure neighborhood disadvantage, considering factors such as socioeconomic status, household composition, and racial and ethnic minority status. Study findings showed women who resided in neighborhoods with very high (vs. very low) vulnerability exhibited higher risk of earlier natural menopause onset (by approximately 2 years), driven primarily by socioeconomic status and household composition. No associations with menopause symptom severity were observed.

The findings underscore the necessity of addressing neighborhood contexts to level reproductive health outcomes across populations.

""As certain characteristics of disadvantaged neighborhoods, such as limited access to social and economic resources, can be modified through community-led initiatives or policies implemented at the local and federal levels, future research is warranted to investigate whether such strategies could alleviate the association between neighborhood disadvantage and early menopause,"" added Aris.

A new review was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on May 8, 2025, titled ""The chemopreventive effects of native Brazilian plants on stomach cancer: A review of the last 25 years.""

The study led by first author Iara Lopes Lemos and corresponding author Mario Roberto Marostica Junior from the University of Campinas reviewed scientific studies published over the past 25 years that examine how native Brazilian plants may help prevent stomach cancer (SC). Their findings suggest that several plant species contain bioactive compounds with potential anticancer properties. By compiling and analyzing this research, the authors aim to highlight the underexplored value of Brazil's biodiversity in the search for new cancer prevention strategies.

Stomach cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers globally and is often diagnosed at advanced stages. The review notes that many factors contribute to the disease, including poor diet, infections, and genetics. However, evidence shows that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in natural compounds like polyphenols and flavonoids may help lower the risk. The reviewed literature suggests that native Brazilian plants may offer similar protective effects.

""[…] a regular consumption of fruit and vegetables rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols and flavonoids, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and chemopreventive effects on SC.""

The study covers ten native species, including açaí, cacao, guava, pitanga, jambu, and physalis. Extracts from these plants showed signs of reducing cancer cell growth, triggering cell death, and slowing disease progression. Although the exact biological mechanisms remain unclear for many cases, some studies reported reduced inflammation and disruption of cancer-related signaling. These findings point to the possibility that natural plant-based substances could support efforts to prevent or manage SC.

Most of the studies included in the review were conducted on laboratory cell models, with very few using animal models and none involving clinical trials. This limited coverage means that while the early results are promising, more research is needed to understand how these plant compounds work in the human body and to evaluate their safety and effectiveness in real-world settings.

This review emphasizes the value of exploring Brazil's rich plant biodiversity for medical purposes. Many of these species remain scientifically underexplored, especially in the context of cancer prevention. By drawing attention to their potential, the authors hope to encourage more research that could lead to the development of new, natural therapies. Their work contributes to the growing recognition that traditional and natural sources can play a meaningful role in modern medicine.

A Ludwig Cancer Research study has discovered that the metabolic decline that accompanies aging impairs the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy, an immunotherapy in which T cells of the immune system are taken from patients, engineered to target cancer cells and reinfused into the same patients for treatment.

Researchers led by Ludwig Lausanne's Helen Carrasco Hope and Nicola Vannini, and their colleague Denis Migliorini of Geneva University Hospitals, report in the current issue of Nature Cancer how dysfunctional mitochondria-which are essentially the batteries of the cell-compromise the ability of CAR-T cells derived from aged mice to kill cancer cells. This dysfunction, they show, stems from the age-related decline in pools of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a molecule of critical importance to energy production, metabolism and mitochondrial function. The researchers report that replenishing NAD+ reverses this dysfunction in preclinical models of cancer, suggesting a novel strategy to enhance cell therapies for older cancer patients.

Our findings strengthen the growing recognition that aging fundamentally reshapes immune cell function and metabolism. They highlight the urgent need to model age more accurately in preclinical studies so that therapies are developed with the real-world cancer population in mind-where most patients are older adults.""

Helen Carrasco Hope, Ludwig Lausanne

The researchers show that CAR-T cells produced from the T cells of aged mice tend to lack ""stemness""-the capacity to expand rapidly and efficiently kill their cellular targets. These capabilities are restored by NAD+ supplementation. To do that, the team used NAD+-boosting compounds currently under clinical investigation for other conditions, demonstrating that their strategy may be readily translated for clinical evaluation as a support for CAR-T cell cancer therapies.

Notably, parallel analyses of clinical datasets by the researchers confirmed that both chronological age and NAD⁺-related gene expression correlate with outcomes of CAR-T therapy in patients.

""This is a major step toward personalized and age-conscious immunotherapy,"" said Vannini. ""By correcting age-related metabolic defects, we could improve outcomes for a large segment of cancer patients.""

Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and UCL have analyzed ancient DNA from Borrelia recurrentis, a type of bacteria that causes relapsing fever, pinpointing when it evolved to spread through lice rather than ticks, and how it gained and lost genes in the process.

This transition may have coincided with changes in human lifestyles, like living closer together and the beginning of the wool trade.

Borrelia recurrentis bacteria cause relapsing fever, an illness with many recurring episodes of fever, which is typically found today in areas with poor sanitation or overcrowding, such as refugee camps. It is a distant cousin of the bacteria that today cause Lyme disease.

Historical records in Britain have referred to periods of a 'sweating sickness' or 'epidemic fever' which may have been caused by B. recurrentis, but limited data means the likely cause of these outbreaks remains unknown.

Only three known species of bacteria, including B. recurrentis, have transitioned from being carried primarily by ticks to lice, changing the potential severity of the disease. Until now it was unknown when B. recurrentis made the jump from ticks to lice and what impact this had on disease transmission and severity in humans. 

In research published today in Science, the scientists sequenced the whole genome from four samples of B. recurrentis. Ranging from 2,300 to 600 years ago, their samples include the oldest B. recurrentis genome to date. These ancient samples were obtained from the skeletons of people who were infected hundreds of years ago. The DNA is a shadow of the bacteria that once circulated in their blood and has been captured in bones and teeth.

The individuals' teeth contained traces of B. recurrentis DNA. Two samples had relatively high amounts of the pathogen, suggesting these individuals may have died from a severe, acute infection, or that the DNA was particularly well preserved.

The researchers looked at differences in the ancient genomes and modern-day B. recurrentis to map how the bacteria has changed over time, finding that the species likely diverged from its nearest tick-borne cousin, B. duttonii, about 6,000 to 4,000 years ago.

They compared the B. recurrentis genomes with B. duttonii, finding that much of the genome was lost during the tick-to-louse transition but that new genes were also gained over time. These genetic changes affected the bacteria's ability to hide from the immune system and also share DNA with neighbouring bacteria, suggesting B. recurrentis had specialised to survive within the human louse.

Based on these ancient and modern genomes, the divergence from the bacteria's tick-borne ancestor happened during the transition from the Neolithic period to the Early Bronze Age. This was a time of change in human lifestyles, as people began to domesticate animals and live in more dense settlements. This may have helped B. recurrentis spread from person to person more easily.

The researchers also raise the possibility that the development of sheep farming for wool at this time may have given an advantage to louse-borne pathogens, as wool has better conditions for lice to lay eggs.

They conclude that the evolution of B. recurrentis highlights that a combination of genetic and environmental changes can help pathogens spread and infect populations more easily.

Louse-borne relapsing fever is a neglected disease with limited modern genomes, making it difficult to study its diversity. Adding four ancient B. recurrentis genomes to the mix has allowed us to create an evolutionary time series and shed light on how the genetics of the bacteria have changed over time. Although there's a trend towards genome decay as it adapted to the human louse vector, we've shown that the evolution of B. recurrentis was dynamic until about 1,000 years ago, when it looks similar to present-day genomes.""

Pooja Swali, Research Fellow at UCL, former Crick PhD student and first author

Pontus Skoglund, Group Leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Crick, and co-senior author, said: ""Ancient DNA can enhance our understanding of significant but understudied diseases like relapsing fever. Understanding how bacteria such as ​​B. recurrentis​ became more ​severe​​ in the past may help us understand how diseases could change in the future. The time points we've identified suggest that ​​changes in human societies​ such as new clothing material or living in larger groups​ may have allowed B. recurrentis to jump vectors and become more lethal, an example of how pathogens and humans have co-evolved."" 

Lucy van Dorp, Group Leader at UCL, and co-senior author, said: ""Genetic analysis of these infections in ancient humans has allowed us to directly track how B. recurrentis has juggled loss and gain of genes during its evolution. Its ability to spread and cause disease appears to be context-dependent, with ancient DNA allowing us to speculate on the important role of past human interactions and behaviour in creating conditions conducive to disease spread. More samples will help us to narrow down the events which led to this tick-to-louse transition and the genetic mechanisms which have helped the bacteria thrive using either vector.""

National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists have developed a new surgical technique for implanting multiple tissue grafts in the eye's retina. The findings in animals may help advance treatment options for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is a leading cause of vision loss among older Americans. A report about the technique published today in JCI Insight.

In diseases such as AMD, the light-sensitive retina tissue at the back of the eye degenerates. Scientists are testing therapies for restoring damaged retinas with grafts of tissue grown in the lab from patient-derived stem cells. Until now, surgeons have only been able to place one graft in the retina, limiting the area that can be treated in patients, and as well as the ability to conduct side-by-side comparisons in animal models. Such comparisons are crucial for confirming that the tissue grafts are integrating with the retina and the underlying blood supply from a network of tiny blood vessels known as the choriocapillaris.

For the technique, investigators designed a new surgical clamp that maintains eye pressure during the insertion of two tissue patches in immediate succession while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue.

In animal models, the scientists used their newly designed surgical technique to compare two different grafts placed sequentially in the same experimentally induced AMD-like lesion. One graft consisted of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells grown on a biodegradable scaffold. RPE cells support and nourish the retina's light-sensing photoreceptors. In AMD, vision loss occurs alongside the loss of RPE cells and photoreceptors. In the lab, RPE cells are grown from human blood cells after they've been converted into stem cells. The second graft consisted of just the biodegradable scaffold to serve as a control.

Post surgery, scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze retinal images and compare the effects of each graft. They observed that the RPE grafts promoted the survival of photoreceptors, while photoreceptors near scaffold-only grafts died at a much higher rate. Additionally, they were able to confirm for the first time that the RPE graft also regenerated the choriocapillaris, which supplies the retina with oxygen and nutrients.

The findings expand on the capability demonstrated in an ongoing, NIH-led first-in-human clinical trial of patient-derived RPE grafts for the dry form of AMD.

The work was supported by the National Eye Institute Intramural Research Program.

Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a group of genetic disorders that lead to progressive vision loss as the light-sensing cells of the eye-the photoreceptors-die due to mutations in genes needed for their function and survival.

Gene therapy has emerged as a promising approach, replacing or supplementing defective genes to preserve or restore vision. Yet, most existing gene therapy strategies have been developed and tested in early disease stages-leaving a major gap in treating patients diagnosed after significant retinal damage has already occurred.

Now, in a study published in Molecular Therapy, researchers from the Division of Experimental Retinal Therapies at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine (Penn Vet) and their collaborators have developed a powerful new toolkit to help close that gap.

Led by Penn Vet's Raghavi Sudharsan, an assistant professor of experimental ophthalmology, and William A. Beltran, the Corinne R. Henry Bower Endowed Professor of Ophthalmology, the team developed four novel photoreceptor-specific promoters. These ""short segments of DNA act as molecular 'switches' to turn on the therapeutic gene in target cells, driving strong and specific gene expression in rod and cone photoreceptors even in mid-to-late stages of disease,"" explains Sudharsan, the lead author on the paper.

""Most currently-used promoters have been tested only in healthy animal models, and their performance often declines when the retina degenerates,"" continues Sudharsan. ""In contrast,"" she says, ""the newly developed promoters were selected based on their ability to turn on gene activity in retinas that had already lost more than half of their photoreceptors-making them more relevant for the stages of disease at which patients are frequently diagnosed."" In head-to-head comparisons, the new promoters outperformed the widely used GRK1 promoter in both expression strength and specificity.

This study addresses one of the biggest hurdles in IRD treatment: how to deliver effective gene therapy after a large portion of the retina has already degenerated. We were particularly excited by the performance of the GNGT2-based promoters, which showed strong expression in both rods and cones, even at advanced disease stages. And their small size-under 850 base pairs-makes them ideal for [adeno-associated virus] AAV packaging, unlike some conventional cone promoters that are significantly larger.""

Raghavi Sudharsan, assistant professor of experimental ophthalmology, University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine

The team also emphasized that the high specificity of these promoters for photoreceptors may help limit off-target effects and reduce potential immune responses-important considerations for safety and long-term efficacy.

The investigators used a combination of transcriptomic analysis, in silico modeling, and in vivo screening in large-animal models to identify a suite of novel, short promoters that remain active in degenerating photoreceptors. These include promoters derived from the GNGT2, IMPG2, and PDE6H genes, which demonstrated strong, cell-specific expression when delivered via AAVs into the retinas of canine models mimicking human IRDs.

""These findings highlight the importance of testing promoters in clinically relevant models and at appropriate disease stages, something that unfortunately cannot be established in cell cultures or retinal organoids,"" says senior author William A. Beltran, who directs the Division of Experimental Retinal Therapies. ""They lay the foundation for a new generation of gene therapies that are more potent, precise, and responsive to the real-world clinical needs of patients with inherited retinal degenerations, whether people or animals.""

A provisional patent on the promoter technology has been filed by the University of Pennsylvania.

William Beltran is the Corinne R. and Henry Bower Endowed Professor of Ophthalmology and Director of the Division of Experimental Retinal Therapies in the Department of Clinical Sciences & Advanced Medicine at the School of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania.

Raghavi Sudharsan is a research assistant professor of experimental ophthalmology in the Department of Clinical Sciences & Advanced Medicine at Penn Vet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Confocal microscopy may help identify biomarkers for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250522/Confocal-microscopy-may-help-identify-biomarkers-for-chemotherapy-induced-neuropathy.aspx","Fri, 23 May 2025 02:12:00 GMT","

A University of Arizona Comprehensive Cancer Center researcher received a $2.4 million National Cancer Institute grant to develop a noninvasive, confocal microscope to examine nerve endings of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in the hopes of identifying potential biomarkers for the disease.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, or CIPN, can be severe and debilitating, often causing physical limitations, including numbness, weakness and pain in the hands and feet of patients, and reduced quality of life.

Patients with CIPN are known to have a reduced number of Meissner corpuscles, which are nerve endings responsible for transmitting the sensations of light touch and low vibration. Dongkyun Kang, PhD, an associate professor of optical sciences at the U of A James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences, hopes to use confocal microscopy images to find and count Meissner corpuscles, eventually leading to a potential imaging biomarker.

""CIPN symptoms can cause high levels of discomfort and present multiple challenges in the daily lives of cancer patients,"" said Kang, who has an additional appointment in the U of A College of Engineering's Department of Biomedical Engineering and is a member of the BIO5 Institute. ""Using this approach, we may be able to identify CIPN earlier to stop symptoms from progressing and possibly prevent the condition altogether.""

Kang's lab has pioneered low-cost confocal microscopy over the past seven years. His team was the first to demonstrate that noninvasive microscopy can be built at low cost, which makes it highly accessible in a wide variety of clinical settings.

This study will build the evidence that our noninvasive microscopy approach can provide quantitative imaging biomarkers for CIPN monitoring, treatment and research. This grant will also support a clinical study to evaluate the new microscope in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.""

Dongkyun Kang, PhD, associate professor of optical sciences, U of A James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences

Kang said his goal is to change the diagnostic focus from subjective, qualitative markers, including patient and clinician questionnaires, to objective, quantitative biomarkers that could support personalized care for patients with CIPN.

""The work Dr. Kang has been doing exemplifies the Cancer Center's approach to precision prevention and therapy,"" said Dan Theodorescu, MD, PhD, the Nancy C. and Craig M. Berge endowed chair for the director of the Cancer Center. ""I'm excited to see how his study evolves, especially given its potential for global impact.""

Kang's co-investigators on the five-year grant include Clara Curiel-Lewandrowski, MD, a professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Dermatology at the U of A College of Medicine – Tucson, a co-director of the U of A Skin Cancer Institute and a BIO5 Institute member; and Denise Roe, DrPH, a professor at the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health and the director of the U of A Cancer Center Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource. Co-investigators from Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital are Sabrina Ramnarine, MD, PhD, and Majid Kazmi, MD. Co-investigators from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are Milind Rajadhyaksha, PhD, and Kivanc Kose, PhD.

This research is supported by the National Cancer Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health, under award no. 1R01CA301271-01.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening complication in children with serious underlying conditions such as heart defects or cancer. Treatment or prevention of thrombosis poses an additional challenge in everyday clinical practice. A therapy using the active ingredient rivaroxaban specifically tailored to children was successfully tested for the first time in 2020. Now, long-term data confirm the benefits of this drug treatment even for extended use. The study was conducted by an international research team led by MedUni Vienna and has been published in the journal ""The Lancet Haematology"".

The long-term data collected by the research team led by Christoph Male from the Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at MedUni Vienna provides the first reliable evidence for extended anticoagulation in children. The study assessed extended treatment in a cohort of around 500 children and adolescents from the EINSTEIN Jr study, whose data on acute phase anticoagulation was already published in 2020. Those study results, also published under the leadership of MedUni Vienna, showed that the anticoagulant rivaroxaban is at least as effective and safe as the standard anticoagulants used to date in children with venous thromboembolism, but also offers a number of advantages for young patients. The positive results paved the way for the worldwide approval of rivaroxaban for children in 2021. Until now, there has been a lack of research on extended anticoagulation in children with VTE, and with rivaroxaban in particular - a gap now closed by the recently published long-term study: The research shows that even with long-term treatment of up to one year, there is only a low risk of VTE recurrence and serious bleeding. Rivaroxaban is therefore the first scientifically proven age-appropriate alternative to the standard anticoagulation therapies available for children up to now.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs when blood clots form in deep veins causing local vessel obstruction or embolization of the clot to the lungs - a potentially life-threatening condition. While this condition has been well researched in adults, there has long been a lack of solid data for children. Until recently, treatment with anticoagulant drugs was based on the off-label use of drugs that were originally developed for adults, such as heparin or vitamin K antagonists. These drugs have some disadvantages that are particularly problematic for children, such as administration by injection and the need for regular blood tests. Direct oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban, which have several advantages in practical use, were also originally developed for adults, but in recent years have been specifically adapted for children and tested in clinical trials.

Our EINSTEIN Jr. study and the long-term investigation now available show that rivaroxaban is an effective and safe option for preventing recurrent thrombosis in children, not only during for acute treatment but also extended treatment - and thus offers the first scientifically sound, age-appropriate alternative to existing standard therapies.""

Christoph Male, study leader 

The importance of the drug in anticoagulation in children is also highlighted in an accompanying editorial in The Lancet Haematology.

Larry Saltzman has blood cancer. He's also a retired doctor, so he knows getting covid-19 could be dangerous for him — his underlying illness puts him at high risk of serious complications and death. To avoid getting sick, he stays away from large gatherings, and he's comforted knowing healthy people who get boosters protect him by reducing his exposure to the virus.

Until now, that is.

Vaccine opponents and skeptics in charge of federal health agencies — starting at the top with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — are restricting access to covid shots that were a signature accomplishment of President Donald Trump's first term and cost taxpayers about $13 billion to develop, produce, and distribute. The agencies are narrowing vaccination recommendations, pushing drugmakers to perform costly clinical studies, and taking other steps that will result in fewer people getting protection from a virus that still kills hundreds each week in the U.S.

""There are hundreds of thousands of people who rely on these vaccines,"" said Saltzman, 71, of Sacramento, California. ""For people who are immunocompromised, if there aren't enough people vaccinated, we lose the ring that's protecting us. We're totally vulnerable.""

The Trump administration on May 20 rolled out tougher approval requirements for covid shots, described as a covid-19 ""vaccination regulatory framework,"" that could leave millions of Americans who want boosters unable to get them.

The FDA will encourage new clinical trials on the widely used vaccines before approving them for children and healthy adults. The requirements could cost drugmakers tens of millions of dollars and are likely to leave boosters largely out of reach for hundreds of millions of Americans this fall.

Under the new guidance, vaccines will be available for high-risk individuals and seniors. But the FDA will encourage drugmakers to commit to conducting post-marketing clinical trials in healthy adults when the agency approves covid vaccines for those populations.

For the past five years, the shots have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for everyone 6 months and older. They have been available each fall after being updated to reflect circulating strains of the virus, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials.

Vinay Prasad, who leads the FDA's division overseeing vaccines, cited ""distrust of the American public"" as he announced the new guidelines at a May 20 briefing.

""We have launched down this multiyear campaign of booster after booster after booster,"" he said, adding that ""we do not have gold-standard science to support this for average-risk, low-risk Americans.""

The details were outlined in a May 20 article in The New England Journal of Medicine, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. He and Prasad later followed up with the briefing, which appeared the same day on YouTube.

The added limits on access aren't the result of any recent data showing there are new health risks from the covid vaccines. Instead, they reflect a different regulatory stance from Kennedy, who has a history of anti-vaccine activism, and Makary, who has questioned the safety data on covid mRNA shots.

Announcing a major regulatory change in a medical journal and YouTube video is a highly unusual approach that still leaves many questions about implementation unanswered. It remains unclear when the changes will go into effect or whether there will be any public comment period. The changes were announced by the administration before an FDA advisory committee meeting on May 22 to consider the 2026 covid vaccine formula.

It's a sharp reversal from the first Trump administration, which launched Operation Warp Speed — the effort that led to the development of the covid shots. Trump called the vaccines the ""gold standard"" and a ""monumental national achievement.""

The announcement is rattling some patient advocacy groups, doctors, nursing home leaders, and researchers who worry about the ramifications. They say higher-risk individuals will be more likely to get covid if people who aren't at risk don't get boosters that can help reduce transmission. And they say the FDA's restrictions go too far, because they don't provide exceptions for healthy individuals who work in high-risk settings, such as hospitals, who may want a covid booster for protection.

The limits will also make it harder to get insurance coverage for the vaccines. And the FDA's new stance could also increase vaccine hesitancy by undermining confidence in covid vaccines that have already been subject to rigorous safety review, said Kate Broderick, chief innovation officer at Maravai Life Sciences, which makes mRNA products for use in vaccine development.

""For the public, it raises questions,"" she said. ""If someone has concerns, I'd like them to know that of all the vaccines, the ones with the most understood safety profile are probably covid-19 vaccines. There is an incredible body of data and over 10 billion doses given.""

Some doctors and epidemiologists say it could leave healthy people especially vulnerable if more virulent strains of covid emerge and they can't access covid shots.

""It's not based on science,"" said Rob Davidson, an emergency room doctor in Michigan and executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care, which works to expand health care access. ""It's what we were all worried would happen. It risks peoples' lives.""

Current federal regulators say there is no high-quality evidence showing that vaccinating healthy people, including health workers who are near or around immunocompromised people, provides an additional benefit.

""It is possible, actually, that such approvals and strategies provide false reassurance and lead to increased harms,"" Prasad said.

The covid vaccines underwent clinical trials to assess safety, and they have been subject to ongoing surveillance and monitoring since they obtained emergency use authorization from the FDA amid the pandemic. Heart issues and allergic reactions can occur but are rare, according to the CDC.

On a separate track, the FDA on May 21 posted letters sent in April to makers of the mRNA covid vaccines to add information about possible heart injury on warning labels, a move that one former agency official described as overkill. The action came after the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a panel of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, held a hearing on alleged adverse events associated with covid vaccines.

Limiting boosters to healthy people goes against guidance from some medical groups.

""The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and the best way to protect children,"" Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email. ""Young children under 5 continue to be at the highest risk, with that risk decreasing as they get older.""

The covid booster clampdown is supported by many adherents of the ""Make America Healthy Again"" movement, which casts suspicion on traditional medicine. Some opponents of covid mRNA vaccines say without evidence that the shots cause ""turbo"" cancer, are genetic bioweapons, and cause more heart damage than the covid virus.

There is no evidence the shots lead to rapid and aggressive cancers. Cancer rates decreased an average of 1.7% per year for men and 1.3% for women from 2018 to 2022, according to the National Institutes of Health. The covid vaccines debuted in 2021.

Federal regulators say narrowing who can get the boosters will align the U.S. with policies of European nations. But other countries have vastly different economic structures for health care and approaches to preventive care. Many European countries, for example, don't recommend flu shots for the entire population. The U.S. does in part because of the financial drain attributed to lost productivity when people are sick.

They also want more information. ""I think there's a void of data,"" Makary told CBS News on April 29. ""And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data.""

A massive five-year study on covid vaccine safety by the Global Vaccine Data Network, involving millions of people, was underway, with about a year left before completion. The Trump administration terminated funding for the project as part of cuts directed by the president's Department of Government Efficiency, and work on the study has stopped for now.

There are a multitude of studies, however, on the vaccines' effectiveness in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death.

Limiting boosters for healthy people can be risky, some doctors say, because people don't always know when they fall into higher-risk categories, such as individuals who are prediabetic or have high blood pressure. The covid vaccine restrictions could deter them from getting boosted, and they might experience worse complications from the virus as a result. For example, about 40% of people with hepatitis C are unaware of their condition, according to a study published in 2023.

The number of people getting covid vaccines has already dropped significantly since the height of the crisis. More than half of the more than 258 million adults in the U.S. had gotten a covid vaccination as of May 2021, according to the CDC. In each of the past two seasons, less than 25% of Americans received boosters, CDC data shows.

While deaths from the virus have dropped, covid remains a risk, especially when cases peak in December and January. Weekly covid deaths topped 2,580 as recently as January 2024, according to CDC data.

Some high-risk individuals are worried that the new restrictions are just the first salvo in halting all access to mRNA shots. ""The HHS motivation really is hidden, and it's to dismiss all mRNA technology,"" said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota.

Officials at the NIH have told scientists to remove references to mRNA in grant applications. HHS also announced plans in May to develop new vaccines without mRNA technology, which uses messenger RNA to instruct cells to make proteins that trigger an immune response.

Rose Keller, 23, is concerned about future access to covid shots. She would be eligible under the current announcement — she has cystic fibrosis, a progressive genetic condition that makes the mucus in her lungs thick and sticky, so covid could land her in the hospital. But she is concerned the Trump administration may go further and restrict access to the vaccines as part of a broader opposition to mRNA technology.

""I've had every booster that's available to me,"" said Keller, a government employee in Augusta, Maine. ""It's a real worry if I don't have the protection of a covid booster.""

Radboudumc researchers Kirsten van Abeelen, Edwin Ardiansyah, Sofiati Dian, Vinod Kumar, Reinout van Crevel and Arjan van Laarhoven used metabolomics to study cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from tuberculous meningitis patients in Vietnam and Indonesia, with long-standing collaborators from Bandung and Jakarta (Indonesia), the Broad Institute (Boston) and the Oxford University Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam).

Meningitis is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Damaging inflammation contributes to its poor prognosis. Corticosteroids reduce mortality, but nearly 50% of patients still die or are left disabled. The researchers hypothesized that metabolic pathways may influence disease outcome and help develop more effective host-directed therapy. They measured levels of 469 metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 1,067 Vietnamese and Indonesian tuberculous meningitis patients with and without HIV before the start of treatment, and observed these patients for clinical outcome.

Mortality was strongly associated with ten metabolites, including three hydroxylated fatty acids with a maximum carbon length of eight. These metabolites predicted mortality, regardless of HIV status, disease severity and cerebrospinal fluid tryptophan levels, which they previously identified as an important prognostic metabolite.

The results suggests that dysregulated β-oxidation may be an important and potentially modifiable contributor to mortality in tuberculous meningitis. Follow-up studies are underway, including quantitative trait locus mapping and rare genetic variant analysis, in the same patient groups. Future intervention studies should examine whether interventions targeting cerebral metabolism or oxygenation can improve survival of this deadly disease.

The bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) may have an ""on-off switch"" that lets them pause and restart growth, according to a new study from the University of Surrey and the University of Oxford. The research helps explain why TB is so hard to treat with antibiotics and could pave the way for better drugs.

In a study published in The EMBO Journal, researchers show how Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses a reversible process called ADP-ribosylation to modify its DNA and control both replication and gene activity. It is the first time this kind of DNA modification has been shown to regulate key processes like gene expression and DNA copying in any organism.

We've found a way that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can slow down its growth and potentially allow it to hide from the immune response and resist antibiotics. By showing that ADP-ribosylation of DNA can control both replication and gene expression, we've discovered a new layer of regulation that could be key to understanding TB's persistence. If we can target this process, we could make the bacteria easier to eliminate - especially in the slow-growing or dormant states that current treatments struggle to reach.""

Professor Graham Stewart, co-author of the study, University of Surrey

The study focused on two enzymes: DarT, which adds the ADP-ribose tag to DNA, and DarG, which removes it. When DarT is active, it stops the bacteria from copying their DNA and dividing. When DarG removes the tag, growth resumes. This start-and-stop control may help the bacteria survive in harsh conditions, making them more resilient during long-term infections.

To find out more about how this molecular switch works, the researchers used a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system to selectively reduce levels of DarG. This allowed DarT to act without restraint, leading to the build-up of DNA modifications and halting bacterial growth. The team then used a technique called ADPr-Seq to map where these tags appeared across the genome, alongside live-cell imaging and RNA sequencing to track changes in DNA replication, cell division and gene expression. These tools helped reveal how ADP-ribosylation affects both the ability of the bacteria to replicate and the activity of genes needed for survival in stressful environments.

According to the World Health Organization, TB kills 1.25 million people globally every year. In 2023, around 10.8 million people fell ill with the disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cutting back on sugary drinks may protect men's fertility, review finds","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250522/Cutting-back-on-sugary-drinks-may-protect-mene28099s-fertility-review-finds.aspx","Fri, 23 May 2025 01:39:00 GMT","

Emerging evidence links regular sugary drink intake to impaired sperm quality and DNA damage. Find out why experts recommend reducing SSBs for reproductive health.



Recommendations for reducing the impact of SSBs on sperm health.

Research shows that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is associated with adverse effects on male reproductive health, primarily through hormonal imbalances and oxidative damage.

Recently, scientists reviewed the available literature to document existing evidence on the association between SSB consumption and sperm health. This narrative review has been published in the journal Nutrients.

The current review included studies published from 2000 to 2024 and assessed all relevant research identified in a search conducted between 11 October 2024 and 14 December 2024 from multiple databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. After removing duplicates, eleven observational and cohort studies fulfilled all eligibility criteria and were considered for the present review.

SSBs are the largest source of added sugar in the diet. For instance, a standard 355ml serving of soda contains around 35.0–37.5 g of sugar and 140–150 calories. SSBs typically contain high concentrations of caloric sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), sucrose, or fruit juice concentrates.

An increase in global SSB consumption by almost 23% between 1990 and 2018 has been noted. SSB consumption is higher in men than in women. According to the Health Promotion Board (HPB) in Singapore, an average person consumed around 60 grams of sugar daily in 2018.

Multiple studies have documented a significant decline in sperm health, with average sperm concentrations decreasing by over 50% between 1973 and 2018. Diverse conditions may affect male reproduction, including reduced total sperm count, ejaculated semen volume, sperm motility and viability, and abnormal sperm morphology.

Previous studies have also shown that poor semen quality is associated with long-term morbidity and increases hospitalization risks, specifically for diabetic patients or those with cardiovascular conditions.

Increased SSB consumption leads to obesity, which is a known contributor to reduced sperm quality. In addition, high sugar intake triggers multiple metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, elevated triglycerides, and accelerated ageing. Numerous studies have established a dose-response relationship, which suggests that higher SSB intake exacerbates adverse outcomes.

High SSB intake, i.e., regular consumption of more than seven drinks per week, equivalent to 245.0–262.5 grams of sugar, is associated with a significant decline in sperm concentration and motility. Men who consumed more than seven SSBs a week exhibited a reduction in sperm concentration by 22% compared to non-consumers.

Similarly, higher SSB intake was inversely associated with semen volume; compared to non-drinkers, men who drank more than seven SSBs a week generated 6% lower semen volume. However, this reduction in semen volume was not always statistically significant. Previous studies also revealed that higher SSB consumption was negatively associated with sperm motility; however, the impact was found to be relatively modest and not statistically significant. Contradictory findings regarding the association between high SSB intake and a reduction in the percentage of morphologically normal sperm have been documented. Some studies have even reported minimal or positive associations between SSB intake and sperm morphology, indicating inconsistency in the evidence.

SSB may cause obesity, which disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, causing impaired gonadotropin responses and altered ultrastructure of ejaculated sperm.

A previous study revealed that high SSB intake reduces hormone levels, including inhibin-B, which is associated with a lower sperm count. Hormonal disruptions through reduced inhibin-B/follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) ratios could be the underlying mechanisms correlating the impact of increased oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction on sperm health.

SSB induces oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage DNA and impair sperm's fertilization capacity. It also damages the sperm membrane through lipid peroxidation and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, which reduces sperm motility and viability. These damages are typically assessed through molecular assays such as the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA), the comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis), and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling).

Chronic oxidative stress also causes accelerated cellular ageing. High sugar-sweetened soda consumption has been associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length in healthy adults, indicating the possible role of SSB in promoting systemic oxidative damage and premature biological aging.

Higher SSB consumption also triggers transient hyperglycemia, elevates ROS production, and affects endothelial function in both microvascular and macrovascular circulations. Antioxidant therapy with N-acetylcysteine and apocynin could alleviate vascular dysfunction. Antioxidant supplementation, such as coenzyme Q10, vitamins C and E, and glutathione, has shown positive effects in mitigating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage. However, the review notes that while supplementation may help in certain cases, excessive use could paradoxically impair sperm function, and a balanced, antioxidant-rich diet is recommended as a safer and more sustainable long-term strategy to improve male reproductive health.

Some included studies also examined artificially sweetened beverages, which generally showed minimal or no effect on sperm health, but further research is needed to clarify these findings.

Based on the current body of evidence, regular consumption of SSBs is associated with reductions in sperm count, motility, and increased DNA fragmentation, which may impair male reproductive health and fertility. However, most of the evidence is observational and does not establish direct causality.

A balanced diet rich in antioxidants can help mitigate low sperm count, motility, and volume. Lifestyle modifications and public health measures aimed at reducing SSB consumption, maintaining a healthy BMI, and improving overall metabolic health are recommended as part of a comprehensive approach to supporting male reproductive function.

To validate the current evidence pool, longitudinal studies with standardized study design and methodology for semen analysis are essential. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and detailed dietary assessments could help uncover the underlying mechanism by which SSB intake impacts sperm volume and quality. Considering the global population's diverse nutritional and genetic makeup, it is imperative to conduct similar research on Asian populations. It is also important to account for confounding factors such as BMI, physical activity, dietary antioxidant intake, and environmental exposures in future studies to clarify the true relationship between SSB intake and sperm health.

A sweeping new analysis reveals that the burden of female infertility has soared over the past three decades, with age-standardized rates rising and women in their late 30s facing the highest risk worldwide.

Study: Global, regional, and national burden of female infertility and trends from 1990 to 2021 with projections to 2050 based on the GBD 2021 analysis. Image Credit: Taimit / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers assessed global trends in female infertility by analyzing changes in prevalence across sociodemographic levels, regions, and ages between 1990 and 2021 and making predictions for the coming years.

Their findings indicate that more than 110 million women were affected by female infertility in 2021, representing an increase of 84% since 1990, with women between 35 and 39 years old being most affected.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines female infertility as occurring when an individual cannot conceive after having regular and unprotected sex for 12 months. It is important to note that the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, on which this research is based, uses a different definition: primary female infertility is characterized by the failure to conceive a child after 5 years of unprotected intercourse, and secondary infertility was identified in couples who desired a child and had been together for over 5 years without using contraception since their last live birth. This condition can be classified as primary or secondary, with varying prevalence rates.

In the U.S., between 7% and 16% (the paper states 7-15.5%) of reproductive-age women are affected. Globally, one in seven couples living in developed nations and 25% of those living in developing countries face infertility, and in countries like China, 15% of women of reproductive age are impacted.

Assisted reproductive treatments like in-vitro fertilization (IVF) incur high costs that range from over $12,000 per cycle in the U.S. to under $4,000 in Japan, based on 2006 United States dollars.

The causes of infertility are multifactorial, with fallopian tube blockages, ovulatory disorders, hormonal imbalances, genetic issues, epigenetic mechanisms potentially linked to environmental pollution, and other environmental factors all contributing. Infertility is also associated with elevated risks for gynecological cancers and chronic conditions like endometriosis, which is linked to asthma, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular problems.

Despite its broad health and social implications, infertility research remains limited. Prior studies show regional differences in infertility types and trends, including increases in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-related infertility and complex regional patterns in endometriosis burden.

In this study, researchers used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset to present a comprehensive, age- and region-specific analysis of female infertility prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2021, with projections to 2050 to inform global health strategies and policy development.

The GBD database compiles health-related data from household surveys, demographic records, and other validated sources. For infertility, DALYs were calculated based solely on years lived with disability (YLD), as infertility is non-fatal.

The analysis included 204 countries and territories grouped into five sociodemographic index (SDI) categories. Cluster analysis was employed to identify regional patterns of change, for instance, noting significant increases in Andean Latin America and decreases in regions like Oceania.

Projections from 2022 to 2050 were made using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, estimating future prevalence, DALYs, and age-standardized rates. Correlation analysis was used to assess relationships between socioeconomic variables, such as the Human Development Index (HDI), and infertility prevalence.

In 2021, female infertility affected approximately 110 million women worldwide, with an age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) of 1,367.4 for every 100,000 and over 601,000 associated DALYs.

Women between 35 and 39 experienced the highest burden, with age-standardized rates about 1.2 times higher than those between 30 and 34. The burden varied by region and SDI level, with middle SDI regions reporting the highest case numbers, while high-middle SDI regions had the highest standardized rates.

Asia recorded the largest absolute burden, especially China and India. East Asia had the highest age-standardized rates, while countries like Australia and New Zealand reported the lowest.

Regarding temporal trends by SDI level, the age-standardized rates (ASR) in low and low-middle-SDI regions initially displayed a decrease, followed by a sharp increase starting around 2010, resulting in an overall upward trend. High SDI regions showed a slow increase followed by a decreasing trend in ASR.

The paper also notes that when looking at the relationship between ASR and SDI level at a point in time (rather than over time), territories with an SDI under 0.50 showed predominantly stable or slightly decreasing ASR, those with SDIs between 0.50 and 0.75 showed mild fluctuations in ASR, and regions with an SDI above 0.75 experienced a rapid decline in ASR.

Furthermore, a statistically significant positive association was found between the Estimated Annual Percent Change (EAPC) in infertility rates and the Human Development Index (HDI), indicating that in countries with high HDI, the incidence of female infertility increased in 2021 but showed a slowing trend when HDI exceeded 0.8.

Between 1990 and 2021, prevalence cases rose by 84.4%, and DALYs increased by 84.4%. Age-specific analysis showed a sharp rise in infertility among women between 30 and 34. While high-SDI regions saw eventual declines in their ASR trends over time, low- and middle-SDI areas faced sharp increases in their ASR after 2010.

Although the global number of women affected by infertility and total DALYs are projected to decline by 2050, the ASPR and DALYs standardized by age will continue to rise. This divergence is driven by population aging, increased infertility risk factors, including potential epigenetic impacts of industrial pollutants, and better diagnostics leading to higher detection rates.

Female infertility remains a substantial global health issue, affecting over 9% of women of reproductive age, with a growing prevalence and burden between 1990 and 2021. Factors like delayed childbearing, urbanization, industrial pollution, and potential epigenetic changes likely contribute to the observed trends.

Projections suggest a decreasing number of infertility cases and DALYs but an increasing ASPR, likely due to aging populations, lifestyle shifts, and greater awareness and diagnosis. Regional disparities, such as rising burdens in Andean Latin America and improvements in areas like Oceania, highlight the need for targeted interventions. Socioeconomic development, high-risk behaviors, and environmental exposures continue to shape fertility trends.

A major strength of this study is its global scope, leveraging extensive data. However, limitations include inconsistent data quality across countries and the lack of granular, patient-level details. Despite declining case numbers, female infertility remains a growing burden requiring targeted prevention, early screening, and enhanced reproductive healthcare policies.

ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team head coach Katie Schoepfer has named 24 players to the first training camp after her team qualified 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which starting this year, will be staged annually and has been expanded from 16 to 24 nations. The camp will take place from May 27-June 3 in Fayetteville, Ga., site of the currently under construction Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, which will host the majority of YNT camps after its completion in 2026.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008, are age-eligible for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. Twenty-three players selected by Schoepfer were born in 2008 with Gotham FC forward Mak Whitham, who was the youngest signing in NWSL history at age 13 (she's now 14), born in 2010.

The USA is preparing for the World Cup which will be held Oct. 17-Nov. 8. The next five editions of the tournament, starting this year, will be held in Morocco. To qualify, the USA needed to win its group in the Final Round of the Concacaf Women's U-17 Championship, and did so with aplomb, outscoring its three opponents, 17-0.

This camp will also serve as a springboard to the June training camp at which the U.S. U-17s will face youth international power Japan twice in Kansas City, with the first match being a promoted game at CPKC Stadium, home to the Kansas City Current, and the first purpose-built stadium for women's soccer. That match will take place on June 28 (6:30 p.m. CT) and the teams will also play a closed-door international on July 1 at The University of Kansas Health System Training Center, which is also home to the Current. Japan has won one FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and finished runners-up twice. Tickets for the promoted match are available through the Kansas City Current here.

Just eight players on this roster participated in the qualifying tournament as Schoepfer takes a deeper dive into the player pool to evaluate players who could contribute to the World Cup Team.

The players that were in Costa Rica for the Concacaf tournament were goalkeeper Evan O'Steen, defenders Pearl Cecil, Lauren Hemann, Gacie Milam and Sydney Schmidt, midfielders Jaiden Rodriguez and Chloe Sadler and forward Ashlyn Anderson. Rodriguez scored twice in the three goals while Anderson tallied four times. Cecil, a center back, and Schmidt scored once each. O'Steen, who plays her youth club for Solar SC, also is on the books for the Dallas Trinity in the USL Super League, but she has not seen action this year.

Goalkeeper Hannah Folliard, defenders Marlee Raymond and Milam and midfielder Brooke Bunton -- all of whom are named to this camp -- were alternates on the Concacaf qualifying team. Milam was eventually moved to the full roster for Costa Rica after an injury to another player.

One professional club and 22 different youth clubs from 15 different states are represented on the roster, with four players from California, three from Florida, and two each from Georgia, Utah and Illinois.

Fourteen countries have qualified so far for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. China PR, Japan, Korea DPR and Korea Republic have qualified from Asia via nominations by the Asian Football Confederation based on results of the last three editions of AFC U-17 Women's Asian Cup in Thailand in 2017 and 2019 and in Indonesia in 2024. New Zealand and Samoa have qualified from Oceania via the 2024 OFC U-16 Women's Championship. From Africa, in addition to host Morocco, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia have earned berths via the 2025 African U-17 Women's World Cup qualifiers. The Concacaf teams that qualified along with the USA were Mexico, Canada and Costa Rica.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Point-counterpoint: Should Pulisic have skipped USMNT duty?","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/usmnt/2025/05/23/point-counterpoint-should-pulisic-have-skipped-usmnt-duty/83792840007/","Fri, 23 May 2025 14:44:00 GMT","

Christian Pulisic's decision to opt out of summer play with the U.S. men's national team will be a major talking point for some time to come.

The decision is dividing opinion between those who see it as an abdication of leadership and responsibility, and those who feel Pulisic has nothing to gain by grinding his body into dust for another summer.

In short, this feels like the optimal moment for a point-counterpoint. Let's get to it.

By Seth Vertelney

Pulisic's comments after the USMNT lost to Canada in the Nations League third-place game were unequivocal.

""This team is everything to me,"" Pulisic told CBS Sports after the defeat. ""I care so much for this team, for this country. I hope people know that about me.""

Pulisic is a leader on this team. When you're arguably the greatest men's player this country has ever produced at age 26, that designation is unavoidable. The forward has said repeatedly that his leadership style is less about big speeches and more about setting an example.

So we must consider the example this sets. What kind of message does it send to his teammates? Especially at this moment, with the team at a low ebb, fan interest waning, and past USMNT legends questioning whether current players have the very fundamental and essential characteristic of simply caring.

Pulisic is not injured. We have to take U.S. Soccer's word for that, because neither Mauricio Pochettino nor Matt Crocker mentioned any injury on Thursday. There has been talk of an ongoing hip issue, but that at least hasn't stopped him from playing for AC Milan.

Instead, Pulisic is tired. After a demanding and frustrating season at Milan, who wouldn't be? But, well, everyone is tired right now. And this isn't the first time in Pochettino's tenure that Pulisic has skipped the chance to play for the USMNT.

One of the more frustrating elements of this decision is that Pulisic's options this summer were not binary.

Was there a way to come into camp with a plan to rest and build up minutes until the Gold Cup knockout phase? Pulisic didn't have to choose between playing every minute of every game or not coming at all. Even if he didn't play a minute, Pulisic attending camp would send a message about its importance.

So does missing it.

Pulisic's absence will certainly mean something for Pochettino, who said the following just a few months ago:

""The way Argentine players compete: When you lose a ball, you cry. When you lose a game, you spend maybe one week in your room when you want to go out. It's how you defend your patch, your flag. It's how you defend your identity, your culture. It's what we want to translate.

""When you play for the national team, you need to feel something in your skin and inside yourself.""

Would the kind of player Pochettino idealizes say ""no thanks"" to the last chance he had to spend a full month with his teammates ahead of a World Cup on home soil? Would he miss the chance to continue building the kind of chemistry and culture his team needs, even if he can't play every minute on the pitch?

Pulisic says the USMNT is everything to him. But right now, actions speak louder than words.

By Jason Anderson

If U.S. Soccer's statement that Christian Pulisic made the decision to opt for rest over participating in the Gold Cup is true, it's an admirable act of self-preservation that may well help the USMNT in the long run.

Let's be frank about Pulisic: He's had knocks and injuries in the past, but over the past two seasons the man has done little other than play soccer nonstop. If he plays for AC Milan on Saturday, he will be playing his 100th competitive match for the Serie A side since departing Chelsea in the summer of 2023, and he's already crossed the 7,000-minute barrier with the Rossoneri.

It's been an excellent move for Pulisic, who is arguably the most important player for a club with global pressure to do well. Milan has fallen short as a club, but Pulisic is doing something no American male player has ever done in that regard. He's not just a player at a big club; he's a foundational piece, and that success comes with an obligation to play through dings and minor issues. Pulisic apparently feels run down and with that workload, who wouldn't?

The thing is, Pulisic has gone a long time without a real break. In 2024, it was Copa América, and while he was rested for the 2023 Gold Cup as well, he still flew back to the U.S. for two crunch Concacaf Nations League matches right before the tournament, once again curtailing his down time. The 2022-23 European season was altered to accommodate both the tail end of Covid-19 restrictions and an entire World Cup that took place in November and December.

The modern calendar for international players is grinding its stars into dust, and Pulisic is no exception. At 26, he already has 78 caps, and per Transfermarkt has played in 371 competitive, senior-level club matches. In the not-too-distant past, that would have represented a full career for an indestructible player in their mid-30s.

This summer is his last chance to seriously recuperate and rest his body and brain before an event that will likely come with more demands and more stress than any USMNT player has ever experienced from the sport. There's no blueprint for how to cope with FIFA, UEFA, and Concacaf's bottomless desire for more games, more competitions, but it seems like the only humane answer is to simply not play for a little while.

If the U.S. wants a World Cup that will change the trajectory of men's soccer in this country, Pulisic's to-do list should include booking a stay at a resort, turning his phone off, and dozing off by a large body of water. It's now or never, and taking this time off is the right call for all parties. Let the man rest.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","'I cannot relate'","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/usmnt/2025/05/23/lalas-hits-out-at-pulisic-for-skipping-usmnt-duty/83817276007/","Fri, 23 May 2025 16:22:10 GMT","

Alexi Lalas has taken exception to Christian Pulisic's decision to opt out of summer play with the U.S. men's national team, saying he could never imagine doing the same thing when he was a player.

Pulisic was excluded from the USMNT roster for upcoming friendlies against Switzerland and Turkey, and will also play no part in the Gold Cup. According to U.S. Soccer, the decision came after a request from the AC Milan star for an extended break after a long club campaign.

According to Lalas, the timing of Pulisic's decision is especially disappointing as the USMNT looks to build momentum ahead of the World Cup on home soil next summer.

""I cannot relate to a player when his country needs him and wants him to represent, that you say no — especially in this moment,"" the former USMNT defender said on his ""State of the Union"" podcast.

""This is a bad look for Christian Pulisic, but it's also a bad look for this team at the exact moment when they need to be doing the opposite. This summer you need to come out with people coming out saying, ‘Yeah, I'm jacked, I cannot wait to watch the World Cup next summer because of what I've seen.'

""This is not the summer and the time to go missing, you use this summer as the last opportunity to be in a tournament situation — and, by the way, in the country that you are playing the tournament next year. You say no. Fine, if that's what you want to do then you had better bring it a year from now when they are playing in the World Cup.

""I just think it's a bad message, it's a bad look and I cannot relate to that. Not just the team but the country, a year out from the World Cup, needed him to come in and be part of this team that changes the vibe and the way that this team is looked at. He's not going to be there, and that's disappointing.""

Pulisic will likely play his 100th competitive match for Milan on Saturday, with the USMNT star set to cross the 50-game threshold in both of his seasons with the Rossoneri after a 2023 move from Chelsea.

Pulisic has become a cornerstone of Milan's project, resulting in him starting nearly every game when available. Though the demand on players in the modern game is much higher than their predecessors, Lalas believes they also have advantages that his generation didn't.

""I played in a different time, but I would bring up the fact that the time I played in, it was bad! It wasn't even close to the resources and the opportunity and, let's be honest, the protection that the players have — chartered flights, or the way the games are referred, or the amenities that they have, or the medical,"" the two-time World Cup veteran said.

""Yes, they play a lot of games. But you know who plays a lot of games? Messi.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

Christian Pulisic is among a slew of regular starters who will be missing when the United States plays in next month's CONCACAF Gold Cup, another blow for a team coming off dismal performances at the Copa America and CONCACAF Nations League.

Given the absences, coach Mauricio Pochettino wants players who will convince worried fans a turnaround is ahead.

“It's our responsibility to send some signal to them,” he said Thursday during a Zoom news conference after announcing his 27-man roster. “I think our fans need to see our team fighting and playing and performing and playing well, yes, but fighting for the flag and being always in every single game (to) match the aggressivity of the opponent.""

Pulisic, the top American player, asked to be left off the roster for the last competitive matches before the 2026 World Cup in order to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.

Yunus Musah also asked out, Antonee Robinson was dropped because he has been playing with an injury, and Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were blocked because FIFA gave the expanded Club World Cup priority over national teams.

Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Tanner Tessmann were omitted in what Pochettino called ""football decisions.""

U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said Pulisic and his advisers asked for the possibility to be left off because of the amount of games he has played in the last two years.

“Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “We decided the best for him, the best of the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.”

Pochettino replaced Gregg Berhalter after the team's first-round elimination at the Copa America last summer. After the Gold Cup, he will have just four brief training windows on FIFA international dates before players report ahead of the World Cup.

In the team's first significant test under Pochettino, the Americans lost to Panama and Canada in the Nations League in March. Without saying players had been complacent, Pochettino said “we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March, and it's about to be — maybe use a different way to approach these opportunities.""

Sixteen of the players picked are from Major League Soccer, the most in a FIFA window since the U.S. sent a B team to the 2023 Gold Cup.

“If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?"" Pochettino asked out loud. ""No, no, no, no, no. What we want do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. ... If we want be good in one year time, we need to think that today is the most important day.""

Outside back Sergiño Dest returns to the national team for the first time since March 2024 after recovering from a torn ACL. Forward Folarin Balogun is with the team for the first time since last September following his recuperation from shoulder surgery.

Pochettino's roster included Alex Freeman, a son of former NFL All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman. The 20-year-old right back made his Major League Soccer debut for Orlando in April 2023 — his only league match that season. He had two MLS appearances last year and has become a regular this season.

Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, a 24-year-old son of the former coach, also was picked for the first time along with 20-year-old forward Damion Downs and 21-year-old defender Quinn Sullivan.



Downs has played on youth teams of Germany and the U.S., and helped Cologne gain promotion to the Bundesliga for 2025-26 after a one-season absence.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese, who has attended national team camp previously but not played in a game, also was selected.

Players will start reporting June 1 for training in Chicago, and the 26-man Gold Cup roster is due June 4. The U.S. plays Turkey on June 7 at East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later at Nashville, Tennessee, then meets Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the first round of the Gold Cup.

The roster:

Goalkeepers: Matt Freese (New York City), Patrick Schulte (Columbus), Zack Steffen (Colorado), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace)

Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando), DeJuan Jones (San Jose), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati)

The United States men's national team will not count on its most high-profile figure for this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. Christian Pulisic, the forward from AC Milan, requested to be left out of the squad in order to rest after a demanding season in Europe. His absence, alongside other regular starters, forces coach Mauricio Pochettino to seek alternatives and take a bold approach ahead of the World Cup.

The U.S. Soccer Federation confirmed that Pulisic asked not to be included in the 27-player preliminary roster due to physical fatigue. According to sporting director Matt Crocker, the 26-year-old has accumulated over 3,500 minutes across club and international competitions over the past two years, leaving him with little time for recovery.



Why Christian Pulisic Abandoned the U.S. and Won't Play in The Gold Cup?



“After extensive conversations, we agreed that this was the best time for him to take a step back,” said Crocker. “The priority is to have him at 100% for the next season with his club and especially ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.”

Although the absences of Giovanni Reyna, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie were anticipated—since their clubs will be playing in the FIFA Club World Cup at the same time—the exclusion of Antonee Robinson, one of the best left backs in the Premier League, raised eyebrows. Also missing from the list are Yunus Musah (Pulisic's teammate at Milan) and other Europe-based players.









Despite these notable omissions, the team welcomes back key names such as Sergiño Dest, returning from an ACL injury, and Folarin Balogun, who is back after recovering from a shoulder problem. The roster includes five players with no prior international experience, such as Matt Freese and Damion Downs, highlighting the coaching staff's desire to refresh the squad.

Mauricio Pochettino emphasized that this is a crucial moment to evaluate emerging talent and instill a winning culture within the team. “It's not about having a vacation or seeing friends. Whoever joins the national team must be ready to give everything,” the Argentine coach stated.

The United States will begin its Gold Cup journey on June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, followed by matches against Saudi Arabia on June 19 and Haiti on June 22. All eyes will be on a rejuvenated American team, determined to perform without its main star.

Christian Pulisic's busy and productive season at Serie A side AC Milan certainly had U.S. men's national team fans excited to see him this summer, but instead, the star attacker will be given a needed period of rest. 

Pulisic was not included in Mauricio Pochettino's 27-player roster for the upcoming June international window, which features a pair of home friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, and the start of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The 26-year-old was one of several omissions from Pochettino's roster, raising many eyebrows ahead of the USMNT's final competitive tournament before the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Pulisic has made 49 appearances for AC Milan this season across all competitions ahead of the Rossoneri's Serie A finale on Sunday. One year after logging 51 appearances in his debut campaign in Italy, Pulisic is closing in on the 50+ appearance plateau for the second-straight season. 

While having Pulisic in the squad makes the USMNT stronger overall, Pochettino defended giving his captain a break, with the hopes of having Pulisic fit and injury-free for the next 12+ months.

“Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,” Pochettino said in a press conference. “We decided the best for him, the best of the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.

“Sometimes we give too much importance knowing to be together and sometimes the group maybe sometimes doesn't work in this way or build in this way..I think it is important to create this challenge,” he added. “I really believe that to build a team is about staying together, to have time to work, yes, but I think we cannot underestimate the player.”

The absence of Pulisic does open a major void in the heart of the USMNT's attack, but will force other players to step up in his place. Midfielders Malik Tillman, Quinn Sullivan and Brenden Aaronson could all move higher upfield in Pulisic's absence while forward Haji Wright is versatile enough to play out wide.  

Pochettino ultimately wants the full squad to make the most of the upcoming opportunities this summer, especially knowing a productive window could help boost many players' chances ahead of 2026. 

“I think it's a great opportunity for different players to have the chance to challenge and to try to get a place in one year's time at the World Cup because I think that is really, really important for us,” Pochettino said. “I think that is for me the most important thing now we are working for the national team.”

The USMNT will face Turkey and Switzerland on June 7 and 10 respectively before opening group stage play at the Gold Cup on June 15.

The one thing that this really proves is what a joke the Gold Cup is.  Would any South American player opt out of Copa America, or a Euro player opt out of the Euros.
The Gold Cup was always a pretty weak tournament, but the Nations League has reduced its status even further.

Didnt Landon Donovan do something like this too?

At least he isnt”retiring” like Giggs did for Wales.

I don't remember Landon ever opting out of a national team callup (could be wrong on that, though).
I do remember him coming home from Europe to play in MLS.  Maybe that's what you're thinking of?

Can you truly count on Pulisic to deliver in 2026? That will be a question on every USMNT fans lips. Fair or unfair he will now be questioned.

Looking forward to seeing how the team does without some of our big guns.

100% weak sauce.  No heart…

101% baseless opinion. No clue…

I'd say that it's disappointing that Pulisic is opting out, and I don't necessarily understand it.  To me, when your national team calls, you show up.  Wearing the shirt is a privilege, not an entitlement.

But I wouldn't question Pulisic's heart.  He gives his all for the national team, and he's made it clear that playing for the United States is important to him.  He has scored some big goals for the United States.  I think he's entitled to a little slack here.

Sounders have been working with FIFA to try to find solutions for fans who may have paid overly inflated prices when tickets were first released. 

When Club World Cup tickets first went on sale back in December, the release came with a degree of sticker shock. The cheapest tickets for any of the six games at Lumen Field were about $80 before fees and the cheapest tickets for the any of the Seattle Sounders' three matches were around $100. What made those prices even tougher to stomach were that only seats in the 300 section were made available, with no clear timeline, process or pricing structure for tickets closer to the action.

At the same time those tickets were made available — for which Sounders season-ticket holders were given a code to gain priority access — there was a separate process for “Club Fan” tickets through FIFA. These were tickets FIFA set aside specifically for Sounders fans who had to effectively apply through the club. Those tickets were eventually revealed to be a little cheaper — and didn't include Ticketmaster fees — while also including some that were in the Brougham End.

Over the next few months, FIFA slowly released more inventory while also trying to steer fans toward very expensive hospitality packages that presumably included more of the premium seating. 

By all accounts, those sales have trailed well beyond expectations. As of early May, the Tuesday afternoon match between Argentinian giant River Plate and Urawa Red Diamonds — one of Japan's most popular teams — had vast swaths of empty seats all around the stadium. Even the Sounders' games against three of the world's biggest and most popular clubs were nowhere close to selling out. It was apparently a similar story at many of the other games around the country, especially those not featuring big-name European clubs.

Finally, FIFA blinked. 

At some point around May 12, prices dropped dramatically, sometimes by as much as half. The get-in price for some Lumen Field matches dropped below $40 and tickets for the Sounders-Botafogo match were about $60. Tickets to see the Sounders play Atletico Madrid started below $75. Although Sounders-PSG tickets were still starting closer to $125, the highest priced tickets near midfield are about $325. 

While that was good news for fans who decided to wait until FIFA's so called “adaptive pricing” model moved in their favor, thousands of other fans were left fuming at the realization that they had overpaid dramatically for tickets.

Over the next 10 days or so, the Sounders began working with FIFA and Ticketmaster to try to find a solution.

At least part of that solution was revealed on Thursday when the Sounders sent an email to all season-ticket holders notifying them of the situation and offering some measure of a solution that was broken into three parts:","{'href': 'https://www.sounderatheart.com', 'title': 'Sounder at Heart'}","soccer"

Chelsea have set the deadline that they want to sign attacking target Joao Pedro from Brighton before the Club World Cup begins in mid-June.

It could be a busy summer for fans of Chelsea because there will be a lot going on at the club.

The Blues are competing in the expanded Club World Cup tournament, which takes place from mid-June to mid-July.

In addition, the summer transfer window will be open, so Enzo Maresca's side have the option to add to their squad. It's been claimed that Chelsea are planning four major new signings to help revamp the young group.

The transfer speculation linking Brighton star Joao Pedro, 23, to Chelsea has been intensifying in recent days.

It was claimed earlier in May that Chelsea are keen on signing Joao Pedro this summer, but they face competition from Arsenal and Liverpool for his signature.

Now, it looks like the Blues have pressed ahead with their attempt to sign the Seagulls centre-forward.

According to Brazilian publication Globo, Chelsea are attempting to speed up negotiations to sign Brighton's Pedro in time for him to be involved at the Club World Cup.

Apparently, Maresca's side have already started talks and signalled their willingness to offer €60m (£50m) for his signature. The report adds that conversations should intensify next week after the Premier League season is wrapped up.

Brighton's asking price for Joao Pedro is £59m ahead of the summer, so Chelsea aren't too far away with their initial interest.

Chelsea supporters have doubts about Joao Pedro because they're not convinced he's an obvious upgrade on Nicolas Jackson for the striker position. In fairness, the 23-year-old Brazilian star has proven at Brighton and Watford in recent seasons he's got the versatility to operate as a No 9, No 10 or a winger.

In the 2010s, Chelsea had a lot of Brazilian flair running through their squad with the likes of Oscar, David Luiz and Willian. Incidentally, Thiago Silva ranks first in the list of Chelsea's greatest ever Brazilian players.

It now looks like history could be repeating itself because there could be plenty of South American talents at Stamford Bridge next season.

Estevao Willian, 18, and Andrey Santos, 21, are Brazilian stars joining up with Chelsea for the 2025/26 campaign.

The suggestion above is that the Blues are pushing hard to get fellow countryman Pedro as well, so perhaps we will see some Brazilian flags in the Stamford Bridge crowd next season.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Thomas Tuchel has won 11 trophies as a manager at domestic level

England manager Thomas Tuchel will not release players early for the Club World Cup because he wants to ""cherish"" and ""worship"" every moment with his squad.

On Friday, Tuchel named his 26-man squad for a World Cup qualifer against Andorra (7 June) and a friendly against Senegal (10 June).

Eight members of the squad play for teams competing at the Club World Cup, which begins on 15 June - five days after England host Senegal at Nottingham Forest's City Ground.

The month-long Club World Cup is being held in the United States and England captain Harry Kane's Bayern Munich play Auckland City on the opening day of the tournament.

Chelsea, who have five players in the England squad, are the first Premier League club in action on 16 June.

Tuchel said no managers had been in touch with him about leaving players out of his plans.

""The discussion was very open,"" said the German. 

""Very quickly we also understood this is a very important camp for us with one year to go until the Word Cup. 

""Why send players if we want to cherish every day we have together. What signal would it send to the group to send players away?""

Tuchel, who oversaw victories against Albania and Latvia in his first two matches in March, said England will start and finish the camp with the same 26 players, adding that he will ""manage their minutes"".

""I was an advocate and I could see the reason for the players who go to the Club World Cup to maybe leave a little earlier, to maybe change the squad,"" Tuchel said. 

""I can understand the argument from especially the clubs who would love to see the players get a rest but we have a strong argument for ourselves and our goals we want to reach. 

""We are building a group and a togetherness. We want to develop a camaraderie and it is only possible if we take every day seriously.""

Despite pressure from clubs participating in the Club World Cup, Tuchel has stuck to his guns.

Hired on a remit to win the 2026 World Cup, Tuchel stressed before his first match in charge that he only has a total of 60 days and 24 sessions with his squad before the tournament begins.

Five Chelsea players - Noni Madueke, Cole Palmer, Levi Colwill, Trevoh Chalobah and Reece James - are included in the squad.

Before the squad was announced, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said there was a lack of care for players' welfare when asked about his players receiving a call-up.

""It is not normal, it is not correct,"" said Maresca.

""I know people say they have money but it is not about money, it is about the health of the players. I don't think people pay attention to that.""

Kane, 31, was always going to be selected given his role as captain, while Conor Gallagher has had a good season with Atletico Madrid in Spain.

But the selection of Jude Bellingham could prove more controversial.

The midfielder has postponed surgery on his shoulder until after the Club World Cup, a decision that will see him miss at least the first six weeks of the 2025-26 season.

The former Birmingham City midfielder has made 52 appearances for Real Madrid this season and could play up to an extra seven matches at the Club World Cup should the La Liga side reach the final.

With a little over a year to go ahead of a World Cup Thomas Tuchel has been hired to win, it was heartening to hear him draw a line in the sand in term of how he will approach matters of club versus country. In terms of some of his actual selections, the England manager's logic is not always quite as easy to follow.

Tuchel admitted at a morning press conference at Wembley that he had considered leaving those players involved in next month's Club World Cup out of the squad for a qualifier against Andorra and a friendly against Senegal at the start of June.

Both of these games could – and probably would - be won without Harry Kane, Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and others.

Nevertheless, they will be with England and will stay with England throughout the forthcoming camp. That is entirely right. It is not Tuchel's fault that the calendar continues to be crammed with more and more club football. International football has to be played at some stage and Tuchel only has five camps between now and his own World Cup 2026 in America.

'We will start camp with 26 players and finish camp with the same 26 players,' Tuchel said.

'That's the decision. I can see the argument for some players to leave early and to maybe change the squad or even nominate a squad without World Club Cup players.

'The decision was open in all directions and it was discussed. But very quickly we realised it's one of five camps and only one year to go. Why send players away who we want to worship and cherish every day we are together? What signal would that send to the group to send players away?

'I can see the argument of the clubs who would love to see their players have a bit of a rest but we have a strong argument for ourselves and for our goals that we want to reach. We want to build a camaraderie and togetherness and that's only possible if we take every game seriously and that's why we keep the group together.

'The players know it and the clubs know it. We will try to manage the minutes of the players of course. '

Tuchel's squad is not without its curiosities. Happily, he has bowed to Phil Foden's request for a rest but it is harder to understand the exclusion of players such as Jarrod Bowen – who was in his first squad – and Crystal Palace's gifted midfielder Adam Wharton, who will be asked to play Under-21 football in this summer's European Championship while Jordan Henderson takes a midfield place with the seniors that already appears set in stone.

And then there is Ivan Toney. Now playing his football in Saudi, the former Brentford striker has been handed his first Tuchel call up on the back of his numbers for Al-Ahli after the national coach admitted he has not yet travelled to watch him play live.

'Ivan deserves to be with us,' said Tuchel.

'I am convinced. He has won a major trophy in the Asian Champions League and has made a huge contribution with his goals and assists.

'I told you I would try to put a visit to Saudi Arabia in my schedule but I didn't make it so why not bring him over and let him travel to us?

'This is a good occasion to meet new players and test new players and meet Ivan and see him in the environment. We have nominated three No 9s with Harry Kane and Ollie Watkins.

'Dominic Solanke deserves to be here but he has been in camp already. I know what he can do. Watkins and Toney were both not with us last time so that explains the decision.'

Tuchel's approach to squad selections often appears a little contradictory, on the one hand talking up the merits of building consistency and togetherness and on the other suggesting some players – such as Solanke and Manchester United defender Harry Maguire – have been omitted because he already knows what they can do for him.

Ben White has missed another chance for a call up as he is about to become a father for the first time while Marc Guehi of Crystal Palace is not in the squad on medical advice after suffering an injury to his eye in last Saturday's FA Cup Final.

In terms of Ajax midfielder Henderson, however, Tuchel remains unequivocal. That particular hill is one that he is clearly prepared to die on.

'If you have training exercises in different groups, the group where Jordan is…you can just turn your back,' Tuchel said.

'He will take care of all the standards in that group. Jordan is vocal and a natural leader. He has a spark. That's what he is good at. He does it in a very impressive way and is still playing at a decent level.

'I understand the question. But once you meet Jordan and see Jordan and speak to Jordan it's such an obvious choice.

'Your perception is far away from my perception but I understand it. This isn't Adam Wharton versus Jordan Henderson. What Jordan brings to the group, an Under 21 player cannot bring.

'It's impossible in terms of personality and experience. Jordan is more than happy to accept the challenge. He wants to presents, no gifts.'

Quite why an England squad containing players such as Bellingham, Kane, Kyle Walker and Decan Rice is in such desperate need of leaders remains a puzzle. Tuchel, however, would appear to be convinced.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

...

Pep Guardiola has confirmed whether Kyle Walker will be part of Manchester City's travelling group to the United States for the FIFA Club World Cup in June.

Walker has spent the second half of the season on loan at AC Milan after a difficult few months near the turn of the year that saw him commit a series of high-profile mistakes and lose his place in the starting XI.

The England international has been one of Pep Guardiola's best and most successful signings and whilst being widely regarded as the best full-back in Premier League history, Walker's time at the Etihad Stadium has come to an end.

     

Fabrizio Romano has reported that club bosses do not consider the 33-year-old part of their plans next season and with the Sheffield-born defender out of contract at Manchester City in 2026, this summer is an ideal time for all parties to shake hands and move on.

Manchester City have identified Juventus' Andrea Cambiaso as a potent replacement for Walker, who left the club midway through what has been a sobering, sub-standard season for the 2023 treble winners.

The former Tottenham man joined Manchester City for a then English record fee for a defender in 2017, winning six Premier League titles and a maiden UEFA Champions League title amongst a plethora of silverware at the Etihad Stadium.

Speaking ahead of Manchester City's final Premier League game of the season against Fulham on Sunday, Guardiola was asked whether Walker will be part of the group that travels to the United States for the FIFA Club World Cup in June.

“No,” said Guardiola, confirming that Manchester City will not include Walker in their squad for the tournament, which confirms that the right-back will leave the club in the next month as he looks to make a permanent move to AC Milan.

Walker featured in AC Milan's kit release for the 2025-26 campaign and whilst the Italian side are undergoing financial issues, it is believed that a permanent transfer will be the ultimate resolution that will fit all parties.

Matheus Nunes, Rico Lewis and January signing Abdukodir Khusanov have collectively shared the workload at right-back since Walker switched Manchester for Milan and it is a sad ending for the former club captain to have departed the club in the manner things turned out in the end – having been the bedrock of Manchester City's defence since 2017.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Pep Guardiola expresses his desire to support Phil Foden ahead of Manchester City's final Premier League game of the season vs. Fulham. (1:04)

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said he's planning to include Phil Foden in his squad for the FIFA Club World Cup despite accepting that midfielder needs a period of ""rest.""

Foden, named the Premier League's best player a year ago, has struggled for form this season. He will miss England's fixtures against Andorra and Senegal in June after asking to be left out of Thomas Tuchel's squad.

Guardiola has said the 24-year-old, who is dealing with an ankle injury, needs to rest. But the City boss said Foden is in line to be part of the group which travels to the Unite States for the Club World Cup.

""In principle, he will come to America,"" Guardiola said.

""We want to help him, that's the most important thing. He needs rest and it's going to happen now after Sunday. Step by step he is going to come back, that is what we want.

""I just want, want, want to help him. I don't care about his performance on the pitch, I want him to feel good and after the rest it will come in an easy way.""

Guardiola has revealed the club will hold talks with the English Football Association (FA) before deciding on the availability of James McAtee and Rico Lewis for the Club World Cup.

England's under-21s begin their Euros campaign against Czech Republic on June 12. City are due to fly to Florida for their Club World Cup base camp on the same day before starting the tournament with a game against Wydad AC in Philadelphia on June 18.

""They have to talk,"" Guardiola said.

""I joke and I am so funny a guy so I don't know who is going to pay the salary in these months -- national teams or the club so if they decide they are going to the under-21s, I don't know who is going to pay it. They are going to decide, I would say, the players with the club.

""They will talk with the sporting director and they have to decide what they want to do.

""I know the manager of under-21s asked the club for both players to go to the under-21s but I don't know the resolution right now.""

Meanwhile, Guardiola has confirmed that Kyle Walker will not rejoin the squad for the Club World Cup. The England defender joined AC Milan on loan in January, but still has a year left on his contract at the Etihad Stadium.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Spot Easter eggs in his design","https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2025/05/23/fifa-world-cup-2026-poster-nj-rich-tu-south-orange/83753892007/","Fri, 23 May 2025 08:29:40 GMT","

The FIFA World Cup is coming back to New Jersey for the first time in more than 30 years in 2026, and a local artist is helping define how the world will see it.

Rich Tu, a visual artist raised in South Orange and now based in Brooklyn, was selected by the region's host committee to pen the official poster for the New York/New Jersey host region. Tu said his composition was meant to reflect the cultural depth of both sides of the Hudson and blend local identity with global scale. Making sure New Jersey was not lost in the shuffle was key, he said.

""What I love about New Jersey is it's so much more than what people think it is,"" Tu said.

FIFA revealed Tu's poster for the New York/New Jersey host region in April at Poster House in Manhattan. It was part of a rollout of official artwork for each of the 16 host stadiums across North America, as the U.S. is set to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.

Tu's vivid, high-energy design is centered on a multicolored soccer ball engulfed in the flames of the Statue of Liberty's torch. Dominated by bold colors, the flame is rendered in fiery reds and oranges, while the torch itself is depicted in cool green and teal tones. 

""I wanted to embody the voice of the fans ... the loudness of the stadiums,"" he said. ""It's bold, like the people of this region.""

In the background, Tu layered iconography from both New York and New Jersey. There are florals for the Garden State and a splash of Knicks orange. Deep blues and purples are layered with architectural outlines and symbols of the regional cultural identity. There is an apple for the big city, a pair of dice for the Jersey Shore's gambling mecca and the face of Lady Liberty, a symbol shared by both sides of the Hudson.  

""This poster is a bold celebration of everything that makes the NY/NJ region so dynamic — our diversity, creativity, and unmistakable energy,"" said Bettina Garibaldi, the regional host committee's chief marketing and communications officer. ""Rich Tu's design captures the essence of who we are: a region that stands out.""

Tu said his poster draws inspiration from past World Cup visuals, including Lance Wyman's work during the 1970 Mexico campaign. Tu said he approached the project with an eye toward scale and permanence, aiming to reflect not just the sport but the energy of the region and the significance of the moment. Having a place in the history of the World Cup and its identifying art for his home region is both gratifying and deeply humbling, he said.

""The world is going to converge here at the end of the World Cup for the final, and this poster is going to sit in kids' rooms,"" Tu said. ""Just to be a part of the history is crazy.""

The poster is on display at 352 Marin Blvd., in Jersey City and set to join the permanent collection at Poster House in New York, the country's only museum dedicated to poster art. The digital version has also been on display in Times Square and at MetLife Stadium, where both the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup are scheduled to take place. MetLife is set to host nine matches in 2025 and eight in 2026, including the World Cup Final.

Tu, who earned degrees from Rutgers University and New York City's School of Visual Arts art college, is a partner at the studio Sunday Afternoon. He teaches at the art college and co-founded the COLORFUL Awards, a program supporting early-career artists from underrepresented backgrounds. He has also led creative efforts for MTV and Nike and worked with brands including Budweiser, G-Shock and The New York Times and been nominated for a Webby Award.","{'href': 'https://www.northjersey.com', 'title': 'Bergen Record'}","soccer"

Christian Pulisic is among a slew of regular starters who will be missing when the United States plays in next month's CONCACAF Gold Cup, another blow for a team coming off dismal performances at the Copa America and CONCACAF Nations League.

Given the absences, coach Mauricio Pochettino wants players who will convince worried fans that a turnaround is ahead.

""It's our responsibility to send some signal to them,"" he said Thursday during a Zoom news conference after announcing his 27-man roster. ""I think our fans need to see our team fighting and playing and performing and playing well, yes, but fighting for the flag and being always in every single game (to) match the aggressivity of the opponent.""

Pulisic, the top American player, asked to be left off the roster for the last competitive matches before the 2026 World Cup to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.

Yunus Musah also asked out, Antonee Robinson was dropped because he has been playing with an injury, and Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were blocked because FIFA gave the expanded Club World Cup priority over national teams.

Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Tanner Tessmann were omitted in what Pochettino called ""football decisions.""

U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said Pulisic and his advisers asked for the possibility to be left off because of the number of games he has played in the last two years.

""Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,"" Pochettino said. ""We decided the best for him, the best of the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.""

Pochettino replaced Gregg Berhalter after the team's first-round elimination at the Copa America last summer. After the Gold Cup, he will have just four brief training windows on FIFA international dates before players report ahead of the World Cup.

In the team's first significant test under Pochettino, the Americans lost to Panama and Canada in the Nations League in March. Without saying players had been complacent, Pochettino said, ""we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March, and it's about to be — maybe use a different way to approach these opportunities.""

Sixteen of the players picked are from Major League Soccer, the most in a FIFA window since the U.S. sent a B team to the 2023 Gold Cup.

""If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?"" Pochettino asked out loud. ""No, no, no, no, no. What we want do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused and spend all my focus and energy in the national team. ... If we want be good in one year time, we need to think that today is the most important day.""

Outside back Sergiño Dest returns to the national team for the first time since March 2024 after recovering from a torn ACL. Forward Folarin Balogun is with the team for the first time since last September, following his recuperation from shoulder surgery.

Pochettino's roster included Alex Freeman, a son of former NFL All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman. The 20-year-old right back made his Major League Soccer debut for Orlando in April 2023 — his only league match that season. He had two MLS appearances last year and has become a regular this season.

Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, a 24-year-old son of the former coach, also was picked for the first time along with 20-year-old forward Damion Downs and 21-year-old defender Quinn Sullivan.

Downs has played on youth teams of Germany and the U.S., and helped Cologne gain promotion to the Bundesliga for 2025-26 after a one-season absence.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese, who has attended national team camp previously but not played in a game, was also selected.

Players will start reporting June 1 for training in Chicago, and the 26-man Gold Cup roster is due June 4. The U.S. plays Turkey on June 7 at East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later at Nashville, Tennessee, then meets Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the first round of the Gold Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Deutsche Telekom secures ‘largest ever' FIFA World Cup rights package","https://www.sportcal.com/news/deutsche-telekom-secures-largest-ever-fifa-world-cup-rights-package/","Fri, 23 May 2025 15:23:51 GMT","

The package includes the 2026 men's and 2027 women's World Cups, and 2025 and 2027 U20 World Cups.

Deutsche Telekom (DT), the German telecommunications giant, has secured a wide-ranging package of soccer rights from global governing body FIFA, encompassing multiple World Cup events across different categories.

The four-tournament package includes games from the 2026 men's FIFA World Cup, the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup, and the youth-category U20 World Cups in 2025 and 2027.


                        The gold standard of business intelligence.

This will be the first time that DT will hold the rights for a FIFA Women's World Cup, which in 2027 will take place in Brazil.

Games will be broadcast on DT's MagentaTV OTT streaming service, on which it will also host highlights, game clips, interviews, shoulder content, and ancillary programming.

Despite the exclusive nature of the deal, Deutsche Telekom is likely to sublicense games out to public service broadcasters such as ARD and ZDF, or commercial free-to-air network RTL, to comply with German broadcasting law, which necessitates free-to-air coverage of fixtures involving the German national team in such major competitions.  

A similar deal occurred with the 2024 European Championships, hosted in Germany, for which DT held exclusive rights.

Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

In a reciprocal deal, DT sub-licensed the rights to that tournament to ARD and ZDF, in exchange for the rights to all 64 games of the 2022 FIFA World Cup (16 of which were exclusive games).

Combined, the new DT rights package will total 272 games of coverage, a deal that DT is calling the “largest World Cup package ever”, in part thanks to the expanded men's World Cup format of 48 teams, making that tournament total 104 matches in itself.

Speaking on the burden of broadcasting the expanded men's World Cup in 2026 – one that will occur across multiple time zones with a large difference to European time – DT's head of TV Arnim Butzen said: “48 participating nations, 104 matches over six weeks – this is the biggest football tournament of all time.

“For us and our partners, this will be a sprint over a marathon distance. This is especially true due to the different time zones in the three host countries. We are happy to accept this logistical challenge and want to make the World Cup an unforgettable football experience for our customers.”

DT is a long-time partner of German soccer's DFB governing body and the German national team, a deal that was renewed in late 2024 to run through the 2026 tournament.

A private-equity firm bought the official provider of logistics services for the 2026 World Cup in a deal worth more than $1 billion.

From turf to turnstiles, one company is helping build the 2026 FIFA World Cup from the ground up—and it just got purchased in a deal worth more than $1 billion.

Private-equity firm Providence Equity Partners on Wednesday acquired a majority stake in Global Critical Logistics (GCL), parent of Rock-It Cargo, which last year was selected to be the official logistics provider for next year's World Cup. 

Financial details were not disclosed, but a person familiar with the matter confirmed to Front Office Sports that the deal is worth more than $1 billion.

“FIFA is a game-changer for us, no question,” GCL president and CEO Dan Rosenthal tells FOS. “Next year's World Cup will be the largest event in sports history.”

What exactly will Rock-It Cargo be doing for the World Cup? Well, everything. The expansive event will feature a record 48 teams and have more than one host country for the first time since 2022; games will be held in 16 stadiums across three nations: the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. 

“If you take any of those stadiums and turn them upside down, anything that shakes out, we will have assisted in getting into place,” Rosenthal says. 

That includes turnstiles, the pitch itself, ref uniforms, player kits, weights that the teams will use in training, and more.

“Everything brought in to be used across the cities and in the venues, we will be assisting in importing, storing things in warehouses, transporting them to the venues, everything,” he says. “This event will set the stage for our growth to come.”

GCL landed the gig after a “highly competitive process,” and Rosenthal says FIFA ultimately selected his company due to its commitment to its craft, culture, and experience helping with major international events.

“We have uniquely different customs expertise compared to competitors,” he says.

Providence doesn't only invest directly in sports, but it has a healthy history of investing in areas surrounding sports leagues and franchises. Its first sports-related investment was the YES Network, and other investments have included the business behind the Ironman Triathlon events, the marketing arm of Major League Soccer, and college sports marketing company Learfield.

Recent acquisitions for Providence included the 2022 purchase of sports agency Wasserman—which represents players from the NBA, WNBA, NFL, MLB, and more—as well as the 2023 deal for a minority stake in Missouri-based sports and entertainment architectural and design firm Populous.

“We invest in the services ecosystem surrounding sports,” Scott Marimow, managing director at Providence, tells FOS. “GCL fits perfectly in with that strategy.”

The seller, ATL Partners, will retain a minority stake in GCL.

Thomas Tuchel has promised England will ""take care"" of their players set for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, with a third of his squad set to feature at this year's tournament.

The German named his second party as Three Lions boss on Friday, ahead of a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier with Andorra and a friendly with Senegal next month.

Several key faces in his team, including captain Harry Kane and midfielder Jude Bellingham, are expected to feature for their respective clubs in the United States only days after.

Speaking after the announcement of his team however, Tuchel hailed the revamped structure of an expanded tournament, live on DAZN, and promised to protect his stars.

""It is a massive tournament, a new one, a lot of travelling and it is very long,"" he said. ""That is the calendar nowadays.

""I think once the players are there they will love and embrace the challenge to play against teams they have maybe never played before.

""The Club World Cup that I played in before was very different and maybe this will change perception. Let's see.

""It is not worth complaining, it is the schedule and we have to find the best solutions within the schedule for the players.

""Because I was in club football we will take care of the minutes of the players if we can. Spending time together was very important for us.""

Richard Gasquet is feeling very good about the state of French tennis.

The 38-year-old has been representing France on the ATP Tour to the best of his ability for over two decades.

Now Gasquet is set to bring his career to an end on home soil at the French Open and bid what will be an emotional farewell to his home fans.

As Gasquet prepares to hang up his racket, he is very confident that he is leaving French tennis on the men's circuit in good hands.

Richard Gasquet has seen plenty of French players come and go during his time on the ATP Tour.

The likes of Gael Monfils, 38, are still going strong, while former top 10 players Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Gilles Simon are no longer active.

Gasquet will soon join them, and he has every faith that the Frenchmen who are at the start of their careers, can be very successful, such as World number 14 Arthur Fils and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who possesses arguably the game's fastest serve.

“The ones I enjoy watching the most are the up-and-coming French players,” Gasquet told the French Open website.

“Arthur Fils, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, they can win some big tournaments. I believe. They have the potential to do so.”

Gasquet is preparing for the final tournament of his career which will be the French Open.

He will take on fellow Frenchman Terence Atmane in what will likely be a raucous atmosphere inside whichever arena is chosen to stage it.

This will be the first and only encounter between these two players and fans will be keen to see if Gasquet can continue his career for at least one more match.

When asked why he wanted to end his career at the French Open, Gasquet said: “As a French player, it's simply the greatest tournament in the world.

“It's a Grand Slam, of course, but I feel like this tournament is above all the others, ten times above, light years above all the others.

“It just seems right to end my career here at Roland. When I made the decision to call it a day in October 2024, when I felt as if the time had come, I straight away thought of Roland-Garros.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Announcing plans to play Geneva for a second year in a row, Djokovic also revealed he had split from rival-turned-coach Andy Murray, a fellow former No. 1 who had been part of Djokovic's team since the end of last season.

Djokovic recovered from a second-set wobble to roar into his first final of the season.

Djokovic, who confirmed he is working with Dusan Vemic and assistant coach Boris Bosnjakovic, made a strong start to his Geneva campaign with back-to-back straight-sets wins over Marton Fucsovics and No. 8 seed Matteo Arnaldi, who won their match at the Mutua Madrid Open last month.Standing between the Serb and a 143rd career ATP final was Norrie, a former BNP Paribas Open champion and Wimbledon semifinalist.

Novak Djokovic into Geneva Open final following semi-final victory over Britain's Cam Norrie; Djokovic to face Hubert Hurkacz in Saturday's final; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Friday 23 May 2025 18:16, UK

Novak Djokovic is through to the Geneva Open final after dominating Britain's Cam Norrie in a third-set decider on Friday, winning 6-4 6-7 6-1.

Having secured the opening set via a solitary break of serve, Djokovic - as he did in his quarter-final against Italian Matteo Arnaldi - fell a break down in the second, only to break back and get on level terms.

Unlike in Djokovic's quarter, though, Norrie forced a tiebreak as he put the fact he was 5-3 ahead out of his mind, and at the second attempt clinched the set to force a decider - saving match point before doing so.

The third set saw Djokovic race out to a 3-0 advantage, however, and the Serbian never looked back, kicking on to seal a comfortable final-set win 6-1.

Djokovic will face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in Saturday's final, after the latter defeated Sebastian Ofner of Austria 6-3 6-4 earlier on Friday.

The 24-time grand slam champion has been stuck on 99 ATP titles since winning an emotional Olympic gold medal last summer, losing finals in Shanghai last year and in Miami in the spring.

It has been a tough season so far for former British No 1 Norrie but he has found some form on the clay and came through qualifying in Switzerland before making it to the last four.

He had won only one set in four previous meetings against Djokovic and managed another here before his challenge faded in the decider.

In his on-court interview, Djokovic said: ""It was the toughest match of the tournament for me so far for sure. Second set he was a break up and I managed to come back, tie-break, match point, I got a bit tight there, missed a couple of mid-court shots.

""That's what happens but I'm really glad how I regrouped in the third and played really the best set of the tournament. It means a lot so let's go for a title.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","ATP: Carlos Alcaraz confident but cautious of Jannik Sinner heading into French Open","https://www.flashscore.com/news/tennis-french-open-atp-singles-in-form-alcaraz-confident-but-cautious-of-sinner-heading-into-french-open/zcZy81IG/","Fri, 23 May 2025 14:55:40 GMT","

Alcaraz and Sinner will be on opposite sides of the draw as the Spaniard returned to the second in the world this week following his Italian Open triumph, potentially setting the stage for another blockbuster final between the game's two rising superstars.

The 22-year-old Alcaraz has won 15 of 16 matches on clay this season, triumphing at Monte Carlo and reaching the Barcelona final before going all the way in Rome after missing the Madrid Open with a thigh injury.

He has also had Sinner's number of late, winning their last four meetings to take a 7-4 head-to-head advantage, a record that includes Alcaraz's five-set win in last year's French Open semi-final. His success on Sunday ended Sinner's run of 26 successive victories.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz believes the challenge of playing Sinner brings the best out of him.

""He's the best player in the world. It doesn't matter that he was out of the tour for three months. Every tournament he's playing, he plays great. The numbers are there. He wins almost every match he plays,"" said Alcaraz.

""If I don't play at my best, 10 out of 10, it's going to be impossible to beat him. That's why I'm more focused when I'm playing against him, or I feel a little bit different when I'm going to face him than other players.

""He has that aura. When you're seeing him on the other side of the net, it's different.

""I'm not going to say I'm feeling like when Rafa (Nadal) and Roger (Federer) are playing, but I'm feeling like it's a different energy when we are facing each other.""

Sinner suffered his first straight-sets loss in 18 months in Rome, underlining his dominance in that time. Equally as impressive, though, was his run to the final in his first tournament since he retained the Australian Open title in January.

""I am closer than expected in a way of everything,"" said Sinner, who served a three-month ban after twice testing positive for traces of the banned anabolic steroid clostebol.

Sinner has always maintained that the product entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who had used a spray containing it to treat a cut.

He eventually reached a settlement after authorities accepted the contamination was accidental and that a longer ban would be an ""unduly harsh sanction"".

""After three months coming here, making this result means a lot to me,"" Sinner said after his runners-up finish in Rome.

""It gives me hopefully confidence to play some good tennis also in Paris.""

Sinner called Alcaraz ""the man to beat,"" but Alexander Zverev is among the title pretenders too after falling just short in last year's final. Zverev then lost to Sinner in the Australian Open final, but does have a clay trophy under his belt this season after winning in Munich.

He made a late decision to enter the Hamburg event this week after losing in the quarter-finals in Rome, searching for a boost after a ""very negative"" loss to Lorenzo Musetti.

""This can't be the last match before the French Open... I need positivity before it starts,"" said Zverev.

Novak Djokovic will touch down in Paris with limited expectations for a man with a record 24 Grand Slam titles, three of them coming at Roland Garros.

The long-time former world number one has slipped to sixth in the rankings, leaving him vulnerable to the possibility of a quarter-final against Alcaraz or Sinner, as his wait for a tour-level 100th title goes on. His last one came at the Olympics, where he beat Alcaraz on Court Philippe Chatrier to land an elusive gold medal.

Djokovic skipped Rome after early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid and is looking to rediscover some form by playing in Geneva.

Madrid champion Casper Ruud is a two-time Roland Garros runner-up, while Britain's Jack Draper ranks a career-best fifth after winning at Indian Wells and reaching the Madrid final.

Musetti has also performed well during the clay swing. The Italian lost the Monte Carlo final to Alcaraz and made the last four as well in Madrid and Rome.

Holger Rune is the only player to beat Alcaraz so far on clay this season, but he has struggled for fitness on either side of his Barcelona triumph.

With all of the Top 75 players entered and the full draw revealed, the 2025 French Open promises big-name battles, comeback arcs and an open race to the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen.

The 2025 Roland Garros draw is out, and defending champion Iga Swiatek faces a difficult path in her quest for a fifth Coupe Suzanne Lenglen trophy. 

Seeded No. 5, her lowest at a Slam since the 2022 Australian Open, Swiatek hasn't reached a final since winning the trophy in Paris last year. She opens against Rebecca Sramkova, with a possible second-round match against either Emma Raducanu or Wang Xinyu. No. 26 seed Marta Kostyuk looms in the third round, while potential fourth-round opponents include No. 12 Elena Rybakina and No. 21 Jelena Ostapenko -- who holds a 6-0 record against Swiatek.

Swiatek is in the same quarter of the draw as No. 4 seed and last year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini, fresh off her second WTA 1000 title in Rome. They are in the same half of the draw as No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka, who opens against Kamilla Rakhimova. Sabalenka has also landed in a section full of landmines: No. 27 seed Leylah Fernandez, Danielle Collins or Olga Danilovic could be third-round opponents, while either No. 16 seed Amanda Anisimova or No. 22 seed Clara Tauson could await in the last 16. Sabalenka is projected to face No. 8 seed Zheng Qinwen, her conqueror in Rome last week, in the quarterfinals.

No. 2 seed Coco Gauff opens against Olivia Gadecki and is projected to face Australian Open champion and No. 7 seed Madison Keys in the quarterfinals. No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula and No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva head the third quarter, which contains another popcorn first round between No. 10 seed Paula Badosa and former World No. 1 Naomi Osaka.

Click here to view the full draw.

For the first time in her career, Sabalenka arrives in Paris as the best player in the world -- by some distance. She has won a tour-leading three titles this season so far, including a third trophy in Madrid three weeks ago. She's the reigning US Open champion, and was also a finalist at the Australian Open in January. Can she convert that dominance into a first Roland Garros title?

Her quarter contains a number of dangerous players with a variety of records against Sabalenka. She's dominated the head-to-head against Collins 7-0, but trails Anisimova 5-2. A potential third round against Fernandez would be their first meeting since the Canadian memorably upset Sabalenka in the 2021 US Open semifinals. Tauson and Zheng both defeated her in their most recent encounters this year, in Dubai and Rome respectively.

Zheng will have to navigate a few players of note to make her potential quarterfinal date with Sabalenka. She takes on 2021 runner-up Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the first round; next could be Miami semifinalist Alexandra Eala, who will make her Grand Slam main-draw debut against Emiliana Arango. Rome semifinalist Peyton Stearns, seeded for the first time at a major at No. 28, is slated to meet Zheng in the third round; No. 11 seed Diana Shnaider is projected in the last 16.

Meanwhile, Petra Kvitova will return to the Grand Slam stage for the first time since returning from maternity leave against Viktorija Golubic, with the winner to face either Anisimova or a qualifier.

First-round matches to watch: [1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. Kamilla Rakhimova, Olga Danilovic vs. [27] Leylah Fernandez, [22] Clara Tauson vs. Magda Linette, [SR] Petra Kvitova vs. Viktorija Golubic, [28] Peyton Stearns vs. Eva Lys, Alexandra Eala vs. Emiliana Arango, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova vs. [8] Zheng Qinwen

Despite the big names in Swiatek's section, the former World No.1 holds the head-to-head edge over most. She's yet to drop a set to either Raducanu or Kostyuk in seven combined meetings, and though she trails Rybakina 4-3 overall, Swiatek has won both of their matches this season. The exception remains 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko, who owns a 6-0 record against her.

With Rybakina and Ostapenko potentially looming in the fourth round, Swiatek's path isn't easy, but the draw may have lightened slightly with the withdrawal of Belinda Bencic, who had originally been scheduled to face Rybakina in the first round.

Paolini, fresh off a confidence-boosting title on home soil in Rome, could face hard-hitting Australian teenager Maya Joint in the second round, No. 29 seed Linda Noskova in the third and No. 13 seed Elina Svitolina in the fourth. Svitolina, a four-time quarterfinalist in Paris, defeated Paolini at the Australian Open in January in their only previous meeting.

First-round matches to watch: Anastasia Potapova vs. [29] Linda Noskova, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [13] Elina Svitolina, [WC] Iva Jovic vs. Renata Zarazua, Emma Raducanu vs. Wang Xinyu

Between Pegula and Andreeva in the third quarter lies several accomplished players on the comeback trail from injury. Pegula's projected fourth-round opponent, No. 14 seed and 2023 finalist Karolina Muchova, has not played since Miami due to a left wrist problem. Their section also contains three unseeded former Top 5 players who have all suffered shoulder injuries of late.

Marketa Vondrousova, the 2019 finalist, underwent shoulder surgery last year, and has not competed since February because of the same issue. Ons Jabeur and Maria Sakkari both ended their 2024 seasons early due to shoulder problems, and have struggled to regain peak form on their return; they are down at No. 35 and No. 92 in the PIF WTA Rankings respectively. Jabeur also suffered a leg injury in Miami, and has not won a match since -- though a fourth-round run in Madrid showed some promise for Sakkari.

Jabeur opens against No. 25 seed Magdalena Frech, with Vondrousova potentially awaiting in the second round in what would be a rematch of the 2023 Wimbledon final. Whoever emerges from that could face Pegula in the third round. Meanwhile, Muchova and Sakkari could meet in the second round if they defeat Alycia Parks and Elsa Jacquemot respectively.

Andreeva, the winner of two WTA 1000 titles already this year, opens against Cristina Bucsa and is projected to face another player on the comeback trail, No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, in the last 16. Badosa has been sidelined for two months due to a recurrence of her back injury, only returning this week in Strasbourg. Indeed, her first round against Osaka marks unfinished business between the two. They were scheduled to meet in the second round of Rome two weeks ago before Badosa withdrew just half an hour ahead of the match.

First-round matches to watch: [17] Daria Kasatkina vs. Katerina Siniakova, Naomi Osaka vs. [10] Paula Badosa, [14] Karolina Muchova vs. Alycia Parks, [WC] Lois Boisson vs. [24] Elise Mertens, [25] Magdalena Frech vs. Ons Jabeur

It's possible to draw both positives and negatives from Gauff's clay season so far. From the glass-half-full perspective, there's no arguing with back-to-back WTA 1000 finals in Madrid and Rome, particularly given that the former US Open champion had failed to make the semifinals in her six prior tournaments. On the other hand, back-to-back losses in finals would have been unwelcome for a player who had previously won nine of her 10 tour-level title matches.

Gauff, the 2022 finalist in Paris, has a manageable draw to build on her recent form. She is slated to face No. 15 seed Barbora Krejcikova in the fourth round; the Wimbledon champion has only just returned from a six-month hiatus with a back injury this week in Strasbourg. The other Top 20 seed in Gauff's section, No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova, started 2025 in hot form but withdrew from Rome and Strasbourg due to a shoulder injury.

Keys, a semifinalist here in 2018, has yet to reach a final following her Australian Open title run -- though the American's power game, bolstered by the confidence of a Grand Slam trophy, could well click on the major stage again. Another potential threat to Gauff is another compatriot, No. 9 seed Emma Navarro, who defeated her at two Grand Slams last year.

First-round matches to watch: Varvara Gracheva vs. [31] Sofia Kenin, [23] Beatriz Haddad Maia vs. Hailey Baptiste, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. [9] Emma Navarro, [15] Barbora Krejcikova vs. Tatjana Maria, [30] Anna Kalinskaya vs. Marie Bouzkova

The four-time champion hopes a subtle philosophical shift will unlock her dominance in Paris

The aura is undeniable. The numbers – and legacy – as well. 

Roland-Garros is Iga Swiatek's happy place and the love affair continues in full swing. 

What does the four-time champion, who last year became the first woman to complete a successful three-peat at Roland-Garros since Justine Henin in 2007, love so much about playing in Paris? 

“Honestly, everything,” she told reporters with a smile, while fielding questions inside the tournament's crowded main interview room on Friday. “I love playing tennis here.” 

Though Swiatek hasn't lived up to her own lofty expectations on the clay this spring, there is hope that sliding her feet on the Parisian clay will be the spark that helps her dial in her laser focus once again. 

Her situation hasn't been dire, but it has been surprising: Swiatek enters Roland-Garros without a clay court title under her belt for the first time since she won her maiden title here, as the world No.54 in 2020. 

Disappointed by her performances in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome, where she failed to reach a single final, the 23-year-old continues to seek solutions. 

“After Rome, I had a lot of time to think about how I played and what my attitude was,” she said. “For sure I focused on changing some stuff.” 

Insiders have also noticed that Swiatek has been a little on edge of late, and believe that a return to Paris, where she holds a mind-boggling 35-2 lifetime record, could be the perfect elixir. 

“For her it's all about mentality,” former world No.1 Caroline Wozniacki said this week in a conference call to promote TNT's coverage of Roland-Garros. “If she can stay loose, if she can stay relaxed, if she can stay happy, her game comes together.”

Wozniacki believes that there is nothing missing from Swiatek's game at the moment. She thinks Swiatek simply needs to relax and let her epic tennis flow. 

“How is she going to go into Roland-Garros?” she asked. “Is she going to feel a ton of pressure and feel tight because she's won there so many times, or is she going to go in there and say ‘You know what? I've won here so many times I can relax and enjoy, because this is my surface and everyone else should be afraid of me.'” 

When you've played close to perfection on a surface for so long, the expectations tend to get higher. A self-described perfectionist, Swiatek admitted on Friday that she tends to judge herself too harshly when she's not playing the type of mind-boggling tennis she knows she is capable of. 

“I don't think it's possible [to not be] a perfectionist, but for sure there are ways to control it a bit more,” she said. “But lately, when I made some mistakes on the court, I focused on them a little bit too much. 

“I needed to realise that by myself, even though my team kind of told me that it's happening.” 

Feature

Sinner sees 'room to improve'

Now that she has recognised the issue, expect a simpler, more patient game from Swiatek than we've seen at other European events this spring. Deep down she knows her tried-and-true patterns can be lethal against the game's best. 

When you've created a blueprint for dominance at a place, why change it? 

“Working her way into the tournament and trying to find her footwork, literally and figuratively, is the way to go,” said two-time Roland-Garros champion Jim Courier, who joined Wozniacki in TNT's conference call earlier this week. “Keep it simple. Her game's good enough.”

Swiatek believes her best tennis will come when she stops worrying about mistakes and simply focuses on attacking her next opportunity. 

She may be outside of the top 4 for the first time in over three years, and seeded fifth in Paris with a gauntlet of a draw to deal with, but she's still the gold standard on the Parisian clay until further notice. 

No woman has won four consecutive Roland-Garros singles titles in the Open Era. With the power of positive thinking fuelling her, Swiatek hopes to be the first to reach the promised land. 

“I want to be more positive about what I'm doing and not focus too much on the mistakes a little bit and kind of just go for it. Be more brave,” she concluded. ","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland-Garros'}","tennis"

French Open

French tennis player Caroline Garcia, the 2022 WTA Tour Finals champion and former world No. 4, has confirmed that the 2025 French Open will be her last as she “says goodbye” to the sport.

“After 15 years competing at the highest level, and more than 25 years putting pretty much every second of my life into it, I feel ready to start a new chapter,” Garcia, 31, wrote on social media.

“I have a few tournaments left. The first one is at home, at Roland Garros. My 14th consecutive time being part of it. And my last,” she wrote.

Garcia is a French Open champion, having won the women's doubles with compatriot Kristina Mladenovic in 2016. In lifting the trophy, Garcia and Mladenovic became the first French pair to win the event in 45 years.

 

 

A post shared by Caroline Garcia (@carogarcia)



Garcia, whose best singles run in Paris took her to the quarterfinals in 2017, won 11 WTA Tour singles titles in her career, three of them at the 1,000 level, one rung below a Grand Slam.

In 2022, she entered the season-ending Tour Finals as the No. 6 seed, but qualified from a group containing then-world No. 1 Iga Świątek. She then beat Aryna Sabalenka in the final to take the title, despite Sabalenka having beaten the world No. 1, No. 2 (Ons Jabeur) and No. 3 (Jessica Pegula) in previous rounds.

Garcia also achieved her best singles Grand Slam result in the same year, reaching the U.S. Open semifinals, where she lost to Jabeur. Her success that year came after a period of more difficult results, after which she took a break from the sport to recover from a foot injury. Garcia later said that she developed an eating disorder in that period, which she later described as one of “many tears, many sleepless nights” in an interview with L'Equipe.

Garcia has been one of the most open players about the pressure of being an elite athlete and its impact on everyday life. She has posted publicly about the abuse players receive online after losing matches, as well as being open about the connection between results and mental health.

After a challenging 2024 season, she ended her campaign in September after experiencing panic attacks and anxiety over her form.

“I'm tired of living in a world where my worth is measured by last week's results, my ranking, or my unforced errors,” Garcia wrote in a post on X.

“I'm 30 now, and I've had an incredible career—winning 1000-level titles, the WTA Finals, doubles Slams, reaching No. 4 in the world.

“But in my mind, I've been stuck on what I haven't achieved. I never made it to No. 1, never won a Slam, never reached an Olympic podium. I've been inconsistent, unable to stay in the top 10 for a full year,” she wrote.

In announcing her last French Open, Garcia said that it will not be her final tournament as it stands. The main draw begins May 25, with Garcia facing American player Bernarda Pera.

As well as a hugely impressive career, Garcia will always be remembered for her openness in talking about the mental challenges of being a professional tennis player.

Her social media post last year about the abuse she so regularly received after matches struck a chord with pretty much everyone involved in the sport, because of how relatable and universal it was. A candid conversation with Naomi Osaka on Garcia's podcast, “Tennis Insider Club”, was similarly illuminating about the challenges tennis players face.

A popular, thoughtful figure on the tour, Garcia will be missed — both for her exciting, aggressive way of playing and for willingness to put her head above the parapet to talk about subjects that are too often considered taboo.

That, coupled with a career-high ranking of No. 4 (plus No. 2 in doubles) and a WTA Tour Finals title, are a fine legacy for a hugely talented player once tipped by Andy Murray as a future world No. 1.

The clay season is approaching its final tournament, as Roland Garros is set to get underway on the 25th of May in Paris.

The draw for the French Open has been announced, with favourable paths to the final for the likes of Novak Djokovic and Coco Gauff. 

It will be the first time the event has taken place since 14-time champion Rafael Nadal retired, marking the start of a new era in the French capital.

On the women's side, however, an era is coming to an end for a former Roland Garros quarter-finalist. 

Former world number four Caroline Garcia took to social media to announce: “Dear tennis, it's time to say goodbye. After 15 years competing at the highest level, and more than 25 years putting pretty much every second of my life into it, I feel ready to start a new chapter.”

“My tennis journey hasn't always been easy. Since my early days, tennis has been much more than just winning or losing. It's been love or hate. Happiness or anger.”

“Still, I'm deeply grateful for this journey—for everything tennis has given me, and for how much it's helped me become a strong, passionate, hard-working woman. But now, it's time for something else.”

“My body and my personal goals need it. Still, this is not over—not just yet. I have a few tournaments left. The first one is at home, at Roland Garros. My 14th consecutive time being part of it. And my last. So to all my tennis family who'll be around: let's meet one more time, to dream, and fight together.”

“In the coming days, there will be more time to share what's next for me. But for now, I just want to focus on living these last weeks as a tennis pro to the fullest. Thank you so much for your support. See you soon on court.”

Garcia has never won a Grand Slam singles title in her career, but has come close on several occasions. 

Her best attempt came at the US Open in 2022, when she made it to the semi-final before bowing out to Ons Jabeur in straight sets.  

At Roland Garros, Garcia's best campaign was a quarter-final finish in 2017, where she was defeated by second seed Karolina Pliskova. 

She has never made it past the Round of 16 at either the Australian Open or Wimbledon. 

Despite her lack of major titles in singles, Garcia is a two-time French Open champion in doubles, with victories in 2016 and 2022 partnering Kristina Mladenovic. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

May 23 (UPI) -- Carolina Garcia, the former No. 4 women's tennis player in the world, will play in her final French Open and soon retire, she announced Friday on social media.

""Dear tennis, it's time to say goodbye,"" Garcia wrote on Instagram and X.

Garcia, 31, previously dealt with a lingering foot injury and a bout with bulimia, which she revealed in 2023. She achieved her career-high ranking (No. 4) in 2018. Garcia sits at No. 145 in the latest WTA Tour singles rankings.

""After 15 years competing at the highest level, and over 25 years devoting almost every second of my life to this sport, I feel ready to turn the page and open a new chapter,"" Garcia wrote on social media.

""My tennis journey hasn't always been easy. Since my early days, tennis has been much more than just wining or losing. It's been love or hate. Happiness or anger. Still, I'm deeply grateful for this journey -- for everything tennis has given me, and for how much it's helped me become a strong, passionate, hard-working woman.

""But now it's time for something else. My body and personal goals need it.""

Garcia, of France, will face No. 90 Bernarda Pera of the United States in the first round of the 2025 French Open on Sunday in Paris. The winner will meet No. 65 Anna Blinkova of Russia or No. 18 Donna Vekic of Croatia in the second round.

Garcia said she still has ""some tournaments left,"" but did not say the events she plans to enter this season. She is to make her 14th appearance at the French Open. Garcia's best finish at Roland-Garros was a 2017 run to the quarterfinals. She reached the 2022 U.S. Open semifinals for her best run at a Grand Slam.

The 2022 WTA Finals champion achieved a career-high No. 2 rankings in the doubles circuit in 2016. She won French Open doubles titles alongside countrywoman Kristina Mladenovic in 2016 and 2022.

""In the coming days, there will be more time to share what's next for me,"" Garcia wrote. ""But for now, I just want to focus on living these last few weeks as a tennis pro to the fullest. Thank you all for your support. See you on the court in just a few days.""

Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff lead the 2025 Wimbledon main-draw entry list, which features 12 Grand Slam champions and the whole of the Top 99 in the PIF WTA Rankings.

The main-draw entry list for Wimbledon 2025 is out, led by World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and World No. 2 Coco Gauff and featuring the entirety of the Top 99 in the PIF WTA Rankings. Click here to view the full entry list.

Both Sabalenka and Gauff will be bidding for a first Wimbledon title. Sabalenka is a two-time semifinalist at The Championships (2021 and 2023), but had to miss last year's edition due to a shoulder injury. Gauff reached the last 16 as a 15-year-old qualifier in a star-making 2019 debut, but has yet to progress beyond that round.

Three former winners are on the entry list: defending champion Barbora Krejcikova, 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova and 2022 champion Elena Rybakina. None are currently in the world's Top 10. A back injury sidelined Krejcikova for the first five months of the year, and she only returned to action this week in Strasbourg (falling to Magda Linette in her opener). Vondrousova missed the second half of 2024 due to a shoulder injury, and has not competed since February due to the same issue.

Two-time champion Petra Kvitova, who returned from maternity leave in February and is currently ranked No. 608, has not entered with her special ranking. The 2011 and 2014 winner will need a wild card to compete in the main draw.

In total, there are 12 Grand Slam champions with direct entry into the main draw. As well as Sabalenka, Gauff, Rybakina, Krejcikova and Vondrousova, the initial list features Iga Swiatek, Madison Keys, Jelena Ostapenko, Sofia Kenin, Emma Raducanu, Naomi Osaka and Victoria Azarenka. None have reached a Wimbledon final to date; Ostapenko and Azarenka are both former semifinalists at SW19. Two former Wimbledon finalists will bid to go one step further and lift their maiden major trophy -- Jasmine Paolini and Ons Jabeur.

Arantxa Rus, the World No. 99 in the rankings as of the week of May 20, is the last direct acceptance.

Five players have entered the main draw using special rankings:

The first 15 alternates to the main draw in case of withdrawals are as follows:

1. Aoi Ito (JPN)2. Erika Andreeva3. Bianca Andreescu (CAN)4. Alizé Cornet (FRA) (using a special ranking of No. 102)5. Leolia Jeanjean (FRA)6. Antonia Ruzic (CRO)7. Diane Parry (FRA)8.

As we move into the heart of the tennis calendar, with Roland Garros in full swing and the grass courts of Wimbledon just around the corner, a handful of stars have already made 2025 their own.

The men's game is thriving with depth, rivalry, and youthful brilliance—and the following players are setting the standard.

Jannik Sinner – The relentless World No.1

Where better to start than with Jannik Sinner? The current World No.1 has continued his rapid ascent with ruthless precision.

After a breakout 2024 season, where he finally got over the Grand Slam hump with wins in the Australian Open and US Open, the 23-year-old Italian began 2025 in style—defending his Melbourne Park crown with a clinical straight-sets win over Alexander Zverev.

A suspension for a banned substance saw him sidelined for over 100 days early in the year, but Sinner wasted no time in regaining his rhythm.

His return to form was showcased in Rome, where he stormed to the Italian Open final. Along the way, he produced stirring comeback wins against tough opponents like Casper Ruud, and Tommy Paul, showing the mental steel that now defines his game.

With three Slams already under his belt and having proven he can bounce back from adversity, Sinner looks poised for another deep run at the remaining majors—and he's one of the favourites in the Wimbledon odds.

Carlos Alcaraz – Still the man to beat

Although the Australian Open remains the missing piece in his Grand Slam puzzle, Carlos Alcaraz has been a consistent menace on the ATP Tour this season.

The 22-year-old Spaniard has already collected three titles in 2025—Rotterdam, Monte-Carlo, and the Italian Open—adding more silverware to an already sparkling collection.

He fell just short in Barcelona, losing a high-octane final to Holger Rune, and was outgunned by Jack Draper in the Indian Wells semi-finals. But Alcaraz, as ever, continues to thrill with his aggressive shot-making and never-say-die attitude.

As the reigning champion at both the French Open and Wimbledon, the summer presents a golden opportunity for Alcaraz to extend his dominance and reassert himself as the sport's top draw.

Jack Draper – The breakout Brit

It's been a breakthrough year for Jack Draper. The 23-year-old Brit has firmly established himself among the world's elite, reaching a career-high World No.5 thanks to a string of standout performances.

The highlight came in March, when Draper captured his first ATP 1000 title at Indian Wells—taking out Carlos Alcaraz in the semis before a commanding win over Holger Rune in the final.

He's also finished runner-up twice already this season: in Doha, where he pushed Andrey Rublev to the limit, and in Madrid, where he fell short against Ruud.

With a strong serve, powerful groundstrokes, and growing confidence, Draper is beginning to look like a legitimate Grand Slam contender—but he remains 8/1 in the tennis odds for Wimbledon.

Alexander Zverev – Struggling Since His Third Major Final But Still In The Hunt

Few players have come closer to Grand Slam glory without sealing the deal than Alexander Zverev. But the 28-year-old German continues to knock on the door in 2025. He started the season with a runner-up finish in Melbourne and but has struggled a bit since. Returning to where he reached the final last year in Paris could kick start his game.

Currently third in the Race to Turin, Zverev picked up title No.24 in Munich last month, delighting his home fans by defeating Ben Shelton in the final.

That win followed a strong showing in the Australian Open and a solid clay-court campaign, where he again proved tough to beat.

Having reached the French Open final in 2024, Zverev will be hoping to finally go one better on the Parisian clay this time around. With his all-court game and vast experience, a maiden Slam feels increasingly inevitable.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Get to know Jacob Fearnley, the British tennis star currently ranked 54th globally after Wimbledon wildcard","https://tennishead.net/get-to-know-jacob-fearnley-the-british-tennis-player-currently-ranked-no-54-globally/","Fri, 23 May 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

From the back gardens of his childhood to the grand stages of professional tennis, Jacob Fearnley's journey is one to follow. 

Turning pro in 2022 after a triumphant stint at TCU, this 23-year-old Brit has quickly emerged as a force on the ATP Tour. 

2024 marked a significant milestone with his Davis Cup debut for Great Britain, and now, the world No. 54 is set to tackle the Roland Garros qualifying rounds, facing a tough opening challenge against former champion Stan Wawrinka. 

He is truly one to keep an eye on with his journey just beginning. 

Fearnley's ascent in the ATP world rankings has been a rapid climb. Going into 2024 outside the top 600 at No. 646, his breakthrough came during the grass-court season with a maiden ATP Challenger title in Nottingham. 

A wildcard entry into Wimbledon saw him reach the second round, propelling him into the top 225. Following this, a strong run on the Challenger Tour yielded three more titles, culminating in his entry into the top 100 in September 2024.

By the end of the year, he stood at No. 99, a surprising rise of over 500 places. This run continued into 2025, reaching the third round of the Australian Open and achieving a career-high ranking of No. 54 by May 2025, marking an extraordinary surge into the upper levels of professional tennis.

According to the ATP Tour, Jacob Fearnley has earned $707,762 in career prize money. This total reflects his earnings from both singles and doubles competitions across all professional levels. 

A significant portion of these earnings has come during his rapid rise in the rankings, boosted by his four ATP Challenger singles titles in 2024 and his second-round appearance at Wimbledon in the same year, as well as reaching the third round of the Australian Open in 2025. 

Fearnley has not yet won any major singles titles. His best results in Grand Slam singles events are:

He qualified for the main draw and reached the third round. His run included a notable straight-sets victory over home favourite Nick Kyrgios in the first round, followed by a four-set win against Frenchman Arthur Cazaux. His journey ended against the No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev in the third round, marking his best Grand Slam singles result to date.

The 23-year-old's Wimbledon second round in 2024 was a significant Centre Court debut against the legendary Novak Djokovic. Despite losing in four sets (6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 7-5), he put up a decent fight, even taking a set off the eventual champion. This performance marked his first Grand Slam second round appearance and boosted his ranking.

Jacob Fearnley is currently preparing for his French Open main draw debut in 2025. The tournament is ongoing, starting on Sunday, May 25th. Fearnley is drawn against former champion Stan Wawrinka in a highly anticipated first-round match on the Parisian clay. The 23-year-old Brit, currently ranked No. 54, will be aiming to make a strong start in his first appearance in the singles main draw at Roland Garros.

Fearnley took part in the US Open qualifying rounds in 2024. In the first round of qualifying, he faced fellow Briton Paul Jubb. Fearnley won the match in three sets, 6-2, 6-7(7), 7-6(6). However, he did not advance further in the qualifying tournament and did not reach the main draw of the 2024 US Open.

Fearnley is 23 years old and was born on July 15, 2001. His height is 1.83 meters (6 feet 0 inches). Currently, he is in a relationship with Keagan Polk. She is a former athlete from Texas Christian University (TCU), where Fearnley also played college tennis.

A post shared by Keagan Polk (@keagan.polk)

Fearnley balanced his studies in kinesiology at Texas Christian University (TCU) with a stellar five-year college tennis career. 

On the court, Fearnley earned All-Big 12 and All-America honours all four years, playing a crucial role in TCU's back-to-back ITA Indoor National Championships (2022, 2023) and their first NCAA Division I men's tennis championship in 2024. 

A four-time ITA All-American and a three-time NCAA Individual Championships qualifier, he also achieved the No. 1 ITA doubles ranking and a top 10 ITA singles ranking. He was a two-time qualifier for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, gaining valuable experience on the professional circuit while still studying. 

His mother is Samantha, who was a human resources manager in the National Health Service. His father is Craig, who worked for Johnson Controls. Both of his parents are now retired. He started playing tennis at the age of three. His grandparents introduced him to the sport, and he first picked up a racket in their back garden.

Fearnley is coached by Toby Smith, Tennis Scotland's National Manager, and Juan Martin, his former college teammate. Smith brings years of experience, while Martin offers useful insight from his playing journey, all focused on driving the world number 54 further in his career.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

“Still, I'm deeply grateful for this journey—for everything tennis has given me, and for how much it's helped me become a strong, passionate, hard-working woman. But now, it's time for something else.”

“My body and my personal goals need it. Still, this is not over—not just yet. I have a few tournaments left. The first one is at home, at Roland Garros. My 14th consecutive time being part of it. And my last. So to all my tennis family who'll be around: let's meet one more time, to dream, and fight together.”

“In the coming days, there will be more time to share what's next for me. But for now, I just want to focus on living these last weeks as a tennis pro to the fullest. Thank you so much for your support. See you soon on court.”

Garcia has never won a Grand Slam singles title in her career, but has come close on several occasions. 

Her best attempt came at the US Open in 2022, when she made it to the semi-final before bowing out to Ons Jabeur in straight sets.  

At Roland Garros, Garcia's best campaign was a quarter-final finish in 2017, where she was defeated by second seed Karolina Pliskova. 

She has never made it past the Round of 16 at either the Australian Open or Wimbledon. 

Despite her lack of major titles in singles, Garcia is a two-time French Open champion in doubles, with victories in 2016 and 2022 partnering Kristina Mladenovic. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu shocked the tennis world when she won the 2021 US Open, and the Brit is capable of winning another Grand Slam title, according to former world No 1 Caroline Wozniacki.

As an 18-year-old qualifier ranked 150th, Raducanu stormed to the US Open title without dropping a set in one of the most remarkable major runs in tennis history. Raducanu is the only player to win a Grand Slam title as a qualifier.

Since her stunning breakthrough in New York — which remains her only WTA title — Raducanu has endured a challenging time on tour, with injuries frequently hampering her progress.

The 22-year-old hired renowned physical trainer Yutaka Nakamura, who previously worked with Maria Sharapova and Naomi Osaka, at the end of the 2024 season.

After a difficult start to 2025, Raducanu kickstarted her campaign at the Miami Open, where she started working with coach Mark Petchey. She reached the quarter-finals in Miami — her best WTA 1000 result and most impressive performance since her US Open triumph.

The Brit has since built on her Miami run with some encouraging results on clay, including a last 16 showing at the Italian Open, and she holds a 9-4 record since linking up with Petchey.

Raducanu is currently the world No 43, which is her highest ranking position since August 2022 — just before she dropped the points from her US Open title.

Ahead of the 2025 French Open, Tennis365 asked Wozniacki about Raducanu's prospects at Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year — and the ceiling she could reach.

“I mean, it's hard to say. Can she stay healthy – is I think the main thing,” the 2018 Australian Open winner said at a TNT Sports event.

“I think she's really going in the right direction, I think she's moving her way up, I think… it's not easy, who's she gonna play? What's the draw gonna be like?

“She's proven she can beat great players, but it's not easy if you get a really tough draw and have to beat seeded after seeded player to reach far. Obviously when you're a higher seed, usually you get somewhat softer draws to start with and it kind of gets easier.

Emma Raducanu told to hold ‘moderate' French Open expectations by former world No 2

Emma Raducanu makes worrying injury confession ahead of Roland Garros

“You know, you have to give her time. She's young, she doesn't have as much experience as many of the others do, but I think with [Mark] Petchey there in her corner… I think he's great, he knows the game so well, he has all the ins and outs of all the stats, et cetera, and I think that's gonna help her a lot.

“And you know, it's not easy being British and playing Wimbledon. I love Wimbledon, I'm sure she loves Wimbledon and can't wait to play, but at the same time, there's a lot of pressure and I hope that she's able to enjoy that and enjoy the crowd and having that be behind her.

“And what her ceiling is, I think time will tell, but she's proven that she can win the US Open, and if you can do it once, you can do it again. It's just a matter of putting it together for seven straight matches.

“I guess we'll just have to wait and see if that's gonna happen and when that's gonna happen. But either way, being as young as she is and already having a Grand Slam under her belt is a great feat.”

Raducanu will face world No 42 Wang Xinyu in her opening match at the French Open and could face reigning champion and five-time major winner Iga Swiatek in the second round.

Former British tennis player Andy Murray recently shared his thoughts on ending his short coaching partnership with 24-time Grand Slam winner
Novak Djokovic
. Murray coached Djokovic for a few months starting with the 2025 Australian Open but the duo parted ways in the lead up to the French Open.

Murray recently took the opportunity to joke about his split with Djokovic despite the decision causing shock among fans and experts alike. Speaking in an interview with UbiTennis, Murray said that even though their partnership didn't last long, he was thankful for the time they spent working together.

Andy Murray further revealed the thing he definitely won't miss about Novak Djokovic, saying something that would make fans laugh.

“It's been a great ride. We both decided it was time to part ways. One thing I won't miss is the food. He was always trying to get me to eat vegan. Man, I don't want air sandwiches and chickpeas for every meal,” Murray said.

Talking about his partnership with Murray, Djokovic said that they decided to call it quits after mutually agreeing that they couldn't get more out of it. Djokovic said that he has nothing but respect for Murray, adding that the British star has a brilliant knowledge of the game and has a mind of a champion.

“We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it. My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person. I think he has a brilliant tennis IQ, he has a very rare mind of a champion that obviously has achieved what he has achieved, and he sees the game incredibly well,” Djokovic told BBC.

Djokovic has had a dismal year as he is still searching for his 100th title win. He is just two matches away from the landmark after having reached the semifinal of the Geneva Open. Prior to this, Djokovic suffered consecutive early losses in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Geneva Open will be his final tournament before leaving for Roland Garros.

Australia's Alex de Minaur is yet again on a collision course with world No.1 Jannik Sinner at a grand slam, but he must first navigate a tricky path through the field at Roland Garros when the French Open starts on Sunday night Australian time.

De Minaur's draw lines up for a potential quarter-final rematch with Sinner after the Australian Open champion thrashed the local hope in straight sets at Melbourne Park.

The ninth seed de Minaur, who has made the final eight at the last four grand slams, will meet Serbian Laslo Djere, who has beaten in all three of their previous meetings, in the first round.

A possible second round date with fellow Australian James Duckworth, after they met in the first round at Wimbledon last year, awaits if Duckworth can get past the hot-and-cold Kazakh Alexander Bublik.

De Minaur's potential third round match with 19-year-old 19th seed Jakub Menšík of Czechia shapes as a difficult test before a likely Round of 16 meeting with fifth seed Jack Draper.

The Brit has been in excellent form, making the final in Madrid and the quarter-finals in Rome, while de Minaur made the Round of 16 in Rome and Madrid after losing to Carlos Alcaraz in a quarter-final in Barcelona, and making a semi-final in Monte Carlo.

Sinner is likely to await in the quarter-finals before potential meetings with Novak Djokovic or defending champion Alcaraz if de Minaur could prevail against the Italian for the first time.

The 26-year-old Sydneysider headlines the 15 Australians across the men's and women's fields.





Australia is guaranteed a female in the second round with 19-year-old Maya Joint to face Ajla Tomljanović in her main draw debut in Paris.

The pair will be familiar with one another as they first meet in the semi-final of the Morocco Open on Friday night Australian time.

Australia's other seeded male, world No. 25 Alexei Popyrin, faces a difficult clash with Japanese world no. 75 Yoshihito Nishioka, who made the fourth round at Roland Garros two years ago.

Meanwhile, Chris O'Connell and Aleksandar Vukic will take on underdog status in their respective clashes with 22nd seed Ugo Humbert and 24th seed Karen Khachanov.

But 23-year-old Olivia Gadecki has the hardest first round match up of all the Australians, a likely centre court clash with world No.2 Coco Gauff.

Daria Kasatkina, the 17th seed in her first grand slam with the Australian flag next to her name, will face Kateřina Siniaková, the Czech doubles world No.1.

- Alcaraz handed tough opener -

Carlos Alcaraz will begin his French Open title defence against Japan's Kei Nishikori as Iga Swiatek faces a difficult route to a fourth successive Roland Garros title after a year-long trophy drought.

Jannik Sinner takes on home hope Arthur Rinderknech in the world no.1's first Grand Slam match since serving a three-month doping ban.

Alcaraz and Sinner have combined to win each of the last five men's Grand Slam titles and are the two chief contenders again in Paris.

Novak Djokovic, who had not won a clay-court match this season before this week, starts his latest quest for a record-setting 25th major against American Mackenzie McDonald.

Seeded sixth, Djokovic could have been drawn to meet either Alcaraz or Sinner in the quarter-finals, but Thursday's draw spared him from that prospect.

Instead, he could run into 2024 runner-up Alexander Zverev in the last eight before a potential semi-final against Sinner. Alcaraz is in the other half of the draw.

Zverev opens against US teenager Learner Tien.

Alcaraz could play Fabian Marozsan or Luca Nardi in the second round, with towering Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard a possible third round-opponent.

The Spaniard is on course to meet 2021 runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas or Ben Shelton in the last 16. Two-time finalist Casper Ruud is seeded to face him in the quarter-finals.

In-form Lorenzo Musetti and fourth seed Taylor Fritz are also in that half of the field.





“The confidence is really high right now. I've been playing great matches, I've got great wins in this clay season. I'm excited,” Alcaraz said on Thursday.

The 22-year-old has won in Monte Carlo and Rome this season. He also reached the final in Barcelona.

Should Sinner get past the 72nd-ranked Rinderknech, he could go up against Richard Gasquet in what is the 38-year-old Frenchman's final tournament before retirement.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina potentially lurks in the third round with Andrey Rublev and Arthur Fils possible rivals in the last 16.

Sinner could meet fifth seed Jack Draper or Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals ahead of what would be a blockbuster clash with Djokovic.

Three-time French Open titlist Djokovic would likely have to get beyond the likes of Denis Shapovalov and Daniil Medvedev to make another deep run.

The 38-year-old Djokovic is appearing at Roland Garros for the 20th time. He has reached the quarter-finals or better at every edition of Roland Garros since 2010.





- Struggling Swiatek handed tricky draw -

Swiatek will need to rediscover her best form to retain the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen following a troubled past 12 months.

The Pole, who has dropped to fifth in the world, is in the same quarter as last year's finalist Jasmine Paolini, former champion Jelena Ostapenko and 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina.

Swiatek plays Slovakian Rebecca Sramkova in the first round before a possible meeting with Britain's Emma Raducanu, the 2021 US Open winner making just her second visit to Paris.

Elina Svitolina, Belinda Bencic, Donna Vekic and Marta Kostyuk also feature alongside Swiatek in a loaded section.

“Every year is different,” said Swiatek, who has not won a title since last year's French Open.

“This season has had more ups and downs than the years before but I know my game is there. I just need to figure out how to use it in the most important moments.”





 Four-time French Open champion Swiatek is in the same half of the draw as top seed Aryna Sabalenka, who gets under way against Kamilla Rakhimova from Russia.

Zheng Qinwen, the winner of Olympic gold on Court Philippe Chatrier last August, could await Sabalenka in the last eight.

Second-ranked Coco Gauff plays Australian Olivia Gadecki in round one and is one of four seeded Americans in the bottom quarter of the women's draw.

The 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, attempting to become the youngest Grand Slam singles champion since compatriot Maria Sharapova in 2004, starts against Cristina Bucsa of Spain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Back in Roland Garros qualifying, Andreescu wins 6-0, 6-0 for first time","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4268019/back-in-roland-garros-qualifying-andreescu-wins-6-0-6-0-for-first-time","Fri, 23 May 2025 08:58:22 GMT","

Playing her first Grand Slam qualifying event in six years, Bianca Andreescu was in no mood to hang around. The former US Open champion raced into the second round of Roland Garros qualifying, whitewashing China's Yao Xinxin 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes.

The result was the first 6-0, 6-0 win of Andreescu's professional career. The last time she won a match 6-0, 6-0 at any level was in Junior Billie Jean King Cup in 2016 over Watsachol Sawatdee. Previously, she had notched two 6-0, 6-1 wins in professional events: over Ari Matsumoto in the first round of the 2018 Gifu ITF W25, and over Garbiñe Muguruza in the 2019 Indian Wells quarterfinals.

Andreescu last contested the preliminary rounds of a major at the 2019 Australian Open, where she qualified and reached the second round. She would end that season in the Top 5 as the reigning champion of Indian Wells, Toronto and the US Open, but has struggled with injury and illness since. This is just the fifth tournament of Andreescu's season following an appendectomy in February, and she is currently ranked No. 102. Last week, she reached the fourth round of Rome, notching two Top 20 wins over Donna Vekic and Elena Rybakina en route.

Andreescu has contested Roland Garros qualifying twice previously, falling to Tereza Smitkova in the 2017 first round and Richel Hogenkamp in the 2018 third round. Her best main-draw performances at the tournament to date are third-round finishes in 2023 and 2024.

There was a gulf in experience between Andreescu and Yao, the 21-year-old who notched her first tour-level win in Jiujiang last October and who was playing the first Grand Slam qualifying event of her career. The Canadian did not face game point in the first set, repeatedly exposing Yao's movement on clay with a series of drop shots. No. 261-ranked Yao improved in the second set, but could not take advantage of three points to hold serve.

""I felt really good coming here,"" said Andreescu afterwards. ""It's the French open -- no matter what match you play in whatever draw, it's a very important match. I was very pleased with my attitude today.""

Andreescu, the No. 17 seed in the qualifying draw, will next face former No. 56 Nao Hibino, who defeated Andrea Lazaro Garcia 7-6(4), 6-4. Elsewhere, Andreescu's Canadian compatriot and the partner with whom she won the 2017 Australian Open and Roland Garros girls' doubles titles, Carson Branstine, notched her first career major qualifying win 6-4, 6-2 over Whitney Osuigwe.

Two of Day 1's longest matches were won by local wild cards who thrilled the Parisian crowd in a pair of rollercoaster epics. Margaux Rouvroy -- who previously upset Sofia Kenin in the 2023 qualifying first round -- needed 3 hours and 40 minutes to defeat Japan's Haruka Kaji 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-6[3], sinking to her knees after triumphing in a gruelling clay-court battle.

The No. 248-ranked Frenchwoman lost the first set after holding one set point in the tiebreak, was two points from defeat trailing 5-4 in the second set and held her first two match points at 5-4 in the decider before outlasting Kaji in the super-tiebreak.

Earlier, Carole Monnet had pulled off an unlikely comeback against Croatia's No. 11 seed Petra Martic. The 23-year-old trailed Martic by a set and 3-1, but reeled in the former quarterfinalist 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 in 2 hours and 35 minutes.

There was better fortune for Croatia in the second-longest match of Day 1, Jana Fett's 6-2, 4-6, 7-6[10] defeat of Priscilla Hon in 2 hours and 45 minutes. Fett came back from 3-0 down in the third set, and saved one match point in the super-tiebreak.

A former WTA Finals champion and Top 5 player, Caroline Garcia leaves behind a legacy of power, perseverance and a plan for what comes next.

Caroline Garcia, one of the most athletic and aggressive players ever produced by France, announced her imminent retirement Friday.

She'll play Bernarda Pera in a first-round match that could be her last at Roland Garros, though she will also compete in ""a few"" more tournaments this year.

""It's time to say goodbye,"" the 31-year-old wrote. ""After 15 years competing at the highest level, and more than 25 years putting pretty much every second of my life into it, I feel ready to start a new chapter.

""My tennis journey hasn't always been easy. Since my early days, tennis has been much more than just winning or losing. It's been love or hate. Happiness or anger.

A post shared by Caroline Garcia (@carogarcia)

Garcia took home 11 titles across every surface, along with 471 match-wins and more than $18 million in prize money. In 2023, she led all players with 462 aces.

She captured her first Hologic WTA Tour title in Bogotá in 2014 and quickly found her footing on home soil. In 2016, she added a second singles trophy in Strasbourg, then teamed up with Kristina Mladenovic to win the Roland Garros doubles crown just two weeks later -- a moment she still counts among her most cherished. Six years on, the pair reunited to capture the title again. The following year, Garcia broke new ground in singles as well, reaching her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at her home major.

In 2017, Garcia won titles in Wuhan and Beijing and vaulted into the Top 10 at year's end. 

Five years later, at the age of 29, Garcia staged a startling career renaissance.

The 2022 season began with a title on the grass in Bad Homburg, followed by a victory on clay in Warsaw and a hard-court win in Cincinnati. She advanced to the semifinals at the US Open and qualified for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth. In a statistic that underlined her versatility, Garcia was the only woman that year to win titles on three different surfaces.

Garcia defeated Daria Kasatkina and Coco Gauff in the group stage, then Maria Sakkari in the semifinals. In a rousing final that captured her power and style, Garcia bested Aryna Sabalenka 7-6(4), 6-4 for the most important title of her career.

Playing an abbreviated schedule, Garcia comes into Roland Garros with a 3-6 record and sits at No. 145 in the PIF WTA Rankings. Her most recent match came in March, a 7-5, 6-2 loss to Iga Swiatek in the second round at the Miami Open.

Professional athletes can sometimes find themselves adrift on retiring, but Garcia has built herself a solid foundation for life after tennis.

She was one of five WTA Tour players enrolled in the Harvard Business School's 2024-25 Crossover Intro Business program. In a very real sense, professional tennis players are independent contractors. They are essentially the CEOs of their personal brand, employing a support team, navigating a global schedule. The Harvard program is a finishing school of sorts for young future entrepreneurs.

Garcia and fiancée Borja Durán launched a podcast last year, “Tennis Insider Club,” which features their exclusive interviews with people involved in the sport. As a result, Garcia became more involved and interested in the business side.

“I always believed I was too busy with tennis to go to university,” Garcia said. “I'm discovering a new environment, seeing different perspectives. Obviously, when you arrive at the end of your career, you want to start building your future.”

“Investing prize money, how to spend reasonably -- because it's a career that ends quite early,” Garcia said. “There are some things I wished I learned earlier, like finance and how to manage money for the future.

“But I think it's also important to go outside of your bubble, because tennis is a very small bubble.”

Post tennis, Garcia's bubble is about to get much larger.

Bearman handed 10-place Monaco GP grid penalty after red flag violation in practice

Verstappen impressed by ‘very, very fast' Ferrari as he admits Red Bull ‘overdid' set-up changes in Monaco practice

FIA Team Principals press conference – Monaco

F2: Dunne takes maiden pole in Monte Carlo by 0.003s

FP2: Leclerc fastest again during second practice in Monaco as Hadjar and Piastri each cause red flags

Home favourite Charles Leclerc set the pace during Friday's opening practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix, bouncing back from an early clash with Lance Stroll to lead the way over Red Bull rival Max Verstappen and McLaren racer Lando Norris.

With the sun shining down and yachts filling the harbour, the Principality looked resplendent as Formula 1's 10 teams and 20 drivers gathered for an initial hour-long hit of running around some of the most famous streets in motorsport.

AS IT HAPPENED: All the action from first practice for the Monaco Grand Prix

Unsurprisingly, plenty of cars were quick to head out at 1330 local time to get a feel for the track conditions – a combination of Pirelli's soft C6, medium C5 and hard C4 tyres being used across the early installation laps and short runs.

There was some drama only a couple of minutes in when Leclerc locked up and went deep at Mirabeau Haute, but he managed to avoid any damage, reverse his Ferrari out of the run-off area and continue on his way.

Leclerc would not be so fortunate a few moments later, though, when he ran into the back of Lance Stroll's Aston Martin – which had moved aside for another car before coming back onto the racing line – under braking for the hairpin.

Practice 1 results

“Come on… I don't think he was aware about the blue flags,” Leclerc sighed over the radio. Stroll confirmed that when he told his engineer “I didn't hear you” ahead of the impact. Given Leclerc's front wing damage, the red flag was thrown to clear the debris.

When the session resumed, with Stroll sidelined due to his broken rear suspension and a gearbox change, drivers picked up where they left off and began to push a little harder – Norris holding the P1 time of 1m 12.290s (on softs) at the halfway mark over Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton and Oscar Piastri.

EXPLAINED: What is the new two-stop rule for the Monaco Grand Prix – and how will it work?

There was also a sign of things to come in Qualifying – particularly Q1 – as drivers squabbled for track position, leaving Pierre Gasly frustrated by some slow-moving cars at the Nouvelle Chicane and Verstappen fuming after he was forced to bail out of a lap.

While Leclerc improved again to eclipse Norris' benchmark and move into the 1m11s bracket, an exasperated radio message – claiming “we are nowhere” in terms of car balance – implied that there is still plenty of work to do at Ferrari.

Several lock-ups, barrier scrapes and close calls followed over the final third of the session, with Hamilton narrowly avoiding traffic at Massenet and then flying over the kerbs at Turn 15/16, and Piastri returning to the pits for inspections after an apparent brush of the wall.

Leclerc remained quickest with his 1m 11.964s effort when the chequered flag dropped, a tenth clear of nearest rival Verstappen, as Norris, the high-flying Williams of Alex Albon, championship leader Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell completed the top six.

Carlos Sainz backed up team mate Albon in seventh position, followed by the lead Alpine of Gasly, Hamilton and Fernando Alonso, who was Aston Martin's sole driver for the majority of the session following Stroll's early clash with Leclerc.

Kimi Antonelli was the fastest rookie of FP1 in 11th, putting his Mercedes just ahead of Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, Racing Bull's Isack Hadjar and the other Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda, who lamented traffic during his final runs.

Haas duo Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon were next up in P15 and P16 respectively, as Liam Lawson (Racing Bulls), Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber), F1 returnee Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and the aforementioned Stroll rounded out the order.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the Monte Carlo paddock, dig through the data and ponder set-up changes before returning to action in Free Practice 2, which is scheduled to begin at 1700 local time and again run for an hour.

Charles Leclerc finished fastest in the opening practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix, despite having brought out an early red flag for a collision with Lance Stroll.

The Ferrari driver, who won his home race 12 months ago, collided with the back of the Aston Martin driver into the Loewes Hairpin after the Canadian moved back onto the racing line, with red flags deployed for several minutes to remove debris.

With a new nosecone fitted, Leclerc posted a 1m 11.964s around the midway point of the one-hour session, and despite complaining of issues with his car, it left him 0.163s clear of reigning World Champion Max Verstappen.

McLaren's Lando Norris finished third having run deep at both Sainte Devote and the Nouvelle Chicane, with team mate and Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri in fifth having believed he clipped the wall at one stage.

Nikola Tsolov took his first-ever FIA Formula 3 pole position around the streets of Monte Carlo, coming out on top in Friday's dramatic split Qualifying.

The Red Bull Junior posted a 1m 24.882s with his final lap of the session to go to the top of the timesheets in Group A, leading his Campos Racing team mate Mari Boya by 0.127s.

F3: Tramnitz leads MP Motorsport 1-2 in Imola Sprint Race

Rodin Motorsport then locked out the top two spots in Group B, with Roman Bilinski leading the way in the red flag-affected running thanks to a 1m 25.332s, while his team mate Callum Voisin wound up 0.027s off in P2.

This meant Tsolov – who had been watching from the pit wall with his Campos team – had done enough to seal the Aramco Pole Position Award, with Bilinski set to join him on the front row for Sunday, ahead of Boya and Voisin.

PREMA Racing's Brando Badoer brought out the lone red flag in the session after crashing into the barrier at Turn 1 late in Group B's running.

Once the action resumed with three minutes and 21 seconds left, only Tim Tramnitz could complete two flying laps. The MP Motorsport driver's lap was good enough for P3, putting him in sixth for the Feature Race behind PREMA Racing's Noel León – who was third-fastest in Group A.

F3: Ramos outduels Camara to claim victory in Imola Feature Race

TRIDENT's Charlie Wurz and ART Grand Prix driver Tuukka Taponen were fourth and fifth in Group A, while Rafael Câmara and Laurens van Hoepen sealed the same positions in Group B.

Next up is a Sprint Race around the Principality, where the grid will be reversed, with this taking place at 1045 local time on Saturday. Alessandro Giusti and Martinius Stenshorne are set to line up on the front row after finishing sixth-fastest in their groups, with the former on pole.

Charles Leclerc completed a perfect Friday for Ferrari after topping the second practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix, which was disrupted by two red flags including one caused by Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri.

The home hero followed up on his P1 in the opening session with the fastest time on Friday afternoon, while team mate Lewis Hamilton in third signified a remarkable turnaround for the Scuderia from a week ago at Imola.

HIGHLIGHTS: Relive FP1 in Monaco as Leclerc finishes fastest despite Stroll collision

Drivers and teams continued to push the limits on the streets of the Principality, with Isack Hadjar and Piastri going beyond it during the one-hour session.

After the first set of runs, reigning World Champion Max Verstappen sat top of the order on a 1m 12.922s despite complaining over the radio for his team to ""please fix the upshifts"" and about the poor quality of his tear-off visors.

Practice 2 results

It took less than eight minutes for the first red flag of the session to be deployed, Hadjar having clipped the inside barrier on the entry to the Nouvelle Chicane which ripped the left-rear tyre off its rim.

Having initially come to a stop on the far side of the chicane as the red flags flew, the Frenchman slowly made his way back to the pits having asked his Racing Bulls team on the best course of action.

Once running resumed, Piastri lowered the benchmark to a 1m 12.548s on a set of medium tyres, but the McLaren driver brought out the red flags again shortly after having hit the barrier head-on at Sainte Devote.

After reversing, the Australian was able to recover back to the pits for a new front wing as the session resumed with 35 minutes remaining.

Prior to the second stoppage, Leclerc had moved to the top of the times with a 1m 12.103s, but multiple Monaco Grand Prix winners Fernando Alonso, on the softs, and Hamilton on the hard rubber both jumped him.

Alonso then became the first driver to dip below the 1m 12s mark with a 1m 11.890s, faster than Leclerc's best from FP1, as the session entered its second half.

Leclerc's first effort on a soft moved the benchmark down to a 1m 11.414s, while his second attempt with 20 minutes remaining improved that to a 1m 11.355s, which would finish as the fastest time on Friday.

Piastri recovered from his incident to finish second, just 0.038s behind Leclerc, with Hamilton one-tenth behind Leclerc as Lando Norris completed the top four.

Liam Lawson finished an impressive fifth just ahead of team mate Hadjar, who found the barriers again, this time at Sainte Devote on a cooldown lap inside the final 10 minutes, which left the Racing Bulls machine with damage as he crabbed back to the pits.

Alonso, Alex Albon's Williams and Kimi Antonelli for Mercedes finished ahead of Verstappen in P10, who remained unhappy with his Red Bull having gone into the run-off area at one point.
The Dutchman was only 0.004s ahead of team mate Yuki Tsunoda, who in turn headed the second Mercedes and Williams of George Russell and Carlos Sainz respectively.

Gabriel Bortoleto, who Verstappen had complained about for blocking through the Swimming Pool section, put his Kick Sauber in 14th with team mate Nico Hulkenberg 16th, as Ollie Bearman's Haas sat between them – though the Briton was later hit with a 10-place grid penalty for the race for overtaking under the red flag.

Pierre Gasly was the top Alpine in P17 as team mate Franco Colapinto ended last of the 20 runners. Lance Stroll, who was handed a one-place penalty for his collision with Leclerc in FP1, was 18th ahead of Esteban Ocon for Haas.

Drivers and teams will debrief overnight ahead of Saturday's crucial Qualifying session.

Lance Stroll has been given a one-place grid penalty following his collision with Charles Leclerc during Friday's first practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix.

Stroll and Leclerc clashed in unusual fashion in the early stages of FP1 when the Aston Martin driver came back onto the racing line under braking for the hairpin after moving over for another car.

FP1: Leclerc leads Verstappen and Norris in first Monaco GP practice after early collision with Stroll

Leclerc ran into the back of Stroll's car and damaged his front wing, triggering a red flag, while the Canadian missed the rest of the session due to broken rear suspension and a gearbox change.

Following a review of the incident, the stewards determined that Stroll was “wholly to blame” and thus handed out a one-place grid drop, which will apply for Sunday's race in the Principality.

“The stewards determined that Car 18 (Stroll) cut across the path of Car 16 (Leclerc) at Turn 6, causing Car 16 to collide into Car 18,” read the decision document. “Car 16 suffered damage as a result.

“The driver of Car 18 stated that although the team warned him of the arrival of Car 16, he did not hear the radio message and that led to the incident.

EXPLAINED: What is the new two-stop rule for the Monaco Grand Prix – and how will it work?

“We considered that Car 18 was wholly to blame for the collision. Car 16 was not in a position to avoid the collision that took place.

“In the circumstances, we imposed a one grid position penalty for the race and one penalty point (on Stroll's licence).”

Lance Stroll has been hit with a one-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix

Asked about the incident in the Team Principal's Press Conference, Aston Martin boss Andy Cowell conceded the team's communication to Stroll needed to be clearer as he explained the damage that was done by the collision.

""Our radio call wasn't clear enough, is the bottom line so we need to learn from that,"" said Cowell. ""Rear wishbone broken, damage to the floor, [the] best option was to change the gearbox because we set up two gearboxes yesterday ready for that sort of scenario.

""The downside is that Lance doesn't get FP1 back. So it's those laps that he's missed. In terms of set-up and learning, then it's learning from Fernando's running that feeds across to both cars going forwards.""

The red flags were displayed less than 10 minutes into the opening practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix following a bizarre collision between Charles Leclerc and Lance Stroll.

Leclerc, who won on the streets of the Principality 12 months ago, had run deep at Mirabeau on his out-lap before reversing and rejoining without incident.

But just minutes later while on a flying lap, the Ferrari driver ran into the back of Stroll's Aston Martin under braking for the Loewes Hairpin after the Canadian driver moved back onto the racing line.

Leclerc's car suffered a broken front wing and pitted, while Stroll's car needed repairs on the rear as the session was red-flagged for several minutes to retrieve debris that had been scattered around the track. Ultimately the Aston Martin was unable to resume in the session with the team confirming the car had suffered rear suspension damage and needed a gearbox change.

Disney's live-action redo 'Lilo & Stitch' boasts the biggest preview of the year so far and seventh-biggest ever for a PG title, while Tom Cruise's final 'M:I' movie hit a franchise high.

	The Memorial Day box office is already delivering in a major way and the long holiday weekend hasn't even begun.


	Disney's live-action redo Lilo & Stitch and Tom Cruise‘s final Mission: Impossible movie, from Paramount and Skydance, both did sizeable business in Thursday previews.




Lilo & Stitch grossed a huge $14.5 million in previews, the largest preview gross of the year to date and a Memorial Day record for Disney's live-action studio after besting The Little Mermaid ($10.3 million) and Aladdin ($7 million), not adjusted for inflation. In terms of Disney's larger film empire, it also beat Memorial Day entry Solo: A Star Wars Story ($14.1 million). And overall, it is the seventh-biggest preview gross of any PG title, including Disney's recent animated  blockbuster Moana 2 ($13.8 million).

	Three weeks ago, Lilo & Stitch was tracking to open to $120 million. Now, it's $165 million, a jaw-dropping gross that would, in an ironic twist, see Lilo & Stitch supplant Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick ($160 million) as the biggest Memorial Day opener of all time, not adjusted for inflation. That's not the only irony: Cruise-starrer Minority Report barely beat the original animated Lilo & Stitch when they opened opposite each other in June 2022.


Stitch isn't just drawing interest from families; it's popping big time among teenage girls and younger women — i.e., Gen Z and younger Millennials — who grew up on the first movie and resulting TV show about a Hawaiian girl with a fraught family life who adopts an adorable, albeit trouble-making, dog-like alien. Box office pundits say the nostalgic factor is running high, just as it did among Millennials and Gen Z'ers for Disney's live-action Aladdin, which made $1.1 billion in global ticket sales after getting families, teens and younger adults. Rideback produced both Lilo and 2019's Aladdin.


	The live-action Lilo & Stitch was originally intended to to go straight to Disney+, helping to explain its modest $100 million production budget. It has a current Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 72 percent. (Both Lilo and M:I presently have a RT audience score of 93 percent.)


Final Reckoning set its own preview record in earning a franchise-best $8.3 million, ahead of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One ($7 million) and Mission: Impossible — Fallout ($6 million.)

	











	The film, with a current RT critics score of 80 percent, is expected to more than make up for the lackluster $54.7 million bow of Dead Reckoning, as well as supplant the $61.2 million three-day launch of Fallout to set a new franchise opening record by a mile.


	A major challenge in terms of Final Reckoning‘s financial success is its $400 million net budget before marketing — making it one of the most expensive films ever made — although Paramount insiders note that each new installment increases the value of the entire library, including a spike in home entertainment sales and rentals of previous titles.


	The two movies are expected to fuel the biggest Memorial Day of all time in terms of ticket sales. While the mash-up isn't expected to be quite the same cultural phenomenon that Barbenheimer was in July 2023, the potent combo of the two movies can't be ignored (as for a moniker, how about “Stitchin: Impossible”?)


	Overseas, Lilo & Stitch is likewise going up against Final Reckoning. 


Lilo has earned $26.7 million in its initial two days from its first 41 markets. In a number of territories, it has scored the highest opening day of the year so far, including in China, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France and Italy. Paramount hasn't yet reported international numbers for Final Reckoning.

Unveiling a deal with an enterprise valuation of $673 million, it outlines a strategy including ""investment in the group's digital operations to continue driving subscriptions"" and ""top journalistic talent.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	U.S. private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners said Friday that it has reached an in-principle agreement to acquire The Telegraph Media Group at a total enterprise valuation of £500 million ($673 million) to become the U.K. media company's sole controlling owner. “It is the largest investment in U.K. print media in a decade and unlocks a new era of growth for the 170-year-old title,” the companies said.


	The ownership of the conservative newspaper and its related offerings has been in question after the Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI agreed to buy The Telegraph and the Spectator magazine in 2023, with the U.K. government then cracking down on foreign state investment in British newspapers, forcing a sale.

The Telegraph wrote that RedBird Capital, which provided part of RedBird IMI's funding for the original deal, was expected to be joined in the new ownership consortium by British media investors.

	“RedBird is in discussions with select U.K.-based minority investors with print media expertise and strong commitment to upholding the editorial values of The Telegraph,” the deal announcement noted. Abu Dhabi's International Media Investments (IMI) “will also participate in the acquisition as a minority investor, subject to the passage of secondary legislation regarding foreign ownership thresholds,” it highlighted. RedBird said its growth strategy includes “capital investment in the group's digital operations to continue driving subscriptions, using best-in-class data analytics and artificial intelligence tools to expand the value proposition to its core subscriber base and potential new subscribers.” 


	RedBird also said it has “ambitious growth plans that focus on investing in top journalistic talent, from award-winning reporters to opinion-leading commentators.” A key part of RedBird's strategy is expanding The Telegraph's global reach, particularly in the United States, “leveraging the title's iconic brand and authoritative reporting to drive new audiences seeking world-class independent journalism. Collaboration across RedBird's portfolio will create unique partnership opportunities, blending tradition with innovation to expand The Telegraph's position as a global leader in quality journalism.”

	











	RedBird also said it would “build on the strong financial foundations established by the current management team” and work with it to grow the brand internationally, with a focus on the U.S. where RedBird has a strong strategic presence across news, media and sports. 


	“Together, RedBird and TMG senior leadership will work to develop new content verticals in areas such as travel and events to maximize the commercial opportunities from a growing international and mass affluent subscriber base,” the companies said. With this latest transaction, RedBird said it “has emerged as one of the largest investors in U.K. media, sports and entertainment, with a portfolio including Premier League Champion Liverpool FC; All3Media, the U.K.'s largest independent television, film and digital production and distribution company; Fulwell Entertainment, one of the U.K.'s leading television, film and music production companies; Build a Rocket Boy, one of the U.K.'s largest independent video gaming and entertainment studios; and the pending acquisition of the U.K.'s Channel 5 as a result of Skydance Entertainment's merger with Paramount Global.”Said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird: “This transaction marks the start of a new era for The Telegraph as we look to grow the brand in the U.K. and internationally, invest in its technology, and expand its subscriber base. We believe that the U.K. is a great place to invest, and this acquisition is an important part of RedBird's growing portfolio of media and entertainment companies in the U.K.” Added Anna Jones, CEO of Telegraph Media Group: “Telegraph Media Group is an award-winning news media organization, with exceptional journalism at its heart, supported by leading commercial expertise, a commitment to innovation and a laser focus on data to drive strategy.” She added that RedBird Capital Partners has “exciting growth plans that build on our success – and will unlock our full potential across the breadth of our business.”

Paramount is partnering with Advent Allen Entertainment to turn an undeveloped site at The Strat into a live experience based on the Tom Cruise franchise, promising jet simulators and piano singalongs.

Paramount Global wants to take Las Vegas visitors to the Danger Zone.


	The media company is partnering with Advent Allen Entertainment to create and launch a fully immersive experience based on its Top Gun franchise, which stars Tom Cruise.




	The experience will be built on an undeveloped site at The Strat Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, and while details remain, uh, classified for now, the companies promise a combination of rides and storytelling, utilizing advanced technology and, of course, jet simulators.

	The companies are also planning to recreate the Hard Deck bar from Top Gun: Maverick, promising live piano singalongs so visitors can channel their inner Miles Teller and sing “Great Balls of Fire.”

	











Top Gun has had a resurgence since the success of Top Gun: Maverick in 2022, and Paramount is betting that its adrenaline-soaked nature will translate to an exciting experiential business. While the initial Top Gun Las Vegas (working title) is set to open in 2028, the companies say that they are actively exploring potential expansion locations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.


	Immersive experiences have become something of a growth business for the entertainment industry. While Disney and Universal continue to pour billions into their global theme parks (Universal just opened its latest park, Epic Universe, this week), many companies are also exploring smaller, more focused efforts. Netflix, for example, is set to open its first two Netflix Houses later this year in Pennsylvania and Texas, and Universal is also experimenting, planning a horror-themed Las Vegas attraction for later this year, and a smaller kids theme park in Texas next year.


	Paramount, for its part, seems content with strategically licensing its IP for immersive experiences, including an indoor theme park in New Jersey based on Nickelodeon, a deal to bring Spongebob to Universal's Texas park, and now Top Gun.


	“This innovative venture marks a new milestone for Top Gun and expands Paramount's portfolio of immersive entertainment,” said Pam Kaufman, president and CEO of international markets, global consumer products and experiences at Paramount. “Paramount is committed to delivering authentic, mind-blowing experiences for fans, and Mark Advent and Bill Allen are the perfect team to make this destination soar.”

	











	“The Top Gun films are one of the most emotionally charged stories of our time,” added Mark Advent, co-founder of Advent Allen Entertainment and creator of Las Vegas' New York New York Hotel & Casino. “We're proud to unite with Paramount to bring this timeless, action-packed epic to life — delivering experiences that embody teamwork, excellence, the exhilaration of speed and the thrill of flying. We are pulling out all the stops and looking forward to bringing Top Gun to even higher heights on the Strip and beyond!”

""I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience,"" the rock star wrote in a statement.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Billy Joel is canceling all of his upcoming shows due to a health issue affecting his ability to perform, the musician announced Friday (May 23).


	In a statement shared to his social media accounts, he shared that the decision comes following a “recent diagnosis” of normal pressure hydrocephalus. “This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,” his statement reads. “Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.”


	“He is grateful for the support from fans during this time and looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage,” the announcement continues, concluding with a message directly from Joel: “I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding.”

	











	Fans with tickets to any of the “Piano Man” singer's scheduled shows will receive automatic refunds to their original payment method.

	According to Cleveland Clinic, normal pressure hydrocephalus is a condition that occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull, pressing on the brain. It can affect “several brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more,” with treatment involving implanting a shunt to drain the excess fluid.


	Joel had several shows planned throughout the summer and fall of this year, as well as a few performances scheduled for the first half of 2026. His canceled appearances include his joint dates with Sting, Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks, as well as his solo gigs.


	The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer previously delayed several of those tour dates by four months after revealing that he had recently undergone surgery. Joel did not disclose his medical condition at that time.


	“While I regret postponing any shows, my health must come first,” he said in a statement in March. “I look forward to getting back on stage and sharing the joy of live music with our amazing fans. Thank you for your understanding.”


	The five-time Grammy winner had been poised to make history on his trek, as his now-canceled shows at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, N.Y.; Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.; and Citi Field in Queens, N.Y., would have made him the first artist to play all three NYC-area stadiums in one summer. “Each [venue] holds personal significance to me,” Joel had told Billboard of the feat in early February. “There's nothing like the energy of the crowds in New York.”


	Joel's health update comes shortly after it was announced that his upcoming two-part documentary, Billy Joel: And So It Goes, will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in June. Later in the summer, the project will air on HBO.

The country superstar performed 27 tunes on opening night in Las Vegas.

	With 33 Country Airplay No. 1s to his name, Kenny Chesney could fill an entire concert—and then some—with only chart toppers. But Thursday night (May 22) at the opening night of his Sphere residency in Las Vegas, he dug deep into his nearly 30 year-catalog.


	Chesney's reputation as a stellar live performer is well established: The four-time Country Music Association Awards entertainer of the year is the only country artist to hit $1 billion in concert grosses reported to Billboard Boxscore. He is well known for his lively, energetic shows and Thursday night was no exception.


	Chesney began prepping for the show last summer, which required all new visuals, before moving into Sphere on Monday (May 19).  “Even with all the simulators, the special editing facilities, the way we have approached rehearsals, it wasn't until we got inside Sphere that me, the band, the crew and all our road family truly got it. It is a whole other world – and I can't wait for the people who've loved this music so intensely to experience this,” he said in a statement.


	Like the Eagles, who return to Sphere in October and November, Chesney enhanced the experience for fans with Spread the Love Bar, a bar inspired by Chesney favorite bars, and Hit Guitars, Tiki Bars and a Whole Lotta Love, a free exhibit.


	Below are all the songs that Chesney performed on the first night of his 15-night Sphere residency that runs through June 21.

Chesney brought No Shoes Nation to the Las Vegas Strip in an immensely enjoyable show.


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



	Las Vegas may be landlocked, but Kenny Chesney took fans to the beach Thursday night (May 22) in the opening night of his 15-date Sphere run.


	The four-time Country Music Association Awards entertainer of the year, the first country artist to play the immersive venue, is one of the most celebrated live performers in any genre and he showed once again why during the two-hour and 15-minute concert. During the fun and breezy 27-song set, many songs celebrated the island lifestyle that embodies the spirit of Chesney's No Shoes Nation. 


	According to Billboard Boxscore, Chesney is the only country artist to reach $1 billion in concert grosses reported to Billboard.  His passionate No Shoes Nation fanbase has followed him into stadiums, which he has filled for 20 years, so to see him in the 18,000-seat Sphere is a chance to view him relatively close up (despite the crazy steep pitch of the four levels).


	Throughout the show, Chesney exhibited a welcome spirit of gratitude for his fans, excitement over his first Las Vegas residency (no starting small for him), and elation at being back on stage, noting this was his first show of 2025. As anyone who's seen one of his stadium shows knows, Chesney thrives on contact with prosceniums that extend far out into audience. The Sphere doesn't allow that, so he had to make do with occasionally palm slapping with fans standing in the front section, dubbed The Sandbar, but he still managed to fully connect with the crowd.


	Chesney, a 2025 Country Music Hall of Fame inductee, has logged 33 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, which is more than any other artist since the chart launched in 1990. He landed his first No. 1 in 1997 with “She's Got It All,” and most recently topped the chart last year with “Take Her Home.” In between have been such hits as “The Good Stuff,” “Living in Fast Forward,” “Don't Blink,” “American Kids,” “Better as a Memory” and “No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem.”


	So, it's no surprise that the show relied heavily on hits (heck, he could have played nothing but his No. 1s and still had the show go longer than two hours), but he also trotted out deeper cuts and lesser performed tunes to create a one-of-a-kind show.


	Chesney's residency lasts through June 21 and tallies 15 dates.


Billboard was at Sphere for opening night, and we've rounded up the best moments of the evening.


	It feels like each act who plays Sphere builds on the amazing special effects and visuals from the acts who came before them and betters them, but Chesney's opening sequence was truly spectacular and honestly felt like a theme-park dark ride attraction.  Sphere's 270-degree wraparound screen (which covers 160,000 square feet) took us deep-sea diving through a shipwreck and further into the abyss, surrounded by sharks and schools of fish before coming to the surface where multi-masted pirate ships sailed with No Shoes Nation flags flying. At the same time the haptic seats are vibrating and moving as the sea turns into a see-through Sphere, filled to the brim,  and it literally feels like the venue does a 360-degree turn in a move that's breathtaking (and a little nauseating if you're prone to motion sickness) and utterly astounding. So, in other words, make sure you're in your seat when the show starts because you really don't want to miss this thrill ride.


	Without pandering, Chesney played tribute to Las Vegas in ways both big and small. During “Living in Fast Forward,” one of Chesney's most enjoyable, upbeat songs 20 years after its release, he incorporated footage of a NASCAR race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Then in a much more obvious way, for his last number before the encore, “Out Last Night,” the scenery switched to the Las Vegas Strip with Sphere with his No Shoes Nation logo and the surrounding hotels including the Venetian and a neon Las Vegas sign (Chesney, embracing the “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas” motto, figured the audience would continue the party after they left the venue,  noting, “It's really possible you're going to wake up tomorrow next to someone you know or someone you don't know.” Not to be outdone, Chesney's bass player, Harmoni Kelley rocked a white, sequined jumpsuit in an homage to Elvis's Vegas era.


	In a show full of dazzling visuals, “Big Star,” his 2002 song about a woman who ends up a superstar despite all those who doubted her, was a standout. “Big Star” became a pinball machine drawing the audience in as if part of the game as balls careened around the Sphere and lights flashed. Other than the opening sequence, it was the most immersive, impressive spectacle of the night. But the nicest part was he used the song to pay tribute to some of the women who came before and after him, showing photos of him with Loretta Lynn and Reba McEntire and then Kelsea Ballerini and Megan Moroney, both of whom he has mentored and taken on tour.


	A little more than half-way through, Chesney huddled with band and crew. They poured a few drinks (made with Blue Chair Rum, no doubt), some of which Chesney and band handed out to audience members. Chesney then said they were deciding what to do next (that's a nice twist to do every show and add in songs not on the setlist) before launching into 1999's “She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy.”  Shortly into the song, Kelsea Ballerini, in a sparkly silver dress, appeared on stage. Chesney seemed genuinely surprised and mightily delighted to be reunited with his fellow Knoxville native and former touring partner, grabbing her in a sweet bear hug, and expressed his surprise again after they finished the song. They then launched into “Half of My Hometown,” their 2021 duet that went straight to No. 1, with Ballerini telling him, “I love you,” at the end, and his answering, “I love you, too.” They then finished with “You & Tequila,” his bittersweet 2011 duet with Grace Potter (as the song's video played in the background).  Their friendship and affection for each other was sweetly palpable. He noted that she wasn't the only friend in attendance, namechecking Van Halen's Michael Anthony and football great Peyton Manning.


	If there's one song that sums up Chesney's ethos, it's 2018's “Get Along,” which Chesney introduced by adding, “It's what we're about.” It's the only song of the night where the lyrics appeared on the screen, leading to a singalong. And in a world divided, words like “Always give love the upper hand” and “Make a friend, can't we all get along?” feel like so much more than just platitudes; they feel like Chesney's Commandments and necessary. Throughout the evening, Chesney's good vibes prevailed, turning Sphere into a big love-in.


	Fans don't usually look to Chesney for statement songs or tunes that address social issues, but “Welcome to the Fishbowl,” the title track to his 2012 album, was downright prophetic, looking at the way social media and technology were going to change our world—in many ways for the worse. “I wrote this song 15 years ago. Little did I know it was a glimpse into the future,” Chesney said. The visuals were especially strong, with Chesney appearing from inside a mobile phone. Coincidentally, sitting inside Sphere definitely feels like sitting inside a fishbowl.


	Prior to starting his residency, Chesney said he would be digging deep into the catalog, as well as bringing the hits, and did he ever. Right after “Fishbowl,” he launched into “One Lonely Island,” from his most recent album, Born. It was the first time he'd done the ballad about two lost souls drifting toward each other for a little comfort or “a night of healin',” as Chesney sings.  He followed that a few songs later with “Seven Days,” from 2010's Hemingway's Whiskey, another tune that he said he had never performed live before. “Thanks for letting us do that,” Chesney said afterwards, but the pleasure was all ours.

	Sydney pop-punk trio Stand Atlantic also make a splash this week, with their 2024 album Was Here roaring back to No. 3 on the Albums Chart following the release of its deluxe edition. It's the highest-charting Australian artist release this week, leading the Top 5 Australian Artist Albums chart ahead of Spacey Jane's If That Makes Sense and Cold Chisel's 50 Years – The Best Of.

	Wearing a dark hooded coat and surrounded by a live band and string ensemble, the Grammy winner delivered a stirring rendition of the song beneath dramatic spotlights, echoing the somber, cinematic visuals from the track's music video released earlier this month.

	“On a song like ‘More to Lose,' I try to keep it a singular take,” Cyrus previously explained in a video shared to Instagram. “I add my harmonies, ad-libs at the end, but it's really a song that's more of a story and I never want that to be interrupted or overthought or chasing perfection.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“I never wanted More to Lose to feel perfect, I wanted it to sound meaningful and emotional,” she added.


	The performance arrives just one week before the release of Something Beautiful, Cyrus' highly anticipated ninth studio album, due May 30. The record is led by “More to Lose,” April's “End of the World,” and recent tracks “Prelude” and the album's title track. It also features collaborations with Naomi Campbell and Brittany Howard.


	The pop star is set to debut a visual album companion to Something Beautiful at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 6. Described as “a one-of-a-kind pop opera,” the film is directed by Cyrus with Jacob Bixenman and Brendan Walter.


	In a recent interview with Apple Music 1's Zane Lowe, Cyrus reflected on her journey to self-acceptance and sobriety — and how it shaped this new creative era. “The sobriety is like, that's like my God. I need it, I live for it,” she said. “It's changed my entire life.” Her 2023 smash “Flowers,” which earned her her first-ever Grammys, served as the breakthrough. “It was some sort of key right into the lock of all healing,” she added.


	With Something Beautiful, Cyrus continues that journey — and if “More to Lose” is any indication, she's not shying away from the parts that hurt.

EXCLUSIVE: During the Cannes Film Festival and market, where JA Bayona presented a preview of Vieja Loca, the film he is producing with Belén Atienza, Ramon Campos and Gabriela Carcova, Shudder acquired rights in North America, UK, Australia and New Zealand.  


	DeAPlaneta will distribute in Spain with sales handled by Studiocanal.


Vieja loca is the feature debut of Argentine screenwriter and director Martín Mauregui, starring Spanish screen legend Carmen Maura alongside Argentine actor Daniel Hendler.

	In Cannes, JA Bayona received the ‘Golden Key to the Fantastic Pavilion' for his contribution to genre cinema. 


	After his worldwide success with Society of the Snow, The Impossible filmmaker Bayona has turned his attention to his work as a producer. In a talk held at the Fantastic Pavilion of the Cannes Film Festival with Ángel Sala, director of the Sitges Fantastic Film Festival, Bayona commented: “When I began my career with The Orphanage, Guillermo del Toro produced it on one condition: that I would sponsor another director in the future. I loved Mauregui's script and it's an opportunity to return to genre cinema, which I love. I approached the project to lend a hand, but I ended up producing. It was the first film to be shot in Argentina after Javier Milei's victory and we are very happy to have been able to make this film a reality at such a complicated time for cinema in Argentina.”   


Vieja loca is a Spanish-Argentine co-production between the production companies Películas La Trini, Primo Content, Mr Field and Friends, Bambu Producciones and La Unión De Los Ríos, with the participation of Amazon España.

	Uche Ojeh, the husband of Today co-host Sheinelle Jones, has died, the show announced on Friday.


	The cause was a form of brain cancer, glioblastoma, Today host Savannah Guthrie told viewers. He was 45.


	“There are no words for the pain that we feel for Sheinelle and their three young children,” Guthrie said. “Uche was an incredible person. We all loved him.”


	Jones has been with the network since 2014. She became co-host of the third hour of the show in 2019.

	Ojeh, a consultant, and Jones had been married for 17 years, having met in the late 1990s, when Jones was a freshman at Northwestern University and Ojeh, then a high school senior, offered to give him a tour of campus, Guthrie said. Ojeh proposed to Jones eight years later during a visit to the campus. They married in 2007.

	Ojeh, a consultant, is survived by a son, Kayin, born in 2009, and twins, a son Uche, and daughter Clara, born in 2012.


	Jones has been absent from the show, announcing in January that she was taking time off for a family health matter.


	She posted on Instagram then, “Hi everybody…I sincerely appreciate all of you who have reached out while I've been absent from the show. I want to share with you that I'm taking time to deal with a family health matter. It's not lost on me how lucky I am to have not only the support of my Today show family, but also to all of you. Your kindness means so much to me. I'll see you soon. Love, Sheinelle.”


	Guthrie told viewers, “Two years ago, when Sheinelle completed her first marathon, Uche was there at the finish line, his pride evident in his beaming smile, just as she cheered him on when he completed a triathlon, little moments that captured the essence of their partnership.”

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: On the heels of its May 7 separation from Lionsgate, Starz is quickly starting to build its own library of IP with four series in priority development, all fully owned by the premium network.


	Starz has opened writers rooms for Kingmaker, set in the world of the DC Black political elite, from Al Letson and Theo Travers; Masquerade, a female-driven thriller set in Venice, from Dave Holstein; and British boxing drama Fightland, from Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson's G-Unit Film & Television, which had been in development at the network since 2022.


	Additionally, Plan B has come on board to produce All Fours, a series in development based on Miranda July's buzzy novel about a woman's journey of self-discovery and sexual awakening, which Starz acquired earlier this year.

	Starz CEO Jeff Hirsch had signaled to Wall Street that standalone Starz plans to own a lot of its programming, outright or through co-productions with other studios. It is a strategy other networks, like Fox Entertainment, have employed after splitting from their vertically integrated studio.


	For Starz, this is not new. The network used to produce and own its original series pre-Lionsgate merger, including hits like Spartacus and Power. Lionsgate Television took over production of the Power franchise post-acquisition and will continue to serve as studio on the existing series after the companies became separate again.


	“This new chapter positions Starz to take greater control of our future – creatively and financially,” said Alison Hoffman, President of Starz Networks. “By owning our IP, we're building long-term value for the business while delivering even more boundary breaking, premium content for our audience.”


	Going forward, Starz is keeping its longtime focus on adult programming for women and underrepresented audiences as exemplified by the network's tentpoles, the Outlander and Power franchises. On the network's priority development slate, the two target demos are represented by Masquerade/All Fours and Kingmaker/Fightland, respectively.


	“As Starz moves into this next chapter, I'm energized by the opportunity to deepen our investment in bold, character-driven storytelling that reflects our audience,” said Kathryn Busby, Starz's President of Original Programming. “We're growing a robust development pipeline with creators who bring fresh, authentic perspectives and doubling down on programming that defines Starz: provocative, premium and inclusive.”

	











	Hirsch in December laid out Starz's programming strategy for putting out eight to ten original series a year, “four of them for each of the demos we have today.”


	The network will also continue to build universes, using characters — and actors — from hit shows to spawn new ones which have better economics since older series get more expensive, something Hirsch has been leaning heavily into.


	Referencing Fightland, from Power franchise executive producer 50 Cent, Hirsch said in December that the drama “has the same feel of the Power universe,” adding, “We probably will take some actors from the original Power and put them in it so that we know we can bring the fan base over.”


	Here are more details on Kingmaker, Masquerade as well as previously announced All Fours and Fightland. 


KINGMAKER (writers room)Set against the glittering backdrop of Washington D.C., “Kingmaker” explores the ruthless, high-stakes world of the Black political elite as they struggle for power, position, and prestige at the highest levels of American government. The series follows the cunning machinations of a legendary power broker as he works in the shadows to reclaim his throne as the undisputed “Kingmaker” on the national political scene. Secrets, betrayals, illicit affairs, and shocking scandals collide as he stops at nothing to outmaneuver his rivals and seize supreme control.


	Al Letson (Monarch) will executive produce and co-showrun, alongside executive producer and co-showrunner Theo Travers (Billions). Beau Willimon (House of Cards) and Jordan Tappis (Severance) will executive produce for Westward. Former top HBO and eOne executive Michael Lombardo also serves as EP.


MASQURADE (writers room)Set in Venice, Masquerade is the story of an American woman who takes on a new identity at a European wedding, using the art of seduction in a murderous con to escape her past and regain her fortune.


	Dave Holstein (Inside Out 2, Kidding) is executive producer, showrunner and writer and Stacey Sher (Heretic, Mrs. America) will also executive produce.


ALL FOURS Starz has acquired the rights to Miranda July's propulsive, sexy and irreverent novel about a woman at a turning point in her life who embarks on a journey of self-discovery and sexual awakening. Featured prominently on many critics' best-of-year lists, the book has captivated readers around the world, sparking a cultural dialogue around female desire, aging and unconventional relationships.


	Plan B will produce.


FIGHTLAND (writers room)The drama series is set within the high stakes, cash rich, dangerous world of British boxing and follows a disgraced, formerly incarcerated boxing champion who returns to London to seek vengeance against the crime family he thinks betrayed him. With edge-of-seat action both in and out of the boxing ring and populated by dangerous characters, this is a world of money and power never seen before.


	Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson will executive produce through his G-Unit Film & Television along with Francis Hopkinson (Wallander, Bancroft) and Kate Leadbetter (Woman in White, Catherine the Great) of Expanded Media who will also produce. Damione Macedon (Power, BMF) and Raphael Jackson Jr. (Power, BMF) will serve as showrunners, executive producers and writers. Daniel Fajemisin-Duncan and Marlon Smith will serve as executive producers and writers.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	Years and years after Jussie Smollett claimed to be the victim of a MAGA hate crime on the cold streets of Chicago, the whole matter, lawsuits and all, is over — after the ex-Empire star wrote a check.


	Actually, two checks.


	A day after officials for the Windy City announced they had reached a settlement with Smollett, the performer says he's giving $50,000 to one local organization, and an additional $10,000 to another. “The decision to settle the civil lawsuit was not the most difficult one to make,” Smollett said today to Deadline. “After repeatedly refusing to pay the City, I was presented with an opportunity to make a charitable donation in exchange for the case being dismissed,” he went on to say (see Smollett's full statement below).

					Jennifer Aniston's Gatecrashing Stalker Is Judged Mentally Incompetent By Expert, But Accused Wants Second Opinion  - Update		
			








	Back in November last year, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously overturned the legal consequences Smollett suffered due to the high profile incident.In the court's opinion, special prosecutor Dan Webb's decision to retry Smollett had violated the performer's rights. That turn of events followed a Chicago jury delivering a guilty verdict against Smollett in December 2021 on five felony charges, including lying to the police about the alleged 2019 hate crime attack in the early hours of January 29, 2019 — an attack that at the time even garnered the short-lived sympathy of then first term president Donald Trump.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Soon afterwards Smollett's story started to fall apart at the seems and, dumped from the one-time blockbuster Danny Strong and Lee Daniels-created hip hop drama, the actor found himself in and out of court, jail and more in quick succession. At one point, local prosecutors had agreed to drop the charges against the actor as part of an agreement that he would forfeit his $10,000 bond and perform community service. Stirring up some of the local Chicago politic mix, with the cops and more, Smollett then was put under the spotlight of a special prosecutor and hauled before the courts for allegedly playing fast and loose with the truth and his own agenda.


	Today, Smollett closed that chapter in his life.


	“Over six years ago, after it was reported I had been jumped, City officials in Chicago set out to convince the public that I willfully set an assault against myself,” he said Friday. “This false narrative has left a stain on my character that will not soon disappear. These officials wanted my money and wanted my confession for something I did not do. Today, it should be clear….They have received neither.”

	











	He added: “However, despite arduous and expensive attempts to punish me, I am innocent both in the eyes of God and of our criminal justice system. What I have to do now is move forward. I will continue creating my art, fighting passionately for causes I hold dear and defending my integrity and family name with the truth.”


	While no longer a regular on network TV like he was in the heyday of Empire, Smollett has tried to pick up the reigns of his career in recent years. The Lost Holiday, a Vivica A. Fox co-staring film Smollett directed, wrote and stars in, debuted on Amazon Prime Video on May 9. 


Read Jussie Smollett's full statement on the settling of the Chicago suit here: 


	Over six years ago, after it was reported I had been jumped, City officials in Chicago set out to convince the public that I willfully set an assault against myself. This false narrative has left a stain on my character that will not soon disappear. These officials wanted my money and wanted my confession for something I did not do. Today, it should be clear….They have received neither.


	The decision to settle the civil lawsuit was not the most difficult one to make. After repeatedly refusing to pay the City, I was presented with an opportunity to make a charitable donation in exchange for the case being dismissed. Despite what happened there politically, Chicago was my home for over 5 years and the people became my family. Therefore, making a donation to benefit Chicago communities that are too often neglected by those in power will always be something I support. I've made a $50,000.00 donation to Building Brighter Futures (BBF) Center for the Arts, a local nonprofit doing incredible work nurturing self-expression, creativity and exploration of the arts for Chicago youth. This organization was of my choosing and I'm comforted that there will be at least one winner from this experience.


	Though I was exonerated by the Illinois Supreme Court in a unanimous decision and the civil case is now dismissed, I'm aware that it will not change everyone's mind about me or the attack I experienced. However, despite arduous and expensive attempts to punish me, I am innocent both in the eyes of God and of our criminal justice system. What I have to do now is move forward. I will continue creating my art, fighting passionately for causes I hold dear and defending my integrity and family name with the truth.


	Lastly, I'm grateful to have had the resources to defend myself. So many do not. They are backed into corners to take deals or confess to crimes they did not actually commit. In their honor, I am donating an additional $10,000.00 to the Chicago Torture Justice Center who provides resources to communities healing from the violence of the Chicago Police Department. To anyone who has had to prove they have in fact been violated, you know how difficult this can be to navigate. I stand with and for you. To everyone who has supported me, thank you. Your prayers and belief in me mean more than words can properly express. I will never take it lightly and will never forget. Onward.


	With Love & Respect,


	Jussie Smollett

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Did Paul Reubens Ever Get Married or Have Kids?","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/pee-wee-herman-married-kids-paul-reubens/","Fri, 23 May 2025 02:43:09 GMT","

The two-part documentary Pee-Wee as Himself will be released on HBO and Max on May 23. Created from over 40 hours of interviews, footage, and thousands of photos, viewers will finally see Paul Reubens and his alter ego as never before. Sadly, Reubens himself didn't live long enough to see how it turned out.

The 70-year-old actor died on July 30, 2023, after privately fighting cancer for six years. Reubens was extremely private about his intimate life. Many fans hope to discover more about the elusive man in the new documentary. Was he ever married? Did he have kids? While the answer to both questions is a simple no, the documentary presents more depth and insight into Reubens' life.

A post shared by Pee-wee Herman (@peeweeherman)

While Reubens was never officially married, he once claimed to Vanity Fair that he had exchanged wedding vows in a mock ceremony with Doris Duke's adopted daughter, Chandi Heffner. “I still have the temporary marriage license signed by Imelda Marcos,” he said. 

In 2018, Debi Mazar talked about her relationship with Reubens, telling Andy Cohen that the two dated, but it was platonic. “We were best friends, and the truth of the matter is that we had a love affair that was just cerebral, and it was great,” she admitted. “We spent a year or two inseparable. Driving everywhere, doing everything together. He's fantastic.”

A post shared by Debi Mazar (@debimazar)

Reubens never had any children either, but it seems like fatherhood was something he thought would come one day. According to Vanity Fair, he wanted to have kids someday. But at the time of the interview, he was already 46 and feeling that he was getting too old to be a dad.

Perhaps one of the biggest bombshells from the Pee-Wee as Himself doc involves Reubens opening up about his personal life. In one of his interviews with director Matt Wolf, he admits that he was “secretive about [his] sexuality even to [his] friends,” he said. “[It was] self-hatred or self-preservation. I was conflicted about sexuality. But fame was way more complicated.”

He acknowledged having had a boyfriend named Guy when he was younger. Unfortunately, Reubens' love life took a backseat as Pee-Wee Herman became more popular. “I was out of the closet, and then I went back in the closet,” he said in the documentary. “I wasn't pursuing the Paul Reubens career, I was pursuing the Pee-wee Herman career.”

As a child, Robert Irwin watched his older sister Bindi Irwin compete on “Dancing With the Stars” Season 21. She was partnered with professional dancer Derek Hough, and the pair won that season. Bindi has since spoken about what an incredible experience being on the show was, and Robert is also hoping to have a positive journey. Still, he's nervous, having never done anything like this before.

“I'm just going to get real for a second, I'm so nervous,” the wildlife conservationist told Us Weekly in an interview published on May 18. “I'm really nervous.”

A post shared by Robert Irwin (@robertirwinphotography)

Some fans may find it surprising to learn that Robert is nervous because of the adventurous life he lives. He deals with venemous creatures and large reptiles almost daily, but he jokingly told Us Weekly that showing off his dancing skills makes him more nervous than “jumping on a crocodile.”

Robert is thankful to have the support of his sister. Bindi publicly supported her brother on Instagram after his casting on the show was announced in April. She shared several photos of herself and Robert and reflected on her time on the show in 2015. In the caption, she encouraged him and expressed her excitement about his casting. 

Some may feel that Robert has a unique advantage because he can ask Bindi for advice on handling the experience, possibly dealing with the nerves, and offering more information on what to expect (although we would imagine every dancer's journey is unique to them). Robert spoke about his sister and how “grateful” he was to have her. He continued, “Not only did she do ‘Dancing With the Stars,' I mean, she won ‘Dancing With the Stars,' and just was such an incredible shining light. I remember watching [her] on that show just thinking, ‘This is the coolest thing ever.'”

We know Bindi can dance, but can Robert? Audiences will soon discover this when Season 34 airs in fall 2025, likely in September. But Bindi believes it will not be her brother's dancing skills that will over audiences, but his attitude to the whole process.

“You can learn to dance, but the genuine passion, dedication, determination that comes from within, and that's what I think will set you apart, because you genuinely are a really good human,” she told Us Weekly. She also praised her brother for his rhythm and for the “wonderful” person he is. “He has nothing to be worried about,” she added.

The way these siblings speak about each other with kindness and respect highlights their close bond.

Lucia Flores-Wiseman is a contestant for Team Levine on “The Voice” Season 27, and she has won over audiences with her beautiful voice and charm. She is a fantastic performer, but there is more to her than the person onstage, including information about her family life. Here are five fast facts about her family you need to know.

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

In an interview with Deepest Dream in May 2025, Flores-Wiseman discussed her music, including her songwriting process for “Transitions.” She explained the track and briefly mentioned how her parents were helping her and her boyfriend.

“One of the reasons why I wrote ‘Transitions' was because I was moving in with my boyfriend into our house and we're renting from my parents, which I'm super glad because there's no way we can afford a prices now,” she told Deepest Dreams. “I've been with my boyfriend since I was 16 years old, and making that transition (was like) – we're doing this!”

Flores-Wiseman is white and Hispanic, and her NBC bio revealed more about her experience growing up and struggling to find her place. Her dad is from Mexico, and her mom is from the United States.

“Lucia struggled to connect with her Mexican roots as she was raised away from that side of her family,” the bio reads. “Determined to embrace her lineage, she became fluent in Spanish while studying abroad in Spain.”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman chose a very special song for her Blind Audition and dedicated it to her parents. The song was Ángela Aguilar's “La Llorona.” Her powerful vocals and the emotion in her singing resulted in all four judges turning their chairs around.

A little video to get to know who I am! There's so many things I didn't get to mention, but I hope this shows a little glimpse into my life! Thank you all for the support from my performances on @NBC's The Voice! So excited for playoffs! ❤️  #thevoice #adamlevine #singer #mexicanamerican 

Some families have cats, others prefer dogs, and the Flores-Wiseman family are dog lovers. Lucia shared this information in a video posted on TikTok in April 2025. The post was for fans to get to know her better.

“My dad is from Mexico and my mom is from the U.S,” she said in the TikTok post. She revealed they have a family dog, a black Labrador, who is 14 years old. In the clip, the singer also briefly discussed having addiction in her family and how she wants to be “a cycle breaker.”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman was raised in Washington state, and she loves it. 

“I just love the Pacific Northwest. I love our fresh air, our wonderful community, and I think the music community continues to grow in Seattle,” she told 425 magazine. “I am so grateful to have a community that supports the arts, and if I didn't have that, I'm not sure if I would be where I am today. I don't know if I would be on ‘The Voice' stage if it weren't for so many people believing in me and creating spaces for me to perform.”

Yeehaw! “American Idol” season 10 winner and country music star Scotty McCreery is ready to be a dad again. He and his wife Gabi, along with their two-year-old son Avery, announced on May 22, 2025, that they'll soon be a family of four. 

In an adorable photo announcement posted to social media, Gabi wrote, “A new best friend coming this fall! 💙💙”

A post shared by Gabi Dugal McCreery (@gabimccreery)

After posting a carousel of photos of their current family of three, with Avery wearing a blue sweatshirt that said “BIG BROTHER,” the McCreerys heard from thousands of friends and fans who were over the moon about their news. 

Within hours of publishing their post, it had over 50,000 likes on Instagram, including from “American Idol” alums Pia Toscano and season 13 winner Caleb Johnson, and nearly as many on Facebook. 

Country star Lauren Alaina, who was runner-up to Scotty on “American Idol” and is expecting her first child in a matter of days, wrote, “Yay!!!! Congrats” followed by three teary-eyed emoji. 

One fan exclaimed, “OMG ..the bestest news I have heard all day ..Congratulations. How awesome ..exciting news 🥰🥰🥰🥰”

Another wrote, “Congratulations!! Y'all make the cutest family!”

Someone else weighed in, “Congratulations! So happy for the 3 of you. It's so exciting to watch your family grow.”

“Congratulations to each one of you,” someone wrote on Facebook. “I will be Praying for a great pregnancy journey, labor and Delivery, healthy Mama and baby. This is so Awesome!!!”

A post shared by Scotty McCreery (@scottymccreery)

Many fans mentioned what a good big brother Avery will be. The McCreerys' little guy has been the apple of their eye since he was born in October 2022. Named Merrick Avery McCreery, after Gabi's father — Merrick Dugal III, the couple chose to call him by his middle name, Avery.

Scotty announced Avery's birth on social media, posting a photo of the newborn and writing, “Thank yall for all of your prayers during this exciting season of life! Healthy baby and a healthy mama! Praise God🙌🏼🙏🏼”

In between touring and releasing new music — including his new song “Bottle Rockets” with Hootie & the Blowfish — Scotty has prioritized being an involved dad. He frequently posts sweet moments with Avery, from singing to him backstage in January to playing on a putting green on May 19.

When Scotty released his song “Love Like This” in early 2024, he shared on social media how much his family inspired him, writing, “Becoming a father is the coolest thing I've ever done and watching my wife be a rock star as his Mom has been the joy of my life these last 15 months 🧡👨‍👩‍👦”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Below Deck Down Under' Couple Hint at a Post-Season Romance","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/below-deck-down-under-couple-romance/","Fri, 23 May 2025 02:43:09 GMT","

There were plenty of boatmances on season 3 of “Below Deck Down Under,” but one couple seemingly hint that their relationship is still going strong.

Nicolas Cattelan, who came in the season mid-way as a deckhand, posted on May 21 with stew Marina Marcondes de Barros, “Always remember what the real treasure is.”

A post shared by NICOLAS CATTELAN (@nicolas.cattelan)

The two were still in their blue Yacht Katina polo shirt and were standing on the deck of the boat with their heads together.

Cattelan and Marcondes de Barros struck up a romance when the deckhand replaced Johnny Arvanitis halfway through the season.

Although it began casually, Marcondes de Barros made her feelings clear when she left Cattelan a sweet note in episode 15. 

The second stew's feelings got ruffled when Cattelan didn't acknowledge the note but when he eventually brought it up, they smoothed things over.

A post shared by NICOLAS CATTELAN (@nicolas.cattelan)

After bosun Wihan Du Toit and deckand Arvanitis were let go by Captain Jason Chambers, Marcondes de Barros thought that was the right decision.

“We need upbeat energy, we need jokes, we need laughing, you know? And that's exactly what Nic and Nate bring to the boat. Honestly, they were a breath of fresh air and exactly what we needed,” the stew told Decider on April 22. 

On her initial flirtation with Du Toit, Marcondes de Barros said, “I don't regret going after Wihan. He's such an interesting guy. He has traveled all over the world. While we shared many similarities, he was way better as a friend than as a lover.”

Since moving on with Cattelan, Marcondes de Barros gushed, “Nic is an amazing person. He speaks several languages. He's well-traveled. He's a nerd … We had a lot of things in common, and I felt very comfortable around him.”

She teased, “I think I ignored the fact that we were really good together until he kissed me. I had no idea he fancied me at all. I was going about my day normally without knowing this cute guy was fancying me. I didn't want to get into anything, but have you seen his smile? I'm a human, I am a woman, so let's see where this goes.”

A post shared by Nate Salmon (@oldm8n8)

Cattelan may seem confident on-camera, but he revealed that he's shy around the opposite sex. “Around beautiful women, I try not to think about it. The more I think about it, the more awkward it gets. I mean, they remind me a lot of the girls who didn't want to talk to me in high school,” he said on his first episode of “Below Deck Down Under,” per Bravo.

His interaction with the charter guests almost got him in trouble when he felt pressured to drink a shot with the ladies.

However, he came clean to Chambers later on, who gave him a second chance. It remains to be seen if Cattelan and Marcondes de Barros make it past season 3 of “Below Deck Down Under.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","“Mission: Impossible” Recap: Every Movie Explained Before the ""Final Reckoning""","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/mission-impossible-movies-recap-final-reckoning/","Fri, 23 May 2025 02:43:09 GMT","

One of the biggest action franchises in movie history is set to come to a (possible) conclusion.

While star Tom Cruise hasn't explicitly stated whether or not the series is kaput, “Mission: Impossible's” latest effort is bound to be as exhilarating as ever. Over the course of eight movies, Cruise's Ethan Hunt has been disavowed at least six separate times, lost a couple of loves and teammates, and has even gone rogue. 

But what exactly led us to the “Final Reckoning?”

Below, you can find a refresher of every “Mission: Impossible” movie. Who joined in what outings, their fates, what stunts made up the set pieces of the movie, and more.

Director Brian De Palma helmed the first movie. The initial outing involved Hunt taking charge of an IMF team (Impossible Mission Force) after their original leader Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is seemingly killed. The rest of the team is also picked off one after another. Hunt is tasked by IMF boss Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) to find the mole that leaked a list containing the agents' names. Hunt teams with Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) as well as his previous team leader's wife, Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart), in order to get the list from the CIA. An intensely quiet wire heist leads to the team scoring the list. 

Using cryptic Biblical messages, the mole is revealed to be the not-so-dead Phelps. Krieger tries to betray Hunt; he fails. A showdown on a train leads to Claire Phelps being revealed to have been working with her husband the entire time. Both are killed during an action sequence. Hunt and Luther are reinstated in the IMF.

Team: Claire Phelps, Franz Krieger, and Luther StickellMask Reveals: FourStunt: Hunt hangs by a wire.

John Woo took on directorial duties for a movie that doesn't adhere to the traditional “Mission: Impossible” look. Hunt is tasked with taking down rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who is the sole owner of the cure to a bioweapon and the bioweapon itself that he'll try to sell back to the pharmaceutical company that created them. 

Luther and helicopter pilot Billy Baird (John Polson) join Hunt and professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandiwe Newton) as they try to recover the viruses. Through a very messy honeypot situation – complete with betrayals, mask removals, and Woo's slick yet adept 90's action directing – Nyah injects herself with the bioweapon. Hunt fights Ambrose on a beach, almost takes a knife to the eye, and is able to save Nyah by giving her the cure. Hunt gets the IMF to clear Nyah's past and the two enjoy a vacation together.  

Team: Billy Baird, Nyah Nordoff-Hall and Luther StickellMask Reveals: ThreeStunt: Hunt free climbs.

J.J. Abrams takes charge of this effort, turning the franchise in a more approachable action direction. A retired Hunt is now engaged to Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), a nurse who doesn't know Hunt's true past.. IMF director of operations John Musgrave (Billy Crudup) tasks Hunt to go on a rescue mission in order to save Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) after she is captured by arms dealer Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), who is looking for an item call the “Rabbit's Foot.” Musgrave has already pulled a team together for Hunt including Declan Gormley (Johnathan Rhys Meyers), Zhen Lei (Maggie Q), and Luther.0

The team is unable to save Farris after Hunt delivers what he believes to be the real “Rabbit's Foot” to the arms dealer. Davian then kidnaps Meade, who finds out Hunt is an IMF agent. Davian seemingly shoots Meade and leaves her for dead. Musgrave arrives to reveal he has been working with Davian in order to preemptively use the “Rabbit's Foot” against terrorists. Hunt finds out Meade wasn't actually shot. He escapes from Musgrave and tasks IMF technician Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to help find Meade. After a fight that leaves Davian dead, Hunt free's Meade before dying himself. She kills a henchman then Musgrave before bringing Hunt back to life with a defibrillator. The two get healed up at the IMF offices before heading off on their honeymoon.

Team: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, Benji Dunn and StickellMask Reveals: TwoStunt: Hunt slides down the side of a building.

After a fellow IMF agent with newly acquired nuclear codes is killed in action by assassin Sabine Moreau (Lea Seydoux), Hunt is extracted from his current mission in order to find out what happened. Joining him this go are William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Dunn and Stickell. Hunt is framed for blowing up the Kremlin by Russian nuclear strategist Kurt “Cobalt” Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist). The team then has to initiate “Ghost Protocol” in order to find out why Cobalt is setting the IMF up to fail. They infiltrate the meeting where Cobalt's henchmen and the assassin are set to exchange the codes for diamonds. But the machine that makes masks breaks, which leads to a teeth-gritting set of meetings in two different rooms. Hunt climbs the side of the Burj Khalifa before chasing a henchman who is revealed to be Cobalt in a mask into a sandstorm, and Carter kills the assassin.

Cobalt wants to start nuclear warfare by destroying San Francisco with a missile from a Russian submarine. The team is able to get the mission accomplished. Sticketll, who was on assignment, gets the lowdown of the entire ordeal before it's revealed that Hunt and Meade are separated. He watches from afar as she enjoys a night out with friends.

Team: William Brandt, Jane Carter, Benji Dunn and StickellMask Reveals: TwoStunt: Hunt climbs the Burj Khalifa.

Writer Christopher McQuarrie – who is credited with rewrites of “Ghost Protocol” – takes over the series from this point forward, giving the movies a singular voice and story that reverberate for the remainder of the series. Hunt and his team along with disavowed MI-6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) must take down The Syndicate, a secret team of rogue operatives from different agencies while working under the thumb of Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). 

They're led by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) who wants to kill millions in order to create a more peaceful Earth. Hunt is captured by Lane's men but Faust, working undercover, helps him escape. She's trying to rob an underwater vault where Lane is keeping the names of all the operatives for The Syndicate. With the help of Hunt, she's able to do it but she betrays Hunt in order to turn the list into MI-6 so she can have her life back. The plan doesn't work but Benji was able to copy the data before Faust stole it. The file is revealed to actually by a monetary account with billions of dollars that Hunt believes Lane will use to fund The Syndicate. Lane chases Hunt through London before being trapped by the IMF and carted away to jail.

Team: Ilsa Faust, Brandt, Dunn and StickellMask Reveals: TwoStunt: Hunt hangs from a plane.

The Syndicate is now called The Apostles and they do terrorist work. Hunt fails to obtain three plutonium cores while managing to save Luther's life. The CIA, led by Erika Sloane (Anglea Bassett), wants to keep an eye on the IMF disbanded against Hunley's wishes. Hunt and CIA operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) must go to Paris in order to intercept the exchange of the plutonium. After a brawl in a nightclub leaves the buyer dead and Faust is revealed to be working on the same mission for MI-6, the three infiltrate a backroom where broker Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby) is set to purchase the nuclear items. 

Hunt assumes the identity of the buyer as Mitsopolis tells him that he will only receive the entire set if he's able to rescue the Apostle's leader, Lane, while he's being transported by police escort. Hunt begrudgingly accepts but plans to betray the Apostles and Mitsopolis by kidnapping Lane with the help of Beji and Luther. The team brings Lane to London but are stopped by the CIA after Walker gives Sloane fake evidence saying Hunt really is the buyer for the plutonium and plans to use it. Waker goes on the run after betraying the CIA and IMF and runs off with the plutonium in order to use it for the Apostles. 

He and Lane plan to use the two bombs at a medical camp in Kasmir that happens to be where Julia Meade and her new husband, Erik (Wes Bently), are stationed. Luther, Benji and Faust must disable the bombs while Hunt goes after the detonator. With the help of Meade, Luther starts dismantling the first bomb. Lane tries to kill Benji and Faust but fails. The two then start working on the second bomb. Hunt fights Walker on the side of a cliff, gets the detonator, and saves the world.

Team: August Walker, Faust, Dunn and StickellMask Reveals: TwoStunt: Hunt performs a Halo jump.

An artificial intelligence named The Entity becomes sentient after coming online. Hunt goes to find the two keys that were used to turn it on as they are the only way to get to AI's source code. While in the Arabian Desert, he finds one key and pretends to kill Faust, who is still disavowed and now has a bounty on her head. Later, Hunt infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community meeting where he gets former IMF and current CIA director Eugene Kittridge to admit he put the bounty on Faust's head. Benji and Luther help Hunt track down the second key at the Abu Dhabi International Airport. The key is revealed to be a fake as thief Grace (Hayley Atwell), steals the first key from Hunt while Benji and Luther disarm a fake nuclear bomb. A ghost from Hunt's past named Gabriel (Esai Morales) who works for The Entity causes the team to abort their mission. 

The CIA – led by Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham) and Theo Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis) – chases Hunt and Grace before Hunt reconnects with his team as Grace escapes on her own. Faust returns and she and Hunt go to confront Mitsopolis who hired Grace to steal the keys in order to sell them. Failing to get Mitsopolis to not go through with the sale to Gabriel, everyone escapes the tense situation. The Entity tricks Hunt, leading Faust to her death at the hand of Gabriel. Hunt is pursued by assassin Paris (Pom Klementieff), who is Gabriel's hired muscle. Hunt spares her in a fight. 

While on The Orient Express, Mitsopolis is set to sell the keys but she is taken out by Grace who impersonates her. The disguised Grace negotiates the sale to none other than Kittridge before pickpocketing the keys and running away with the money. The train goes off the rails as Hunt boards using a parachute. Hunt is informed by a dying Paris what the keys do. He and Grace escape the train as the CIA closes in on the two. Gabriel is then pickpocketed by Hunt during a fight and the IMF operative sets off to destroy The Entity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","Stellan Skarsgård Finds One of His Best Roles in ‘Sentimental Value': The Actor on His Cannes Hit and What He Thinks of Son Alexander's Sexy ‘Pillion'","https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/stellan-skarsgard-sentimental-value-interview-1235125908/","Fri, 23 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

On a shaded rooftop above the Croisette, Stellan Skarsgård deflected praise for his performance in Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” a rare Cannes consensus pick.

“Proud?” he told IndieWire quietly, rolling the word with audible distaste. “I'm not usually proud of things. I don't know about that. Joachim's way of working is very special, very beautiful, and quite brave. And it fucking works. That's good.”

In the film, Skarsgård plays Gustav Borg, a once-lauded arthouse director who abandoned his wife and daughters in pursuit of his career. Fifteen years have passed since his last film, and longer still since his last success. Now, he's written a screenplay exploring his emotional distance from his family and his mother's suicide, centred on a role he wants his estranged daughter Nora, played by “The Worst Person in the World” star Renate Reinsve, to take on.

Cinephiles may recognise Gustav Borg's type, the faded auteur with a loyal cinematographer and a career documentary about which he is quietly proud. But Skarsgård insists there was no single point of inspiration. “I've made about 150 films and worked with a lot of directors,” said Skarsgård. “There's no particular one I based him on. He could be a composer, conductor, even a banker. It's about a man whose work is his life. And that's the problem: it competes with his family life.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






“He is conservative in a way and doesn't have the tools to break the scar tissue that comes from not being present. As a father, he's more traditional than me because I have no hierarchy with my kids,” he said, referring to his seven sons and one daughter, offspring that include three employees of the film and television industry, a doctor and the acting fraternity of Alexander, Gustaf, Bill and Valter. “I was very pleased when they became actors because we had at least found something in common that we could talk about,” he said with a smile. “But I don't have a weaker relationship with my doctor son than with the others.”

“They're doing different things and they're very different kinds of actors. The important thing that they have understood is, ‘fuck the world'. It's what you experience on the set that is important, and you can have a good experience on a small budget film or in a big budget film and you can become famous from it or be unknown after it.”

 










His son Alexander is also at Cannes, starring in Harry Lighton's poignant and explicit BDSM romance “Pillion”, which the elder Skarsgård admits he is “dying to see”. Critics have called the performance revealing and brave, descriptors that make Skarsgård smile.

“Oh good,” he said. “I want him to be like that.”

The character of Gustav Borg is already being discussed as a possible first Oscar nomination for Skarsgård, who already has an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe award for his performance in the HBO miniseries “Chernobyl.” Described by Trier as “one of the great Nordic actors of all time,” the role of Borg gives Skarsgård the rare opportunity to show the depth of his talent, creating a warm, complex, funny and deeply melancholy character.

“I like getting awards because I like,” he said, miming receiving a statue, “‘I liked what you did. Here, have an award.' That's fun.” He sips on a glass of water and looks over the bustle of the Croisette below. “I used to party all night at festivals and do press all day. I had an enormous appetite for that because I'm a very social being. But with age, you can't go on like that. I have to go to bed early, and I've got to get up and produce something.”

 










Skarsgård has been acting since 1968, and in that time has seen the industry reshape itself around streaming, franchises, and finance. Over the last decade, he has been involved in some of the most financially successful film franchises, including “Dune,” the Marvel universe, and “Mamma Mia,” as well as series like “Andor” and “Chernobyl.” While his methods have changed little, the industry around him has transformed. When he considers how the industry has changed over his long career, Skarsgård singles out money as the root of all change.

“Everything is owned by investment companies now, and they need 15% return on their invested capital to be happy. Before, you could have a film studio and have 5% return of the capital, and they were happy too, but that doesn't work anymore. So, you get those fucking big machines — like Netflix,” he said, citing the company that his “Sentimental Value” character makes his deeply personal film for.

“Since Netflix won the competition about streaming services, they don't throw away money anymore,” he said. “They fired their head of film because he wanted to support artists, so now they're starting to do reality shows instead,” he shrugged. “AT&T owns Time Warner, you know? What have they got to do with it? But I suppose I am good for business.”

 










Skarsgård reserves a special place for anyone who loves and cares about film, such as director Joachim Trier. In the past, Skarsgård has cited his favorite performances as those devoid of the process of acting. Trier, he said, is a director whose methods are “exemplary” when it comes to creating performances like these. 

“What I want is the absolute truth in expression, and that cannot be planned,” said Skarsgård. “You can plan the surface of it, you can make a very beautiful performance of it, but it will be like a beautiful diamond; totally cold. It doesn't have the irrationality of life,” he paused.

“But Joachim sees what you're doing, even if you're not doing it. He does a lot of takes, but he doesn't push you in any direction. He lures out the experience, the reflection of the experience and the different kinds of emotions that are created in the moment, so you don't know what's going to come, and sometimes you surprise yourself. I used to say, ‘I'm very technical, but I want to be as good as an amateur when I act'. Like Björk, she's an amateur, but [in Lars von Trier's ‘Dancer in the Dark'], she's got a rich inner life that pours out of her when she's acting.”

 










It is this sense of on-set spontaneity and surprise that Skarsgård credits with keeping him excited and engaged with acting. This can come on any size of set, he said, it depends on the people with whom he's working, and there are few people he's worked with more often than the director of “Dancer in the Dark.”

“It's the same with the other Trier, Lars von Trier,” he continued. “He doesn't even block the scene. He says, ‘Good?,' he starts, and things come. He's not working in detail as much as Joachim, so they're different in that way. Joachim has a much more solid script.”

A few days earlier at Cannes, on IndieWire's Screen Talk podcast, Neon head and “Sentimental Value” producer Tom Quinn recalled a moment of Cannes infamy. Back in 2011, when he was working on Lars von Trier's film “Melancholia,” which starred Skarsgård, his son Alexander, Kiefer Sutherland, Brady Corbet, Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Kirsten Dunst, Quinn believed it would be a breakout hit in the U.S. Then, came the infamous press conference, where von Trier declared, “I understand Hitler.” The comment, later apologized for and taken out of context, irreversibly damaged his reputation. “You can see the moment he says it,” Quinn recalled. “The actresses' faces just fall. That was the moment it was all over.”

 










Since his debut in the late 1980s, von Trier has built one of cinema's most viscerally powerful and galvanizing filmographies and built a partnership with Skarsgård that has included films such as “Breaking the Waves”, “Nymphomaniacs I and II,” and “Dogville.” In 2022, the director was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and it seems unlikely he'll direct again. These days, von Trier doesn't pick up the phone, but the two still text.

“I mean, when Lars calls, I don't even read the script,” said Skarsgård. “I know the staff that he's going to work with, and I know what he makes will be good or it will be a totally unseen film,” he laughs. “Before he said to me, ‘Stellan, I know what kind of films I'm making, they're the films that haven't been made.'”

When it comes to the question of his own forthcoming projects, Skarsgård replies with a firm “no, nothing.” For someone who works as much as you, does that seem a little scary?

“Not as scary as some of the projects that I'm offered,” he replied with a smile.

“Sentimental Value” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. Neon releases the film later this year.

Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardennes have settled into a comfortable niche over the course of 13 feature films. Well-researched social-realist depictions of marginalized people butting up against intransigent institutions is the way the record goes. To be fair to les frères Dardennes, there is a reliable level of unshowy competence as well as an integrity to their insistence on embedding with unglamorous, recognizable people.

All the while, they facilitate other filmmakers in bringing related French and Belgian slice-of-life visions to fruition. They helped to produce one of the best debuts of last year, “Julie Keeps Quiet” by Leonardo Van Dijl. At this edition of Cannes alone there are two films to bear their names as producers: “Enzo” by Laurent Cantet and Robin Campillo opened Directors Fortnight and, neatly enough, “Adam's Sake” by Laura Wandel opened Critics' Week.

Earnest force-for-cinema credentials established, how does “Young Mothers” fit into their body of work? Pivoting around a shelter for teenage mothers in the Belgian city of Liège, this modest offering does not deliver the immense emotional returns of “Two Days, One Night” (2014) — arguably their last heavy-hitter. Nonetheless, there is a satisfying, compact completeness to their handling of the storylines of four different young mothers and sufficient grace notes are enabled in each case to stave off the cliches that occasionally threaten to engulf events.

Jessica and Alba. Perla and Noa. Ariane and Lili. Julie and Mia. Each of the titular young mothers is a frightened child ill-equipped to handle the beloved bundle that now depends on them. The film's most immediate power stems from the casting of age-appropriate, largely unknown actresses, so that we have frequent cause to double-take at the sight of babies with babies. 

The shelter is depicted as a port in a storm where the girls participate in communal chores like cooking and cleaning and try to help each other out with childcare when they can. The grownup authorities are encouraging yet firm. Although the futures of Jessica, Perla, Ariane, Julie, are uncertain, this is a rare example of a positive institution showing up in a Dardennes flick. 

Each mother is dealing with non-existent or complex relationships with their families of origin. Bar Julie, who drew the long straw with her devoted Dylan, each mother is also dealing with an absent or checked-out baby daddy. Addiction, either personal or from their own caregivers, is a motif. Any sense of preparedness for the baby's arrival is notable by its absence as the characters spin out in spurts of productive energy, desperate to lay out the next track in the road in front of them. They want to bag a home or employment or a relationship to stop their new responsibility from feeling so totalizing and lonely. 

 










The curtain opens on a heavily pregnant Jessica (Babette Verbeek) as she rolls up to meet the mother who gave her up as a baby. It's a no show so caseworker Yasmine drives Jessica back home. Then we're with Noa (Lucie LaRuelle) as she picks up Perla's dad post release from a juvenile detention center. She's delighted to finally present as a family, whereas he is more animated by his first spliff in two months. The stress of it all causes Noa to collapse and Julie (Elsa Houben) helps to bring her back to her body with a massage. It won't be until later that we discover the demons that Julie is fighting. 

The most fully inhabited inter-generational microcosm comes courtesy of Ariane (Janaina Halloy Foken). Her pressures are packaged in a brilliant, ragged performance by Christelle Cornill as the mother that forced her not to have an abortion. Their scenes reveal that Ariane is sturdier than the precarious adult who has only recently shed a violent ex and is so obsessed with baby Lili that we fear for the vacuum she is contending with alone. Cornill is a volatile presence capable of delivering a backhander before falling to her knees in remorse. Halloy Foken (whose credits include “Inexorable” by Fabrice Du Welz) holds her own as a focused teenager determined not to let her life be derailed by emotional blackmail close to home.

 










The brothers do rigorous work in cutting between these four stories while letting them intersect as the girls warmly co-exist in the shelter. Essential character details emerge amidst the pace that drives their daily goals, and the fears bubbling underneath occasionally erupt, without anyone having to pay the price for this natural human upset. If there is an archetypal quality to each girl and if this is amplified by the stereotypical nature of their problems, there is enough tenderness in the atmosphere of the shelter to allow each actor to take their foot of the gas and relax into the small and soothing tasks that make up domesticity. 

A great deal of mastery is present in the balancing of disparate storylines and the blending of contrasting emotional landscapes. Individual insecurity is offset by release-valve relationships in a film that – like its young protagonist – is stronger than it looks.

“Young Mothers” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Ask anyone — it's easy to get lost in the Tokyo subway. The city's underground boasts ample signposting to guide commuters and tourists — but there's so much of it, the passageways and stairways all look alike, and oh, we're right back where we started.

Genki Kawamura's delightful blockbuster provocation “Exit 8” understands and exploits these frustrations, transforming these claustrophobic corridors into a site of psychological exploration, personal choice, and national anxieties.

Quite possibly the first video game adaptation to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, “Exit 8” is adapted from the virally successful 2023 independent game of the same name, which has now hit over 1.5 million downloads worldwide and has further internet cache on YouTube and Twitch (the most popular video has 6.2 million views at the time of writing). Ostensibly a first-person walking simulator, “Exit 8” the game is “Spot the Difference” by way of “The Stanley Parable,” a compelling little experience that can be completed in under an hour, in standard flatscreen or VR.

The objective is simple: Look for anomalies in a single underground passageway that weren't there on your previous walkthrough. If you spy any, turn around and go back the way you came. If you think there are none, proceed down the hallway and around the next corner. Get it right, and you advance from Exit 0 to Exit 1, and so on. Get it wrong, and you're returned to the preceding exit. The goal is to reach Exit 8, which will bring you back above ground. Toho's blockbuster film adaptation is a remarkably faithful translation, one-to-one in its central environment and signage, to the point that the film at first feels like an FMV transmedia advertisement for its source material. But the core concept has been expanded in smart and surprisingly thrilling ways.

The directing and co-writing credit of Genki Kawamura would appear an odd choice. As a prominent film producer (“Your Name,” “Monster”) and best-selling novelist (“If Cats Disappeared from the World”), Kawamura's debut directorial effort was 2022's “A Hundred Flowers,” a subdued, melancholy dementia drama. His work focuses on interpersonal struggles, not J-horror jump scares. But take another look, and it starts to make sense.

 










Arashi superstar Kazunari Ninomiya is The Lost Man, a backpack-clad commuter seeking a way out of the underground and back to the light of day — where his once-girlfriend is waiting to hear his decision on whether he wants to keep the baby that she's carrying. Initially distracted by his playlist and a phone call, he soon realizes that the passageways are looping, a situation that he quickly and pragmatically adapts to. As he scans the advertisements on the walls and itemizes his environment out loud, Ninomiya and the glossy production design bring a “Squid Game” dopamine to proceedings. Your interest and attention is maintained because you want to see what's around the next corner. Did The Lost Man fail to notice something? What will the subsequent exit bring? Wait, did the eyes on that poster just move?

Ninomiya's megastar popularity takes on a new shape when placed within these hyper-reflective, Unreal Engine-esque walls. A film that speaks in video game grammar, “Exit 8” feels like a live-action “Let's Play'” a logical modern evolution of cinema where your experience is akin to watching am influencer livestream their findings — solidified by your fellow spectators, who lean in as you do when new developments arise and confusion continues. 

 










“Exit 8” contains no jump scares. It instead succeeds through a cumulative anxiety, where we could be stuck here forever (the feature-length running time is weaponized rather than wasted), and that something genuinely horrific could eventually appear within this cyclical space. Something genuinely horrific does eventually make its entrance, but it's the little fears that leave a lasting impression. Disembodied wails of coin-locker babies echo off the tiled walls. Poster advertisements promise better pay, remind us of appropriate etiquette, and uphold beauty standards. These are distinctly Japanese anxieties — as is getting trapped in a liminal space that scuppers your punctuality.

A brain-warping shift of perspective reveals the path to be less linear than first thought, allowing Kawamura and co-writer Kentaro Hirase to introduce extra dimension to its inhabitants. There are multiple players in this loop, and they all want out for different reasons. The twists in store are gratifying and worth experiencing blind. Kawamura's literary verve has elevated and transformed a dialogue-free indie game into a mystery box more reminiscent of complex ADV adventures such as “Zero Escape” and “Danganronpa,” and the cult film classic “Cube.”

It's a devilishly entertaining time at the movies, building to an exhilarating finale that centers why The Lost Man, or indeed the viewer, should want to leave this recursive labyrinth. If you've spied a commercial for “Exit 8,” you may be wondering how a Japanese feature in 2025 can possibly use Ravel's iconic “Bolero” in a way that feels wholly its own — the track became synonymous with Sion Sono's “Love Exposure” back in 2008 — but rest assured that this is the sharpest needledrop of the year.

 










The Lost Man's struggle with impending fatherhood may seem slight, but it ultimately proves resonant. “Exit 8” is a cinematic captcha, tasking us with finding the difference between one image and the next to prove our humanity.

“Exit 8” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Can an even meaner “Carrie” actually end well for the prom queen? In Netflix's new “Fear Street” adaptation, Matt Palmer argues yes and no with a whip-smart teen horror movie co-written by the director and Donald McLeary. An even gorier “Heathers” crowned in the pitch-black comedy era of “Bottoms,” “Fear Street: Prom Queen” is anchored in the same vicious and girly roots as the original film trilogy from 2021 — albeit missing some of the scope and style inherent to Leigh Janiak's three-part slasher epic. Still, Palmer and McLeary's take is giddy and gruesome, a clever next chapter with a fresh killer whose bloody raincoat isn't the only detail to scream “I Know What You Did Last Summer.”

References don't make a good movie any more than they make a good movie review, but “Fear Street: Prom Queen” successfully uses genre homage to carbonate R.L. Stine's simple recipe for more fizzy-minded audiences. The punch(line) is intoxicating and pridefully chunky, funneled through a messy spiral of a script that's chockfull of exposition dumps you'll expect… and several amputations you won't. From a woman muttering her way through a lethal head-wound to cinema's cruelest use of a slippery doorknob, “Prom Queen” blitzes through familiar pop-comic vignettes, only pausing to make its loathsome characters' adolescent nightmares just a little bit freakier.

Flecks of Jamie Lee Curtis' “Prom Night,” Rose McGowan's “Jawbreaker,” and even Clea DuVall's “But I'm a Cheerleader” rain down on this snappy ensemble effort like confetti. It's 1988 in Shadyside, where it's about to be prom night for the same cursed town explored in the earlier installments. Miracles are rare here, but outcast Lori Granger (India Fowler) isn't going down without a fight when it comes to her school's race for prom queen. She's one of a half-dozen contestants in a heavily symbolic race that all six girls say they're determined to win. The odds are the most stacked against Lori, who in addition to sharing the same name as Michael Meyers' favorite victim (yeah, yeah, different spelling) suffers each day as Rosemary's baby — literally.

Crossing off cliched character traits like orders on her waitressing pad, Lori is the daughter of a disgraced widow cop. Rosemary Granger (Joanne Boland) stands accused of murdering her husband years before. Now, narrating over a moody synth score (which, for good or bad, sounds a lot like “Stranger Things”), Lori explains that being named queen is the fastest and surest way to restore her mother's reputation. Even tossing in some lore about a ruined prom decades earlier, our final girl's motivation makes next to no sense. And yet, Palmer proves a worthy protector of the “Fear Street” legacy, embracing any limitations in his comparatively quick worldbuilding through the shrugging comfort of camp.

 










Meet the Wolf Pack. Yes, the Wolf Pack. More Joan Crawford than Regina George, queen bee Tiffany (Fina Strazza) is as good at crafting insults as she is milking their every syllable upon delivery. Even straight-A student Linda (Ilan O'Driscoll) gets lines like, “I'm gonna cut the bitch who did this!” in a clique as bone-deep cruel as it is prone to passive-aggressive infighting. One-note stoner Christy (Ariana Greenblatt), loyal “lap dog” Melissa (Ella Rubin), and yappy gossip Debbie (Rebecca Ablack) complete Tiffany's cast of henchmen, opposite their leader's tough-to-read boyfriend Tyler (David Iacono, giving a solid nod to John Travolta's Billy Nolan). They've all got plus-ones and parents they're bringing to the “Prom Queen” potluck, but without a weapon of choice, the killer gets especially creative, turning a varied and cheeky collection of deaths into a single murderous meal.

Sometimes one by one, but just as often two by two, Shadyside's worst bullies become meat bags — satisfyingly swallowed up by action scenes, set pieces, and gross-out gags, some even on par with the newly revitalized “Final Destination.” Megan (Suzanna Son), Lori's horror-loving best friend, does wonders for the comedic tone, emerging at the center of the first scare and pleasantly pulling focus the whole way through. A queer-coded class clown with the SFX talent of genre wizard Rick Baker, she handily earns Most Likely Fan Favorite through a slew of deranged pranks. Suffice to say, not since Squidward Tentacles celebrated April Fool's Day has a practical joke gone so outrageously far.

 










To say nothing of her fate, peppy student reporter Harmony LaFay (Cecilia Lee) sticks out as another character “Fear Street” might consider bringing back, if the standalone didn't work so well. Giving their teen co-stars a strong backboard, the adult cast boasts Emmy winner Lili Taylor as Vice President Dolores Brekenridge alongside eclectic film presence Katherine Waterston (“Babylon,” “Alien: Covenant”) as Tiffany's mom, Nancy. Rife with red herrings but not especially complex, “Prom Queen” makes it mark by acting with intention. It's territory you've seen countless Sissy Spacek-types sprint through before, and you'll wish parts of Shadyside's science curriculum came with a chemistry read. But when total commitment collides with enough gore and guts, this wonderfully energetic soiree sidesteps tired tropes to reach a royally dark place. Shout out to editor Christopher Donaldson, who manages that enthusiasm like a weed-smoking chaperone.

Flirty and fiendish, “Prom Queen” is the pick if you want to laugh, gag, and chant “KISS!” (in a homoerotic manner) without leaving the house this weekend. One dance sequence seems to recall “Sugar & Spice” on purpose, while another channels the “Wicked” hat dance by mistake. There's a meat cleaver/skull gag that looks great until it gets overused. And the same could be said of goofy Principal Wayland (Darrin Baker), who repeatedly drops the word “wowzers.” (Was that popular in the '80s? Or ever?) Those tiny flaws play more like charming imperfections on “Fear Street,” where Palmer's contribution rules as definitive proof there is more fun to be had adapting this spooky book series. Brought back at just the right time, Netflix should make these movies an annual affair — even if Lori doesn't live to be prom queen.

 










“Fear Street: Prom Queen” is now streaming on Netflix.

If there's such a thing as a “Sundance movie,” it's typically about a dysfunctional family, demonstrably quirky, rigidly adhering to a three-act structure, possessing clever-clever needle drops. Is there a Cannes equivalent to the “Sundance movie”? 

It's certainly not as discussed as an archetype, but it appears there is: The “Cannes movie” is a French drama with light comedic notes, attuned to small moments, often related to a coming-of-age theme (at any age), a certain literary open-endedness, minimal camera movements, and no or little score. Not all of these attributes need to be present, but usually some combination is. This can be anything from “The 400 Blows” to 2024's Directors' Fortnight opener “This Life of Mine” to even something as visually extravagant as 2025's animated film “Arco.”

Joséphine Japy's debut feature “The Wonderers” is a perfect example of the form. Cinematic autofiction, it's her reflective account of her own experience growing up with a disabled sister whose actual diagnosis remained elusive for years. Bertille (the name of the character in the film and of Japy's real-life sister) developed an affliction where she would no longer speak or appear to understand the speech of others, and instead goes through life as if in deep thought all the time. Sometimes, she smiles and laughs to herself. Sometimes, she erupts in screams of agonizing pain. In one humorous moment in Japy's film, Bertille, played by the non-disabled actress Sarah Pachoud, wanders off while having lunch with her family at an outdoor restaurant, sits on a random male patron's lap, and steals some of his food, which she brings back to her own family's table.

That moment captures the triumph of Japy's film: Living with someone dealing with a severe disability is not always sturm und drang every moment. And “The Wonderers” is not out to make some statement about disability or living in a family with a disabled person — it's simply trying to capture the emotion of Japy's own experience, the highs and the lows. It's obviously difficult, and in many ways defining, but it doesn't have to be solely defining. Even as much as her sister's experience has affected the life of Marion (Angelina Woreth), the stand-in for Japy herself.

Some details of Japy's story are changed: She was already working as an actress and in her 20s when she finally found out Bertille's diagnosis. In “The Wonderers,” her stand-in, Marion, is a senior in high school. But the emotional truth of what living with that uncertainty is like is something Japy powerfully captures. For years, Bertille's family didn't know for sure what her condition was. Which meant that treatment was impossible, and that the eventual outcome of her condition was uncertain, too. Could it be that she had a condition that could result in her dropping dead at any moment? We think we live in a time of such advanced medicine that ascertaining the cause of any condition is possible, but some diagnoses do remain out of reach.

 










Not knowing whether her sister or their daughter will live or not, or what to expect from any moment of being around her, has put Marion and her parents in a kind of ongoing limbo. Marion doesn't really know how to live her own life. So much of her attention has been directed toward her sister that Marion decides to “embrace life” by embarking on a misguided romance with a man twice her age. Their parents, played by Pierre-Yves Cardinal and Mélanie Laurent, who gave Japy a role in her own directorial effort “Breathe,” have been affected similarly: Laurent's character doesn't allow herself to feel too much just in case she has to deal with a sudden loss at any moment, and Cardinal's character hasn't ever even told his work colleagues that he has a second daughter, thinking that knowledge of her disability might harm his career.

The first half of “The Wonderers” does feel a bit slack, like a sequence of scenes simply placed together rather than a narrative that flows. But by the end, this has become an affecting family drama, and one that taps powerfully into uncertainty as a way of life. It's very much a first film, and the execution behind a number of moments — including one when Bertille brings food back to the table at the restaurant, which is told through dialogue more than captured in the camera — doesn't match the strength of the ideas at hand. But if this is a “Cannes movie,” it is a Cannes movie par excellence, and hopefully one that's just the springboard for a rich career behind the camera for Japy.

 










“The Wonderers” world premiered in Special Screenings at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Seventeen was a very good year: sneaking out to dance all night at Hugs&Kisses, swigging peach schnapps from a jewel-encrusted flask at the Mercat Basement, being the first to arrive and the first to leave at Misty Nights. I lived in a relatively small city but I didn't know anyone, or anything, so the nights felt rich and intoxicating, and ever so slightly dangerous. The first time you go out, your tiny internal world suddenly feels massive.

Big city life, the fabulous and melancholy new album by Smerz, distils this feeling into a potent moonshine. It's romantic and itchily excitable music—a mixtape for the long train ride into the city and the delirious cab home, to hum at your retail job while you're waiting to clock off—and it strikes, immediately, as Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt's gesamtkunstwerk, a record that synthesizes the fright-night beats of 2018's Have fun with the contemporary classical experiments of Believer and Før og etter and the arch electroclash of last year's Allina.

On Big city life, all those paths twist together, creating dazzling formations: lush trip-hop torch songs, swaggering electro grooves, dance tracks that sound like Liquid Liquid blasting into an empty club after the lights come on. All this takes place in a romantasy version of Oslo where the streets are always rain-slicked and the clubs always smell like rare Baccarat Rouge 540—the perfect setting for modern fables about growing up, going out, and falling in love.

Like any good fairytale, Big city life begins with Smerz's version of an “I Want” song. The title track will strike as familiar to anyone who's woken up one day and realized they're running on autopilot: “I heard the trip was great ha ha ha,” Stoltenberg sings lifelessly. Day-to-day social niceties are anathema to Smerz; the only cure is “the freedom of a big city,” a wild, unscripted world where you're not just repeating “I heard that they broke up ha ha ha” over and over at the social function.

Stoltenberg and Motzfeldt's vocals frequently scan as droll, in the vein of other irony-drenched deadpan-pop duos like Coco & Clair Clair or New York, but there is a difference between Motzfeldt's anhedonia on the title track and, say, the sly encouragement with which Stoltenberg raps on “Roll the dice.” It's their take on “Dancing Queen,” written entirely in the second person in hopes of reaching the high-potential wallflower who needs it most: “When you're here, all dressed up, looking ready and nice/Feel the places, walk the streets, and take no advice.” This is Smerz's best party trick on Big city life: making music that reminds you of the club but is by no means club music. “Roll the dice”s is built around a slinky piano riff and what sounds like a chopped-up techno break, but moves with the affected looseness of Parker Posey dancing among the stacks in Party Girl. This is the zone of Big city life: the space between aspiration and reality.

Perhaps this is a fertile zone for Smerz because it's less heartbreaking to write about the time before you saw the world for what it really is, when every sparkly dress made you look like Bianca Jagger and every grimy Uber felt like your white horse. “I'm realizing lately/That I won't be like this again,” Motzfeldt sings on “A thousand lies,” each note putting a crack in her and Stoltenberg's omniscient perch. No wonder, then, that time is a fixation on Big city life, not in the way Smerz write about it, but in the way they stretch and compress it, frequently indulging in songs that feel too slow or too fast, like they're trying to fast-forward through the shitty party or make the summer nights last forever.

Sometimes, it's so effective that you have to wonder what kind of witchcraft they're working with. “You got time and I got money” is Sade's “Like a Tattoo” by way of Chairlift's lovedrunk “Show U Off” with the strings from “Bitter Sweet Symphony” thrown in for good measure. It feels like it stretches out for hours—but, wait, couldn't it go on just a little longer?—and projects a relationship from dizzy crush to first night together to eternity. It's timeless in small ways: “I like your shoes/I like these clean T-shirts on you,” sings Stoltenberg, like she's trying to immortalize the tiny details.

Perhaps, Smerz suggest, this is a fundamental reason to switch off Netflix and drag yourself to a club filled with hack DJs and creepy former Tinder matches: There's true love to be found under the strobes. “Baby, do you know how hearts collide?” asks Stoltenberg on “Dreams,” “Not in my daily moves from bed to bathroom.” Of course not—you have to go find it. And until then, Big city life's stories of seedy afters and glamorous nights out have your back.

Saint Etienne have announced announced a new album, and they're saying it's their final one. International, the British indie-pop trio's follow-up to The Night, is out September 5 via Heavenly. The new album is led by the single “Glad,” which was co-written and co-produced with the Chemical Brothers' Tom Rowlands and features Doves' Jez Williams on guitar. Watch the accompanying video, directed by Scrub, below.

“We asked Tom if he had any songs in progress that might suit Saint Etienne, and he sent a backing track that he'd been working on with Jez from Doves,” Saint Etienne vocalist Sarah Cracknell said in a statement. “We fell in love with it straight away, and the top line melody and words for ‘Glad' came easy.”

Pete Wiggs added, “The song is about taking pleasure in everyday things like nature and the outdoors when life is otherwise getting you down.”

Along with Tom Rowlands and Jez Williams, International has contributions from Confidence Man, Erol Alkan, Vince Clarke, Nick Heyward, Orbital's Paul Hartnoll, and Xenomania's Tim Powell.

Formed in London in 1990, by childhood friends Wiggs and Bob Stanley, Saint Etienne put out two singles that same year—“Kiss and Make Up” and their cover of Neil Young's “Only Love Can Break Your Heart”—before they added Cracknell for “Nothing Can Stop Us.” All three songs appeared on the band's 1991 debut, Foxbase Alpha, which kicked off a decade-defining run of albums, most notable among them 1993's sophomore effort So Tough, 1994's Tiger Bay, and 1998's Good Humor.

Wiggs, Stanley, and Cracknell became beloved for their blend of twee indie-pop and contemporary club sound, which balanced an alluringly cosmopolitan sheen with charm, wit, and approachability. After 2005's Tales From Turnpike House, Saint Etienne took an extended break from recording. Since their return, in 2012, with Words and Music by Saint Etienne, however, the band has consistently put out new records, among them Home Counties (2017) and I've Been Trying to Tell You (2021).

According to a press release, “The group aren't splitting up as such—they still remain the best of friends after 35 years recording together—but they don't feel like they want to go on forever and wanted to go out with a bang.”

Cole Pulice's music manifests a state of animated suspension. Over the past five years, the Oakland saxophonist and synthesist has learned to untether their instrument from the laws of physics, thanks to a fusion of real-time playing with extensive digital signal processing. They have compared their setup to being strapped into a mech suit—working their horn, or a breath-based Yamaha MIDI controller, with their mouth and hands, while both feet manipulate an array of effects pedals that stretch and warp the flow of sound. Pulice's breakthrough recording, 2023's If I Don't See You in the Future, I'll See You in the Pasture, was a 22-minute meditation in which everything and nothing seemed to happen at once. Chords smeared outward toward the horizon, the progression so gradual you forgot where you were in the sequence, while a mercurial cadenza soared over the top. It epitomized the artist's main organizing principle: the tension between movement and stasis.

Land's End is Pulice's first solo album since that Longform Editions release—last year they released the more lyrical Phantasy & Reality, their second collaboration with ambient composer Lynn Avery—and it represents a subtle but important progression in their work: While roughly half the 32-minute album builds upon the gentle amorphousness of their previous recordings, a three-part suite at the heart of the record brings electric guitar into the mix, yielding a more structured approach to songwriting.

The first song, “Fragments of a Slipstream Dream,” is a bridge, an extension of the gleaming arc that defines If I Don't See You in the Future. At the outset, Pulice methodically plays four descending notes on their horn, a staircase smeared by digital processing into a broad, frozen expanse. Blushing chords, Cocteau Twins-like in their gauzy radiance, add harmonic complexity. After a minute or so, Pulice begins playing tentative melodic figures on their horn, its timbre at first tinny and compressed, then full and breathy. There's a searching quality to their playing, which tends to move in fits and starts, traveling outward from the center, tracing tight circles as it goes, before looping back to the starting point. Yet tracing their horn's line of flight would be an impossible task; its movements are unpredictable, a scale model of boundlessness.

The mode abruptly shifts with “In a Hidden Nook Between Worlds”; the artist's habitual fog gives way to startling clarity as Pulice plucks out a clean-tone electric guitar melody. They were new to the instrument when they recorded the piece; the Stratocaster was loaned by a friend, and they've described their approach as being guided by “child's brain.” Curiously, I don't hear anything tentative about their playing—to the contrary, it sounds unusually deliberate and composed. Though tonally steeped in Americana, the song is the most jazz-like among the artist's work to date, saxophone and guitar moving in unison through the head of the piece before both instruments veer into abstraction in part II. Where Pulice's previous work was clearly indebted to technologically aided improvisation and post-processing, this is the first of their pieces you could imagine being notated on the stave; the guitar imposes a sense of order that extends to Pulice's horn.

Those clean lines blur again on the two closing tracks. “In This & Every Life” is an Ethio-jazz miniature that sets slippery saxophone runs against chiming bells and furtive guitar—an understated setup for “After the Rain,” one of the most ecstatic songs in Pulice's catalog. The song begins with guitar, this time dissolved into a soft tumult, like vapor rising from wet pavement; after a few exploratory runs, the saxophone eases its way into an unabashedly sweet melody. There's something effortless about the way it takes shape, almost like a rainbow appearing in the mist; singing in unison, Maria BC joins in, sounding equally effortless. Without really changing, the piece just keeps on growing, all nine minutes of it—guitar tumbling, saxophone branching, Maria BC's voice leading a virtual choir. Double rainbow becomes triple rainbow; prisms as far as the eye can see. In its expansiveness, the piece seeks kinship with Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders' Promises, Nala Sinephro's Space 1.8, and other touchstones of the ambient-jazz canon. But it retains the quality most crucial to Pulice's work: a guileless spirit of simplicity.

At the outset of Tune-Yards' vibrant new album Better Dreaming, Merrill Garbus asks in a hushed voice, “Ready?” It's the sound of a performer steeling herself, a private inhale before unleashing “Heartbreak,” a full-bodied groove full of joy and pain in equal measure. “Watch me survive another heartbreak,” Garbus intones sweetly, before belting her way through a rousing chorus and a middle eight of sheer vocal force. It's an apt introduction to a record that charts the tense relationship between vulnerability and strength.

Better Dreaming is the sixth studio album from Garbus, who first debuted as a solo artist with the lo-fi tape BiRd-BrAiNs and now collaborates as a duo with her partner, multi-instrumentalist and producer Nate Brenner. Armed with a ukulele, head-spinning percussion, and a liberally used loop pedal, Garbus built a reputation for visceral, biting alternative pop music built on the rhythms of Afro-pop and funk. Tune-Yards' most recent records, 2018's I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life and 2021's sketchy., both reckoned directly with Garbus's position as a white woman working in African musical traditions, and with whiteness more generally. Though ambitious, the songs lacked some of the hurricane dynamism of the earlier music, feeling instead restrained and careful, and sometimes weighed down by fear and guilt. On the breezier Better Dreaming, Garbus continues to examine our political landscape—and her own position in it—with her usual unflinching lyrical style, but this time it's been metabolized into something more outward-facing and hopeful: songs you can really dance to.

Garbus has previously spoken about the importance of singing, vocalizing, and humming as “a pathway through the hardest parts of our psyches.” Better Dreaming feels like her fullest expression of that idea; her voice sounds more full-bodied than ever as she urges you to “sing yourself into existence” at the cacophonous finale of album closer “Sanctuary.” Tune-Yards' instrumentation has famously been dense with ideas, loops, and samples, but here it's more often pulled taut, to allow Garbus's voice to rush like water to fill every crack. On the title track, her languishing cries are layered together in a digital ocean that washes over the listener. Later, on “See You There,” what begins as a plaintive folk song erupts into a scream that crackles with distortion and rage.

It's Tune-Yards' most accessible and melodic album to date. “Limelight,” the funk-driven lead single, was inspired by Garbus and Brenner dancing to George Clinton with their toddler—who also features on backing vocals—and it's no surprise to learn that it was conceived with family-friendly dance parties in mind. The music may lack some of the experimental bite that characterized early Tune-Yards releases like w h o k i l l, but it's still colored by Garbus's political intent: “Let go of the life you're living,” the sun-bright chorus urges: “Let yourself see how free you can be.”

Just as recordings of Garbus's giggling toddler go toe-to-toe with liberatory sentiment on “Limelight,” the whole record skirts the line between the intimate and the communal. Singing about her experience of parenthood and her hopes and fears for her child—and children generally—she also makes space for anthemic songs that build a sense of joyful coalition, such as the handclap-fueled “How Big Is the Rainbow.” These songs invite the listener in, whether in big dance-party moments or in the gentler Motown sway of “Get Through,” where Garbus delivers a lullaby for difficult times: “We don't know how we get through, but we do.” Where in the past she's sometimes been accused of being overly didactic, here Garbus is more emotionally vulnerable. There are no straightforward answers to how we get through, but in that “we” lies a powerful article of faith: that true strength lies in togetherness.

	Just when everyone thought Donald Trump's trade war and tariff frenzy had finally reached a period of weary — if expensive — attrition, the president made sure to remind everyone that his trade policy is just as erratic and arbitrary as ever. 


	Trump is now threatening to level steep tariffs on iPhones and the European Union.


	“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote early Friday morning on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” 


	In another post, the president added that he would be “recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.” 


	“Our discussions with them are going nowhere,” Trump added, claiming that “their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the U.S. of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable.”

	











	Financial markets did not respond kindly to the social media posts, with Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures all dropping on Friday morning. 


	The announcement signals to nations attempting to negotiate trade agreements with the administration — to extremely limited success — that the American president is not committed to respecting the 90-day pause on the enactment of steep, potentially devastating reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. Earlier this month, as talks with the U.S. seemed to reach a stalemate, the European Union drafted a list of over $100 billion worth of American imports that could be tariffed in retaliation for Trump's tax penalties.

	The Trump administration is still imposing a 51-percent effective tariff rate on Chinese imports, while China is responding with a 32-percent effective tariff rate on U.S. products. Those rates are down from a peak of 147 percent and 125 percent, respectively. While the lowering of import penalties brought some relief to American businesses, major retailers like Walmart and Target are warning that prices are still expected to increase for American consumers so long as tariffs remain in place. 

	











	While Apple designs its products in the United States, they are primarily manufactured abroad. In recent years, the Silicon Valley giant has attempted to move some of its production out of China and into friendlier nations like India. If produced in the United States, the price of iPhones could rise by thousands of dollars given both the hefty upfront cost of building factories, and supply chain issues related to its various components.

Harvard University has sued the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, and the Department of Justice in response to the Trump administration's attempt to block the Ivy League school from enrolling international students. 


	“This revocation is a blatant violation of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology' of its faculty and students,” the university wrote in a lawsuit filed Friday morning.


	The university requested that the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts declare the Trump administration's actions unconstitutional and unlawful, that the court enjoin the administration from enforcing the expulsion of international students, and compensate the university for fees and legal bills related to the litigation. Hours after filing the suit, the court granted a temporary restraining order blocking the administration from enforcing the directive.

	











	The Trump administration's move to block Harvard from accepting foreign applicants on student visas is the latest escalation in an ongoing feud between MAGA Republicans and America's most prestigious educational institutions. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the university on Thursday. “It is a privilege to enroll foreign students, and it is also a privilege to employ aliens on campus […] Harvard is prohibited from having any aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status for the 2025-2026 academic school year. This decertification also means that existing aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status must transfer to another university in order to maintain their nonimmigrant status.”

	In an open letter to students, faculty, and staff, Harvard President Alan M. Garber wrote that Noem's letter “continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body.” 

	











	Harvard and the Trump administration have been locked in a back and forth for months now. The Trump administration has been attacking Harvard for allowing pro-Palestinian activism on campus, and last month the Department of Education demanded that the school allow government oversight over its hiring practices, curriculum, and admissions practices in order to align them with the political priorities of the Trump government. The university refused. Earlier this month, the Department of Education froze all federal grant funding to the university over their refusal to bend to their demands. 


	Friday's lawsuit states that “there is no lawful justification for the government's unprecedented  revocation of Harvard's [Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)] certification, and the government has not offered any.”

Billy Joel is cancelling every concert on his itinerary, 17 shows in total booked at stadiums across North America and England, due to a recent diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH).


	“This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance,” reads a statement from Joel's team. “Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.”


	“I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience,” Joel says in a statement, “and thank you for understanding.”


	Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus is a brain disorder where excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain's ventricles. “[It] can affect several brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more,” reads an explainer on the Cleveland Clinic's website. “The symptoms of NPH look very much like those of dementia, but NPH is sometimes reversible.”

	











	Joel's last concert took place on Feb. 22 at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut. Near the end of the show, he fell flat on his back after throwing his microphone stand to a crew member. But he quickly stood up and finished the set.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	One month later, Joel announced that he was taking a four-month break from the road due to a “medical condition” that required surgery and physical therapy. He planned on returning to the stage on July 5 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “While I regret postponing any shows, my health must come first,” he told fans in a statement. “I look forward to getting back on stage and sharing the joy of live music with our amazing fans. Thank you for your understanding.”


	It's unclear if his medical issues at the time were related to Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus. The disorder affects roughly 0.2 percent of people in their seventies and causes gait issues, bladder control issues, and cognitive difficulties. It's most commonly addressed with a surgery where a device known as a shunt is implanted to remove the excess fluids.

	“NPH is unusual among dementia-like conditions because it's often reversible,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. “However, the chances of reversing this condition are highest with early diagnosis and fast treatment. Delays in diagnosis and treatment make it more likely that the damage to your brain from the pressure will be permanent, severe or both.”


	Joel, 76, wrapped up his decade-long residency at Madison Square Garden in July 2024. In the months that followed, he continued to tour all across America and England, playing roughly twice a month. He hasn't released an album of new pop songs since 1993's River of Dreams, though in February 2024, he teamed up with songwriter/producer Freddy Wexler on the single “Turn the Lights Back On.” He premiered the track at the Grammys that month and performed it live a handful of times, but it left his set in June and never reappeared.

Miley Cyrus delivered a rush of emotion to Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday night, performing her potent single “More to Lose.”


	Appearing with a live band elevated by violins, the Grammy winner was illuminated by spotlights as she took the stage in a dark, hooded coat, echoing the visuals of the track's music video released earlier this month. The live rendition on the late night stage saw Cyrus bring the full force of the track's poignant chorus as she sang, “And you say it, but I wish it wasn't true/I knew someday that one would have to choose/I just thought we had more to lose.”

A post shared by Jimmy Kimmel Live (@jimmykimmellive)


	“On a song like ‘More to Lose,' I try to keep it a singular take. I add my harmonies, ad-libs at the end, but it's really a song that's more of a story and I never want that to be interrupted or overthought or chasing perfection,” Cyrus previously said in an interview posted to her Instagram. “I never wanted ‘More to Lose' to feel perfect, I wanted it to sound meaningful and emotional.”

Something Beautiful will be accompanied by a visual album, which is set to have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 6. A synopsis of the project, directed by Cyrus with Jacob Bixenman and Brendan Walter, details it as “a unique visual experience… including 13 original songs from the upcoming album. A one-of-a-kind pop opera from the mind of Miley Cyrus.”

	President Donald Trump and Republicans' “big, beautiful,” tax bill already promises to leave millions of Americans without access to Medicaid and food assistance programs. The GOP is using Congress' massive budget reconciliation bill to slash taxes on the wealthy and enact a host of right-wing policy dreams, and among them is the fulfillment of their more than decade-long fixation on gutting the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 


	Republicans plan to allow for the expiration of subsidies that help people afford individual health insurance plans, a move that would lead to a steep rise in prices for Americans who purchase coverage through the ACA marketplace. 


	The version of the reconciliation bill passed Thursday by the House of Representatives would also prohibit passive re-enrollment for ACA plan users who receive financial assistance; increase penalties for incorrect reporting of income; place further restrictions on enrollment periods; and create new bureaucratic hurdles to obtaining premium tax credits, in ways that experts say will cause many to forgo or lose coverage.

	











	In addition to the bill's efforts to force millions off Medicaid and trim payments to health care providers for patients on the safety-net program, which provides health insurance to low-income and disabled Americans, the legislation would slash states' funding for Medicaid if they allow undocumented migrants or “lawfully present” individuals (mostly children) to enroll in ACA plans. 


	The sum total of Republicans' health care policies — including their changes to Medicaid and the ACA, and the expiration of expanded premium subsidies — are expected to result in roughly 14 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage. In a letter to House leadership, 18 state-level ACA marketplaces warned of the potential devastation. 


	“The Americans who depend on the marketplaces include working parents, small business owners, farmers, gig workers, early retirees, and lower and middle-class individuals of all ages, political views, and backgrounds who drive our local economies and make both our rural and urban communities thrive,” they wrote. “These proposals, in total, will drastically diminish the progress on health coverage that the United States has made in the last decade via marketplaces. Only the sickest patients may remain in the marketplaces, skyrocketing costs for everyone.”

	“Millions of Americans will lose their health coverage, local hospital systems will face unprecedented financial strain, state operational costs will spike in order to implement burdensome new federal rules, and all of this is likely to result in insurance carriers pulling out of local insurance markets. Some states may even be forced to walk away from state-based marketplaces entirely,” they warned. 


	“This bill's intent is to drown Americans in paperwork in order to make it harder to get on and stay on coverage,” Anthony Wright, Executive Director at Families USA, told Rolling Stone. 


	“Right now, if you are apply, if you are in the exchange — whether it's DC Health Link, or Covered California, or New York State of Health, or healthcare.gov — and you are applying for coverage with a tax credit, right now most of those systems are based on electronic verification,” Wright says, explaining that state marketplaces have access to federal systems so they can — “not automatically, but pretty seamlessly” — verify a person's eligibility. 


	The current Republican bill would eliminate provisional eligibility for advanced premium tax credits, and deny the tax credits to consumers while they await a determination. It would also prohibit “passive re-enrollment” for individuals who've purchased ACA plans with advanced premium tax credits. The new system would require plan-holders to re-submit their verification during the enrollment period. If not, they would be re-enrolled in a plan without a tax credit, which would in effect put them on the hook for the full price of their premium, which they likely cannot afford given their income status qualified them for a tax credit. According to the Commonwealth Fund, 93 percent of ACA marketplace enrollees use an advanced premium tax credit to pay for their plans.

	While some of the changes would result in direct coverage denials, the majority of lost coverage would likely be due to individuals opting out of the system due to the much higher premium costs they'd be expected to absorb, as well as the confusing, time-consuming, and nonsensical red tape Republicans are deliberately placing on them.


	“They're actually taking us back to the Stone Age of what it means to sign up for coverage in terms of paperwork and bureaucracy,” says Wright, adding that there are electronic systems to make the process “much easier, and we have been doing it for the last 15 years.”

	Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the health research organization KFF, tells Rolling Stone that the tax bill is “not [a] repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but it, in many ways, has the same effect of dramatically increasing the number of people without health insurance.” 


	After the House passed the reconciliation bill Thursday, Levitt wrote on X that “it would represent the biggest rollback in federal support for health care ever.”

Bono called for an end to the war between Israel and Hamas at 2025 Ivor Novello Awards last night. 


	During the awards ceremony, held at London's Grosvenor House, U2 became the first Irish act to receive Fellowship of the Ivors Academy. Bono took the opportunity to criticize Hamas and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and to encourage peace. 


	The rock band performed their 1983 song “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” which is about the 1972 massacre during which the British army shot at unarmed protestors and ultimately killed 14 people. “I used to introduce this next song by saying it was not a rebel song,” Bono noted, via NME. “It was because believing in the possibilities of peace was then, and is now, a rebellious act; and some would say a ridiculous one.”


	“To believe peace was attainable between your country and ours, between our country and itself was a ridiculous idea because peace creates possibilities in the most intractable situations, and Lord knows there's a few of them out there right now,” he said. “Hamas release the hostages. Stop the war. Israel be released from Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right fundamentalists that twist your sacred texts. All of you protect our aid workers, they are the best of us.”

During these military exercises in 1952, various UFO sightings were recorded... but what did those at sea really see? 

In 1952, just seven years after Victory in Europe Day, NATO forces, comprised of the twelve founding members along with Greece and Turkey, which joined that year, reported observing a series of mysterious flying objects during peacetime military exercises.

These UFO sightings were becoming increasingly common in the United States, with newspaper headlines featuring stories from individuals who claimed to have spotted an alien vessel flying above their backyards.

Exercise Mainbrace was the name given to the first set of peacetime military preparations to take place by NATO members since the founding of the organization. The exercises included over 80,000 men and 200 ships, and lasted from September 14 to September 25. More than four sightings were recorded by the US non-profit research organization into UFO sightings, the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), during Exercise Membrance, with news stories from the time detailing that many of the witnesses assumed the objects to be weather balloons. 

On one occasion, an object that a Danish crew described later to investigators as triangular was spotted flying overhead at incredible speed. This first sighting occurred on September 13, just as the men involved were getting into position to begin the 12 days of military exercises. 

Reports later published by NICAP from the time also indicate that “the object emitted a bluish glow.” According to Live Science, the sighting was made from the Danish destroyer ship, Willemoes, one of 200 ships that formed part of the military exercises. The Lieutenant of the Willemoes estimated that the object was flying around 900 miles per hour. 

Another sighting came on September 19 after a British fighter pilot had carried out their planned operation over the North Sea and was on the return to the Topcliffe airfield, in Yorkshire. Whether it was an optical illusion caused by the sun's reflections, soldiers in the group reported seeing a silver flying object above the Meteor jet piloted by one of their own. Though the flying heights were different, the trajectories matched up.

The report detailing the event said it occurred around 11:00 A.M, and that as the jet was set to make its landing, the object was “swaying back and forth like a pendulum."" 

“Lieutenant John W. Kilburn and other observers on the ground said that when the Meteor began circling, the UFO stopped,” wrote Richard Hall, a self-proclaimed Ufologist, and researchers for NICAP when the sightings took place. Witnesses described the object as “disk-shapped,” a more traditional form for UFO sightings than the triangular object reported by the Danish crew. The crew could not track the object, with Hall writing that after mirroring the pilot's movements, “the disk suddenly took off westward at high speed, changed course, and disappeared to the southeast."" 

The next day, a sighting was reported by US military members onboard the USS Franklin D. Rosevelet aircraft carrier. These members captured an image of the UFO, they say, which was described as “silvery” and “spherical.” However, these photos were not made public, writes Hall, while adding that those who did see them described them as “excellent” and that ""judging by the size of the object in each successive photo, one could see that it was moving rapidly.” The crew and other military leaders ruled out the possibility of the object being a weather balloon. 

At least three more sightings would be made during the remainder of Exercise Mainbrace. In the years that followed, what was seen was attributed to the hype of UFO sightings that had just begun to take off.

We called this guy, he went by Mr. Billy, and he told us his story. I was nearly in tears by the end. I believed every word he said like I was talking to my grandpa. It was like having grandpa recount a story of something that happened to him in his life and how he was affected by it.

(UFO Podcaster/Researcher CJ Dearinger on the Alien Girl 111 podcast.)

Exploring the intriguing realm of Ufology, we encounter a fascinating tapestry of individuals who have dedicated their lives to unraveling the mysteries of unidentified flying objects and extraterrestrial encounters. Among these luminaries, female leaders stand out for their pioneering contributions and unwavering commitment to the pursuit of truth. In this article, we delve into the remarkable stories of three such trailblazers whose insights and research have left an indelible mark on the field of ufology. 

Deb, a counselor who operates anonymously within the UFO community due to professional concerns, embarked on her journey into researching Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) approximately two years ago. Since then, she has become a pivotal figure within the field. Joining the podcast Calling All Beings as a co-host marked a significant milestone in her exploration of the UFO phenomenon. Through this platform, Deb has conducted numerous insightful interviews with individuals who have encountered UAPs or are actively involved in addressing the UAP issue. Her involvement extends beyond podcasting; she has lent her expertise to initiatives such as the UAP Medical Coalition and Deb's Data Dojo. 

Not content with merely exploring the mysteries of the cosmos, Deb is also committed to fostering organization within the UFO community. To this end, she created UFO Connector, a platform aimed at facilitating the organization of UAP-related data. Looking ahead, Deb's ambitions include the completion of a forthcoming book, currently in progress, and the development of Anomalous Debates alongside Courtney Marchesani. Deb's multifaceted contributions underscore her status as a prominent figure within the realm of ufology, as she continues to push the boundaries of knowledge and understanding in pursuit of the truth.

Fringe, a retired 54-year-old with a unique past, spent nearly two decades as a police officer and investigator in a bustling metropolitan department alongside her husband. Despite a career filled with countless investigations and courtroom appearances, her life took a mysterious turn as she grappled with otherworldly encounters. From lucid dreams and out-of-body experiences to shadow beings and encounters with Hat Man, her journey intertwined with the enigmatic world of the paranormal.

Growing up amid a backdrop of familial complexities and abusive environments, Fringe's experiences with ""aliens"" began to unfold at a tender age, continuing into adulthood with a series of unsettling encounters and experiments. Despite her initial belief in benevolent extraterrestrial beings, Fringe's investigations and personal experiences led her to a chilling realization: the entities she encountered were part of a darker agenda, involving spiritual warfare and manipulation. Through introspection and consultation with fellow abductees, Fringe pieced together a narrative of deception and control, shedding light on a phenomenon shrouded in secrecy. Though her journey has been fraught with challenges, Fringe remains resolute in her quest for understanding, sharing her story to illuminate the shadows of the unknown. Learn more about Fringe on her website.

CJ Dearinger is the co-host of the All Things Unexplained podcast. She was first brought on to be a bit of a skeptic of the paranormal world, but everything changed for her when she talked to former law enforcement officer Mr. Billy for the show. Mr. Billy witnessed one of the most documented UFO encounters in history, as over a dozen law enforcement officials observed and tracked a UFO over rural Flora, Mississippi. For CJ, he reminded her of her grandpa. When asked about her transition from skeptical CJ to ‘The Unexplained CJ' on the Alien Girl 111 podcast, CJ had this to say:

We called this guy, he went by Mr. Billy, and he told us his story. I was nearly in tears by the end. I believed every word he said like I was talking to my grandpa. It was like having grandpa recount a story of something that happened to him in his life and how he was affected by it. At first, nobody believed him, they all made him out to be crazy. He was seeing this craft in the sky, but then one night several other officers came to his door and asked him to get his camera because they saw the craft in the sky. The next day, Mr. Billy received a call from Dr. J. Allen Hynek about his experience.

Since Mr. Billy's story, CJ has talked to guests such as Erik Bard, Thomas Winterton, and Brandon Fugal from Skinwalker Ranch; Andrew Bustamante and Paul Beban from Beyond Skinwalker Ranch; best-selling author Patricia Cornwell; Nick Pope from Ancient Aliens; and physicist Avi Loeb, among many others. You can listen to a new episode of All Things Unexplained featuring UFO pioneer CJ Dearinger every Monday wherever you podcast. In addition, CJ is researching information for an upcoming book on the UFO phenomenon. The groundbreaking nonfiction volume could connect the dots between many aspects and factions in the realm of UFOs.

In conclusion, the stories of Fringe, Deb, and CJ offer a multifaceted glimpse into the diverse landscape of Ufology and the enigmatic experiences that define it. From Fringe's harrowing encounters with shadow beings to Deb's courageous efforts to uncover UAP truths while maintaining anonymity, and CJ's pioneering qualitative research into the UFO phenomenon, these women exemplify resilience, curiosity, and a relentless pursuit of truth in the face of the unknown. As leaders in their respective fields, they inspire others to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos, reminding us that the quest for understanding knows no bounds. Through their stories, we are encouraged to challenge conventional wisdom, explore new frontiers, and embrace the complexities of the universe with open minds and steadfast determination.","{'href': 'https://www.meer.com', 'title': 'meer.com'}","other"

Come one, come all! The Paranormal Cirque is comin' back to town. This is an experience unlike any other, where horror and gymnastic and circus artistry collide in a supernatural spectacle!

Brought to life by Cirque Italia, The Paranormal Cirque previously visited the Chippewa Valley back in the fall of 2023, where hundreds of attendees marveled at the theatrics and stunts performed under the 'Clown Castle' circus tent at the Oakwood Mall lot.

The troupe is home to around 40 performers and crew members from across the country, each with their own unique skillset, contributing to the magic of the traveling production.

“I'd describe it as a thrilling blend of circus artistry, horror, and live entertainment,” says Yury Belaus, a gymnast and key performer with the Paranormal Cirque crew. “It's an immersive journey filled with spine-chilling acts, captivating performances, and an eerie atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat.”

This season will introduce new acts, such as a daring performance atop the ""tallest unicycle anyone has ever seen,"" Yury said. “This show is filled with spooky and surprising moments,” they continued. “From unexpected scares that leap out from the shadows to illusions that defy explanation, each act is designed to keep the viewers on their toes.”





Paranormal Cirque will roll back into town for several shows:

Due to the nature of the Paranormal Cirque performance, the show is intended for 18-plus audiences only. Anyone ages 17 and younger must be accompanied by an adult or parent. Tickets cost $15-$65, depending on age and proximity to stage.

Tickets and more event details on the Eau Claire show dates are available online at paranormalcirque.com.

Humming along since 2002, Volume One is a magazine, an
            event & video production company, & a retail store based in Eau Claire, WI.

Origins

In April, astronomers said they had detected a possible signature of life on the exoplanet K2-18b. Now, three independent analyses discount the evidence.

In April, a team of astronomers announced that they might — just might — have found signs of life on a planet over 120 light-years from Earth. The mere possibility of extraterrestrial life was enough to attract attention worldwide. It also attracted intense scrutiny from other astronomers.

Over the past month, researchers have independently analyzed the data, which suggested that the planet, called K2-18b, has a molecule in its atmosphere that could have been created by living organisms. Three different analyses have all reached the same conclusion: They see no compelling evidence for life on K2-18b.

“The claim just absolutely vanishes,” said Luis Welbanks, an astronomer at Arizona State University and an author of one of the studies.

The debate has less to do with the existence of alien life than with the challenge of observing distant planets. We can see a nearby planet like Jupiter because it reflects enough sunlight to become visible to the naked eye. But a planet like K2-18b is so far away that it becomes invisible not just to the naked eye but to conventional telescopes.

Astronomers have devised a series of increasingly sophisticated tricks to glean information about distant planets. They can measure the wobble of stars and the gravity of planets orbiting them. In 2010, researchers caught a glimpse of GJ 1214b, a planet 48 light-years away, as it passed in front of the star it orbits. When the star's light shined through the planet's atmosphere, certain wavelengths were absorbed indicating that GJ 1214b might have an atmosphere rich in water vapor.

In 2022, astronomers began using a powerful new tool to peer at distant planets this way. They pointed the James Webb Space Telescope at faraway solar systems and began detecting exquisitely faint patterns in starlight, clues to the complexity of exoplanet atmospheres.

Supernatural follows Sam and Dean Winchester, two brothers with plenty of unresolved trauma, traveling around the country, saving people, and hunting things. Over fifteen years, the Winchesters overcame numerous obstacles, evolving and growing. Audiences saw many sides to the characters, and the actors delivered numerous excellent performances.

Jared Padalecki stars as Sam Winchester, the younger and more learned of the brothers. Padalecki gave great depth to Sam and showed off his versatility, playing beautiful, tragic scenes as brilliantly as Sam's more comedic ones. Several moments are absolutely flawless in execution.

 Supernatural has always balanced the dark and violent nature of monster hunting with humor. ""Tall Tales"" is often cited as one of the funniest episodes of the series. When the Winchester boys are investigating a series of strange occurrences, things get personal. The brothers are at each other's throats, and they call Bobby Singer to help them with the case.

""Tall Tales""

February 15, 2007

9.1/10

When Crowley died in Supernatural Season 12, Mark Sheppard left the series on not-so-great terms with one or more of the executives.

Sam and Dean recount the events leading up to the present, and they both have their own version of what happened. One of the best Sam moments comes in Dean's version. When Sam interrupts Dean's flirting with a grad student, Dean describes Sam snootily, saying, ""We don't have any time for any of your blah blah blah blah."" The laughs don't stop there, either, like when Dean depicts Sam hugging a student and telling him that he's ""too precious for this world.""

Sam and Dean head to the movies, where they check out the haunting of a film set. In Supernatural's first meta-episode, the Winchester brothers join a studio tour to get on the lot. The boys ride a trolley as their guide narrates the sights.

When they approach the set of Stars Hollow, Sam becomes visibly uncomfortable. The tour guide mentions it's the set for Gilmore Girls, and at the notion of maybe getting to see one of the show's stars, Sam immediately jumps off the trolley and heads in the opposite direction. The brief, awkward moment was played perfectly by Jared Padalecki, creating yet another fantastic moment for Sam.

 ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" is about a cursed object. A rare and magical rabbit's foot gives its possessor fantastic luck, but once someone loses the foot, their luck turns deadly. Initially, Sam has great luck, winning $15,000 in lotto scratchers and free meals for a year, but when Bela picks his pocket, Sam becomes a clumsy safety hazard.

9.2/10

Supernatural introduced several characters in memorable ways that revealed to the audience who they truly are in a single scene. 

Some of Sam's most hilarious and iconic moments from Supernatural are in ""Bad Day at Black Rock."" As Dean talks to Bobby about Bela, Sam steps in gum. In an effort to get the gum off his shoe, he began scraping it against an open drain in the street. His shoe comes off and falls into the sewer. When Dean turns around, Sam is hunched over, defeated, and pouting. Jared Paddalecki delivers comedy gold when he says, ""I lost my shoe.""

 After Gordon is locked up for killing a few psychics and trying to kill Sam, he breaks out of prison. A man on a mission, he tracks down Sam and Dean with Kubrick, landing himself smack-dab in the middle of a vampire hunt. Gordon gets turned into a bloodsucker, but insists on killing Sam before Kubrick can put Gordon down.

Sam and Dean knowingly walk into Gordon's trap to save an innocent woman, and Sam gets separated from Dean and the hostage. Gordon tries to kill Sam, but Sam, being the skilled hunter he is, manages to get the upper hand on Gordon, wrapping razor wire around his neck. Sam brutally and justifiably decapitates Gordon in an impressive show of strength.

 Audiences get to see a darker side of Sam in season three's ""Mystery Spot."" Sam gets stuck in a time loop where, every day, he has to watch Dean die. After one of the days, Sam thinks he's broken the loop, but he is still unable to prevent Dean's inevitable demise. Sam becomes a badass hunter in the weeks and months that follow, hunting down the trickster with a steely resolve.

9.5/10

The episode featured plenty of comedic moments with Dean dying in every way imaginable, but seeing the dark and relentless hunter that Sam became was new for the character. He didn't even flinch when sewing up his wounds. In the montage, through a series of voicemails from Bobby, it becomes clear that Sam was an incredibly efficient solo hunter. Fueled by anger and determination, viewers got a glimpse at the scary side of Sam.

 In the epic season five finale, Sam accepts Lucifer, kicking off the apocalypse. The plan was for Sam to overpower Lucifer and jump back into the cage from which he came, but things didn't go to plan. In one last-ditch effort to save the world, Dean crashes Lucifer and Michael's fight. Castiel shows up and sets Michael on fire, buying Dean a little time to try to reach Sam.

In its 15-season run, Supernatural introduced some very bizarre concepts and storylines some of which didn't work for the fans.

As Lucifer beat the daylight out of Dean against the Impala, he caught a glimpse of the toy soldier he'd shoved in the ashtray. At that moment, Sam was flooded with memories of his family, of Dean, and was able to take control of his body long enough to throw Michael and himself into the cage, averting the end of the world. It was a perfect episode of Supernatural, with some of Sam's best scenes.

Sam and Dean head to Indiana to investigate an alien abduction. Per Dean's request, Sam is no longer concealing his apathy, which leads to some hysterically inappropriate reactions from Sam. When Dean looks at the abduction site, a bright white light starts to follow him. Dean starts shouting into the phone as he's chased by the ""aliens.""

Sam humorously remains indifferent to his brother's peril, making jokes about ""close encounters"" and ordering another beer while Dean runs for his life. After Dean is taken, Sam continues the case, but takes a break to have sex with a hippie chick. ""Clap Your Hands If You Believe"" is peak Soulless Sam, and Jared Padalecki's comedy timing is first-rate.

One of Supernatural's best episodes is, without a doubt, ""The French Mistake."" Sam and Dean are sent to an alternate reality where they're actors who only play monster hunters on TV. The meta-episode is pretty perfect from start to finish, but the highlight is Sam and Dean trying to act on camera.

From body language to facial expressions to line readings, Jared Padalecki delivered a comedically genius performance, creating one of the best moments for Sam Winchester. During Dean's lines, Sam stands behind his brother, having forgotten how to stand casually. When it's his turn to speak, he says his line directly to the ceiling. Then, Sam uses his arms, awkwardly outstretched, to visualize the concept of a lock having a key. It's pure gold.

In season eight of Supernatural, Sam performs a series of trials to close the gates of Hell. The last task is to cure a demon. Sam and Dean kidnap Crowley to perform a special exorcism that involves injecting the demon with purified blood. Sam confesses his sins so his blood will be pure for the ritual.

9.3/10

Supernatural is a beloved and long-running series that, unfortunately, still has more than a few problematic episodes that aren't easy to rewatch.

The entire sequence of Sam and Crowley is incredible, but the moment Sam tells Dean what he has confessed is heartbreaking and flawless. Sam's greatest regret is letting down his big brother. With tears in his eyes, the audience can hear the pain and guilt in his voice when he tells Dean what it feels like that Dean turned to Castiel and Benny, because Dean felt he couldn't count on Sam.

Since the ""Pilot"" episode of Supernatural, Sam and his father have had a contentious relationship. Their final moments before John Winchester died in the season three premiere were no different. Sam challenged John and didn't play the dutiful son, like his brother. John only had a few moments to say goodbye to his sons before Azazel collected his soul, and Sam never got to say goodbye.

In the 300th episode, Dean uses a wish-granting pearl to give him his heart's desire. Dean and Sam think it will lock Michael away, but instead, it pulls John from the past. John gets to tell his boys how much he loved them, and Sam finally gets closure and can let go of the guilt he'd carried around for years.

Dean Winchester is one of Supernatural's most beloved characters, and there are more than a few reasons that prove why.

Transformers' Rodimus Prime was a controversial G1 character, but a more organic development could have seen him successfully replace Optimus Prime.

For many fans, Ronald D. Moore's Battlestar Galactica finale was a full-circle culmination of everything Battlestar Galactica bravely explored.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Jensen Ackles Thinks The Scariest Supernatural Episode Is One With No Monsters At All","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-jensen-ackles-scariest-episode-benders-factoid/","Fri, 23 May 2025 12:15:00 GMT","

When most fans think of the scariest Supernatural episode, they probably picture terrifying demons, shape-shifting wendigos, or vengeful spirits lurking in the shadows. After all, the long-running CW series built its legacy on gory creature effects and nightmarish folklore. But for Jensen Ackles, who played Dean Winchester across all 15 seasons, the most disturbing episode had nothing to do with monsters at all. It's not the creatures that haunted him - it's the humans. And that might just make it even scarier.

Ackles' choice for the scariest Supernatural episode is a chilling detour from the series' usual supernatural formula. Found in season 1, episode 15, “The Benders” marks a rare moment when the horror didn't come from beyond the grave or another dimension. Instead, it came from people. Real, flesh-and-blood people doing horrifying things. The episode left a lasting impression on Ackles, and it still sticks out in the minds of fans who remember just how grounded - and unsettling - it was. Digging into why this episode freaked him out so much reveals what made “The Benders” so unique, and how it's part of a much larger pattern across the show's history.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly (available via YouTube), Jensen Ackles opened up about the episode of Supernatural that scared him the most - and surprisingly, it wasn't about ghosts, demons, or anything supernatural at all. Ackles singled out “The Benders” as the scariest Supernatural episode, explaining that it's the realism that truly got under his skin. “The reason that always kind of stuck with me is…because it wasn't a monster,” he said, “it was real people as humans doing very bad things.”

There's no creature to blame, just cruelty and depravity in its purest human form.

“The Benders,” which aired during Supernatural season 1, follows Sam and Dean as they investigate a case in Minnesota involving mysterious disappearances. However, instead of finding a supernatural creature behind it all, they uncover a horrifying truth: a backwoods family abducting people for sport. These villains - the Benders- are deeply unsettling because they operate without magic or monsters. They're a twisted, murderous family who trap, hunt, and kill strangers for fun, in scenes that evoke movies like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Deliverance. There's no creature to blame, just cruelty and depravity in its purest human form.

Dean ends up captured, held in a cage like the Benders' other victims. Meanwhile, Sam teams up with a local sheriff's deputy, Kathleen, whose brother was one of the Benders' earlier victims. What follows is a tense, gripping rescue mission, with minimal reliance on the supernatural. It's horror stripped to its rawest: humans preying on humans. There are no spells to reverse the situation, no demon blades to drive into evil entities - just survival instincts, grit, and the terrifying unpredictability of human nature.

Jensen Ackles' pick for the scariest Supernatural episode is revealing. It underscores how even in a show dominated by the paranormal, some of its most unforgettable moments came from very real threats. “The Benders” stands out because it hits differently - it's not fantasy horror, it's something that could, in theory, actually happen. And that, as Ackles points out, is exactly what makes it so disturbing.

While Supernatural is filled with all kinds of otherworldly nightmares, “The Benders” wasn't the only time the show dipped into horror grounded in humanity. In fact, some of the scariest Supernatural episodes over the years featured villains with no powers, no spells, and no demonic affiliations - just regular people capable of terrifying acts. These human antagonists reminded viewers that evil doesn't always wear a monstrous face.

Take, for instance, the chilling doctor in “Time Is On My Side” from season 3. In this episode, Dean and Sam investigate a case at a medical facility where a doctor is secretly performing illegal surgeries and keeping body parts from victims. There's a scientific edge to the horror, but the core of it is a human being playing god with people's lives. It's not ghosts that keep you up after this one - it's the cold calculation of someone who believes their twisted experiments are justified.

Another unnerving example comes from “Malleus Maleficarum” in season 3, which introduces a coven of witches. While the witches technically use magic, the real horror isn't their spells - it's how casually they turn on one another and sacrifice innocent lives for petty revenge and social climbing. Their magic amplifies their dark intentions, but the root of the terror is very human: jealousy, betrayal, and a complete lack of empathy.

 Then there's “Family Remains” from season 4, a deeply uncomfortable episode that, like “The Benders,” seems to be going the classic ghost route - until it isn't. Dean and Sam investigate a haunting in a creepy old house, but by the end, it's revealed that the real threat is a feral, inbred human girl living in the walls. The reveal is stomach-churning and drives home the point once again: the scariest Supernatural episode isn't necessarily the one with the biggest monster, it's the one with the most horrifying humanity.

Even the Men of Letters storyline, while full of supernatural elements, has its roots in human villainy. The secretive organization made morally gray decisions that often blurred the line between good and evil. From memory wipes to brutal experiments, the Men of Letters were a reminder that even those fighting on the side of ""order"" can be deeply unethical.

Throughout Supernatural, creators returned again and again to the idea that evil isn't limited to the paranormal. Sometimes, it's born out of trauma, power, obsession, or sheer psychopathy. And while monster-of-the-week episodes brought plenty of fun, it's the human villains - like the Benders - that linger in the background long after the credits roll. For many fans, and clearly for Ackles too, the scariest Supernatural episode is the one that doesn't let them hide behind the safety net of fantasy.

It's Sam who gets kidnapped, and Dean who teams up with the sheriff. 

Star Trek: Picard season 3 showrunner Terry Matalas recalls what it was like losing season 1 and 2's actors ot make way for the Next Generation cast.

If you liked The Witcher, there's an even better fantasy adaptation that can be found on Netflix, and it's much more aligned with its source material.

Timothy Olyphant was a part of an excellent Netflix horror-comedy TV show that ended after three seasons, though it deserved much more time.

Two of the best Sopranos represented a major event in the lead-up to the finale, and it allowed James Gandolfini to take on another role.

Charlie Hunnam has a favorite Sons of Anarchy episode, and it's not only a key episode in Jax's story but also a very heartbreaking one.

Goatboy here with an armylist from the new Thousand Sons codex, that's all vehicles, no Battleline!.

I think there is a very strong vehicle build in here using the new Robots, some Daemon Engines, a mixture of Thousand Sons Monsters, and good ole Psychic Leaders.  This might be a good list for any kind of Team event where having an option that can floor things on an open field would be a powerful thing to have.  Plus you wouldn't have to paint a ton of Rubricae.

The armylist will be using the Warpforged Cabal Detachment which is the vehicle-focused option for the Thousand Sons.  The rule for the detachment gives the ability to reroll either a hit, wound, or damage roll.  If you happen to be within 6” of a Thousand Sons Psyker you get to reroll all of those per vehicle within range of their Psychic Daddy. 

Also, your Deadly Demises are on a 5+ if you are within 6” of the Psyker so be ready to lose your Sorcerer if too many tanks explode.  You also get some sweet Enhancements that do things like give your infantry-based Psychic Characters Lone Operative if they are within 3” of a Vehicle and even better bonuses to your rituals.

As you can tell from the right up above will most likely see a ton of robots, some characters, a few tanks, and maybe a Mutalith or two.  Let's get to brewing based off of the points given to use early by GW.  Now these might change again before they become official and bonafide.

Yup there is no Battleline for the army.  The Sorcerer in Terminator armor is there to Deep Strike in and throw a Psychic hit on something if needed to activate some of the armies powers.  Right now it will have a ton of attacks, get a good deal of rerolls, and just be a brutal thing to try and get too.

The three smaller units of Robots is there to get in the way and hopefully let your army do the good work of creating a Castle of crap that is murdering you downfield.  The Tzaangor parts are to cover objectives, help give the Daemon Prince Lone Operative, and just give you some action play as needed.  Happy Gaming!

ALL IS DUST!

Jamie Foxx attended the 2025 Golden Globe Awards as a nominee for his Netflix comedy special, ""Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was . . . ""

Jamie Foxx is addressing conspiracy theories that Sean ""Diddy"" Combs played a role in his 2023 hospitalization.

In a roundtable discussion with several other comedy stars for The Hollywood Reporter, Foxx spoke about recovering after his nearly fatal stroke. He recalled that while he was in the hospital, he was ""heavily sedated"" and on multiple painkillers, and in his altered state he got on his phone to see what people were saying about his then-mysterious condition.

""So, they ‘Men in Black'-ed me, and I'm f---ed up, and this isn't funny, but I snuck in my phone because I didn't know what the outside world was saying, and I couldn't get my mind around the fact that I had a stroke,"" Foxx said. ""I'm in f---ing perfect shape. [I see things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me.' No, Puffy didn't try to kill me.""

At the time, an unfounded rumor was that Combs had attempted to silence Foxx from sharing any details he might have about the alleged crimes he would go on to be charged with – in September 2024, Combs was arrested on racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking charges. He's currently on trial.

Foxx and Combs had been friends ahead of Combs' legal troubles. Foxx also joked about rumors that he'd tried to hurt him in his December comedy special. There, he said, ""The Internet said Puffy was trying to kill me, that's what the Internet was saying. I know what you thinking, ‘Diddy?' Hell no, I left them parties early. I was out by 9, something don't look right. It's slippery in here.""

While Foxx told The Hollywood Reporter that the rumors about Combs weren't true, he did share another rumor that had upset him while he was in the hospital.

""When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These b-----a-- motherf---ers are trying to clone me,'"" he said. ""And then I saw me walk into my room, but I'm white, so I see the white me. The next morning, I said, ‘I know what's up, you're trying to clone me and make me white so I'll sell better overseas.' The psychiatrist says, ‘Are you all right?' And I say, ‘Am I all right or am I all white? I saw you trying to get the white motherf---ing Jamie Foxx and it ain't going to happen.' He just calmly goes, ‘I think we're going to lower your dosage.'""

In another part of the conversation, Foxx revealed that a stand-up joke about Oprah Winfrey was one of her best friend Gayle King's favorite things. 

The ""Django Unchained"" star explained ""I did an Oprah joke"" when asked by the outlet about a ""combative or hilarious post-joke encounter.""

""When we did ‘Ray,' my management, they're from Oakland, but those mother-----s started talking in English accents, like, 'Well, we've won the Oscar now …'"" the 57-year-old joked.

He continued, ""But I wanted to go back to doing stand-up, and there was this rumor that me and Oprah were dating, and I thought, ‘Well, that's a perfect joke.'""

Jamie Foxx has broken his silence on the conspiracy theory alleging Sean “Diddy” Combs orchestrated the 2023 medical emergency that had him “within an inch of his life.” 

The “Ray” actor said that while in the hospital, sedated on a cocktail of pain medications, he was able to sneak his phone and find out what the world was saying about him, he told a Hollywood Reporter roundtable Thursday.

“I didn't know what the outside world was saying and I couldn't get my mind around the fact that I had a stroke. I'm in f–king perfect shape. [I see things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me,'” Foxx, 57, recalled.

“No, Puffy didn't try to kill me.”

However, what caused him to “flip” out was when he read the conspiracy theory that he was cloned.

“When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These bitch-ass motherf–kers are trying to clone me,'” the comic joked.

Even while heavily medicated and still trying to figure out what caused his medical emergency, the Oscar-winning actor didn't miss a beat, using his comedic chops to lighten up the situation.

“The next morning, I said, ‘I know what's up, you're trying to clone me and make me white so I'll sell better overseas.' The psychiatrist says, ‘Are you all right?' And I say, ‘Am I all right or am I all white? I saw you trying to get the white motherf–king Jamie Foxx and it ain't going to happen.' He just calmly goes, ‘I think we're going to lower your dosage,'” Foxx quipped.

While the “Django Unchained” star has shot down any conspiracy theory about Combs causing his medical emergency, it's not the first time he's brought it up publicly.

Foxx previously addressed the rumors that the disgraced Bad Boy Records founder tried to kill him in his 2024 Netflix stand-up special, “What Had Happened Was.”

“The internet said Puffy was trying to kill me, that's what the internet was saying. I know what you thinking, ‘Diddy?'” Foxx joked on stage.

“Hell no, I left them parties early.”

The beloved comic told the audience that he always was “out by 9” whenever Combs threw a party — sharing that “something [didn't] look right” as the evenings would get later.

Foxx quipped, “It's slippery in here.”

Combs, who was arrested in September 2024 and is currently on trial for sex trafficking and racketeering, is alleged to have had wild sex performances dubbed “Freak-Offs” at his parties over the years.

He faces life in prison if convicted.

In his comedy special, Foxx said a brain bleed caused him to have a stroke, which led to his April 2023 hospitalization.

He detailed the “medical complication” that nearly killed him and caused him to lose 20 days of memory after a “bad headache,” before waking up in a wheelchair in the hospital, where doctors told him he was “within an inch of his life” when he first arrived.

The Grammy winner credited his sister Deidra Dixon with getting him the help he needed, as well as his daughter Anelise for saving his life by keeping him calm as a “spiritual defibrillator.”

[I] had a really good job, drove a really nice car… Life was good.” She had made it out of Bradford, Pennsylvania, a once-booming oil town that had become a blue-collar factory town where everyone knew everyone else's business. Her older sister, Cindy, had stayed in Bradford, though. So had their younger teenage brother, Al, along with their father, Dale. 

But now, it seemed, Dale had vanished. 

Dale Kerstetter, 50, had reported for his shift as a security guard at Corning Glass Works on Saturday, September 12, at 10:30 p.m. After he got off at 7 a.m. the next day, he was supposed to visit his girlfriend, Pamela Mays. When he didn't show up at her house, Mays called Al, who called Cindy, who called Penny. The second oldest of Kerstetter's six children, Penny was the one most like him: slight of stature but strong in personality. 

“What do you mean they can't find him?” Penny asked her sister. 

Then she got in her car and drove to Bradford. 

The day before, when Kerstetter had arrived for work at Corning, he had talked with the guard he was replacing, Art Peterson. Peterson left a few minutes later without punching his time card. The next shift worker often punched the previous worker's time card, but Kerstetter did not do so that night. After midnight, he also did not check in every hour as was customary. (The record is unclear about how the check-in process worked at Corning, but Penny maintains someone should have known something was wrong if a guard didn't check in during his shift.) 

When John Lindquist arrived Sunday morning to replace Kerstetter, he found Kerstetter's uneaten lunch, plant keys, and a newspaper in the cafeteria. Kerstetter's Jeep pickup was in the parking lot with the keys in the ignition. A carton of cigarettes and the holster of his .22 caliber gun, but not the gun, were inside, along with a daypack. 

Lindquist searched the 112,000-square-foot facility, first on his own and then with his supervisor, looking for Kerstetter. It was not until Sunday evening that the township police were called. By then the theories were as unlikely as they were varied. Kerstetter had a heart attack. Kerstetter killed himself. Kerstetter went on a bender. 

A search dog was brought in, alerting at the expected places: in the cafeteria, the storage areas, the bathroom, the mechanical-equipment room, the electric-switchgear room—all locations Kerstetter would have normally visited on his shift. 

But the dog also alerted in a place Kerstetter would not have usually been, the kiln area where sand and other raw materials were melted at over 1,400°C to make glass rods. From the kiln the glass passed into platinum pipes. As the investigation continued, Corning staff discovered that some of the platinum, one of the most expensive commodities in the world, was also missing. The company initially estimated 23,000 grams worth about $460,000 was gone, then later revised those figures to 11,000 grams and $220,000. 

The value of the theft (more than $600,000 in today's money), the unusual nature of the crime, and the lack of clues sparked a nearly four-decade search into what happened that September night. 

While new methods of examining forensic evidence—DNA testing, for example—can be useful for solving cold cases today, Kerstetter's case is different. There is no forensic evidence to reexamine. Instead, there are people. And the time to get answers from them is running out. 

AT CORNING, KERSTETTER worked as a journeyman, which means he did whatever was needed: painting offices, operating the machines, performing maintenance jobs. Penny remembers him helping install a new tile floor and washing the windows. “He came in and did his job and he left, just like everybody else,” says Penny. “It was a factory job.” 

And Bradford was a factory town. Corning Glass Works opened in Bradford in 1958. They made glass resistors and insulators that control the flow of current between wires in television and radio sets. Kerstetter began working at the company the following year.

That was also the year he married his first wife, Nancy. They knew each other from the school bus. Kerstetter left high school early to join the Air Force. Nancy, who was three years younger, had gotten a job at the phone company after she graduated. Not long after she started work, she ran into Dale at a carnival. He was fun to be around, a joker, a local she could trust. They dated for six months and then married. Cindy was born and then Penny, whom Kerstetter named after a beloved childhood dog. Kerstetter had been so close to the animal that he refused to leave his room for two days after it died. Penny was followed by two more girls, Bonnie and Wendy, and then the twins, Susan and Al.

Nancy stayed home with the children while Kerstetter worked at Corning. At work Kerstetter was known as something of a survivalist, having once sewn up a cut on his own finger. Kerstetter's grit came in handy when a forklift that held a propane tank rolled underneath a stream of molten glass. Kerstetter jumped onto the forklift and drove it out of the way before the hot glass could cause the propane tank to explode. His actions saved lives as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of equipment. 

He also had a reputation as a bit of a mischief-maker. Roland “Skeet” Stoughton used to work nights with Kerstetter. “If he could make you laugh or he could scare somebody, that's what he did,” Stoughton says. 

In 1987, when Corning was downsizing and Kerstetter's pay was cut, he added overnight and weekend security shifts. Art Peterson Jr., the son of the guard Kerstetter replaced the night he went missing, does not believe his late father or any of the other guards had special security training. They usually didn't carry weapons. Kerstetter brought his own gun, which fits with the “tough, scrappy little guy” image Peterson Jr. has of Kerstetter from when their families used to go camping together. Nevertheless, Kerstetter, who was 5'4"" and 130 pounds, “wasn't a very big guy,” he adds. “He wouldn't have been difficult to have been overpowered.” The plant did not have much of a security system. Penny remembers the door being unlocked when she visited her father during his shift. 

After her father's disappearance, Cindy thinks people got the idea that Bradford “was a perfect town to commit a crime in because nobody was going to do anything.”

At one time Bradford was the perfect place for nefarious activities. Located about 90 miles south of Buffalo, New York, and the Canadian border, Bradford was well-positioned during Prohibition. Local bootleggers sold moonshine, beer, and wine to the city's wealthier residents who were happy to turn a blind eye, explains Sally Ryan Costik, curator of the Bradford Landmark Society and author of the 2011 book on Bradford during that era, Bootleggers, Bullets and Blood. Fights with neighboring bootleggers resulted in around 50 murders in Bradford and two neighboring communities during the Prohibition years from 1920 to 1933. Before moonshine there was oil. Before oil there was lumber. 

Surrounded by the Allegheny National Forest, Bradford began as a lumber town. After oil was discovered in the late 1800s, Bradford got big, producing more than 630 million barrels of oil from 1871 to 1967. After the oil boom petered out, there were the big factories: Zippo lighters, Case Knives, Dresser Industries, Corning Glass Works. 

Bradford's population peaked in the 1930s at around 33,000. The 1930s are also when Bradford became known for another disappearance. It happened on Mother's Day. While on a family picnic, two young girls left their parents briefly to pick flowers. Only one girl returned. A massive manhunt was launched for 4-year-old Marjorie West. Bloodhounds and soldiers searched a three-mile radius. Native American trackers were called in. “They never found anything,” says Costik. “Nothing… She just literally vanished.” 

Half a century later, Kerstetter vanished. Bradford had a new mystery. 

Cindy was in her mid-20s at the time and working at Zippo. Aside from her grandmother, Cindy was the only family member who remained in town following Kerstetter's disappearance. (Al had gone to see his mother in Texas after the incident, and Penny had returned to the D.C. area.) In the days and weeks after Kerstetter went missing, everyone's questions were directed at Cindy. “I felt like all eyes were on me,” she says. 

“Imagine someone you know that doesn't come home,” she says. “What are you supposed to think? And how am I supposed to feel? I didn't know.” 

At 63, she still doesn't. Cindy believes it is easier to get away with things in a place where everyone knows you. In Bradford, she says, “there's all kinds of things people hide.” 

Their mother Nancy is living in Pennsylvania again, but not in Bradford—none of the family lives there anymore. Nancy has returned to her maiden name, which she does not want used. She is gentle, caring—and slightly wary. 

Aside from Penny, and sometimes Cindy, her children “really don't want to talk about it—especially Al.” In an early media interview, Al suggests, in the wishful way a young man might, that his father could be in Canada or Australia. It was enough to make people suspect Al knew where his father was. Al has kept silent ever since. Private and protective, Cindy doesn't want to discuss her personal life or her life growing up, but she's willing to discuss the incident. She asked that we not use her last name.

Yet as much as the family wants to put it behind them, they can't fully. There are too many unanswered questions. Nancy entertains the possibility that Dale was killed and buried in the woods. “Every winter during hunting season, I always hoped that somebody would find something, and they could go back and identify him,” she says. 

THE MONDAY AFTER Kerstetter disappeared, Patrick Foley sat down at his desk to watch the grainy security footage, a compilation of still images taken every few seconds by three cameras placed at three different angles. A personnel manager at Corning, Foley was a middle-aged man with thinning hair and had only been with the company a few years. He was shocked by what he saw when he turned on the small television screen. In the footage, a masked man comes into view. “Then Dale Kerstetter came back and met this masked person,” he said in an interview with Unsolved Mysteries, which recreated the footage for a 1989 episode. It is 10:45 on Saturday night. The camera captures Kerstetter looking directly at the camera. It is the last time Kerstetter is seen. 

At 11:19 p.m., the masked man enters the kiln area where the platinum is located. 

Platinum is a critical material used in glassmaking equipment because of its resistance to high temperatures and corrosion. Typically, raw materials like sand, limestone, and soda ash are melted in a large tank called a kiln. The molten mixture is then poured into a cooling tank that feeds into a platinum cylinder that branches in two, forming a Y shape. The two cylinders are connected to “down draws,” which make canes, or long, thin rods, which are then cut to make resistors. 

For 35 minutes, the masked man toils away, removing the precious metal from the kiln's complicated machinery. 

This was no snatch and grab. The part of the kiln that held the platinum cylinders was covered by mesh wire and gated. The cylinders themselves were covered with insulating fire brick. The thief would have had to use a tool of some kind to carve out the U-shaped fire bricks, then a saw to cut away the platinum.

The footage shows the masked man returning to the kiln multiple times, spending roughly two hours at the facility. He removes 11,000 grams' worth of platinum but leaves behind much more, three times more according to a former employee, hundreds of thousands of dollars more. 

When Corning employees were interviewed for Unsolved Mysteries, they suggested the company thought it possible Kerstetter was an accomplice. C. Dale Parry, another personnel manager at the company, told the show that Kerstetter was a “marginal employee” and a “slow worker.” His colleague Foley said, “I think the fact that he did everything in front of the camera was once again just Dale Kerstetter just saying to us ‘Hey, here I am. I'm taking your platinum and there isn't a thing you can do about it.'” 

Penny, who says she first saw the video during the initial investigation in 1987, sees something else. “I think he's looking at the camera saying, ‘Do you guys see this? Is somebody going to come and help me?'” 

Prior to the platinum theft, there had only been minor thefts at Corning, explains Bradford Township Police Lieutenant Tim Gigliotti. Employees would take pieces of flooring or a shelf they could use in their homes. This was a much more brazen crime. 

At 12:51 a.m., the masked man uses a hand truck to drag what looks like a plastic-covered load out of the plant. The footage finally ends at 12:53 a.m., when camera three shows the man reentering the plant. He is not seen on film again. Some speculate the load is the platinum. 

Others believe it is Kerstetter's body. 

DALE KERSTETTER WAS known to enjoy fine food, to read Forbes magazine, and to study and invest in the stock market. Although he left high school early, Kerstetter was a lifelong learner, obtaining his GED and taking several college courses. “He wasn't the country bumpkin,” says Penny. Both Penny and her mother mention Kerstetter being ahead of his time. Even though men were not expected to play a large role in child rearing in the 1960s, Nancy remembers her husband questioning why he couldn't get paternity leave when she was pregnant.

They also remember family excursions: picking berries, fishing, cooking out. In winter they would drive to a country road where they would cook hamburgers over a fire, drink hot chocolate, and go sledding. Kerstetter loved the outdoors—and adventure. He hunted, fished, trapped, and went skydiving (once shattering his ankle so badly, his surgeon used pins to repair it). Penny joined him in many of these pursuits, going trapping with him as a child and skydiving with him as an adult. 

Nancy says out of all her children, Penny most reminds her of Dale. There are the obvious similarities: They both smoked and liked a bit of excitement. And then there is the part she can't explain. “Just sometimes she might do something that would remind me of something he might do,” Nancy says. 

After 22 years of marriage, Nancy and Dale divorced and Dale remarried. Despite the divorce, Nancy and Dale remained close. In the 1980s, Nancy moved to Texas, and was there when she found out Dale had disappeared. 

“I could see it both ways,” she says. “But the more I think about it, I really think somebody did go in there and do something to him.” 

From the start, Corning management viewed Kerstetter with suspicion. Patrick Foley, following a tip, told the police to check Kerstetter's discharge papers from the Air Force, implying Kerstetter had been accused of stealing platinum while in the service. (United States Air Force records show Kerstetter was honorably discharged.) Corning did not respond to multiple phone and email requests for comment. 

Cindy remembers going to Corning with her boyfriend and listening to a company supervisor who seemed to assume her father was guilty. Law enforcement agents repeatedly asked her if her father had contacted her. She kept telling them no. “I think they sat outside my apartment a couple times,” she says. 

When the family first tried to have Kerstetter declared legally dead so they could collect life insurance, Corning objected. A 1990 appeal from an order dismissing the family's petition explains that the company was permitted to intervene to “assert its contention that Kerstetter had been a participant in the theft of the platinum.” According to Corning, there was evidence Kerstetter was experiencing financial difficulties. 

Kerstetter was in debt. A September 9, 1987, letter from Mastercard declared his balance of $3,882.88 to be in default. According to his family, he had more than enough in his bank account to pay this off, as well as investments and people he could count on to help him out financially if he needed. Kerstetter was also very close to retirement and collecting his pension. If he helped with the heist, he wouldn't have done it for the money, says Penny. 

It would have been for the thrill. 

FENCING THE PLATINUM would have been more than just exciting—it would have required prior planning and connections to a facility that could melt the metal down, making it easier to sell. The platinum was of such high grade that melting it down would have entailed a special machine, says retired Pennsylvania state trooper Max Bizzak. “All the places I contacted had no means or facility to melt that down.”

Bizzak, a tall, slim father of three, was called to assist the township police three days after Kerstetter went missing. He remembers being shown the video footage. “It was really, really hazy,” he says. “You can hardly see anything.” 

Aside from the footage, he didn't have a lot to work with. By the time he arrived on the scene, any evidence had been compromised. He doesn't remember seeing the daypack or gun holster; the family says they never got an accounting of what happened to those. They also found it strange that there was a daypack at all because Kerstetter never used one. The family wonders if the pack might have belonged to the masked man or someone else and are concerned by its disappearance. There had been no leads on the masked man. 

At first Bizzak and the township police, under the leadership of Chief Dave Doyle, worked together chasing down leads. Because the state police had more resources, they eventually took it over. It was Bizzak who contacted Unsolved Mysteries, hoping they might discover something the police had missed. 

While Bizzak worked the case, his wife, Barb, handled the home front. She also became his de facto coordinator during long assignments. In the 1980s, Max and his partner had a three-year assignment with the U.S. Marshals to help investigate the Pagan's Motorcycle Club. At a time before pagers and cell phones, Barb was the one they primarily checked in with. The undercover operation may have been Bizzak's most exciting assignment, but it doesn't haunt him the way Kerstetter's case does. 

Bizzak was five years away from retirement when he began work on the Kerstetter case. By mid-September, the FBI had been called in to assist. Local law enforcement offices often called the bureau if they needed help with laboratory services or forensic metallurgy services, or in the apprehension of a fugitive. Chief Doyle hoped the bureau's labs would be able to improve the poor quality of the tapes. Instead they made them worse. “I had watched it on their machine at Corning, and when I got it back from the FBI, I didn't even recognize it,” he adds. “That was a big blunder.” 

At the time, the FBI was not involved directly in investigating platinum thefts, says FBI Supervisory Special Agent Michael Howard. But among the FBI files on the Kerstetter case is information about a 1960 theft of $152,000 worth of platinum from a Corning plant in Rhode Island. There were at least three more platinum thefts at Corning in the 1970s, two in New York and one in Virginia, and quite a few others at plants owned by different companies.

Kerstetter was not the first guard to go missing. 

A month before the Bradford heist, in Solon, Ohio, a night watchman vanished along with $85,000 worth of platinum. In a newspaper account at the time, private investigator Lee Feathers said he suspected the theft involved insider knowledge. The night watchman had been employed by Brinks Security System. Feathers contacted the Pennsylvania State Police to see if Kerstetter was also employed by Brinks. He was not. Whether that is the reason the Pennsylvania police did not investigate further is not in their report, only that despite the similarities in the cases, the trooper who responded did not feel the cases were related. 

When Feathers was asked by a reporter where the platinum would be sold, he said it depended on the thieves' contacts, but that it was obvious they would have already had a contact or buyer for it. The FBI attempted to figure out who that buyer might be in the Bradford case, interviewing several scrap-metal dealers, all of whom reported that the only platinum they dealt with was through collecting catalytic converters. 

Platinum group metals—which include iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and ruthenium—occur together in nature. However, substantial deposits that can be mined in large quantities are rare, which is one of the reasons platinum is so valuable, explains Ruth Schulte, a mineral commodity specialist for the National Minerals Information Center. This rarity, combined with resistance to wear and tarnish, make platinum well suited for making jewelry as well as investments in the form of coin and bullion. 

But its ability to withstand chemical and temperature assault, to deform without breaking under different types of stress, and to enable catalytic reactions make it useful in industrial applications, like at Corning. Platinum group metals are also used in the chemical industry to produce fertilizer, explosives, and silicone. In addition, platinum-supported catalysts are used in gas production and crude oil refinery. In the last 40 years, platinum has primarily been used by the automotive industry in catalytic converters to capture harmful exhaust emissions.

Platinum's value also makes it desirable for thieves. Special Agent Howard, who manages the FBI's major theft program, says the trend today is to steal platinum group metals that are already in finished products and not in their raw form. Because thieves now tend to target distributors—which involve interstate shipments—and not refineries, the FBI has taken a more active role in these investigations. Howard believes the pivot from targeting raw materials to finished products—for platinum, mainly catalytic converters—is likely because there is less raw material in circulation. Laundering the stolen items is not difficult. “There are very active laundering markets for precious metals virtually everywhere in the world,” says Howard. 

Chief Doyle has his own theory. He thinks Kerstetter could have participated as part of a theft ring with ties to Mexico, and that perhaps he was killed by accomplices in a hotel in Florida. Doyle has nothing to base this on. At the same time, he is puzzled by the fact that some valuable platinum in the Bradford plant, something Kerstetter would have known about, was left untouched. 

“I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of platinum was inside the furnace, but they didn't go do that,” he says. 

THE SECOND PHONE call Penny Chlebowy received after her father went missing came in March 1992. 

Penny was pregnant and living in Buffalo, New York. She was at work and took the call in her boss's office. A Pennsylvania state trooper was on the line. A headless, handless body had been found in Florida. One of the feet was damaged. The trooper wanted Penny's permission to review Kerstetter's medical records and see if the damage matched her father's ankle injury.

When her boss heard the conversation, he was shocked. Penny remained composed. She was tough because she had to be, but that didn't mean it didn't bother her. “There's not too much more that I could find unsettling than to get a phone call like that,” says Penny. 

Penny gave the trooper permission to access her father's records. The x-rays were gone, but the medical files were still there. And when the surgeon who had repaired her father's ankle saw imaging of the John Doe, Penny recalls the doctor saying it wasn't his work. And that was the end of that. 

There were other leads over the years. On September 23, just 10 days after Kerstetter was declared missing, a man reported seeing him on West Washington Street in Bradford. He was sure it was Kerstetter because he had met Kerstetter before. A day later, a woman reported seeing a man she believed to be Kerstetter near the railroad tracks. As recently as 2020, a woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico, contacted authorities after viewing the Unsolved Mysteries episode because she was convinced Kerstetter was her neighbor. 

A month after the heist, the Bradford Township police department received a note naming the president of a smelting company in New York. In police interviews, the executive theorized his name was on the note because a Bradford company with which he formerly did business had a grudge against him. He did deal in platinum, but only catalytic converters. He didn't know Kerstetter. 

Tim Gigliotti, with the township police, describes Kerstetter as having hung around with “less than savory” people. The stories are colorful: a doctor who was suspected of trying to kill his wife; an accused killer who was one of three men tried for shooting a man and pushing his truck, with his body inside it, into a large body of water. The accused killer was found innocent and is now deceased, but he used to meet with Kerstetter on Saturday mornings at a local restaurant, according to Doyle. These and other acquaintances of Kerstetter's were interviewed by police and the FBI, then dropped for one reason or another. 

“It was all speculation,” says Bizzak. 

A few years ago, Penny met with one of her father's friends who was living in Florida at the time Kerstetter went missing. He had come under suspicion when Kerstetter's young son Al told police that his father had seen the man with a suitcase containing a large amount of cash after he had declared bankruptcy. The man was interviewed. Penny knew about his background and knew her father was a loyal friend; yet after talking to him she decided the police were right to not pursue him. 

“That's a dead end,” she says. 

TODAY BRADFORD HAS plenty of churches and brick buildings. Hometown Hero signs hang from lamp posts, American-made Ram trucks cruise the streets, and the occasional Amish or Mennonite woman can be found among the pedestrians. The vanishing now is done by the younger generation leaving for bigger cities and better jobs. 

The Corning grounds are still there, nearly 10 acres surrounded by forest on the outskirts of town just around the corner from the township police. The facilities have been split up and are occupied by different enterprises, explains Bob Cummins, the local construction company owner who bought the property. The section where the platinum theft occurred was torn down during remodeling. 

Grass grows through cracks in the visitors' parking lot. The office space remains intact, but in serious need of upkeep. The long, carpeted main hallway is dark. Floors inside offices are pocked with puddles below where the ceiling has collapsed and leaked. A sign on the wall thanks people for not smoking. At the far end of the hallway is a makeshift storage area. An old life-size cutout Santa grins eerily from one corner, a snowman from another. 

Penny toured the facility a few years ago. She has never really stopped searching. She posts on an Unsolved Mysteries message board dedicated to her father's case. That is how she met Heather Graupmann, an Illinois woman who's also behind Lostnfoundblogs.com. Together the two began digging. Penny returned to the state police to examine their files. 

Graupmann found files of her own, accounts of other platinum thefts. Graupmann felt more could be learned from these thefts and listed some of them in the two blogs she wrote about Kerstetter in 2018 and 2019. 

It was the video footage she mentioned, though, that caught readers' attention. After the publication of her first story, an amateur investigator requested and received the Corning security footage from the police through the nonprofit news site MuckRock. The video was so corrupted it was almost impossible to decipher. Graupmann asked a film hobbyist named Mike West to clean it up. During the process West discovered what he believes could be a third person, bringing up the possibility there were two intruders. 

In 2022, the case was returned to the township police after decades spent with the state police. Chief Doyle had retired in 2012, and Gigliotti was then handling the case. Gigliotti is aware of West's work and said the video breakdown was slightly helpful but that West's work doesn't “really clarify anything.” 

Gigliotti, whose age and relaxed attire—a blue polo shirt—signal the tail end of a career, was not working for the township when the theft happened. But he worked for them before and after, and interacted with Corning through his father's trucking company, which picked things up at the facility. The renewed attention gave him hope. Gigliotti felt with Kerstetter's friends in “their golden years, somebody might come forward.” 

There was talk. An old friend of Kerstetter's told Penny he thought her father might be in one of the hundreds of old oil wells that dot the region. The wells, some as deep as 1,500 feet, are in various states of disrepair: fully filled in, partially filled in, and hollow. A local driller offered the police a map of the wells and help utilizing a camera system to search for a body in a well. The problem is that checking every well is not possible, says Gigliotti. “It would take years.” Time is something they don't have. 

As time passes, says Gigliotti, it becomes “progressively less and less probable we're going to find any body.” A lot of the people who'd remember anything are gone now. 

PENNY IS NOW a 61-year-old grandmother. Her mother, Nancy, 85, is a great-grandmother. Seated in Penny's backyard in a rural neighborhood in Pennsylvania, the women reminisce about the man at the center of the mystery. Penny tells me how Kerstetter would bring home fresh doughnuts when he got off the night shift. Once, the neighbor's dog jumped on Penny's sister and knocked her over. Kerstetter opened the window and shot the dog off his daughter. Both Penny and Nancy remember Kerstetter being a crack shot. Nancy remembers that the owner of the dog was a cook at the school the children attended. Lunchtime was complicated after that.

Nancy has short gray hair and a gentle manner. Penny is wearing a T-shirt dress, dangling earrings, and a stone bracelet. On the table in front of Penny is a pack of American Spirit cigarettes and a can of diet tonic water. The women have long since given up hope Kerstetter is alive. 

What is left is Kerstetter's reputation. Penny wants it cleared. “Anybody that really knew him would tell you that he would never [leave his family],” she says. 

Kerstetter's former colleague, Skeet Stoughton, is now 87 and battling lymphoma. He has his reasons for thinking his friend is innocent. Kerstetter would have known about the additional platinum right next to where the platinum was stolen. He would have known about the security camera and would have covered it up instead of looking at it. And finally, Kerstetter wouldn't have left a carton of cigarettes in his truck. “In my opinion, and I'll go to my grave saying that, and I'm getting closer to that, Dale Kerstetter never had one thing to do with stealing that platinum,” says Stoughton. 

Patrick Foley, formerly of the Corning personnel office, is still suspicious of Kerstetter's involvement. When I reach him by phone, he refers me to his Unsolved Mysteries interview. “I fully believe what I said then, and there's been no reason for me to change my mind since then,” says Foley. 

That Kerstetter is most likely dead is the one thing most everyone can agree on. 

Initially Max Bizzak had hoped Graupmann, the blogger, might find something the police had missed. A summer rainstorm beats down outside as Bizzak sips coffee on his covered porch, his long legs stretching out in front of him. A week before his 84th birthday, he is neither hunched nor hesitant. Tall and lean, with a head full of white hair, Bizzak is dressed in shorts and a trim athletic shirt. He and Barb live about 30 miles southeast of Bradford in the town where he grew up. They have been married almost 60 years. 

Barb, who is small and quick with a wink, sits against the wall. She says she is there to smoke, and she does, but really, she is there to make sure her husband remembers everything correctly. He does, mostly. 

What has faded is his hope. He's still hung up on Penny. 

“She wanted to find out what happened to her father, and I couldn't give her an answer,” he says. “I couldn't even tell her if her father was involved in the theft, or he was a victim. And today, I still can't tell you.” 

When her husband steps out for a minute, Barb approaches, a large manila envelope in her hand. Inside are printouts of the two articles Graupmann wrote on the case as well as the letter Penny included when she mailed them to Bizzak. Barb offers them to me. I refuse them politely, telling her I already have a copy. 

The envelope stays in the air between us. 

The mysteries, the homicides, the late nights, the worry, all that was supposed to have ended when Max retired at age 52, after almost 30 years of service.

Now Max's memory is failing.

Barb extends the envelope toward me again, telling me to take it. 

When I accept, she smiles. 

“Now he can be done,” she says.

""Dire wolves"" created by Colossal Biosciences were pegged as ""the first animals in history to be brought back from extinction."" But that all depends on your definition of de-extinction — and Colossal's definition isn't the same as everyone else's.

The idea of resurrecting extinct organisms is alluring; I would love to see one of the strange Cambrian animals like Hallucigenia and Opabinia, feathered dinosaurs, the giant hornless rhino ""Walter"" and giant sloths.

The ""de-extinction"" company Colossal Biosciences promises to fulfill that dream, at least for extinct animals like woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), dodos (Raphus cucullatus), and Tasmanian tigers (Thylacinus cynocephalus). It has recently been making waves in its quest to de-extinct charismatic fauna. First, it claimed to have developed elephant induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), from which they could ""de-extinct"" woolly mammoths, then for creating Colossal Woolly Mouse, or the Mammouse, a proof of concept that mammoth-like traits can be engineered into other animals.



Most recently, in a choreographed, but botched, reveal, Colossal made an astonishing claim: they had brought back the dire wolf from extinction. ""De-extinction is now a reality,"" it posted to X. On LinkedIn, representatives wrote the wolves were ""the first animals in history to be brought back from extinction.""

News headlines boldly claimed that ""The dire wolf is back,"" and the ""Return of the Dire Wolf."" But the photogenic, clickbaitable animals in their public relations campaign are not dire wolves; they are genetically engineered grey wolves that might resemble dire wolves. To me, this feels like an assault on objective truth in pursuit of profit.

Colossal's years-long de-extinction campaign is built on a semantic house of cards and the ""illusory truth effect"" — where if you repeat something enough times, people will believe it. The common-sense definition of de-extinction is reversing extinction — bringing a species that no longer exists back to life. But that's not Colossal's definition.

The company has rebranded it as ""deëxtinction"" or ""functional de-extinction"" — describing it as ""the process of generating an organism that both resembles and is genetically similar to an extinct species [emphasis added].""

It ignores that ""similar"" is relative given all organisms descend from a common ancestor that lived 4.2 billion years ago; humans are more genetically similar to sponges than bacteria, but swapping genes between humans and sponges doesn't transmutate one into the other. A hairy elephant is not a woolly mammoth and a grey wolf with a few genetic alterations isn't a dire wolf. Saying they are with a tweaked definition of de-extinction doesn't make it true.

In a subsequent interview with New Scientist, chief scientist at Colossal Beth Shapiro acknowledged that dire wolves haven't been de-extincted, while seemingly claiming Colossal never said they were. ""It's not possible to bring something back that is identical to a species that used to be alive,"" she told the publication. ""Our animals are grey wolves with 20 edits that are cloned. And we've said that from the very beginning. Colloquially, they're calling them dire wolves and that makes people angry.""

They further mislead by simplifying and exploiting a nuanced scientific debate over species concepts; because there is no universally agreed-upon species definition, it gives them license to use an alternative, more convenient one.

While evolutionary biologists debate whether species are real biological entities or conceptual abstractions, no definition is based on overall similarity.

Colossal calls them dire wolves because if they look like this animal, then they are the animal.

Much like the meaning of de-extinction, Colossal redefines what it means to be a species. In a remarkable bit of lawfare, Colossal has filed patents that, if accepted as written by the Patent and Trademark Office, would legitimize their definition of de-extinction as a single gene from an extinct species introduced into an extant one. They have also filed for a type of trademark that secures their rights to use the names of the de-extinct ""dire wolves,"" Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi, in board games, toys, video games, trading cards, etc., to protect their ""brand identity.""

Thus, if transgenic grey wolf clones are transmutated into dire wolves because Colossal says they are, and if the government agrees with Colossal's definition, then one mutation could turn living species into monetizable and lucrative extinct ones.

The foundations of their house of cards are shoddy and built on disinformation, or, as the philosopher Harry G. Frankfurt might say, bulls**t.

Who benefits from this colossal bulls**t campaign? Colossal's investors, who I can't imagine care about quiet academic debates over species concepts. Colossal aims to monetize the development and commercialization of cutting-edge biotech, including methods to edit the genome at multiple locations simultaneously, differentiate cells into sperm and eggs, and invent artificial wombs, among others. These techniques are legitimately promising. Developing these methods will have profound implications for human health and disease when successful.



When, and I do believe it is when, not if, they succeed, infertility and genetic disease will be a thing of the past. But instead of applying these methods to real problems, the company is focused on selling de-extinction to the public.

Colossal's deception is already having real-world consequences.

The Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum wrote on on X that the arrival of the dire wolf is a ""time to fundamentally change how we think about species conservation,"" that ""the marvel of de-extinction technology can help forge a future where populations are never at risk,"" and that ""The Endangered Species List has become like the Hotel California: once a species enters, they never leave. In fact, 97 percent of species that are added to the endangered list remain there.""

Burgum declines to note in his post that those 97% of species remain on the list because we have failed to protect their habitats from human encroachment; their populations have not rebounded, therefore, they stay on the list. The Trump administration has announced it will remove protections from many endangered species, citing Colossal's de-extinction of the dire wolf. Who needs to protect endangered species like the red wolves from extinction when we can just introduce one of their extinct genes into a coyote and deëxtinct them?

—Colossal's de-extincted 'dire wolf' isn't a dire wolf and it has not been de-extincted, experts say

—How related are dire wolves and gray wolves? The answer might surprise you.

—Most complete Tasmanian tiger genome yet pieced together from 110-year-old pickled head

In an era where ""alternative facts"" reign, Colossal's claim to de-extinction is more than just semantics and nonsensical differences in definitions. It is about market capitalization, at the expense of the foundations of scientific integrity and public trust in science and scientists.

Their scripted narrative has polluted the information ecosystem, and like a forever chemical, now that it has been introduced, it will linger on. Almost no one who read the fawning and remarkably gullible headlines or saw the TV coverage will read the critical commentary that followed, the news cycle has passed.

It's hard to dismantle a multi-year disinformation campaign wielded by a $10 billion biotech Goliath and work toward the de-extinction of truth. But we can speak truth to power and help the public discern science from science fiction, information from misinformation, and breakthroughs from flashy marketing ploys. What Colossal Biosciences offers us is bulls**t in exchange for objective truth.

The ancient Maya civilization stretched throughout Central America and lasted for nearly three millennia. Although never unified into one massive empire, the Maya controlled dozens of city-states, also known as ""polities,"" which arose when people settled in permanent villages and began to cultivate maize. The ancient Maya are well known for their pyramids and for their series of calendars — one of which convinced many people that the world would end in an apocalypse on Dec. 21, 2012. While the ancient political system collapsed between A.D. 800 and 1000, the society did not. Today, more than 7 million Maya live in their original homelands and beyond.

In this article

Nashville, Tennessee, has transformed from its reputation as ""Music City"" into a major U.S. metro thanks to rapid population growth, job opportunities in key industries like healthcare and tech and a good quality of life.  

It's now become one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities, boasting a diverse community and a competitive economy. 

""It's not just economics. It's our climate here,"" said John Eldridge, founder and CEO of development company E3 Construction Services. ""It's our culture here. It's our location.""

Some of the biggest names in tech like Amazon and Oracle have invested in the region, too, fueling a rapid tech expansion. Oracle has developed a $1.4 billion Nashville campus for its global headquarters, and Amazon has leased over 1 million square feet of office space in downtown — on top of opening a $230 million East Coast operations hub in 2018.

According to a joint report by the Great Nashville Technology Council and Middle Tennessee State University, the number of tech jobs in the Nashville area grew by 17% between 2017 and 2022. 

""We found that we could locate here, we found that we could find the talent here,"" said Amazon's Vice President of Worldwide Economic Development Holly Sullivan adding that both the state of Tennessee and the city of Nashville had very business-friendly policies. ""When you find that, you want to double down on that.""

Many other corporate giants have been recruited to the area thanks to the city's 10-year strategy that gets upgraded every decade. Under the plan, more than 600,000 jobs have been created since 1990 and per-capita income in the region has grown by more than 234%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  

Commercial and residential real estate have boomed, though the city has struggled to keep up with enough affordable housing. Nashville ranked among cities with the biggest increase in home prices between 2014 and 2024, according to Construction Coverage.

Polish fighter jets intercepted a Russian Su-24 bomber in international airspace over the Baltic Sea on May 22, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said during a press conference on May 23, according to the Polish news outlet RMF24. 

The incident marks the latest in a series of Russian provocations near NATO territory. According to Kosiniak-Kamysz, the Russian aircraft posed a threat to regional airspace safety.

""These maneuvers performed by the Russian Su-24 show that the actions were dangerous and intentional,"" the minister said. He added that Polish pilots quickly detected, intercepted, and forced the bomber to withdraw from the area.

The encounter took place near the heavily militarized Kaliningrad Oblast, a Russian exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania.

Russian aircraft often fly from Kaliningrad without using transponders, failing to file flight plans, and not establishing contact with regional air traffic control — a pattern that NATO officials have long described as high-risk behavior.

""We are resistant to provocations, but we react appropriately, individually and collectively,"" Kosiniak-Kamysz said, referring to NATO's air policing measures.

The intercepted aircraft, a Soviet-designed Su-24 bomber, is capable of carrying guided bombs and precision missiles and was developed for low-level penetration missions.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has scrambled fighter jets multiple times in response to missile and drone attacks near its border.

On several occasions, Russian projectiles have briefly entered Polish airspace, prompting strong protests from Warsaw and increased NATO monitoring in the region.

On Feb. 11, a Russian Su-24MR reconnaissance aircraft flew into Polish airspace over the Gdansk Bay for over a minute. Moscow blamed a navigational failure, though Polish officials have dismissed similar explanations in the past as implausible.

Poland, which shares a border with Ukraine and hosts significant NATO infrastructure, has warned that Russian aerial provocations could trigger escalation if not contained.

Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Tim Hodgson arrives for a meeting of the federal cabinet in West Block on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on May 14.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Canada's new Natural Resources Minister says the country needs more oil and gas infrastructure to open trade opportunities with overseas markets and shore up energy supplies in Eastern Canada.

Tim Hodgson made the remarks at a hotel ballroom in Calgary packed with business and political leaders in the wake of a series of meetings with Western Canadian officials. That included Alberta's Energy Minister Brian Jean and its Affordability and Utilities Minister, Nathan Neudorf, as well as Saskatchewan's Deputy Premier Jim Reiter.

Calling himself a pragmatist and a businessman, Mr. Hodgson took aim at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and broader trade friction with the country's largest export market.

“We did not ask for this trade war. But we are going to win it,” he said at the event hosted by the Calgary Chamber of Commerce Friday morning.

“If we're going to sit across the table from him or anyone else, we need to hold Canada's best cards. That means being able to sell our products to the world. It means expanding our markets, modernizing our infrastructure, and creating the conditions to compete and win.”

Canada will remain a reliable global supplier of oil and gas for decades to come, Mr. Hodgson said in a nod to fears in the oil patch that the Liberal government of Prime Minister Mark Carney might double down on some policies of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau.

Industry executives criticized many of those policies as being anti-oil and gas, and have given Carney's government a laundry list of ways to attract energy capital and boost energy security, from scrapping a cap on emissions to streamlining project reviews.

“The real challenge is not whether we produce, but whether we can get the best products to market before someone else does,” he said.

“It's high time to trade more with people who share our values – not just our border.”

He pledged to work quickly with the provinces and territories, industry and Indigenous partners to diversify trade, and open and expand new markets for energy as well as critical minerals and forest products.

Mr. Hodgson, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker who previously sat on boards of Alberta-based companies, stressed his first public appearance in his role was a first step in resetting the relationship between the province and Ottawa.

“No more asking, ‘Why build?' The real question is, ‘How do we get it done?' That means breaking apart barriers and ripping down red tape,” he said.

He said he would consult with industry to identify and fast-track projects of national interest which matter to the Canadian economy, the environment, and the country's sovereignty. 

The government has said permitting decisions will be made within two years via a major federal projects office that will offer a single window for permits.

The goal is to create an environment for the private sector to see potential gains from investments in such projects, he said.

“I'm from the private sector. I've sat on boards. I understand when projects go forward people look at the lifetime [return on equity] of the project,” he told the audience. “They have to make an assessment of risk-return in putting capital to work. That's how the private sector gets stuff done.” 

Many attendees from the business and political communities said they were encouraged by Mr. Hodgson's messaging and impressed that Calgary was his first major stop in his role. However, some stressed that the real test will be their ability to develop major projects with fewer regulatory burdens.

“There is some repair and trust-building that has to happen given the challenges of the last ten years, I would argue,” Calgary Chamber president Deborah Yedlin told reporters.

“But I think that he's definitely someone who understands how to get things done, and if you've ever been an investment banker you know there are ways to find common ground and to find a solution and to reach an agreement on some contentious challenges.”

Although Mr. Hodgson emphasized the need for more infrastructure, he did not mention pipelines during his speech. But he called on the Pathways Alliance to hasten its plans to build a massive carbon capture project in the oil sands, saying it is critical to demonstrate to Canadians and oversees customers that the industry operates responsibly. 

The Pathways Alliance is a consortium of Canada's six largest oil sands companies, which together have publicly committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands production by 2050.

“Your federal government has committed to certainty, to support, and to making Canada an energy superpower, but we need a partner who is also willing to make good on their promises to Canadians,” Mr. Hodgson said.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said in a statement on Thursday that its staff have completed a “major cleanup” of Social Security records after it was discovered that more than 12 million people aged 120 or older were in the system.

But it added that “some complex cases remain, such as individuals with 2+ different birth dates on file,” which “will be investigated in a follow-up effort.”

DOGE also provided a portion of a screenshot that showed there were about 3.3 million people aged 120 to 129, 3.9 million aged 130 to 139, 3.5 million listed as age 140 to 149, 1.3 million listed as age 150 to 159, and around 124,000 listed as age 160 to 169, all of whom were marked as deceased in the Social Security system.

“The amount of people that were not alive that did not show on the system ... was outstanding. Millions and millions. And that is a source of potential for fraud,” he told the news outlet, adding that the work that DOGE did in the agency “was 100 percent accurate” in a bid to locate anything that could lead to fraud.

That's because, according to Bisignano, an active Social Security number that is “still alive in the system” presents the “opportunity for fraud.”

Established by President Donald Trump in January, DOGE is tasked with finding what officials say are fraud, waste, and abuse. But its efforts have been blocked in several court cases, namely in the Social Security Administration.

In March, U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander, who is based in Maryland, ruled that DOGE could not access Social Security systems because such a move could run afoul of the federal Privacy Act, also alleging that the task force's mission to root out fraud, waste, and abuse is a “fishing expedition.” She also directed the DOGE team to delete any personally identifiable data that it may have in its possession.

“The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,” the judge wrote.

A month later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a ruling to uphold Hollander's order, prompting the Trump administration to file its appeal with the Supreme Court.

“When district courts attempt to transform themselves into the human resources department for the Executive Branch, the irreparable harm to the government is clear,” he wrote.

The task force has been effectively led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, a senior adviser to Trump and a special government employee, meaning he has 130 days to complete his work. Musk said in a Tesla earnings call last month that he would be stepping back from his government duties in May to focus on his company.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
