Charles Leclerc finished fastest in the opening practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix, despite having brought out an early red flag for a collision with Lance Stroll.

The Ferrari driver, who won his home race 12 months ago, collided with the back of the Aston Martin driver into the Loewes Hairpin after the Canadian moved back onto the racing line, with red flags deployed for several minutes to remove debris.

With a new nosecone fitted, Leclerc posted a 1m 11.964s around the midway point of the one-hour session, and despite complaining of issues with his car, it left him 0.163s clear of reigning World Champion Max Verstappen.

McLaren's Lando Norris finished third having run deep at both Sainte Devote and the Nouvelle Chicane, with team mate and Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri in fifth having believed he clipped the wall at one stage.

This meant Tsolov – who had been watching from the pit wall with his Campos team – had done enough to seal the Aramco Pole Position Award, with Bilinski set to join him on the front row for Sunday, ahead of Boya and Voisin. Once the action resumed with three minutes and 21 seconds left, only Tim Tramnitz could complete two flying laps. The MP Motorsport driver's lap was good enough for P3, putting him in sixth for the Feature Race behind PREMA Racing's Noel León – who was third-fastest in Group A. Alessandro Giusti and Martinius Stenshorne are set to line up on the front row after finishing sixth-fastest in their groups, with the former on pole.

There was some drama only a couple of minutes in when Leclerc locked up and went deep at Mirabeau Haute, but he managed to avoid any damage, reverse his Ferrari out of the run-off area and continue on his way. Stroll confirmed that when he told his engineer “I didn't hear you” ahead of the impact. There was also a sign of things to come in Qualifying – particularly Q1 – as drivers squabbled for track position, leaving Pierre Gasly frustrated by some slow-moving cars at the Nouvelle Chicane and Verstappen fuming after he was forced to bail out of a lap. While Leclerc improved again to eclipse Norris' benchmark and move into the 1m11s bracket, an exasperated radio message – claiming “we are nowhere” in terms of car balance – implied that there is still plenty of work to do at Ferrari. 2025 Monaco GP FP1: Leclerc runs into the back of Stroll's Aston Martin in first practice READ MORE: Driving test nerves, forming a Ferrari band and Harry Potter's magic – Getting to know the real Charles Leclerc Driving test nerves, forming a Ferrari band and Harry Potter's magic – Getting to know the real Charles Leclerc WATCH: Drivers and team bosses react after getting their own ‘F1' movie screening in Monaco Stroll hit with grid penalty after Leclerc clash in opening Monaco GP practice Hamilton hails ‘really positive' driver response to ‘F1' movie screening as he promises ‘edge of your seat' experience for fans</p>
