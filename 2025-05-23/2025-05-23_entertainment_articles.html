                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billy Joel has canceled all 17 shows he had scheduled for 2025 after announcing a recent diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). This brain disorder is caused by the accumulation of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's ventricles, leading to a host of cognitive and physical problems, especially gait, coordination, and bladder control issues. In a statement, Joel's team said the musician had been having problems with his “hearing, vision, and balance,” and that he's “undergoing specific physical therapy” as he recovers. “I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience,” Joel himself said, “and thank you for understanding.” But Dr. Charles Matouk, a neurosurgeon and professor at the Yale School of Medicine, tells Rolling Stone that NPH is probably “much more common than we think. But unlike those diseases, there's a fairly straightforward way to detect NPH and address some of its most debilitating symptoms. “NPH, in and of itself, is not going to kill you like cancer or a heart attack, but it is going to decrease your quality of life,” Matouk says. But if detected and treated early, he adds, “You can significantly improve people.” There's ongoing research into whether there's a genetic predisposition to the condition, Matouk says, but at the moment, doctors don't have a solid genetic marker for it. Joel was able to get back on his feet and finish his set, but a month later, he announced that he was postponing future shows after undergoing surgery for a “medical condition” that required physical therapy.) One is an inability to get out of a deep couch or chair, especially one that doesn't have arms to push off of; the other is a sharp decline in handwriting quality. In both instances, Matouk says, it's a coordination issue caused by the NPH. As for the kind of cognitive decline caused by NPH, it's “much more mild” than Alzheimer's or dementia, Matouk says. With no single diagnostic test available to detect NPH, doctors rely on these pieces of clinical evidence, along with CAT scans or MRIs of the brain, to show where fluid has built up. But the final diagnosis doesn't come until after doctors perform a spinal tap — drawing fluid from a person's back and then seeing if they get better. “And patients can often get better in like an hour,” Matouk says. Metallica, Billy Joel Docs, Miley Cyrus Visual Album Lead 2025 Tribeca's Music-Heavy Lineup ‘Billy Joel: And So It Goes' Documentary to Premiere at 2025 Tribeca Festival New Billy Joel Doc on HBO Will Dive Into Subjects Not ‘Explored Before' Clinical trials are also underway for a far less invasive, more accessible treatment that would achieve the same thing by tapping into blood vessels via a small puncture in the thigh or groin. But they're not an outright cure, and Matouk pushes back against the perception of NPH as a kind of reversible dementia, saying, “Even with treatment, the memory problems are not improved to nearly as great an extent as gait and bladder control.” Now Other Parents Are Rethinking How Much They Share Online Whether this means someone like Joel could reach a place where he's able to perform again is an open question.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(Updated with more details, Halle Berry correction) A Will Smith music video shoot in West Hollywood is facing union picket lines today after producers pink slipped the entire crew last night. IATSE is on the street outside Quixote West Hollywood Studios right now after Breathe Entertainment fired the 35-person crew on Thursday over contract dispute. Already on site this morning were replacement workers a.k.a. However, technically he didn't cross a picket line as union members were not yet in formation when the King Richard star showed up in his white Lamborghini early Friday, I'm told. The shoot at Quixote is for a track from that Based On A True Story album distributed by indie label Slang Records, sources say. Though video shoots do not fall under union regulations, crews can seek guild mandated benefits and recognition – which is what occurred here. Which is why the initial crew was canned. Fellow Oscar winner Halle Berry was said to be scheduled to show up later today, as we previously reported from multiple sources. However, even with some ex-crew insisting Berry was expected, reps for the Oscar winner got back to Deadline and vehemently denied their client has anything to do with this L.A. shoot. That lack of involvement has now been clarified to be for no other reason than The Union star is in France today at the Cannes Film Festival, where she is a member of the jury. Spokespeople and agents for the CAA-repped Smith did not respond to requests for comment on the fluid situation when contacted by Deadline. STRIKE ALERT: The IATSE is on strike against a Will Smith music video produced by Breathe Entertainment and will be picketing at Quixote West Hollywood Studios today unless a fair contract is offered to the crew. Breathe Entertainment also did not respond to Deadline's request for comment on what went down. A spokesperson for Quixote this morning confirmed the union activity outside.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actress is notorious for finding the good while facing her fair share of tough stuff, including seeing son Bennett, her second child with husband Ryan Goodell, through three life-saving surgeries. Now seven, Bennett was born in 2017 with multiple life-threatening congenital heart defects (CHDs), requiring three heart surgeries — the first at just five days old — at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA). The unknowns surrounding his health were terrifying for DeLoach's family, but on May 21, 2025, she told Us Weekly that one silver lining of the experience was that it forced her to find her voice and speak up for what matters. Raised in Georgia, DeLoach said she was taught “to be seen and not heard.” But that way of being didn't fly when her child was in crisis, needing someone to advocate for him. Speaking up for Bennett, gave DeLoach the confidence to speak up for herself, her family (including Bennett's older brother Hudson, 11), as well as other people and initiatives she cares deeply about. DeLoach continues to advocate for Bennett, who is thriving but still requires monitoring, and she also uses her voice to speak up raise awareness and money for causes that matter to her, including children's heart health. … I hope by the time I take my last breath in this world that it will just be a part of the screening of every newborn.” DeLoach's advocacy work includes serving as president of the CHLA Foundation's Board of Trustees, fundraising for the Alzheimer's Association, and sitting on the board of Mind What Matters, a nonprofit devoting to supporting caregivers. DeLoach also learned through her son's health crisis how much support caregivers need but rarely receive. “My husband went to work every day, and it was just me (at home),” she told EntertainmentNow in December, noting that many parents struggle to juggle being caregivers to chronically ill children while also bringing in an income. “You know, some people have to quit their jobs. They struggle with being able to get to their own doctor's appointments, which is why we hear that sometimes caregivers go down before the actual person who is sick.” “The load that they carry is so big and so heavy,” DeLoach said, “and so I understand why so many caregivers and first responders, nurses and firefighters … love Hallmark because, for 90 minutes, you get to disappear into a world where everything is going to be okay, where there is a happy ending.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A day after officials for the Windy City announced they had reached a settlement with Smollett, the performer says he's giving $50,000 to one local organization, and an additional $10,000 to another. “After repeatedly refusing to pay the City, I was presented with an opportunity to make a charitable donation in exchange for the case being dismissed,” he went on to say (see Smollett's full statement below). Donald Trump Threatens New Tariffs On Apple And The European Union Jennifer Aniston's Gatecrashing Stalker Is Judged Mentally Incompetent By Expert, But Accused Wants Second Opinion  - Update That turn of events followed a Chicago jury delivering a guilty verdict against Smollett in December 2021 on five felony charges, including lying to the police about the alleged 2019 hate crime attack in the early hours of January 29, 2019 — an attack that at the time even garnered the short-lived sympathy of then first term president Donald Trump. Soon afterwards Smollett's story started to fall apart at the seems and, dumped from the one-time blockbuster Danny Strong and Lee Daniels-created hip hop drama, the actor found himself in and out of court, jail and more in quick succession. At one point, local prosecutors had agreed to drop the charges against the actor as part of an agreement that he would forfeit his $10,000 bond and perform community service. Today, Smollett closed that chapter in his life. “Over six years ago, after it was reported I had been jumped, City officials in Chicago set out to convince the public that I willfully set an assault against myself,” he said Friday. “This false narrative has left a stain on my character that will not soon disappear. He added: “However, despite arduous and expensive attempts to punish me, I am innocent both in the eyes of God and of our criminal justice system. What I have to do now is move forward. I will continue creating my art, fighting passionately for causes I hold dear and defending my integrity and family name with the truth.” While no longer a regular on network TV like he was in the heyday of Empire, Smollett has tried to pick up the reigns of his career in recent years. Over six years ago, after it was reported I had been jumped, City officials in Chicago set out to convince the public that I willfully set an assault against myself. This false narrative has left a stain on my character that will not soon disappear. After repeatedly refusing to pay the City, I was presented with an opportunity to make a charitable donation in exchange for the case being dismissed. Despite what happened there politically, Chicago was my home for over 5 years and the people became my family. Therefore, making a donation to benefit Chicago communities that are too often neglected by those in power will always be something I support. I've made a $50,000.00 donation to Building Brighter Futures (BBF) Center for the Arts, a local nonprofit doing incredible work nurturing self-expression, creativity and exploration of the arts for Chicago youth. This organization was of my choosing and I'm comforted that there will be at least one winner from this experience. Though I was exonerated by the Illinois Supreme Court in a unanimous decision and the civil case is now dismissed, I'm aware that it will not change everyone's mind about me or the attack I experienced. However, despite arduous and expensive attempts to punish me, I am innocent both in the eyes of God and of our criminal justice system. What I have to do now is move forward. I will continue creating my art, fighting passionately for causes I hold dear and defending my integrity and family name with the truth. In their honor, I am donating an additional $10,000.00 to the Chicago Torture Justice Center who provides resources to communities healing from the violence of the Chicago Police Department.

It's certainly not as discussed as an archetype, but it appears there is: The “Cannes movie” is a French drama with light comedic notes, attuned to small moments, often related to a coming-of-age theme (at any age), a certain literary open-endedness, minimal camera movements, and no or little score. Not all of these attributes need to be present, but usually some combination is. This can be anything from “The 400 Blows” to 2024's Directors' Fortnight opener “This Life of Mine” to even something as visually extravagant as 2025's animated film “Arco.” Related Stories ‘Young Mothers' Review: Taut and Tender Drama About a Home for Teenage Moms Shows What the Dardennes Do Best Cannes 2025 Films Sold So Far: Oliver Laxe's ‘Sirât' Acquired by Neon Cinematic autofiction, it's her reflective account of her own experience growing up with a disabled sister whose actual diagnosis remained elusive for years. Sometimes, she erupts in screams of agonizing pain. In one humorous moment in Japy's film, Bertille, played by the non-disabled actress Sarah Pachoud, wanders off while having lunch with her family at an outdoor restaurant, sits on a random male patron's lap, and steals some of his food, which she brings back to her own family's table. That moment captures the triumph of Japy's film: Living with someone dealing with a severe disability is not always sturm und drang every moment. It's obviously difficult, and in many ways defining, but it doesn't have to be solely defining. Even as much as her sister's experience has affected the life of Marion (Angelina Woreth), the stand-in for Japy herself. Some details of Japy's story are changed: She was already working as an actress and in her 20s when she finally found out Bertille's diagnosis. Which meant that treatment was impossible, and that the eventual outcome of her condition was uncertain, too. Could it be that she had a condition that could result in her dropping dead at any moment? We think we live in a time of such advanced medicine that ascertaining the cause of any condition is possible, but some diagnoses do remain out of reach. Not knowing whether her sister or their daughter will live or not, or what to expect from any moment of being around her, has put Marion and her parents in a kind of ongoing limbo. Marion doesn't really know how to live her own life. So much of her attention has been directed toward her sister that Marion decides to “embrace life” by embarking on a misguided romance with a man twice her age. Their parents, played by Pierre-Yves Cardinal and Mélanie Laurent, who gave Japy a role in her own directorial effort “Breathe,” have been affected similarly: Laurent's character doesn't allow herself to feel too much just in case she has to deal with a sudden loss at any moment, and Cardinal's character hasn't ever even told his work colleagues that he has a second daughter, thinking that knowledge of her disability might harm his career. But by the end, this has become an affecting family drama, and one that taps powerfully into uncertainty as a way of life. But if this is a “Cannes movie,” it is a Cannes movie par excellence, and hopefully one that's just the springboard for a rich career behind the camera for Japy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience," the rock star wrote in a statement. Billy Joel is canceling all of his upcoming shows due to a health issue affecting his ability to perform, the musician announced Friday (May 23). “This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,” his statement reads. “Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. According to Cleveland Clinic, normal pressure hydrocephalus is a condition that occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull, pressing on the brain. It can affect “several brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more,” with treatment involving implanting a shunt to drain the excess fluid. Joel had several shows planned throughout the summer and fall of this year, as well as a few performances scheduled for the first half of 2026. The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer previously delayed several of those tour dates by four months after revealing that he had recently undergone surgery. Joel did not disclose his medical condition at that time. “I look forward to getting back on stage and sharing the joy of live music with our amazing fans. “Each [venue] holds personal significance to me,” Joel had told Billboard of the feat in early February. Joel's health update comes shortly after it was announced that his upcoming two-part documentary, Billy Joel: And So It Goes, will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's move to block Harvard from accepting foreign applicants on student visas is the latest escalation in an ongoing feud between MAGA Republicans and America's most prestigious educational institutions. “I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the university on Thursday. “It is a privilege to enroll foreign students, and it is also a privilege to employ aliens on campus […] Harvard is prohibited from having any aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status for the 2025-2026 academic school year. This decertification also means that existing aliens on F- or J- nonimmigrant status must transfer to another university in order to maintain their nonimmigrant status.” In an open letter to students, faculty, and staff, Harvard President Alan M. Garber wrote that Noem's letter “continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body.” Friday's lawsuit states that “there is no lawful justification for the government's unprecedented  revocation of Harvard's [Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)] certification, and the government has not offered any.” Billy Joel Cancels All Concerts After Brain Disorder Diagnosis Now Other Parents Are Rethinking How Much They Share Online Take the World's Hardest Rolling Stones Quiz On Thursday, Noem was asked on Fox News about the prospect of a lawsuit challenging the administration's push to revoke student visas. “I am on the side of America and they need to be too.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney's live-action redo 'Lilo & Stitch' boasts the biggest preview of the year so far and seventh-biggest ever for a PG title, while Tom Cruise's final 'M:I' movie hit a franchise high. Lilo & Stitch grossed a huge $14.5 million in previews, the largest preview gross of the year to date and a Memorial Day record for Disney's live-action studio after besting The Little Mermaid ($10.3 million) and Aladdin ($7 million), not adjusted for inflation. In terms of Disney's larger film empire, it also beat Memorial Day entry Solo: A Star Wars Story ($14.1 million). And overall, it is the seventh-biggest preview gross of any PG title, including Disney's recent animated  blockbuster Moana 2 ($13.8 million). 'Avengers: Doomsday' and 'Avengers: Secret Wars' Delay Release Dates From May to December Now, it's $165 million, a jaw-dropping gross that would, in an ironic twist, see Lilo & Stitch supplant Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick ($160 million) as the biggest Memorial Day opener of all time, not adjusted for inflation. Stitch isn't just drawing interest from families; it's popping big time among teenage girls and younger women — i.e., Gen Z and younger Millennials — who grew up on the first movie and resulting TV show about a Hawaiian girl with a fraught family life who adopts an adorable, albeit trouble-making, dog-like alien. Box office pundits say the nostalgic factor is running high, just as it did among Millennials and Gen Z'ers for Disney's live-action Aladdin, which made $1.1 billion in global ticket sales after getting families, teens and younger adults. It has a current Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 72 percent. (Both Lilo and M:I presently have a RT audience score of 93 percent.) The film, with a current RT critics score of 80 percent, is expected to more than make up for the lackluster $54.7 million bow of Dead Reckoning, as well as supplant the $61.2 million three-day launch of Fallout to set a new franchise opening record by a mile. Overseas, Lilo & Stitch is likewise going up against Final Reckoning. In a number of territories, it has scored the highest opening day of the year so far, including in China, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France and Italy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the summer of 2021, a man identified as John Doe sued Afrika Bambaataa, accusing the hip-hop pioneer of sexually abusing him and sex trafficking him between 1991 and 1995. Bambaataa, whose legal name is Lance Taylor, never entered a legal response to Doe's lawsuit, so Judge Alexander M. Tisch has now granted a default judgment against him “without opposition,” online New York court records show. As a result, Bambaataa has effectively lost the lawsuit, and “an assessment of damages against defendant Lance Taylor shall be referred to a Special Referee for inquest.” Pitchfork was unable to reach Bambaataa in 2021, and contacts for the musician have not responded to new requests for comment. Pitchfork has also reached out to Doe's attorneys, Hugo G. Ortega and Rehan Nazrali, for comment on the judgment. John Doe filed his lawsuit some five years after Ronald Savage came forward to say that Afrika Bambaataa sexually abused him, in the 1980s, when he was a minor. Bambaataa denied Savage's claims, calling them “baseless” and “false,” but, shortly after, more men alleged that they were also sexually abused as children by the musician. Bambaataa denied those claims, too, and he has since largely stayed out of the public eye.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We asked Tom if he had any songs in progress that might suit Saint Etienne, and he sent a backing track that he'd been working on with Jez from Doves,” Saint Etienne vocalist Sarah Cracknell said in a statement. Pete Wiggs added, “The song is about taking pleasure in everyday things like nature and the outdoors when life is otherwise getting you down.” Along with Tom Rowlands and Jez Williams, International has contributions from Confidence Man, Erol Alkan, Vince Clarke, Nick Heyward, Orbital's Paul Hartnoll, and Xenomania's Tim Powell. Formed in London in 1990, by childhood friends Wiggs and Bob Stanley, Saint Etienne put out two singles that same year—“Kiss and Make Up” and their cover of Neil Young's “Only Love Can Break Your Heart”—before they added Cracknell for “Nothing Can Stop Us.” All three songs appeared on the band's 1991 debut, Foxbase Alpha, which kicked off a decade-defining run of albums, most notable among them 1993's sophomore effort So Tough, 1994's Tiger Bay, and 1998's Good Humor. Since their return, in 2012, with Words and Music by Saint Etienne, however, the band has consistently put out new records, among them Home Counties (2017) and I've Been Trying to Tell You (2021). According to a press release, “The group aren't splitting up as such—they still remain the best of friends after 35 years recording together—but they don't feel like they want to go on forever and wanted to go out with a bang.” All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chesney brought No Shoes Nation to the Las Vegas Strip in an immensely enjoyable show. Las Vegas may be landlocked, but Kenny Chesney took fans to the beach Thursday night (May 22) in the opening night of his 15-date Sphere run. His passionate No Shoes Nation fanbase has followed him into stadiums, which he has filled for 20 years, so to see him in the 18,000-seat Sphere is a chance to view him relatively close up (despite the crazy steep pitch of the four levels). Throughout the show, Chesney exhibited a welcome spirit of gratitude for his fans, excitement over his first Las Vegas residency (no starting small for him), and elation at being back on stage, noting this was his first show of 2025. As anyone who's seen one of his stadium shows knows, Chesney thrives on contact with prosceniums that extend far out into audience. Chesney, a 2025 Country Music Hall of Fame inductee, has logged 33 No. 1 in 1997 with “She's Got It All,” and most recently topped the chart last year with “Take Her Home.” In between have been such hits as “The Good Stuff,” “Living in Fast Forward,” “Don't Blink,” “American Kids,” “Better as a Memory” and “No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem.” 1s and still had the show go longer than two hours), but he also trotted out deeper cuts and lesser performed tunes to create a one-of-a-kind show. It feels like each act who plays Sphere builds on the amazing special effects and visuals from the acts who came before them and betters them, but Chesney's opening sequence was truly spectacular and honestly felt like a theme-park dark ride attraction. Sphere's 270-degree wraparound screen (which covers 160,000 square feet) took us deep-sea diving through a shipwreck and further into the abyss, surrounded by sharks and schools of fish before coming to the surface where multi-masted pirate ships sailed with No Shoes Nation flags flying. So, in other words, make sure you're in your seat when the show starts because you really don't want to miss this thrill ride. Without pandering, Chesney played tribute to Las Vegas in ways both big and small. During “Living in Fast Forward,” one of Chesney's most enjoyable, upbeat songs 20 years after its release, he incorporated footage of a NASCAR race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. A little more than half-way through, Chesney huddled with band and crew. They poured a few drinks (made with Blue Chair Rum, no doubt), some of which Chesney and band handed out to audience members. Chesney then said they were deciding what to do next (that's a nice twist to do every show and add in songs not on the setlist) before launching into 1999's “She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy.”  Shortly into the song, Kelsea Ballerini, in a sparkly silver dress, appeared on stage. Chesney seemed genuinely surprised and mightily delighted to be reunited with his fellow Knoxville native and former touring partner, grabbing her in a sweet bear hug, and expressed his surprise again after they finished the song. They then launched into “Half of My Hometown,” their 2021 duet that went straight to No. 1, with Ballerini telling him, “I love you,” at the end, and his answering, “I love you, too.” They then finished with “You & Tequila,” his bittersweet 2011 duet with Grace Potter (as the song's video played in the background). Their friendship and affection for each other was sweetly palpable. He noted that she wasn't the only friend in attendance, namechecking Van Halen's Michael Anthony and football great Peyton Manning. And in a world divided, words like “Always give love the upper hand” and “Make a friend, can't we all get along?” feel like so much more than just platitudes; they feel like Chesney's Commandments and necessary. Throughout the evening, Chesney's good vibes prevailed, turning Sphere into a big love-in. Fans don't usually look to Chesney for statement songs or tunes that address social issues, but “Welcome to the Fishbowl,” the title track to his 2012 album, was downright prophetic, looking at the way social media and technology were going to change our world—in many ways for the worse. Little did I know it was a glimpse into the future,” Chesney said. The visuals were especially strong, with Chesney appearing from inside a mobile phone. Prior to starting his residency, Chesney said he would be digging deep into the catalog, as well as bringing the hits, and did he ever. Right after “Fishbowl,” he launched into “One Lonely Island,” from his most recent album, Born. It was the first time he'd done the ballad about two lost souls drifting toward each other for a little comfort or “a night of healin',” as Chesney sings. “Thanks for letting us do that,” Chesney said afterwards, but the pleasure was all ours.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She was partnered with professional dancer Derek Hough, and the pair won that season. Bindi has since spoken about what an incredible experience being on the show was, and Robert is also hoping to have a positive journey. Still, he's nervous, having never done anything like this before. “I'm just going to get real for a second, I'm so nervous,” the wildlife conservationist told Us Weekly in an interview published on May 18. Some fans may find it surprising to learn that Robert is nervous because of the adventurous life he lives. He deals with venemous creatures and large reptiles almost daily, but he jokingly told Us Weekly that showing off his dancing skills makes him more nervous than “jumping on a crocodile.” Robert is thankful to have the support of his sister. In the caption, she encouraged him and expressed her excitement about his casting. Some may feel that Robert has a unique advantage because he can ask Bindi for advice on handling the experience, possibly dealing with the nerves, and offering more information on what to expect (although we would imagine every dancer's journey is unique to them). Robert spoke about his sister and how “grateful” he was to have her. He continued, “Not only did she do ‘Dancing With the Stars,' I mean, she won ‘Dancing With the Stars,' and just was such an incredible shining light. I remember watching [her] on that show just thinking, ‘This is the coolest thing ever. But Bindi believes it will not be her brother's dancing skills that will over audiences, but his attitude to the whole process. The way these siblings speak about each other with kindness and respect highlights their close bond.</p>
