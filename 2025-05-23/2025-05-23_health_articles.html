                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With funding from the Spencer Foundation, a private foundation focused on funding education studies, a Wayne State University research team is examining the long-term effects of bullying and mental health on social and academic progress in adolescents. Hannah L. Schacter, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and an affiliate faculty at the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute, received the grant alongside her co-principal investigator, Adam Hoffman, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences. The one-year grant for nearly $50,000 is funded through the Foundation's Small Research Grants on Education program and will benefit their study, "Understanding the Effects of Peer Victimization and Mental Health in High School on College Persistence." The grant focuses on how adolescents' peer experiences during high school affect their long-term outcomes, specifically their academic persistence during college. We have quite a bit of evidence that kids who are bullied by their peers not only do worse in terms of their mental health, but they also experience negative academic effects. Schacter said that researchers know much less about how such effects linger beyond high school, particularly on young people's academic progress. "We have an ongoing longitudinal study that we started in the fall of 2020 with a cohort of ninth graders," Schacter said. This grant allows us to continue to observe this cohort in college and see if their previous experiences with bullying are affecting them academically or socially after high school." "I'd like to recruit another larger cohort in the future to compare some of what we are seeing among students who weren't in high school during COVID." "This funding from the Spencer Foundation will allow Dr. Schacter and her research team to gain valuable insight into the long-term effect that bullying has on our younger generation," said Ezemenari M. Obasi, Ph.D., vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. "I look forward to seeing the impact of this important work."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening complication in children with serious underlying conditions such as heart defects or cancer. Treatment or prevention of thrombosis poses an additional challenge in everyday clinical practice. A therapy using the active ingredient rivaroxaban specifically tailored to children was successfully tested for the first time in 2020. Now, long-term data confirm the benefits of this drug treatment even for extended use. The study assessed extended treatment in a cohort of around 500 children and adolescents from the EINSTEIN Jr study, whose data on acute phase anticoagulation was already published in 2020. Those study results, also published under the leadership of MedUni Vienna, showed that the anticoagulant rivaroxaban is at least as effective and safe as the standard anticoagulants used to date in children with venous thromboembolism, but also offers a number of advantages for young patients. Until now, there has been a lack of research on extended anticoagulation in children with VTE, and with rivaroxaban in particular - a gap now closed by the recently published long-term study: The research shows that even with long-term treatment of up to one year, there is only a low risk of VTE recurrence and serious bleeding. Rivaroxaban is therefore the first scientifically proven age-appropriate alternative to the standard anticoagulation therapies available for children up to now. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs when blood clots form in deep veins causing local vessel obstruction or embolization of the clot to the lungs - a potentially life-threatening condition. While this condition has been well researched in adults, there has long been a lack of solid data for children. Until recently, treatment with anticoagulant drugs was based on the off-label use of drugs that were originally developed for adults, such as heparin or vitamin K antagonists. These drugs have some disadvantages that are particularly problematic for children, such as administration by injection and the need for regular blood tests. Direct oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban, which have several advantages in practical use, were also originally developed for adults, but in recent years have been specifically adapted for children and tested in clinical trials. Our EINSTEIN Jr. study and the long-term investigation now available show that rivaroxaban is an effective and safe option for preventing recurrent thrombosis in children, not only during for acute treatment but also extended treatment - and thus offers the first scientifically sound, age-appropriate alternative to existing standard therapies."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) may have an "on-off switch" that lets them pause and restart growth, according to a new study from the University of Surrey and the University of Oxford. The research helps explain why TB is so hard to treat with antibiotics and could pave the way for better drugs. In a study published in The EMBO Journal, researchers show how Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses a reversible process called ADP-ribosylation to modify its DNA and control both replication and gene activity. It is the first time this kind of DNA modification has been shown to regulate key processes like gene expression and DNA copying in any organism. We've found a way that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can slow down its growth and potentially allow it to hide from the immune response and resist antibiotics. By showing that ADP-ribosylation of DNA can control both replication and gene expression, we've discovered a new layer of regulation that could be key to understanding TB's persistence. If we can target this process, we could make the bacteria easier to eliminate - especially in the slow-growing or dormant states that current treatments struggle to reach." The study focused on two enzymes: DarT, which adds the ADP-ribose tag to DNA, and DarG, which removes it. When DarT is active, it stops the bacteria from copying their DNA and dividing. This start-and-stop control may help the bacteria survive in harsh conditions, making them more resilient during long-term infections. To find out more about how this molecular switch works, the researchers used a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system to selectively reduce levels of DarG. The team then used a technique called ADPr-Seq to map where these tags appeared across the genome, alongside live-cell imaging and RNA sequencing to track changes in DNA replication, cell division and gene expression. According to the World Health Organization, TB kills 1.25 million people globally every year. In 2023, around 10.8 million people fell ill with the disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists have developed a new surgical technique for implanting multiple tissue grafts in the eye's retina. The findings in animals may help advance treatment options for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is a leading cause of vision loss among older Americans. A report about the technique published today in JCI Insight. Scientists are testing therapies for restoring damaged retinas with grafts of tissue grown in the lab from patient-derived stem cells. Until now, surgeons have only been able to place one graft in the retina, limiting the area that can be treated in patients, and as well as the ability to conduct side-by-side comparisons in animal models. For the technique, investigators designed a new surgical clamp that maintains eye pressure during the insertion of two tissue patches in immediate succession while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue. In animal models, the scientists used their newly designed surgical technique to compare two different grafts placed sequentially in the same experimentally induced AMD-like lesion. One graft consisted of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells grown on a biodegradable scaffold. RPE cells support and nourish the retina's light-sensing photoreceptors. Post surgery, scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze retinal images and compare the effects of each graft. They observed that the RPE grafts promoted the survival of photoreceptors, while photoreceptors near scaffold-only grafts died at a much higher rate. iPSC-RPE patch restores photoreceptors and regenerates choriocapillaris in a pig retinal degeneration model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's also a retired doctor, so he knows getting covid-19 could be dangerous for him — his underlying illness puts him at high risk of serious complications and death. To avoid getting sick, he stays away from large gatherings, and he's comforted knowing healthy people who get boosters protect him by reducing his exposure to the virus. Vaccine opponents and skeptics in charge of federal health agencies — starting at the top with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — are restricting access to covid shots that were a signature accomplishment of President Donald Trump's first term and cost taxpayers about $13 billion to develop, produce, and distribute. The agencies are narrowing vaccination recommendations, pushing drugmakers to perform costly clinical studies, and taking other steps that will result in fewer people getting protection from a virus that still kills hundreds each week in the U.S. "For people who are immunocompromised, if there aren't enough people vaccinated, we lose the ring that's protecting us. The Trump administration on May 20 rolled out tougher approval requirements for covid shots, described as a covid-19 "vaccination regulatory framework," that could leave millions of Americans who want boosters unable to get them. The FDA will encourage new clinical trials on the widely used vaccines before approving them for children and healthy adults. Under the new guidance, vaccines will be available for high-risk individuals and seniors. But the FDA will encourage drugmakers to commit to conducting post-marketing clinical trials in healthy adults when the agency approves covid vaccines for those populations. They have been available each fall after being updated to reflect circulating strains of the virus, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials. "We have launched down this multiyear campaign of booster after booster after booster," he said, adding that "we do not have gold-standard science to support this for average-risk, low-risk Americans." The details were outlined in a May 20 article in The New England Journal of Medicine, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. Instead, they reflect a different regulatory stance from Kennedy, who has a history of anti-vaccine activism, and Makary, who has questioned the safety data on covid mRNA shots. It remains unclear when the changes will go into effect or whether there will be any public comment period. The announcement is rattling some patient advocacy groups, doctors, nursing home leaders, and researchers who worry about the ramifications. They say higher-risk individuals will be more likely to get covid if people who aren't at risk don't get boosters that can help reduce transmission. And they say the FDA's restrictions go too far, because they don't provide exceptions for healthy individuals who work in high-risk settings, such as hospitals, who may want a covid booster for protection. And the FDA's new stance could also increase vaccine hesitancy by undermining confidence in covid vaccines that have already been subject to rigorous safety review, said Kate Broderick, chief innovation officer at Maravai Life Sciences, which makes mRNA products for use in vaccine development. "For the public, it raises questions," she said. There is an incredible body of data and over 10 billion doses given." Some doctors and epidemiologists say it could leave healthy people especially vulnerable if more virulent strains of covid emerge and they can't access covid shots. "It's not based on science," said Rob Davidson, an emergency room doctor in Michigan and executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care, which works to expand health care access. "It's what we were all worried would happen. Current federal regulators say there is no high-quality evidence showing that vaccinating healthy people, including health workers who are near or around immunocompromised people, provides an additional benefit. "It is possible, actually, that such approvals and strategies provide false reassurance and lead to increased harms," Prasad said. The covid vaccines underwent clinical trials to assess safety, and they have been subject to ongoing surveillance and monitoring since they obtained emergency use authorization from the FDA amid the pandemic. Heart issues and allergic reactions can occur but are rare, according to the CDC. On a separate track, the FDA on May 21 posted letters sent in April to makers of the mRNA covid vaccines to add information about possible heart injury on warning labels, a move that one former agency official described as overkill. The action came after the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a panel of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, held a hearing on alleged adverse events associated with covid vaccines. Limiting boosters to healthy people goes against guidance from some medical groups. The covid booster clampdown is supported by many adherents of the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, which casts suspicion on traditional medicine. Some opponents of covid mRNA vaccines say without evidence that the shots cause "turbo" cancer, are genetic bioweapons, and cause more heart damage than the covid virus. There is no evidence the shots lead to rapid and aggressive cancers. Cancer rates decreased an average of 1.7% per year for men and 1.3% for women from 2018 to 2022, according to the National Institutes of Health. "I think there's a void of data," Makary told CBS News on April 29. "And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data." A massive five-year study on covid vaccine safety by the Global Vaccine Data Network, involving millions of people, was underway, with about a year left before completion. There are a multitude of studies, however, on the vaccines' effectiveness in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Limiting boosters for healthy people can be risky, some doctors say, because people don't always know when they fall into higher-risk categories, such as individuals who are prediabetic or have high blood pressure. The covid vaccine restrictions could deter them from getting boosted, and they might experience worse complications from the virus as a result. For example, about 40% of people with hepatitis C are unaware of their condition, according to a study published in 2023. While deaths from the virus have dropped, covid remains a risk, especially when cases peak in December and January. Some high-risk individuals are worried that the new restrictions are just the first salvo in halting all access to mRNA shots. "The HHS motivation really is hidden, and it's to dismiss all mRNA technology," said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. Rose Keller, 23, is concerned about future access to covid shots. She would be eligible under the current announcement — she has cystic fibrosis, a progressive genetic condition that makes the mucus in her lungs thick and sticky, so covid could land her in the hospital. But she is concerned the Trump administration may go further and restrict access to the vaccines as part of a broader opposition to mRNA technology. "I've had every booster that's available to me," said Keller, a government employee in Augusta, Maine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving. But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill," would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits. While enacting much of Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance. Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says. Two of the states — Utah and Illinois — have "trigger" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured. The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization. California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15. In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court. Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020. "We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut," he said. Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants. Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding. "This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in," Slonaker said. In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. "It would be a hard situation, obviously," she said. Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status. She said the provision shows Republicans' "hostility against immigrants" and that "they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage." U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as "an open doormat," inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling. The poll found that Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, helping reduce the national uninsured rate to a historic low. By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services. The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF. Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to "support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens." Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a "red herring" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023. The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do. The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs. The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces. The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a group of genetic disorders that lead to progressive vision loss as the light-sensing cells of the eye-the photoreceptors-die due to mutations in genes needed for their function and survival. Yet, most existing gene therapy strategies have been developed and tested in early disease stages-leaving a major gap in treating patients diagnosed after significant retinal damage has already occurred. Now, in a study published in Molecular Therapy, researchers from the Division of Experimental Retinal Therapies at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine (Penn Vet) and their collaborators have developed a powerful new toolkit to help close that gap. Led by Penn Vet's Raghavi Sudharsan, an assistant professor of experimental ophthalmology, and William A. Beltran, the Corinne R. Henry Bower Endowed Professor of Ophthalmology, the team developed four novel photoreceptor-specific promoters. These "short segments of DNA act as molecular 'switches' to turn on the therapeutic gene in target cells, driving strong and specific gene expression in rod and cone photoreceptors even in mid-to-late stages of disease," explains Sudharsan, the lead author on the paper. "Most currently-used promoters have been tested only in healthy animal models, and their performance often declines when the retina degenerates," continues Sudharsan. "In contrast," she says, "the newly developed promoters were selected based on their ability to turn on gene activity in retinas that had already lost more than half of their photoreceptors-making them more relevant for the stages of disease at which patients are frequently diagnosed." This study addresses one of the biggest hurdles in IRD treatment: how to deliver effective gene therapy after a large portion of the retina has already degenerated. We were particularly excited by the performance of the GNGT2-based promoters, which showed strong expression in both rods and cones, even at advanced disease stages. And their small size-under 850 base pairs-makes them ideal for [adeno-associated virus] AAV packaging, unlike some conventional cone promoters that are significantly larger." The team also emphasized that the high specificity of these promoters for photoreceptors may help limit off-target effects and reduce potential immune responses-important considerations for safety and long-term efficacy. These include promoters derived from the GNGT2, IMPG2, and PDE6H genes, which demonstrated strong, cell-specific expression when delivered via AAVs into the retinas of canine models mimicking human IRDs. "These findings highlight the importance of testing promoters in clinically relevant models and at appropriate disease stages, something that unfortunately cannot be established in cell cultures or retinal organoids," says senior author William A. Beltran, who directs the Division of Experimental Retinal Therapies. "They lay the foundation for a new generation of gene therapies that are more potent, precise, and responsive to the real-world clinical needs of patients with inherited retinal degenerations, whether people or animals." Raghavi Sudharsan is a research assistant professor of experimental ophthalmology in the Department of Clinical Sciences & Advanced Medicine at Penn Vet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sweeping new analysis reveals that the burden of female infertility has soared over the past three decades, with age-standardized rates rising and women in their late 30s facing the highest risk worldwide. Study: Global, regional, and national burden of female infertility and trends from 1990 to 2021 with projections to 2050 based on the GBD 2021 analysis. Their findings indicate that more than 110 million women were affected by female infertility in 2021, representing an increase of 84% since 1990, with women between 35 and 39 years old being most affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines female infertility as occurring when an individual cannot conceive after having regular and unprotected sex for 12 months. It is important to note that the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, on which this research is based, uses a different definition: primary female infertility is characterized by the failure to conceive a child after 5 years of unprotected intercourse, and secondary infertility was identified in couples who desired a child and had been together for over 5 years without using contraception since their last live birth. This condition can be classified as primary or secondary, with varying prevalence rates. Assisted reproductive treatments like in-vitro fertilization (IVF) incur high costs that range from over $12,000 per cycle in the U.S. to under $4,000 in Japan, based on 2006 United States dollars. The causes of infertility are multifactorial, with fallopian tube blockages, ovulatory disorders, hormonal imbalances, genetic issues, epigenetic mechanisms potentially linked to environmental pollution, and other environmental factors all contributing. Infertility is also associated with elevated risks for gynecological cancers and chronic conditions like endometriosis, which is linked to asthma, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular problems. Despite its broad health and social implications, infertility research remains limited. In this study, researchers used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset to present a comprehensive, age- and region-specific analysis of female infertility prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2021, with projections to 2050 to inform global health strategies and policy development. The GBD database compiles health-related data from household surveys, demographic records, and other validated sources. The analysis included 204 countries and territories grouped into five sociodemographic index (SDI) categories. Cluster analysis was employed to identify regional patterns of change, for instance, noting significant increases in Andean Latin America and decreases in regions like Oceania. Projections from 2022 to 2050 were made using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, estimating future prevalence, DALYs, and age-standardized rates. Correlation analysis was used to assess relationships between socioeconomic variables, such as the Human Development Index (HDI), and infertility prevalence. In 2021, female infertility affected approximately 110 million women worldwide, with an age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) of 1,367.4 for every 100,000 and over 601,000 associated DALYs. Women between 35 and 39 experienced the highest burden, with age-standardized rates about 1.2 times higher than those between 30 and 34. Asia recorded the largest absolute burden, especially China and India. Regarding temporal trends by SDI level, the age-standardized rates (ASR) in low and low-middle-SDI regions initially displayed a decrease, followed by a sharp increase starting around 2010, resulting in an overall upward trend. The paper also notes that when looking at the relationship between ASR and SDI level at a point in time (rather than over time), territories with an SDI under 0.50 showed predominantly stable or slightly decreasing ASR, those with SDIs between 0.50 and 0.75 showed mild fluctuations in ASR, and regions with an SDI above 0.75 experienced a rapid decline in ASR. Furthermore, a statistically significant positive association was found between the Estimated Annual Percent Change (EAPC) in infertility rates and the Human Development Index (HDI), indicating that in countries with high HDI, the incidence of female infertility increased in 2021 but showed a slowing trend when HDI exceeded 0.8. Age-specific analysis showed a sharp rise in infertility among women between 30 and 34. While high-SDI regions saw eventual declines in their ASR trends over time, low- and middle-SDI areas faced sharp increases in their ASR after 2010. Although the global number of women affected by infertility and total DALYs are projected to decline by 2050, the ASPR and DALYs standardized by age will continue to rise. This divergence is driven by population aging, increased infertility risk factors, including potential epigenetic impacts of industrial pollutants, and better diagnostics leading to higher detection rates. Female infertility remains a substantial global health issue, affecting over 9% of women of reproductive age, with a growing prevalence and burden between 1990 and 2021. Factors like delayed childbearing, urbanization, industrial pollution, and potential epigenetic changes likely contribute to the observed trends. Regional disparities, such as rising burdens in Andean Latin America and improvements in areas like Oceania, highlight the need for targeted interventions. Socioeconomic development, high-risk behaviors, and environmental exposures continue to shape fertility trends. A major strength of this study is its global scope, leveraging extensive data. However, limitations include inconsistent data quality across countries and the lack of granular, patient-level details. Despite declining case numbers, female infertility remains a growing burden requiring targeted prevention, early screening, and enhanced reproductive healthcare policies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A University of Arizona Comprehensive Cancer Center researcher received a $2.4 million National Cancer Institute grant to develop a noninvasive, confocal microscope to examine nerve endings of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in the hopes of identifying potential biomarkers for the disease. Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. Patients with CIPN are known to have a reduced number of Meissner corpuscles, which are nerve endings responsible for transmitting the sensations of light touch and low vibration. Dongkyun Kang, PhD, an associate professor of optical sciences at the U of A James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences, hopes to use confocal microscopy images to find and count Meissner corpuscles, eventually leading to a potential imaging biomarker. "Using this approach, we may be able to identify CIPN earlier to stop symptoms from progressing and possibly prevent the condition altogether." Kang's lab has pioneered low-cost confocal microscopy over the past seven years. His team was the first to demonstrate that noninvasive microscopy can be built at low cost, which makes it highly accessible in a wide variety of clinical settings. This study will build the evidence that our noninvasive microscopy approach can provide quantitative imaging biomarkers for CIPN monitoring, treatment and research. This grant will also support a clinical study to evaluate the new microscope in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy." Kang said his goal is to change the diagnostic focus from subjective, qualitative markers, including patient and clinician questionnaires, to objective, quantitative biomarkers that could support personalized care for patients with CIPN. "I'm excited to see how his study evolves, especially given its potential for global impact." This research is supported by the National Cancer Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health, under award no.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emerging evidence links regular sugary drink intake to impaired sperm quality and DNA damage. Find out why experts recommend reducing SSBs for reproductive health. Recommendations for reducing the impact of SSBs on sperm health. Research shows that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is associated with adverse effects on male reproductive health, primarily through hormonal imbalances and oxidative damage. This narrative review has been published in the journal Nutrients. SSBs typically contain high concentrations of caloric sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), sucrose, or fruit juice concentrates. An increase in global SSB consumption by almost 23% between 1990 and 2018 has been noted. Previous studies have also shown that poor semen quality is associated with long-term morbidity and increases hospitalization risks, specifically for diabetic patients or those with cardiovascular conditions. In addition, high sugar intake triggers multiple metabolic conditions, such as insulin resistance, elevated triglycerides, and accelerated ageing. Numerous studies have established a dose-response relationship, which suggests that higher SSB intake exacerbates adverse outcomes. High SSB intake, i.e., regular consumption of more than seven drinks per week, equivalent to 245.0–262.5 grams of sugar, is associated with a significant decline in sperm concentration and motility. Similarly, higher SSB intake was inversely associated with semen volume; compared to non-drinkers, men who drank more than seven SSBs a week generated 6% lower semen volume. However, this reduction in semen volume was not always statistically significant. Previous studies also revealed that higher SSB consumption was negatively associated with sperm motility; however, the impact was found to be relatively modest and not statistically significant. Contradictory findings regarding the association between high SSB intake and a reduction in the percentage of morphologically normal sperm have been documented. Some studies have even reported minimal or positive associations between SSB intake and sperm morphology, indicating inconsistency in the evidence. SSB may cause obesity, which disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, causing impaired gonadotropin responses and altered ultrastructure of ejaculated sperm. A previous study revealed that high SSB intake reduces hormone levels, including inhibin-B, which is associated with a lower sperm count. Hormonal disruptions through reduced inhibin-B/follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) ratios could be the underlying mechanisms correlating the impact of increased oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction on sperm health. SSB induces oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage DNA and impair sperm's fertilization capacity. It also damages the sperm membrane through lipid peroxidation and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, which reduces sperm motility and viability. These damages are typically assessed through molecular assays such as the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA), the comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis), and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling). Chronic oxidative stress also causes accelerated cellular ageing. High sugar-sweetened soda consumption has been associated with shorter leukocyte telomere length in healthy adults, indicating the possible role of SSB in promoting systemic oxidative damage and premature biological aging. Higher SSB consumption also triggers transient hyperglycemia, elevates ROS production, and affects endothelial function in both microvascular and macrovascular circulations. Antioxidant therapy with N-acetylcysteine and apocynin could alleviate vascular dysfunction. Antioxidant supplementation, such as coenzyme Q10, vitamins C and E, and glutathione, has shown positive effects in mitigating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage. However, the review notes that while supplementation may help in certain cases, excessive use could paradoxically impair sperm function, and a balanced, antioxidant-rich diet is recommended as a safer and more sustainable long-term strategy to improve male reproductive health. Some included studies also examined artificially sweetened beverages, which generally showed minimal or no effect on sperm health, but further research is needed to clarify these findings. Based on the current body of evidence, regular consumption of SSBs is associated with reductions in sperm count, motility, and increased DNA fragmentation, which may impair male reproductive health and fertility. However, most of the evidence is observational and does not establish direct causality. A balanced diet rich in antioxidants can help mitigate low sperm count, motility, and volume. Lifestyle modifications and public health measures aimed at reducing SSB consumption, maintaining a healthy BMI, and improving overall metabolic health are recommended as part of a comprehensive approach to supporting male reproductive function. To validate the current evidence pool, longitudinal studies with standardized study design and methodology for semen analysis are essential. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and detailed dietary assessments could help uncover the underlying mechanism by which SSB intake impacts sperm volume and quality. Considering the global population's diverse nutritional and genetic makeup, it is imperative to conduct similar research on Asian populations. It is also important to account for confounding factors such as BMI, physical activity, dietary antioxidant intake, and environmental exposures in future studies to clarify the true relationship between SSB intake and sperm health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Radboudumc researchers Kirsten van Abeelen, Edwin Ardiansyah, Sofiati Dian, Vinod Kumar, Reinout van Crevel and Arjan van Laarhoven used metabolomics to study cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from tuberculous meningitis patients in Vietnam and Indonesia, with long-standing collaborators from Bandung and Jakarta (Indonesia), the Broad Institute (Boston) and the Oxford University Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). Corticosteroids reduce mortality, but nearly 50% of patients still die or are left disabled. The researchers hypothesized that metabolic pathways may influence disease outcome and help develop more effective host-directed therapy. They measured levels of 469 metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 1,067 Vietnamese and Indonesian tuberculous meningitis patients with and without HIV before the start of treatment, and observed these patients for clinical outcome. These metabolites predicted mortality, regardless of HIV status, disease severity and cerebrospinal fluid tryptophan levels, which they previously identified as an important prognostic metabolite. The results suggests that dysregulated β-oxidation may be an important and potentially modifiable contributor to mortality in tuberculous meningitis. Follow-up studies are underway, including quantitative trait locus mapping and rare genetic variant analysis, in the same patient groups. Future intervention studies should examine whether interventions targeting cerebral metabolism or oxygenation can improve survival of this deadly disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The research followed 691 women from pregnancy to midlife and found that those residing in highly vulnerable neighborhoods, particularly within 10 years of perimenopause onset, experienced menopause approximately two years earlier than those in less vulnerable areas. The study, "Neighborhood Vulnerability and Age of Natural Menopause and Menopause Symptoms Among Midlife Women" was published May 22 in JAMA Network Open. Women experiencing more intense menopausal symptoms have demonstrated lower quality of life and cognitive performance. Additionally, women who undergo menopause at an earlier age face a higher risk of developing long-term health issues; specifically, a 1-year decrease in menopause age is linked to 2-3% higher risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality. At present, there are significant gaps in understanding how neighborhood contexts may affect reproductive aging in midlife women. Our research indicates that living in less vulnerable neighborhoods may be a key factor in preventing earlier menopause and reducing future disease risk." Izzuddin Aris, Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor of Population Medicine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and senior author of the study The study included nearly 700 women from Project Viva, a prospective cohort in eastern Massachusetts, followed from April 1999 to August 2021. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was used to measure neighborhood disadvantage, considering factors such as socioeconomic status, household composition, and racial and ethnic minority status. Study findings showed women who resided in neighborhoods with very high (vs. very low) vulnerability exhibited higher risk of earlier natural menopause onset (by approximately 2 years), driven primarily by socioeconomic status and household composition. No associations with menopause symptom severity were observed. "As certain characteristics of disadvantaged neighborhoods, such as limited access to social and economic resources, can be modified through community-led initiatives or policies implemented at the local and federal levels, future research is warranted to investigate whether such strategies could alleviate the association between neighborhood disadvantage and early menopause," added Aris.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on May 8, 2025, titled "The chemopreventive effects of native Brazilian plants on stomach cancer: A review of the last 25 years." The study led by first author Iara Lopes Lemos and corresponding author Mario Roberto Marostica Junior from the University of Campinas reviewed scientific studies published over the past 25 years that examine how native Brazilian plants may help prevent stomach cancer (SC). Their findings suggest that several plant species contain bioactive compounds with potential anticancer properties. Stomach cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers globally and is often diagnosed at advanced stages. However, evidence shows that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in natural compounds like polyphenols and flavonoids may help lower the risk. The reviewed literature suggests that native Brazilian plants may offer similar protective effects. The study covers ten native species, including açaí, cacao, guava, pitanga, jambu, and physalis. Extracts from these plants showed signs of reducing cancer cell growth, triggering cell death, and slowing disease progression. Although the exact biological mechanisms remain unclear for many cases, some studies reported reduced inflammation and disruption of cancer-related signaling. These findings point to the possibility that natural plant-based substances could support efforts to prevent or manage SC. Most of the studies included in the review were conducted on laboratory cell models, with very few using animal models and none involving clinical trials. This limited coverage means that while the early results are promising, more research is needed to understand how these plant compounds work in the human body and to evaluate their safety and effectiveness in real-world settings. This review emphasizes the value of exploring Brazil's rich plant biodiversity for medical purposes. Their work contributes to the growing recognition that traditional and natural sources can play a meaningful role in modern medicine.
