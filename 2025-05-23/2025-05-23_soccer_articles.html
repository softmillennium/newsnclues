                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic's decision to withdraw from the U.S. Men's National Team's (USMNT) Gold Cup roster has ignited controversy across American soccer circles. The Milan star's absence marks a significant development just one year out from the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil, and it has led to both understanding and fierce criticism, especially from former national team players and analysts. These matches are key tune-ups ahead of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which begins June 15. Alongside Pulisic, other notable absentees include Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, and Gio Reyna. The omission, however, wasn't due to injury or performance issues. It was a deliberate decision made in consultation with the U.S. Soccer Federation. “When it comes to Christian Pulisic, here's the problem I have. He is, when all is said and done, going to go down as the best male American soccer player in history… But I cannot relate to someone in his position, who is a national team player, opting out, not wanting to represent your team,” said Lalas. He even compared the 26-year-old's workload and commitment to that of Lionel Messi, saying, “Yes, they play a lot of games. But you know who plays a lot of games? He's not going to be there, and that's disappointing.” World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beppe Marotta says that Inter Milan will discuss a new contract for Simone Inzaghi after the FIFA Club World Cup this summer. The Nerazzurri President spoke to Italian broadcaster DAZN, via FCInterNews, ahead of today's Serie A clash with Como. However, there have been some reports that Inter want to tie their coach's future down more long-term. “He's still under contract for one year,” said the Nerazzurri President. “And then there's one particularly significant thing – we have a great, symbiotic relationship with Inzaghi.” “He's a great professional,” Marotta said of Inter's coach. He called Inzaghi “the architect of this extraordinary cycle.” “We have every desire to continue on with him. “Now's not the time to talk about it,” Marotta then cautioned. Then, Marotta was evasive on the recent controversy around refereeing and VAR in Serie A. “I don't want to get into that,” he said. “Silence is a form of communication,” the Inter President continued. Marotta was referring to Inter's media blackout after last Sunday's Serie A draw with Lazio. “But we thought it was appropriate not out of disrespect.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Though Aaronson is a veteran, his return after missing the Nations League shows Pochettino values him. Mauricio Pochettino has gotten his point across over the last few months. “If we want to be good in one year's time, we need to think that today is the important day,” he said when he unveiled his roster for this summer's Gold Cup and two friendlies before it. “Because we need to build, from today, our way. When that didn't happen at March's Concacaf Nations League final four, the outcry was swift and sharp. What might be the most talented generation in program history didn't bring it like the team's past eras, and as a result got beat by opponents who did. “We only have time to come to maybe train one, two, three times; play, compete; one, two [days of] recovery, then play [again], and then go home,” he said. “And then maybe wait two months to be all together. If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friends — that is the culture that we want to create? » READ MORE: Brenden Aaronson and Quinn Sullivan are in, but Christian Pulisic is out of the USMNT Gold Cup picture Former Union midfielder Brenden Aaronson is back, as are forwards Folarin Balogun and Haji Wright. Diego Luna, Brian White, Patrick Agyemang, and Union product Jack McGlynn are MLS-based players with another chance to show they can run with the big names at European clubs. “[With] one year to the World Cup, it's true that it's possible that, to me, [this] is an opportunity to have all the players that maybe you [will] have in your head in one year,” Pochettino said. “But I think at the same time, it's so exciting to see different players, young players, players that maybe have not played or they are going to make the debut in the national team. Those are words that a lot of people wanted to hear. “I think it's important to create this challenge,” he continued. At one point, Pochettino said, “I don't like to punish” players in his job. You need to show [the] right attitude,” Pochettino said. “But not only that, perform and be brave, and follow the rules that we are going to set in the group. And of course, they need to know that [if] they do, and we are satisfied about the performance, they are going to compete in a fair way with different people that maybe are not involved today, in this squad.” Aaronson's return after not making the Nations League squad is a symbol of that. » READ MORE: FIFA president Gianni Infantino liked what he saw on his first visit to Philadelphia “The most important [thing] is that he keeps bringing his energy, positivity, enthusiastic passion,” Pochettino said. “I think this type of player, that transmits to the rest of the team these feelings and these emotions, that is really important — and of course after [that], he needs to perform. But I think he's a player that already has the experience.” Since then, he has played for Leeds United in England's Premier League and Union Berlin in Germany's Bundesliga and the Champions League, and this past season he helped Leeds gain promotion back to the top flight. His approval of Christian Pulisic's request to skip the summer doesn't just deprive the team of its best player and biggest star. It sends a message that not all commitments — and Pulisic's overall commitment is unquestioned — are created equal. It's fair to say, as U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker did, that Pulisic just had a second straight long season at Italy's AC Milan and has earned the right to rest. And it's fair to say Pulisic's long injury history matters, as the time nears when a new one could be disastrous. But it's also fair to say his absence now muddles the message. “Everyone can have different opinions,” he said, and on social media they very much did. “Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last [extended] time before the World Cup. One was what message he'd send to an increasingly frustrated fan base. “I think that's our responsibility to convey,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States men's national team will not count on its most high-profile figure for this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. Christian Pulisic, the forward from AC Milan, requested to be left out of the squad in order to rest after a demanding season in Europe. His absence, alongside other regular starters, forces coach Mauricio Pochettino to seek alternatives and take a bold approach ahead of the World Cup. According to sporting director Matt Crocker, the 26-year-old has accumulated over 3,500 minutes across club and international competitions over the past two years, leaving him with little time for recovery. “After extensive conversations, we agreed that this was the best time for him to take a step back,” said Crocker. Also missing from the list are Yunus Musah (Pulisic's teammate at Milan) and other Europe-based players. Despite these notable omissions, the team welcomes back key names such as Sergiño Dest, returning from an ACL injury, and Folarin Balogun, who is back after recovering from a shoulder problem. Mauricio Pochettino emphasized that this is a crucial moment to evaluate emerging talent and instill a winning culture within the team. “It's not about having a vacation or seeing friends. All eyes will be on a rejuvenated American team, determined to perform without its main star.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a breakout season in the Dutch top flight, U.S. Men's National Team star Richard Ledezma appears to be on the verge of a move from PSV to Liga MX side Chivas. Ledezma's move was all but confirmed with the news that he had received his Mexican passport — a requirement for all Chivas players, as per GiveMeSport and CL Merlo. Upon his return to North America, Ledezma is expected to put pen to paper on a four-year deal with the 12-time league champions, having turned down an extension offer from PSV as well as interest from Italy, England, and other Mexican teams, via ESPN. He has the possibility of being Mexican,” Aguirre explained in February after Mauricio Pochettino did not include Ledezma in his 60-man preliminary roster for the CONCACAF Nations League, via ESPN. “I didn't put him on the list of 60 because at the moment, I wasn't so clear about him. “Let's see what happens from here to the future. He is versatile, in New York he played as a striker, in Europe they play him as a winger. His versatility and competitive level make him valuable.” To date, Ledezma's international career has been limited to a single appearance back in November 2020, when he came on as a substitute in a 6-2 friendly win against Panama, assisting two goals by Sebastian Soto. While Ledezma has yet to file for a one-time switch of allegiances with FIFA, his latest snub by Pochettino could further sway his call. This comes after his best season with the back-to-back Dutch champions, having been deployed as an emergency right back for much of the year due in part to USMNT teammate Sergino Dest's recovery from an ACL tear. Ledezma ultimately made 38 appearances in all competitions, providing one goal and one assist en route to his first Eredivisie title. It marked an excellent turnaround for Ledezma, whose European career to date had largely been thwarted by injuries and a lengthy battle to break into the lineup. Having not been named among their 60-man preliminary roster, his next shot at action could come when Aguirre's side faces Japan on September 6 in Oakland before a friendly against South Korea three days later.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team head coach Katie Schoepfer has named 24 players to the first training camp after her team qualified 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which starting this year, will be staged annually and has been expanded from 16 to 24 nations. The camp will take place from May 27-June 3 in Fayetteville, Ga., site of the currently under construction Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, which will host the majority of YNT camps after its completion in 2026. Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008, are age-eligible for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. That match will take place on June 28 (6:30 p.m. CT) and the teams will also play a closed-door international on July 1 at The University of Kansas Health System Training Center, which is also home to the Current. Japan has won one FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and finished runners-up twice. Just eight players on this roster participated in the qualifying tournament as Schoepfer takes a deeper dive into the player pool to evaluate players who could contribute to the World Cup Team. The players that were in Costa Rica for the Concacaf tournament were goalkeeper Evan O'Steen, defenders Pearl Cecil, Lauren Hemann, Gacie Milam and Sydney Schmidt, midfielders Jaiden Rodriguez and Chloe Sadler and forward Ashlyn Anderson. Rodriguez scored twice in the three goals while Anderson tallied four times. Cecil, a center back, and Schmidt scored once each. O'Steen, who plays her youth club for Solar SC, also is on the books for the Dallas Trinity in the USL Super League, but she has not seen action this year. Goalkeeper Hannah Folliard, defenders Marlee Raymond and Milam and midfielder Brooke Bunton -- all of whom are named to this camp -- were alternates on the Concacaf qualifying team. Fourteen countries have qualified so far for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. China PR, Japan, Korea DPR and Korea Republic have qualified from Asia via nominations by the Asian Football Confederation based on results of the last three editions of AFC U-17 Women's Asian Cup in Thailand in 2017 and 2019 and in Indonesia in 2024. New Zealand and Samoa have qualified from Oceania via the 2024 OFC U-16 Women's Championship. From Africa, in addition to host Morocco, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia have earned berths via the 2025 African U-17 Women's World Cup qualifiers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deutsche Telekom (DT), the German telecommunications giant, has secured a wide-ranging package of soccer rights from global governing body FIFA, encompassing multiple World Cup events across different categories. Games will be broadcast on DT's MagentaTV OTT streaming service, on which it will also host highlights, game clips, interviews, shoulder content, and ancillary programming. Despite the exclusive nature of the deal, Deutsche Telekom is likely to sublicense games out to public service broadcasters such as ARD and ZDF, or commercial free-to-air network RTL, to comply with German broadcasting law, which necessitates free-to-air coverage of fixtures involving the German national team in such major competitions. A similar deal occurred with the 2024 European Championships, hosted in Germany, for which DT held exclusive rights. Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. In a reciprocal deal, DT sub-licensed the rights to that tournament to ARD and ZDF, in exchange for the rights to all 64 games of the 2022 FIFA World Cup (16 of which were exclusive games). Combined, the new DT rights package will total 272 games of coverage, a deal that DT is calling the “largest World Cup package ever”, in part thanks to the expanded men's World Cup format of 48 teams, making that tournament total 104 matches in itself. Speaking on the burden of broadcasting the expanded men's World Cup in 2026 – one that will occur across multiple time zones with a large difference to European time – DT's head of TV Arnim Butzen said: “48 participating nations, 104 matches over six weeks – this is the biggest football tournament of all time. We are happy to accept this logistical challenge and want to make the World Cup an unforgettable football experience for our customers.” DT is a long-time partner of German soccer's DFB governing body and the German national team, a deal that was renewed in late 2024 to run through the 2026 tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have set the deadline that they want to sign attacking target Joao Pedro from Brighton before the Club World Cup begins in mid-June. It's been claimed that Chelsea are planning four major new signings to help revamp the young group. The transfer speculation linking Brighton star Joao Pedro, 23, to Chelsea has been intensifying in recent days. It was claimed earlier in May that Chelsea are keen on signing Joao Pedro this summer, but they face competition from Arsenal and Liverpool for his signature. Apparently, Maresca's side have already started talks and signalled their willingness to offer €60m (£50m) for his signature. Brighton's asking price for Joao Pedro is £59m ahead of the summer, so Chelsea aren't too far away with their initial interest. Chelsea supporters have doubts about Joao Pedro because they're not convinced he's an obvious upgrade on Nicolas Jackson for the striker position. In fairness, the 23-year-old Brazilian star has proven at Brighton and Watford in recent seasons he's got the versatility to operate as a No 9, No 10 or a winger. Incidentally, Thiago Silva ranks first in the list of Chelsea's greatest ever Brazilian players. It now looks like history could be repeating itself because there could be plenty of South American talents at Stamford Bridge next season. Estevao Willian, 18, and Andrey Santos, 21, are Brazilian stars joining up with Chelsea for the 2025/26 campaign.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel has promised England will "take care" of their players set for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, with a third of his squad set to feature at this year's tournament. The German named his second party as Three Lions boss on Friday, ahead of a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier with Andorra and a friendly with Senegal next month. Several key faces in his team, including captain Harry Kane and midfielder Jude Bellingham, are expected to feature for their respective clubs in the United States only days after. Speaking after the announcement of his team however, Tuchel hailed the revamped structure of an expanded tournament, live on DAZN, and promised to protect his stars. "I think once the players are there they will love and embrace the challenge to play against teams they have maybe never played before. "The Club World Cup that I played in before was very different and maybe this will change perception. "Because I was in club football we will take care of the minutes of the players if we can. Spending time together was very important for us." Watch all 62 matches of the 2025 Club World Cup live on DAZN. More information and to sign up for a free account here</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time Christian Pulisic is among a slew of regular starters who will be missing when the United States plays in next month's CONCACAF Gold Cup, another blow for a team coming off dismal performances at the Copa America and CONCACAF Nations League. Given the absences, coach Mauricio Pochettino wants players who will convince worried fans that a turnaround is ahead. "It's our responsibility to send some signal to them," he said Thursday during a Zoom news conference after announcing his 27-man roster. Yunus Musah also asked out, Antonee Robinson was dropped because he has been playing with an injury, and Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were blocked because FIFA gave the expanded Club World Cup priority over national teams. Josh Sargent, Joe Scally, Cameron Carter-Vickers and Tanner Tessmann were omitted in what Pochettino called "football decisions." U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said Pulisic and his advisers asked for the possibility to be left off because of the number of games he has played in the last two years. "Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup," Pochettino said. After the Gold Cup, he will have just four brief training windows on FIFA international dates before players report ahead of the World Cup. Without saying players had been complacent, Pochettino said, "we learned a lot in the last few camps, for sure in March, and it's about to be — maybe use a different way to approach these opportunities." "If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend, that is the culture that we want to create?" If we want be good in one year time, we need to think that today is the most important day." Outside back Sergiño Dest returns to the national team for the first time since March 2024 after recovering from a torn ACL. Forward Folarin Balogun is with the team for the first time since last September, following his recuperation from shoulder surgery. He had two MLS appearances last year and has become a regular this season. Midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, a 24-year-old son of the former coach, also was picked for the first time along with 20-year-old forward Damion Downs and 21-year-old defender Quinn Sullivan. Downs has played on youth teams of Germany and the U.S., and helped Cologne gain promotion to the Bundesliga for 2025-26 after a one-season absence. Goalkeeper Matt Freese, who has attended national team camp previously but not played in a game, was also selected. The U.S. plays Turkey on June 7 at East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later at Nashville, Tennessee, then meets Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the first round of the Gold Cup.</p>

And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Foden has only started one of City's last eight games after being hurt in a challenge by Manchester United midfielder Casemiro in early April and Tuchel described the 24-year-old as “a little bit injured” when discussing his omission. But whereas Foden had suggested that he might benefit from a summer off and missing the Club World Cup, Guardiola expects him to be part of the City squad. Guardiola has said that former City captain Kyle Walker will not be part of his squad in the United States. But he is waiting to find out if James McAtee and Rico Lewis will play for City in the Club World Cup after England Under-21 manager Lee Carsley said he wanted to call them both up for the summer's European Championships. With Mateo Kovacic suspended following his red card in midweek, Guardiola has a vacancy in midfield but he insisted it is too soon for the Ballon d'Or winner to play 90 minutes.

But it is the first kind of step, for his mind, for his knee, but still is not the Rodri we know.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel has won 11 trophies as a manager at domestic level England manager Thomas Tuchel will not release players early for the Club World Cup because he wants to "cherish" and "worship" every moment with his squad. Eight members of the squad play for teams competing at the Club World Cup, which begins on 15 June - five days after England host Senegal at Nottingham Forest's City Ground. Tuchel said no managers had been in touch with him about leaving players out of his plans. Tuchel, who oversaw victories against Albania and Latvia in his first two matches in March, said England will start and finish the camp with the same 26 players, adding that he will "manage their minutes". Despite pressure from clubs participating in the Club World Cup, Tuchel has stuck to his guns. Hired on a remit to win the 2026 World Cup, Tuchel stressed before his first match in charge that he only has a total of 60 days and 24 sessions with his squad before the tournament begins. Five Chelsea players - Noni Madueke, Cole Palmer, Levi Colwill, Trevoh Chalobah and Reece James - are included in the squad. Before the squad was announced, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said there was a lack of care for players' welfare when asked about his players receiving a call-up. "I know people say they have money but it is not about money, it is about the health of the players. Kane, 31, was always going to be selected given his role as captain, while Conor Gallagher has had a good season with Atletico Madrid in Spain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA World Cup is coming back to New Jersey for the first time in more than 30 years in 2026, and a local artist is helping define how the world will see it. Rich Tu, a visual artist raised in South Orange and now based in Brooklyn, was selected by the region's host committee to pen the official poster for the New York/New Jersey host region. Tu said his composition was meant to reflect the cultural depth of both sides of the Hudson and blend local identity with global scale. "What I love about New Jersey is it's so much more than what people think it is," Tu said. It was part of a rollout of official artwork for each of the 16 host stadiums across North America, as the U.S. is set to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada. Tu's vivid, high-energy design is centered on a multicolored soccer ball engulfed in the flames of the Statue of Liberty's torch. Dominated by bold colors, the flame is rendered in fiery reds and oranges, while the torch itself is depicted in cool green and teal tones. "It's bold, like the people of this region." There are florals for the Garden State and a splash of Knicks orange. "This poster is a bold celebration of everything that makes the NY/NJ region so dynamic — our diversity, creativity, and unmistakable energy," said Bettina Garibaldi, the regional host committee's chief marketing and communications officer. "Rich Tu's design captures the essence of who we are: a region that stands out." Tu said his poster draws inspiration from past World Cup visuals, including Lance Wyman's work during the 1970 Mexico campaign. Having a place in the history of the World Cup and its identifying art for his home region is both gratifying and deeply humbling, he said. "Just to be a part of the history is crazy." The poster is on display at 352 Marin Blvd., in Jersey City and set to join the permanent collection at Poster House in New York, the country's only museum dedicated to poster art. The digital version has also been on display in Times Square and at MetLife Stadium, where both the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup are scheduled to take place. Tu, who earned degrees from Rutgers University and New York City's School of Visual Arts art college, is a partner at the studio Sunday Afternoon.</p>
