                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sabalenka has had success on clay, but Swiatek can be dominant. When Aryna Sabalenka was a teenager in Minsk, Belarus, she would have long conversations with her father, Sergey, a former Belarusian hockey player who introduced her to tennis when they drove by some empty local courts. They did not discuss specific results or rankings so much as aspirations. Sergey, Sabalenka has said, was anxious for her to win at least one major title before she turned 25. “We were having our chats, and it was, of course, his dream because he was the one pushing himself really hard to make sure that I stay there because it wasn't something cheap back then in Belarus.” Sergey died suddenly in November 2019, more than three years before Sabalenka captured the first of her back-to-back Australian Open titles. She also won last year's U.S. Open by beating Jessica Pegula. 1, has never won the French Open, which begins on Sunday, or Wimbledon, titles she covets most. The closest she has come at Roland Garros was a 7-6 (5), 6-7 (5), 7-5 semifinal loss to Karolina Muchova in 2023. Last year, while suffering from a stomach illness, she lost in the quarterfinals to Mirra Andreeva. Sabalenka has also missed two of the last three Wimbledons — she withdrew with a shoulder injury last year and was barred from playing in 2022 when Russians and Belarusians were prohibited because of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Two years ago she lost to Ons Jabeur in the semifinals. Thank you for your patience while we verify access. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.</p>

Djokovic is bidding to become just the third man in the Open era - after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer - to win 100 ATP titles. It has been a disappointing clay season for Djokovic, who suffered immediate exits in Madrid and Monte Carlo. However, an ATP 250 title in Geneva could be the perfect confidence booster before the French Open, where he will be chasing a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title. Djokovic will face American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round at Roland Garros, which starts on Sunday. A double fault by Djokovic at 5-2 brought up a set point for Norrie, but he missed his chance and allowed Djokovic to break back and level at 5-5. World number six Djokovic reasserted his dominance by grabbing the first three games of the third set - a gap that Norrie was unable to close as he was broken again to allow Djokovic to serve out victory after two hours and 15 minutes. It will be Djokovic's second final of the season after the Miami Open in March, where he lost to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik.

Having secured the opening set via a solitary break of serve, Djokovic - as he did in his quarter-final against Italian Matteo Arnaldi - fell a break down in the second, only to break back and get on level terms. Unlike in Djokovic's quarter, though, Norrie forced a tiebreak as he put the fact he was 5-3 ahead out of his mind, and at the second attempt clinched the set to force a decider - saving match point before doing so. The third set saw Djokovic race out to a 3-0 advantage, however, and the Serbian never looked back, kicking on to seal a comfortable final-set win 6-1. Djokovic will face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in Saturday's final, after the latter defeated Sebastian Ofner of Austria 6-3 6-4 earlier on Friday. It has been a tough season so far for former British No 1 Norrie but he has found some form on the clay and came through qualifying in Switzerland before making it to the last four. He had won only one set in four previous meetings against Djokovic and managed another here before his challenge faded in the decider. In his on-court interview, Djokovic said: "It was the toughest match of the tournament for me so far for sure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The current World No.1 has continued his rapid ascent with ruthless precision. After a breakout 2024 season, where he finally got over the Grand Slam hump with wins in the Australian Open and US Open, the 23-year-old Italian began 2025 in style—defending his Melbourne Park crown with a clinical straight-sets win over Alexander Zverev. A suspension for a banned substance saw him sidelined for over 100 days early in the year, but Sinner wasted no time in regaining his rhythm. Along the way, he produced stirring comeback wins against tough opponents like Casper Ruud, and Tommy Paul, showing the mental steel that now defines his game. With three Slams already under his belt and having proven he can bounce back from adversity, Sinner looks poised for another deep run at the remaining majors—and he's one of the favourites in the Wimbledon odds. He fell just short in Barcelona, losing a high-octane final to Holger Rune, and was outgunned by Jack Draper in the Indian Wells semi-finals. But Alcaraz, as ever, continues to thrill with his aggressive shot-making and never-say-die attitude. The 23-year-old Brit has firmly established himself among the world's elite, reaching a career-high World No.5 thanks to a string of standout performances. With a strong serve, powerful groundstrokes, and growing confidence, Draper is beginning to look like a legitimate Grand Slam contender—but he remains 8/1 in the tennis odds for Wimbledon. Alexander Zverev – Struggling Since His Third Major Final But Still In The Hunt Few players have come closer to Grand Slam glory without sealing the deal than Alexander Zverev. Returning to where he reached the final last year in Paris could kick start his game. That win followed a strong showing in the Australian Open and a solid clay-court campaign, where he again proved tough to beat. Having reached the French Open final in 2024, Zverev will be hoping to finally go one better on the Parisian clay this time around. With his all-court game and vast experience, a maiden Slam feels increasingly inevitable.

"In the coming days, there will be more time to share what's next for me," Garcia wrote. "But for now, I just want to focus on living these last few weeks as a tennis pro to the fullest. See you on the court in just a few days." First-round coverage of the 2025 French Open will start at 5 a.m. EDT Sunday on TNT and Max.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Richard Gasquet is feeling very good about the state of French tennis. Now Gasquet is set to bring his career to an end on home soil at the French Open and bid what will be an emotional farewell to his home fans. As Gasquet prepares to hang up his racket, he is very confident that he is leaving French tennis on the men's circuit in good hands. Richard Gasquet has seen plenty of French players come and go during his time on the ATP Tour. The likes of Gael Monfils, 38, are still going strong, while former top 10 players Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Gilles Simon are no longer active. Gasquet will soon join them, and he has every faith that the Frenchmen who are at the start of their careers, can be very successful, such as World number 14 Arthur Fils and Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who possesses arguably the game's fastest serve. “Arthur Fils, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, they can win some big tournaments. He will take on fellow Frenchman Terence Atmane in what will likely be a raucous atmosphere inside whichever arena is chosen to stage it. This will be the first and only encounter between these two players and fans will be keen to see if Gasquet can continue his career for at least one more match. “It just seems right to end my career here at Roland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He has also had Sinner's number of late, winning their last four meetings to take a 7-4 head-to-head advantage, a record that includes Alcaraz's five-set win in last year's French Open semi-final. His success on Sunday ended Sinner's run of 26 successive victories. Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz believes the challenge of playing Sinner brings the best out of him. It doesn't matter that he was out of the tour for three months. "If I don't play at my best, 10 out of 10, it's going to be impossible to beat him. "I'm not going to say I'm feeling like when Rafa (Nadal) and Roger (Federer) are playing, but I'm feeling like it's a different energy when we are facing each other." Equally as impressive, though, was his run to the final in his first tournament since he retained the Australian Open title in January. "I am closer than expected in a way of everything," said Sinner, who served a three-month ban after twice testing positive for traces of the banned anabolic steroid clostebol. He eventually reached a settlement after authorities accepted the contamination was accidental and that a longer ban would be an "unduly harsh sanction". "After three months coming here, making this result means a lot to me," Sinner said after his runners-up finish in Rome. "It gives me hopefully confidence to play some good tennis also in Paris." Sinner called Alcaraz "the man to beat," but Alexander Zverev is among the title pretenders too after falling just short in last year's final. Zverev then lost to Sinner in the Australian Open final, but does have a clay trophy under his belt this season after winning in Munich. He made a late decision to enter the Hamburg event this week after losing in the quarter-finals in Rome, searching for a boost after a "very negative" loss to Lorenzo Musetti. I need positivity before it starts," said Zverev. Novak Djokovic will touch down in Paris with limited expectations for a man with a record 24 Grand Slam titles, three of them coming at Roland Garros. The long-time former world number one has slipped to sixth in the rankings, leaving him vulnerable to the possibility of a quarter-final against Alcaraz or Sinner, as his wait for a tour-level 100th title goes on. His last one came at the Olympics, where he beat Alcaraz on Court Philippe Chatrier to land an elusive gold medal. Djokovic skipped Rome after early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid and is looking to rediscover some form by playing in Geneva. Madrid champion Casper Ruud is a two-time Roland Garros runner-up, while Britain's Jack Draper ranks a career-best fifth after winning at Indian Wells and reaching the Madrid final. Musetti has also performed well during the clay swing. Holger Rune is the only player to beat Alcaraz so far on clay this season, but he has struggled for fitness on either side of his Barcelona triumph.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former British tennis player Andy Murray recently shared his thoughts on ending his short coaching partnership with 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic . Murray recently took the opportunity to joke about his split with Djokovic despite the decision causing shock among fans and experts alike. Speaking in an interview with UbiTennis, Murray said that even though their partnership didn't last long, he was thankful for the time they spent working together. Andy Murray further revealed the thing he definitely won't miss about Novak Djokovic, saying something that would make fans laugh. We both decided it was time to part ways. One thing I won't miss is the food. Man, I don't want air sandwiches and chickpeas for every meal,” Murray said. Talking about his partnership with Murray, Djokovic said that they decided to call it quits after mutually agreeing that they couldn't get more out of it. “We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it. My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person. Djokovic has had a dismal year as he is still searching for his 100th title win. Prior to this, Djokovic suffered consecutive early losses in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Geneva Open will be his final tournament before leaving for Roland Garros.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the back gardens of his childhood to the grand stages of professional tennis, Jacob Fearnley's journey is one to follow. 2024 marked a significant milestone with his Davis Cup debut for Great Britain, and now, the world No. 54 is set to tackle the Roland Garros qualifying rounds, facing a tough opening challenge against former champion Stan Wawrinka. He is truly one to keep an eye on with his journey just beginning. Fearnley's ascent in the ATP world rankings has been a rapid climb. 646, his breakthrough came during the grass-court season with a maiden ATP Challenger title in Nottingham. Following this, a strong run on the Challenger Tour yielded three more titles, culminating in his entry into the top 100 in September 2024. 54 by May 2025, marking an extraordinary surge into the upper levels of professional tennis.

A significant portion of these earnings has come during his rapid rise in the rankings, boosted by his four ATP Challenger singles titles in 2024 and his second-round appearance at Wimbledon in the same year, as well as reaching the third round of the Australian Open in 2025. Fearnley has not yet won any major singles titles. His best results in Grand Slam singles events are: His run included a notable straight-sets victory over home favourite Nick Kyrgios in the first round, followed by a four-set win against Frenchman Arthur Cazaux. 2 seed Alexander Zverev in the third round, marking his best Grand Slam singles result to date.

She is a former athlete from Texas Christian University (TCU), where Fearnley also played college tennis. Fearnley balanced his studies in kinesiology at Texas Christian University (TCU) with a stellar five-year college tennis career. On the court, Fearnley earned All-Big 12 and All-America honours all four years, playing a crucial role in TCU's back-to-back ITA Indoor National Championships (2022, 2023) and their first NCAA Division I men's tennis championship in 2024.

His grandparents introduced him to the sport, and he first picked up a racket in their back garden.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As an 18-year-old qualifier ranked 150th, Raducanu stormed to the US Open title without dropping a set in one of the most remarkable major runs in tennis history. After a difficult start to 2025, Raducanu kickstarted her campaign at the Miami Open, where she started working with coach Mark Petchey. The Brit has since built on her Miami run with some encouraging results on clay, including a last 16 showing at the Italian Open, and she holds a 9-4 record since linking up with Petchey. Raducanu is currently the world No 43, which is her highest ranking position since August 2022 — just before she dropped the points from her US Open title. Ahead of the 2025 French Open, Tennis365 asked Wozniacki about Raducanu's prospects at Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year — and the ceiling she could reach. “She's proven she can beat great players, but it's not easy if you get a really tough draw and have to beat seeded after seeded player to reach far. Emma Raducanu told to hold ‘moderate' French Open expectations by former world No 2 Emma Raducanu makes worrying injury confession ahead of Roland Garros She's young, she doesn't have as much experience as many of the others do, but I think with [Mark] Petchey there in her corner… I think he's great, he knows the game so well, he has all the ins and outs of all the stats, et cetera, and I think that's gonna help her a lot. “I guess we'll just have to wait and see if that's gonna happen and when that's gonna happen. But either way, being as young as she is and already having a Grand Slam under her belt is a great feat.” Raducanu will face world No 42 Wang Xinyu in her opening match at the French Open and could face reigning champion and five-time major winner Iga Swiatek in the second round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE -Caroline Garcia, of France, hits a return to Iga Swiatek, of Poland, during the Miami Open tennis tournament, March 21, 2025, in Miami Gardens, Fla. As she prepares to play at the French Open for a 14th consecutive appearance, the Frenchwoman said on social media that “it's time to say goodbye.” “After 15 years competing at the highest level, and over 25 years devoting almost every second of my life to this sport, I feel ready to turn the page and open a new chapter,” Garcia said. I still have a few tournaments to play. Garcia, who has won 11 titles but is now ranked No. 145, will play against Bernarda Pera in the first round. After several inconsistent years marred by doubts and injuries, Garcia took a break from tennis in March 2022 to nurse an injured foot. The pause brought dividends as she enjoyed a tremendous second half of that season with several titles, including at the WTA Finals, to go with her semifinal appearance at the U.S. Open. Two years ago, she revealed in an interview with L'Equipe newspaper that she had to deal with bulimia for a spell, triggered by losses and pain from the lingering foot injury that affected her daily life. “My journey hasn't always been easy,” Garcia said on Friday. “Since the beginning, tennis has meant so much more than wins and losses. And despite everything, I'm deeply grateful for all that this adventure has brought me. For the strong, passionate, and determined woman it helped me become. But now, it's time to move on. Several French players paid tribute to Garcia. “She's had a great career,” said Varvara Gracheva, ranked No. I hope she does well at her last Roland-Garros.” Léolia Jeanjean, ranked 103rd, said Garcia made a lasting impact. “She's going to leave a great mark on women's tennis," Jeanjean said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australia's Alex de Minaur is yet again on a collision course with world No.1 Jannik Sinner at a grand slam, but he must first navigate a tricky path through the field at Roland Garros when the French Open starts on Sunday night Australian time. De Minaur's draw lines up for a potential quarter-final rematch with Sinner after the Australian Open champion thrashed the local hope in straight sets at Melbourne Park. A possible second round date with fellow Australian James Duckworth, after they met in the first round at Wimbledon last year, awaits if Duckworth can get past the hot-and-cold Kazakh Alexander Bublik. De Minaur's potential third round match with 19-year-old 19th seed Jakub Menšík of Czechia shapes as a difficult test before a likely Round of 16 meeting with fifth seed Jack Draper. 25 Alexei Popyrin, faces a difficult clash with Japanese world no. 75 Yoshihito Nishioka, who made the fourth round at Roland Garros two years ago. Meanwhile, Chris O'Connell and Aleksandar Vukic will take on underdog status in their respective clashes with 22nd seed Ugo Humbert and 24th seed Karen Khachanov. But 23-year-old Olivia Gadecki has the hardest first round match up of all the Australians, a likely centre court clash with world No.2 Coco Gauff. Carlos Alcaraz will begin his French Open title defence against Japan's Kei Nishikori as Iga Swiatek faces a difficult route to a fourth successive Roland Garros title after a year-long trophy drought. Jannik Sinner takes on home hope Arthur Rinderknech in the world no.1's first Grand Slam match since serving a three-month doping ban. Alcaraz and Sinner have combined to win each of the last five men's Grand Slam titles and are the two chief contenders again in Paris. Novak Djokovic, who had not won a clay-court match this season before this week, starts his latest quest for a record-setting 25th major against American Mackenzie McDonald. Seeded sixth, Djokovic could have been drawn to meet either Alcaraz or Sinner in the quarter-finals, but Thursday's draw spared him from that prospect. Instead, he could run into 2024 runner-up Alexander Zverev in the last eight before a potential semi-final against Sinner. Alcaraz could play Fabian Marozsan or Luca Nardi in the second round, with towering Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard a possible third round-opponent. Two-time finalist Casper Ruud is seeded to face him in the quarter-finals. In-form Lorenzo Musetti and fourth seed Taylor Fritz are also in that half of the field. The 22-year-old has won in Monte Carlo and Rome this season. Should Sinner get past the 72nd-ranked Rinderknech, he could go up against Richard Gasquet in what is the 38-year-old Frenchman's final tournament before retirement. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina potentially lurks in the third round with Andrey Rublev and Arthur Fils possible rivals in the last 16. Sinner could meet fifth seed Jack Draper or Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals ahead of what would be a blockbuster clash with Djokovic. Three-time French Open titlist Djokovic would likely have to get beyond the likes of Denis Shapovalov and Daniil Medvedev to make another deep run. He has reached the quarter-finals or better at every edition of Roland Garros since 2010. Swiatek will need to rediscover her best form to retain the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen following a troubled past 12 months. Swiatek plays Slovakian Rebecca Sramkova in the first round before a possible meeting with Britain's Emma Raducanu, the 2021 US Open winner making just her second visit to Paris. Elina Svitolina, Belinda Bencic, Donna Vekic and Marta Kostyuk also feature alongside Swiatek in a loaded section. “This season has had more ups and downs than the years before but I know my game is there. Four-time French Open champion Swiatek is in the same half of the draw as top seed Aryna Sabalenka, who gets under way against Kamilla Rakhimova from Russia. Zheng Qinwen, the winner of Olympic gold on Court Philippe Chatrier last August, could await Sabalenka in the last eight. Second-ranked Coco Gauff plays Australian Olivia Gadecki in round one and is one of four seeded Americans in the bottom quarter of the women's draw. The 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, attempting to become the youngest Grand Slam singles champion since compatriot Maria Sharapova in 2004, starts against Cristina Bucsa of Spain. Naomi Osaka plays 10th seed Paula Badosa in an eye-catching first round tie, while eighth seed Zheng takes on former finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.</p>
