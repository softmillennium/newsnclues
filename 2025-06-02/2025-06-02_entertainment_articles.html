Nathan Fielder Calls the FAA "Dumb" After Agency Dismisses 'The Rehearsal' Season 2's Message In the season two finale, Fielder actually flies a 737, with 150 actors as passengers. Black declared when he was watching the show, “You tricked me because I thought we were heading towards a Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. You're going to be sitting at a panel, you're going to be talking to all of the members of Congress about flight safety; and then you pulled a switcheroo on us, and the finale episode is actually you've learned how to fly a 737, an unbelievable twist I did not see coming.” “If I could get in front of the Congress panel, I would have done that and I will still do that, if they will have me,” Fielder responded, pointing out how the FAA made a statement this week about the show, which he had previously called “dumb.” He touched on it again at the event, saying, “They don't seem to know what they're talking about, truly.” And I was like, well, that'll really help me go through the mindset but also sort of show that I'm trying to take this seriously. “And then flying the big plane thing, we didn't actually know that we could do that for sure until, literally, like days before it happened. Nathan Fielder joins Jack Black for a conversation about #TheRehearsal in LA pic.twitter.com/3YovyLs3Ml Black asked Fielder now that he is a certified pilot how often he is flying, with the comedian revealing, “I do it when I have time. With an entire episode dedicated to the life of Sully Sullenberger, who famously landed a plane on the Hudson River in 2009, Fielder also revealed, “I haven't spoken to him. I don't think we heard back, but I'm sure he watched it and was probably just shocked at someone figuring out what actually happened in that plane. I assume he just can't actually acknowledge it, because it would be illegal, right?” he deadpanned of his “discovery” in the show that Sullenberger was listening to an Evanescence song on his iPod during the landing. Maybe he could have asked [his co-pilot for his opinion] a little earlier, if I can give any note now that we're sort of peers, I guess. Black concluded the screening at Vidiots by telling Fielder, “Your contribution to television and cinema history is magical. And it's like, how the fuck does he do that?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four years before Taylor Swift began her crusade to re-record new versions of her early albums so she could own the valuable master recordings, Bowling for Soup did the same. The pop-punk band put out Songs People Actually Liked — Volume 1, note-for-note copies of early quasi-hits such as “Girl All the Bad Guys Want” and “Punk Rock 101,” and justified it by telling fans they were more mature, better musicians and sought to “add some luster” to the originals. “We had to be very careful about never making our audience feel like we were taking advantage of them,” says Jaret Reddick, the band's frontman, by phone from a Disney cruise with his family in Juneau, Alaska. “Shortly after that, Taylor Swift literally educates the entire music population on song ownership. Swift announced Friday (May 30) that she purchased the master recordings to her first six albums, from 2006's Taylor Swift to 2017's Reputation, from investment firm Shamrock Capital, for an undisclosed price. Angered that control of her catalog went to Braun, who'd worked with her enemy Kanye West, Swift tried and failed to buy back the recordings from Braun, then Shamrock, which bought them from Braun for what sources say was around $360 million. Swift's strategy — re-recording all six of those albums with most of the original musicians as “Taylor's Versions,” convincing top radio stations to air them and streaming services to emphasize them in playlists while promoting them on her massive tours — has been influential, directly or indirectly, on other artists. “You try to put the shortest re-recording restriction you can get in the record contract — it used to be five years after release, but now I've found they've extended it to 10 years,” says Ben McLane, another music attorney. Nonetheless, artists in the post-“Taylor's Versions” age persist in following Swift's lead: Pop-punk band Cartel recently announced it would release a re-recording of its 2005 album Chroma this September. “Artists are re-recording their masters more frequently than they were,” says Josh Karp, a lawyer who represents Cartel and other artists. “Part of that is definitely that Taylor shined a big bright light on it and showed it could be done successfully.” Long before Swift, Frank Sinatra, Little Richard, Chuck Berry and many others re-recorded their hits to claim financial control, and the process still happens today, with or without Swift's influence. Switchfoot put out a new version of its 2003 breakthrough The Beautiful Letdown 20 years later; TLC, Wheatus and Paris Hilton have done the same in recent years; and Ashanti announced in 2022 that Swift inspired her to begin a similar project. Swift's crusade, according to Gandhar Savur, a music attorney, has helped young artists better understand the benefits of signing label licensing deals rather than ownership deals. In the former, artists retain control of their recordings, although they're unlikely to get an advance payment from a label to fund an expensive recording project; in the latter, the label pays out that advance money in exchange for ownership of the recordings for as long as several decades. “Historically, artists have said, ‘Don't give away your publishing,' and that message has gotten across. After Wheatus finished re-recording its 1999 alt-rock hit “Teenage Dirtbag” in April 2020, and it went viral on TikTok and Instagram during the pandemic lockdown, the new master generated nearly $25,000 for singer-songwriter Brendan Brown, according to Billboard estimates in 2023. “I would love to see the contract,” Brown said by phone from a tour bus en route to New Jersey after Swift's announcement Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Warren's “Ordinary” remains the biggest song in the world, as it notches a fifth week at No. As previously reported, the song takes over at No. Meanwhile, sombr scores his first Global 200 top 10 with “Back to Friends” (up 17-9) and MOLIY, Silent Addy, Skillibeng and Shenseea's “Shake It to the Max (Fly)” surges to the top tier on Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States. Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations. Further sparking its profile, Warren performed the song on the American Music Awards, broadcast on CBS, May 26. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on the Global 200, after 18 weeks at No. 1 starting last September (second only to the 19 weeks at No. 1 for Mariah Carey's “All I Want for Christmas Is You” since the chart began); ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” repeats at No. 1 starting in November; Billie Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” keeps at No. 1 last August; and Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” lifts 6-5 after seven weeks on top starting in February 2024. sombr's “Back to Friends” hits the Global 200's top 10, bounding 17-9 with 37.7 million streams (up 13%) worldwide. The singer-songwriter (real name Shane Boose) is charting his first two Global 200 entries in the top 20 simultaneously – “Undressed” jumps 19-13, likewise hitting a new high, with both tracks having benefitted from exposure on TikTok. “Die With a Smile” is steady at No. 3, has led longer: 19 weeks, beginning in November. “Birds of a Feather” ascends 5-4, following three weeks at No. 1 last August, and JIN's “Don't Say You Love Me” dips to No. Plus, MOLIY, Silent Addy, Skillibeng and Shenseea's “Shake It to the Max (Fly)” swoops into the Global Excl.

Now, original series creator Nic Pizzolatto is teasing that the acting duo might return to the hit HBO series more than 10 years since first starring together in it. Pizzolatto, who served as an executive producer on “True Detective” Season 4 but has not written for the show since his HBO deal expired after Season 3, said during the “Nothing Left Unsaid” podcast that he is toying with another “story” involving McConaughey and Harrelson's respective characters, Rust Cohle and Martin Hart. Pizzolatto, McConaughey, and Harrelson recently reunited for a January 2025 ad for True to Texas, with McConaughey and Harrelson back as their “True Detective” characters.

McConaughey has consistently praised Pizzolatto and his experience on “True Detective” Season 1. I watched it weekly, like everyone else, on Sunday night, and that was an event for me,” he said.

It's not news that the documentary market continues to be in flux, particularly for political documentaries, with many filmmakers complaining about a lack of distribution channels. So it's good news that Netflix has closed a hybrid licensing deal for six documentary films that played well at festivals over the past year, but were not acquired by any distributor. Rather than leave the orphans in limbo, Netflix opted to give this group of diverse titles a distribution home. Related Stories ‘Dogtooth' Propelled Auteur Yorgos Lanthimos to International Acclaim, Now It's Back in Theaters 15 Years Later — Watch the 4K Trailer All 12 Wes Anderson Movies, Ranked, from ‘Bottle Rocket' to ‘The Phoenician Scheme' In territories outside the English language, they are available non-exclusively. “We saw a chance to bridge that gap by partnering with our licensing team to make sure these six impactful films — which all received stellar festival receptions — could be seen and loved by wider audiences. The fact that they all come from talented filmmakers we've had the privilege of working with before telling such a diverse range of stories makes this even better.” It makes sense that Netflix would support established filmmakers the streamer had worked with before. “The White House Effect” was well-received at Telluride 2024, followed by 13 more festivals. “Netflix came up with interesting way to get films out there that hadn't found a deal yet,” said Submarine co-founder Josh Braun, who repped “In Waves and War” and “The White House Effect.” “We are happy to be part of this, because the market is challenging and this is a good opportunity to get these films out there in a bigger way than a self-release.” Netflix has also worked with doc veteran Chris Smith and his producer Danny Gabi (“Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond,” “Fyre Fest”). Smith directed Sundance 2024 Premiere “Devo” (August 19) a biodoc that explores the evolution of the art-punk New Wave band, which scored a hit with “Whip It” in 1980 and gained mainstream success with their message of societal “de-evolution,” formed in response to the 1970 Kent State shootings. Netflix also licensed Tribeca 2024 premiere “I'm Your Venus” (June 23), directed by Kimberly Reed (“Dark Money”), which follows the biological and ballroom families of “Paris Burning” star Venus Xtravaganza as they investigate the unsolved mystery of her 1988 murder. Another movie in the package, produced by Netflix stalwart Fisher Stevens (“Beckham,” “Dark Money,” Season 1) is Matthew O. Henderson's SXSW 2024 premiere “A King Like Me” (June 19). Also included in the Netflix buy is Tribeca 2023 debut “Sunday Best,” written by Mark Monroe and directed by the late Sacha Jenkins (July 21). Produced by Netflix veteran Rafael Marmor (“Will & Harper”), the film shows how pioneering television host Ed Sullivan platformed Black musicians during the Civil Rights era. As recent hits “Becoming Led Zeppelin” ($13 million worldwide) and “No Other Land” ($3.6 million worldwide) prove, a theatrical audience will show up for some docs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jonathan Joss, who voiced John Redcorn on multiple seasons of Fox's animated series King of the Hill, was shot and killed Sunday in San Antonio, police have confirmed. Police say Joss, 59, was found shot near a roadway after officers were dispatched to the scene of a shooting in progress in the early evening hours. Police attempted life-saving measures, but paramedics pronounced Joss deceased. A suspect, Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, 56, was located and eventually booked for murder, according to the police. Joss, a native of San Antonio, had worked steadily as an actor since the mid-1990s, first appearing in the Luke Perry rodeo movie 8 Seconds. His later TV credits includes Friday Night Lights, The League, Ray Donovan, In Plain Sight and Parks & Recreation. It was one of several video game credits that also included voice work in Red Dead Redemption, The Walking Dead: Michonne, Days Gone, Cyberpunk 2077 and Wasteland 3. Most recently, he played Bad Face on Paramount+'s Tulsa King. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

[This story contains major spoilers from the season one finale of Your Friends & Neighbors.] “You don't deserve it,” Olivia Munn‘s Sam says when confronted by Jon Hamm's Coop in the Your Friends & Neighbors finale. Sam's husband was the victim, making Coop a prime suspect when the police later found out about Coop and Sam's secret relationship. Coop ended up getting arrested when the murder weapon, a gun, was found in his car — a murder weapon that was planted there by Sam to frame Coop. How the 'Your Friends & Neighbors' Finale Liberated Jon Hamm's Suburban Dad for Season 2 Apple TV+ Sets Serial Killer Drama With Liev Schreiber, Zazie Beetz, Stephen Graham But in the season finale, which released Friday, viewers discovered that there was never a murder. Paul died by suicide — while on FaceTime with Sam — and she staged the scene to make it look like a murder so that she could receive Paul's life insurance money, as she was in the process of divorcing him. When Coop gets out on bail and confronts Sam, one of her reasons for setting him up is because Sam, who comes from a blue-collar background, doesn't think Coop, a former hedge fund guy, deserves the life he has. It's a little bit of a satire, and thematically it's all about what makes these people tick,” creator Jonathan Tropper told THR in a finale interview about how the reveal and ending sets up the show for the already renewed season two. Your Friends & Neighbors marked Munn's first on-screen project following her breast cancer diagnosis. She's previously opened up about how she was nervous to film sex scenes with Hamm because of her cancer scars. “He and I get along so well it's just really easy to play,” she said. Below, Munn talks to THR about how money and privilege are the real villains in the series, explains how anyone could relate to Coop and Sam's on-again-off-again relationship and teases what's next for Sam in season two, which is currently filming. In episode six, we started to see a different side to Sam when she told off a salesperson when buying skincare. Knowing what we now know, was that a clue that there was more to Sam than we might expect? Everything that she is desperate to hold on to is literally at the very end of her fingertips, and in that moment, everything just explodes. She's had so much ambition and drive in her life to get to the top of the social mountain and have this incredible wealth. Before the twist is revealed, Sam broke things off with Coop. Why did she decide to let him go? Then it seemed like he was trying to make their relationship more than a friends-with-benefits situation. It wasn't said in the script, but it's something that [Jonathan] Tropper [creator/showrunner] and I talked about a lot, and when I went into the season I was thinking about: “What's the part of the story that we haven't seen before we meet all these characters? And what's been going on with Sam and Coop?” They both entered their relationship in similar places but very different emotionally. He was looking for a soft place to land when he was struggling so much to want to keep his family together, and my character is hoping that this flourishes into something more. So, I thought a lot about what other conversations they were having that we don't see on screen. There's a point where you have to just wake up and realize you're in this cycle of: “Yes, he wants more. Now, about the ending, what was your reaction to reading in the script that Sam made her ex-husband's suicide look like a murder? This part was like the Shakespearean equivalent of showing what all that leads to: When you see what happens when blind ambition and the desperate need to maintain your social status and wealth come up against losing it all. It's a timeless story of people thinking that money buys happiness, and putting all of your self worth and your entire life into the idea that if you have money, then everything is going to be OK. So for her, there was no other way. When Coop asks her why she framed him for Paul's murder, she responds, saying, “You should have been kinder to me,” and notes that he doesn't deserve the privileged life he has. However, that could apply to a lot of people in that neighborhood, so why was Coop the one to pin Paul's death on? That line: “You should have been kinder to me” is something that Tropper told me in our first initial call. You're left feeling really empty at the end. What I really loved about that scene in particular was that there has been so much dialogue in the world about privilege, and I've had to have many conversations with friends about it just over the last five years where it's been at the apex of discussion in the world. No one is saying that people with inherent privilege don't work hard or haven't faced their own battles and slayed their own dragons and worked really, really hard. But we don't have the cheat codes. We don't have the maps in front of us. Oh, that's great we went to Yale together, come on in. That moment in the foyer of Sam's home, that's what Sam is saying: “Yeah, you worked hard, but I worked harder because it was not set up for me to be here.” Everything was set up for Coop. When Tropper first talked to me about this, [he mentioned] it's a lot based on his life. He goes: There is this world of people whose families are wealthy and their families went to Harvard or Yale, and so their children get to go to Harvard or Yale. And then, because the dad had a hedge fund, or knew this hedge fund guy, it's set up for his son to then go into this hedge fund, and then it's set up for him to run the hedge fund. During your monologue, Sam setting up the crime scene reminded me of Gone Girl. Was that an inspiration at all for Sam's storyline? But I think of Gone Girl as sociopathic. (Laughs) She's very sociopathic, and I think that Sam is a very nuanced, complex character who came from a blue-collar upbringing who has found herself at the top of this social mountain and has convinced herself this is what she needs to do to survive. She's convinced herself that the only way to survive is to be in this social world and with this enormous wealth and that there is no other path in life to forge, which I always think is interesting because she didn't come from money. She can go back into a life and figure out how to live without money. I think Sam has really lost her sense of self and is focused on only the things she has seen that matter. The money and lifestyle have also corrupted Sam, and when something like that happens, you can't really see any other way besides what you think is the only one in front of you. It's staggering and shocking for most of society who have a moral compass. It's set up that way because they've got the key, those cheat codes. My character wasn't born with privilege and yet, here she is. She's fallen off the mountain, and yet she's still in this world, and we're going to see the struggle of trying to stay in that world, keep a place in that world, get back to where she was and how everyone is going to handle that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean Combs' personal assistant “Mia” returned to the stand today for the third day, where she spoke about her reticence to come forward sooner with allegations of sexual assault against Combs. “I was terrified and brainwashed,” she said, while being cross-examined by Combs' defense attorney, Brian Steel. Steel took a highly aggressive approach to his cross examination as he picked up the defense's efforts to undermine Mia's allegations by highlighting instances where she appeared affection towards, or supportive of, her former boss. Mia (who is testifying under a pseudonym) responded to Steel's questions by trying to convey the complex emotions that came with working for someone who was both her alleged abuser and someone she described as her “protector.” (Mia later asserted that she did not intend to file a civil suit against Combs.) Steel also repeatedly cast doubt on the veracity of Mia's allegations, asking if her claims were true, suggesting the events she described never happened, or that she made them up. At one point, Mia retorted, “I would not lie in this courtroom. As expected, the prosecution has repeatedly objected to Steel's questions and Judge Arun Subramanian has often sided with the prosecution (at one point, he sustained about 10 objections in as many minutes). Federal prosecutor Maurene Comey expressed her concern to the judge that Steel's tone would not be reflected in the court transcripts; and she accused Steel of trying to “humiliate” Mia and effectively deterring other potential victims from coming forward. One person who certainly seemed engaged with Steel's approach was Combs. Asked if Combs still had a hold on her at that point, Mia said the mogul still did “psychologically.” She also added that she sent these texts after “tragic events” in his life, like the death of his partner, Kim Porter, in November 2018. Steel also pressed Mia over why there was no contemporaneous documentation of Combs' alleged abuse, even though she was constantly filming Combs at his instruction and taking notes during their time together. 50 Cent Pledges to Prevent a Trump Pardon for Sean Combs: ‘I'm Gonna Reach Out' Sean Combs Trial: RICO Heating Up, Suspicious Destroyed Evidence and Alleged Rape Trump Addresses Possible Sean Combs Pardon: ‘I Would Certainly Look at the Facts' She said that the only time she “reached out for help was very subtly to people in the office but not disclosing things that other people hadn't witnessed.” She suggested others who worked for Combs were similarly cautious, saying “nobody around batted an eye” when Combs misbehaved or acted out. Mia even said she grew fearful when Combs threatened to tell his girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, about “everything” between them. During her testimony last week, Mia repeatedly broke down in tears as she detailed a hellish eight years working for Combs between 2009 and 2017. She claimed she fluctuated between a constant state of feeling like Combs' best friend and “a worthless piece of crap,” all depending on the volatile mogul's mood. Sometimes, she'd be showered with praise and promised executive roles in one of Combs' many companies. At other times, Mia said, she might have her arm crushed in a heavy industrial door or have a bowl of spaghetti hurled at her for not rushing off to IHOP in the middle of the night fast enough. Mia said her job was always in jeopardy and once was placed on unpaid leave for “insubordination” because she left a hotel without Combs' permission to attend a party with Ventura at Prince's house. Mia testified that Combs sexually assaulted her multiple times, describing the alleged attacks as unpredictable and sporadic. There were other sexual assaults, Mia said, but she repressed them, only able to recall a “horrible dark feeling in my stomach.” “We would have to get right back into work, and there was so much going on, I never processed it. Prosecutors accuse Combs of wielding his vast wealth and “multifaceted business empire” to fulfill his sexual desires with crimes including physical assault, threats, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two weeks after taking second place on the season 23 finale of “American Idol,” 18-year-old country crooner John Foster thrilled fans with a glimmer of the new music he's working on, including inspiration from meeting one of his own idols. On May 31, 2025, Foster posted a new music video, filmed in one take, of himself performing “Amazing Grace” with a dose of his Louisiana-infused sound. “I thought it fitting that my first Post-Idol music video be ‘Amazing Grace', because it's His Grace that's brought me this far,” he wrote. “American Idol” fans saw Foster perform “Amazing Grace” a couple of times, including a portion performed in Cajun French, during his hometown visit on the show, when he serenaded lawmakers at the Louisiana State Capitol on May 14. Within 24 hours, over 10,000 fans liked Foster's video, loved seeing his full rendition in the new music video, including one who wrote, “I loved hearing you sing Amazing Grace. John always keep this sweet humble spirit that you have ❤️❤️🙏” You have touched the hearts of millions with your beautiful voice. “Thank you for singing this one…I pray your life journey is Blessed all the way through and Beyond…Gods Blessings Always be with you…I also Loved the Cajun French added for the ‘flavor' and sentiment that represents all of us fellow Louisianans…Huggs!! Two days before sharing his rendition of “Amazing Grace,” Foster shared another meaningful connection to his Louisiana roots, posting a photo with local music legend Wayne Toups on May 29. “I'm so glad that this moment was captured,” Foster wrote. Stay tuned everyone; I'm working hard to get some great things headed your way!” Foster and Toups — a Grammy-winning artist known for his unique blend of zydeco, Cajun, and southern rock — performed “Mathilda” together at the Cajun Country Memorial Day Festival, according to radio station Gator 99.5. Foster will get to perform alongside other legends on June 7, when he makes his Grand Ole Opry debut.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days after winning the 27th season of “The Voice,” singer Adam David treated travelers at Nashville International Airport to an impromptu concert as they all waited for their flight. On May 31, 2025, airport officials at Berry Field Nashville airport (BNA) posted video footage of David, 34, who was waiting to board his flight. As he stood at the gate, he pulled out his acoustic guitar to perform a mini-concert for his fellow passengers. A live performance at the gate, of course! Huge thanks to @spiritairlines for making this unforgettable moment happen. Just another day of live music at BNA!” A post shared by Nashville Intl Airport (@flynashville) Many people seated at the gate applauded, and David then told them, “I'm gonna play a couple songs,” before launching into “Signed, Sealed, Delivered.” Many fans who saw the video couldn't believe that David's fellow travelers weren't freaking out about being serenaded by the singer. One person wrote, “those people are way to calm!! Someone else commented, “Aaaaand that is why you WON!!!! Another fan chimed in, “Live at the airport! Now that's a lucky group of people right there! A post shared by Zack Zaro (@zackzaro) David, who's a native of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was in Nashville to perform at the Recovery Unplugged “Sober Sessions” on May 30 alongside Struggle Jennings and “American Idol” season 20 winner Noah Thompson. David, 34, previously sought help from the organization's branch in Fort Lauderdale and celebrated six years of sobriety in March, he told Nashville's News Channel 5, explaining, “Getting clean wasn't easy,” he added. I did the full program down there. While in Nashville, he also got to reunite and jam with some of his fellow contestants on season 27 of “The Voice,” including Zack Zaro, Tatum Scott, Page Mackenzie, and his fellow Team Bublé member Carlos Santiago. After our knockouts, I told Adam, ‘you better win…' and he did. I'll be cheering you on the whole way!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, the fourth largest contributor to America's trade imbalance, after machinery and electrical equipment and automobiles. Disruption of their supply will have catastrophic consequences on America's health, for pharmaceuticals aren't like cars or smart phones one can do without — they're a basic necessity, like food and water. But there's a serious case to be made to bring back a large chunk of the manufacturing to the U.S. for reasons of national security, especially in the current divisive and uncertain political climate. It is no secret that the U.S. and China are currently in a testy relation that could escalate into a full blown military conflict over Taiwan. What if supply of these drugs are interrupted? Tariffs, however, will not alleviate such a scenario. But America's vulnerability is real, and it will take a concerted effort on multiple fronts to make America self-reliant in health care. They can't compete with India and China, the two countries that account for most of the supply of these “commoditized” pharmaceuticals to America, saving the American health care system reportedly more than $400 billion annually. And China directly supplies 40 percent of all raw ingredients used in the U.S. to manufacture drugs. In 2021, the Biden administration singled out the raw materials used in drugs sold in the U.S. as being just as critical for national security as semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals. It pointed to antibiotics as an example, citing a 2019 report from China that spoke of Beijing considering leveraging export of “antibiotics as a retaliatory tool in the U.S.-China trade war.” It mentioned Xinhua, China's state media, suggesting China could assume “strategic control” over supplies and limit exports. And during Trump's first term, Gary Cohn, then an economic adviser, warned at a security hearing that a Department of Commerce study found that 97 percent of all antibiotics in the U.S. came from China. “If you're the Chinese and you want to really just destroy us, just stop sending us antibiotics,” he said. 50 Cent Pledges to Prevent a Trump Pardon for Sean Combs: ‘I'm Gonna Reach Out' 'Reckless and Dangerous:' Nadler Attacks Trump After DHS Detained His Staffer Mike Johnson and Russ Vought Continue to Lie About Medicaid Cuts Trump Spreads Bizarre Conspiracy Theory That Biden Was Executed and Replaced by a Robot Clone When a skirmish broke out between India and China over a border dispute in 2020, Indian companies became alarmed about whether they would be able to manufacture antibiotics for the country. An executive of a leading manufacturer of antibiotics in India (which manufactures for my firm) said, “We can switch to another country, but the starting chemical to make the raw material comes from China. For one, making pharmaceutical raw materials often involves hazardous compounds, and it generates harmful pollutants that are costly to contain. But the biggest reason is that as world leaders in innovation, they're highly focused on research and development. Patents protect their profit, which depends less on manufacturing costs. These innovator companies have little incentive to plunge into mass manufacturing low-cost medicines, especially the raw materials, where China has a 35-40 percent cost advantage over the U.S. He has issued an executive order to push the FDA and other regulatory agencies to expedite the approval process for establishing pharma manufacturing plants in the U.S. And indeed, several leading pharma companies have announced eye-popping investments: Johnson & Johnson said it will invest $55 billion in R&D and manufacturing; Genentech, $50 billion; and Novartis, $23 billion. The president seems lulled by these instantaneous pledges. Few of these medicines are currently imported from China or India. (Parke-Davis, then the largest drug company and now owned by Pfizer, commissioned Rockwell to make a series of illustrations for its ad campaign.) The mixture is hauled to another room, where it's dried, and then to another room where it's pressed into a tablet or filled into a capsule, and finally these are fed into a machine that packs them in blister strips and into a box. One can imagine a continuous process going seamlessly from chemical synthesis to the final tablet or capsule, managed and monitored by sophisticated technology. (This is currently done with biological medicines, where going from cell culture to propagation to filtration, formulation, and filling of vials and syringes is a seamless, automatic process.)
