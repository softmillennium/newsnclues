                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prosectors are expected to call Eddie Garcia, who worked in security at the InterContinental Hotel, to the stand tomorrow when court resumes. Over three days of testimony, “Mia,” a former assistant to Combs who used a pseudonym, described the abuse — verbal, physical and sexual — she said she experienced while working for him. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Prosecutors said they expect to question Garcia for about 90 minutes. Prosecutor Maurene Comey said forensic video expert Frank Piazza, Combs employee Derek Ferguson and Bryana Bongolan, who previously accused Combs of sexual battery, are likely among the next witnesses to follow Garcia, but the order could change. Comey said “Jane,” another one of Combs' accusers who is using a pseudonym during the trial, could take the stand as early as Wednesday afternoon. The plan is to get Jane off the stand in plenty of time for an international flight she's scheduled to catch next Thursday, prosecutors said. Tomorrow, prosecutors in Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal criminal trial are expected to call an InterContinental Hotel employee to testify under an immunity order. Bringing in a witness under an immunity order could significantly help the prosecution's case against Combs, said Lisa Bonner, an entertainment lawyer and former litigator who is not involved in the case. The immunity order can indicate “a very reluctant witness coming forward,” Bonner said, adding that “when you are coming in and invoking your right to waive your fifth amendment right and get some type of immunity, that means, ‘Listen, I didn't want to be here and tell the story from the beginning. “Once one comes in under an immunity order, that is a great opportunity for the prosecution to really hone in on the fact that you are here reluctantly, we presume that you're telling the truth and you had something to lose by coming here,” she said. Bonner added that she thinks that'll be “a great opportunity for the prosecution to score some points with the jury.” Remember: The InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles is where Combs was seen striking and dragging Cassie Ventura during a 2016 altercation, footage of which was previously shown to the jury during Ventura's testimony. Beverly Hills Hotel employee Sylvia Oken is off the stand. The defense team briefly cross-examined her, and prosecutors didn't have any questions for a redirect-examination. The jury saw two bills for Sean “Diddy” Combs' hotel stays addressed to an alias associated with his guest profile. One of them, from May 2015, included a $500 charge for “oil damage.” She's a custodial witness for hotel records being admitted as evidence. Mia, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, has finished her testimony and is now off the stand. When prosecutor Madison Smyser asked her about speaking to human resources, Mia  referenced a former employee who she said was fired after reporting Combs' abuse of his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura. “Human resources only punished me unjustly, also fired Kayla for even discussing Cassie's abuse. When asked, Mia reiterated her previous testimony that she didn't feel like she could've left her job with Sean “Diddy” Combs. Mia also testified again that she feared for her physical safety. Prosecutor Madison Smyser is going through several of Mia's social media posts that the jury saw during cross-examination. Mia confirmed that promoting the events and projects in those posts were part of her job. Smyser asked Mia what Sean “Diddy” Combs did when he thought she wasn't doing her job. Mia confirmed that posting for Combs' birthday was also part of her job, and if she didn't do it she would've been “in trouble.” Smyser referenced Mia's previous testimony that she created a scrapbook for Combs' birthday because she thought it would make him happy. Defense attorney Brian Steel has finished his cross examination of the former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs testifying under the pseudonym of Mia. Prosecutor Madison Smyser is now questioning Mia on re-direct examination. Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said the prosecution will be reordering the upcoming witnesses to accommodate for a custodial witness who has a flight later today because Mia's cross-examination is much longer than expected. Defense attorney Brian Steel revisited Mia's testimony about the time Sean “Diddy” Combs slammed a door on her arm multiple times. Mia said that her arm was bruised but she didn't seek any medical treatment. Mia said she didn't scream during the incident, even though it was in painful. Defense attorney Brian Steel asked Mia a couple of questions about reporting the abuse she allegedly endured by Combs. The former assistant testified she didn't contact law enforcement about it. She also said “no” when Steel asked if she ever considered reporting the alleged abuse through a women's shelter, doing so anonymously or asking a third party to report it for her. Defense attorney Brian Steel asked Mia a series of questions about what she knew about Casandra Ventura's jealousy of other women Sean “Diddy” Combs dated. Mia said she didn't recall Ventura having specific jealousy of Kim Porter, who Combs shared three children with. “He presented to her that they were exclusive,” Mia said. Defense attorney Brian Steel returned to the messages Mia sent in December 2016 after she learned Revolt Films, the Sean “Diddy” Combs-owned business she was working for at the time, would be shutting down. In those texts, Mia said her life was “over.” “My entire world was being ripped away from me immediately,” Mia testified today. “And even if in hindsight that world was awful, I didn't know it at the time.” Steel asked if she wanted to continue working for Combs and his business at that time. “Mia,” a former Combs employee testifying under a pseudonym, has been on the stand since this morning, answering questions under cross-examination about her experience working for Combs. Mia's testimony, which began last week, details allegations that she was physically and sexually assaulted by the music mogul multiple times during her employment from 2009 to 2017. This morning, Mia also testified about the control Combs held over her during her employment, saying she was “psychologically” under his grip and “terrified” of him. Her testimony could help the prosecution's case for a conviction on the sex trafficking charge, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Mark O'Mara, who is not involved in Combs' federal criminal trial, said. “So they're bringing in all of these witnesses, including Mia now, to say, ‘This is the environment that Mr. Combs is responsible for and it was an environment of coercion. O'Mara added that prosecutors showing through testimony that “any type of force that has the effect of moving somebody towards a certain decision,” including “economic force” and “emotional force,” is where Mia's testimony becomes relevant. At the time, Mia said she did not think Combs had “blacklisted” her. Context: Mia testified during direct examination last week that she hasn't be able to work because she has severe PTSD. “I would have to leave because I would be triggered by really normal situations with like an overwhelming sense of fear of being in trouble,” Mia said of when she tried to work. Defense attorney Brian Steel suggested that Mia was let go from Sean “Diddy” Combs' companies for alcohol use. Defense attorney Brian Steel asked Mia if she intended to sue Sean “Diddy” Combs, her former boss, based on the sexual assault allegations she has made against him. The defense attorney also asked Mia is she wanted money based on her testimony at trial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax-break package. Anna Johnson answers the question from a reader: How do you maintain journalistic integrity while covering the administration amid deep political divides and fast-changing events? U.S. District Judge John Holcomb, who was appointed in 2019 by Trump, ruled that the administration is not providing due process rights to people it accuses of belonging to a Venezuelan gang against which Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law. Holcomb did find that Trump's invocation of the act was proper. That's in contrast to some other judges who ruled it cannot be used against a gang. The FBI says the suspect in an attack in Boulder, Colorado that injured six yelled “Free Palestine” and used a makeshift flamethrower. In a post on his social media site, Trump wrote, that the suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, “came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy” — even though the details surrounding Soliman aren't entirely clear. Trump is “likely” to talk this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says. The two leaders are slated to talk as trade tensions have intensified after both nations agreed in May to reduce tariffs for a 90-day negotiation period. But the U.S. is displeased with problems over China exporting critical minerals, while China is frustrated by U.S. efforts to limit their access to advanced computer chips. Pennsylvania's two U.S. senators, Democrat John Fetterman and Republican David McCormick sat on Monday for 30 minutes to take questions from Shannon Bream, anchor of Fox News Sunday, at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston as part of an effort to promote bipartisanship. They found it easy to agree on certain questions, such as foreign policy, and politely disagreed on others, including President Trump's tax breaks, spending cuts and border security bill. Fetterman says he won't support cuts to Medicaid and food aid. McCormick stresses the need for tax relief, spending cuts and border security. But he also says they agree that the federal government shouldn't take benefits away from vulnerable people. Fetterman and McCormick have struck up a friendship following McCormick's victory last November over longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, Fetterman's mentor in the Senate. Fetterman has had something of a warm embrace from Republicans over his ideological split with Democrats on Israel and border policy. On foreign policy, both men are strong backers of Israel in its war against Hamas and preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, even if it means Israel striking Iran's nuclear facilities to destroy them. FILE - The Supreme Court is seen under stormy skies in Washington, June 20, 2019. Trump administration lawyers have filed emergency appeals with the nation's highest court a little less than once a week on average since Trump began his second term. Among the administration's victories was an order allowing it to enforce the Republican president's ban of on transgender military service members. ▶ Read more about what's left on the court's docket The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that's languished for years. The visit comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project. While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that “recognizes Alaska's unique value.” Conservative legal activist Leonard Leo helped Trump transform the federal judiciary in his first term. He closely advised Trump on his Supreme Court picks and is widely credited as the architect of the conservative majority responsible for overturning Roe v. Wade. Leonard Leo speaks at the National Lawyers Convention in Washington, Nov. 16, 2017. But Trump last week lashed out at Leo, blaming his former adviser and the group Leo used to head for encouraging him to appoint judges who are now blocking his agenda. Trump's broadsides came after a three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked his sweeping tariffs, ruling that he had overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and levy tariffs on imports from almost every country in the world. FILE - In this Sept. 16, 2018, file photo, American flags are displayed together with Chinese flags on top of a trishaw in Beijing. China blasted the U.S. on Monday over moves it alleged harmed Chinese interests, including issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and planning to revoke Chinese student visas. “These practices seriously violate the consensus” reached during trade discussions in Geneva last month, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement. That referred to a China-U.S. joint statement in which the United States and China agreed to slash their massive recent tariffs, restarting stalled trade between the world's two biggest economies. But last month's de-escalation in Trump's trade wars did nothing to resolve underlying differences between Beijing and Washington and Monday's statement showed how easily such agreements can lead to further turbulence. The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the “blatantly wrong claim that the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.”</p>

Eight people were injured on Sunday, with one in critical condition, after Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly targeted a pro-Israel peaceful protest aimed at advocating for the release of Hamas hostages. Police said they received reports of a man who was setting people on fire. Leo Terrell, senior counsel for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, said in a post on X that one of the victims is a Holocaust survivor. She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety," Terrell said. "And now, decades later, she's victimized again by a terrorist screaming ‘Free Palestine.' The same slogan another terrorist just screamed when murdering Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim on May 21." "The attack on this survivor reminds me of the horror of October 7, when Holocaust survivors were murdered and dragged away by Hamas terrorists in Israel," he added. Anti-bomb robotics are put into place following an incident involving multiple injuries that the FBI is investigating as an act of terror on June 1, 2025 in Boulder, Colorado. A suspect is in custody after reportedly throwing an incendiary device at a group participating in an organized walk near the courthouse to show solidarity with hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman was charged with murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent; murder in the first degree – extreme indifference; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; first-degree assault – non-family; first-degree assault – heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony. The alleged attack happened on Sunday during a gathering held by pro-Israel group "Run for Their Lives." During the attack, Soliman was allegedly heard yelling, "Free Palestine." According to sources who spoke with Fox News, Soliman was in the United States illegally and is an Egyptian national. Soliman, 46, was charged with first-degree murder, crimes against at-risk adults/elderly, assault, criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies and use of explosives or incendiary devices during a felony. Soliman filed a claim with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services on March 29, 2023, which authorized him to work through March 2025. FBI director Kash Patel has described the incident as a terror attack. Law enforcement officials dress up in protective gear to investigate an attack on the Pearl Street Mall, Sunday in Boulder, Colorado. "We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado," FBI director Kash Patel said. "Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available." Fox News' Greg Norman and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, file) JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A second group of white South Africans has arrived in the United States under a refugee program announced by the Trump administration, officials and advocacy groups said Monday. Nine people, including families, arrived late last week, said Jaco Kleynhans, head of international liaison at the Solidarity Movement, a group representing members of South Africa's white Afrikaner minority. The group traveled on a commercial flight to Atlanta, he said. An initial group of 59 white South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on a chartered flight last month under the new program announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in February. The Trump administration said it is offering refugee status to white South Africans it alleges are being persecuted by their Black-led government and are victims of racially motivated violence. Trump has falsely claimed that white South African farmers are targeted in widespread attacks that amount to genocide and are having their land taken away. Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with those baseless claims during a meeting at the White House last month. Ramaphosa has said the relatively small number of attacks on white farmers are part of South Africa's larger problems with violent crime, which affects all races. The Trump administration initially said the refugee program was aimed at members of South Africa's Afrikaner minority, who are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers. In new guidance published by the U.S. Embassy last month, applicants must be “a member of a racial minority” in South Africa and “must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.” There are around 4.5 million whites in total, including those with British or other heritage. Another group helping white South Africans apply for refugee status has said tens of thousands have applied.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Colorado attack: A man used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set people on fire Sunday at a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado, held in support of hostages in Gaza. He injured at least eight people ranging in age from 52 to 88 — including a Holocaust survivor — before being detained. He faces both federal hate crime and multiple state felony charges. Soliman is scheduled to appear in a local court this afternoon. • Suspect's history: Soliman had applied for asylum in the US and was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005, sources told CNN. He was in the US illegally, a Homeland Security official said today. The suspect entered the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor and was granted a two-year work authorization in March 2023. • Community outcry: Jewish leaders called for action against attacks on their community in the wake of rising antisemitic violence and threats. Less than two weeks ago, two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot dead in Washington, DC, by an attacker who yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested. Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and acting United States Attorney for the District of Colorado Bishop Grewell will hold a news conference today, according to the Department of Justice. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the attack has been charged with a hate crime, according to an affidavit filed today, in addition to local charges. “These fundamental freedoms must be respected and safeguarded for everyone, regardless of their views or background.” Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in Sunday's attack in Boulder, Colorado, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to an affidavit filed Monday. President Donald Trump said that the “horrific attack” in Boulder, Colorado will not be tolerated by his administration, in his first comments since yesterday's incident. “Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday, nearly a full day after the assault. Soliman was in the US illegally, a Homeland Security official said. “He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” Trump wrote. Police found 16 additional molotov cocktails in the area where the Boulder attack suspect was spotted, according to multiple law enforcement sources. Soliman was wearing a utility vest over his shirt and was carrying a garden sprayer filled with gasoline, sources said. Many witnesses said he looked like a gardener, officials added. Witnesses said that Soliman took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. Soliman was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for burns he sustained to his hands during the attack. In dispatch audio from the Boulder City Fire Department a person on scene also noted that additional Molotov cocktails were found. The Boulder Police Department have released a mugshot of 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who has been detained and is facing charges related to the attack on members of the Jewish community at an event in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday. Soliman is expected to appear in court later today. The weekend attack in Boulder that left at least eight victims injured has left congregants of a local synagogue feeling enraged, vulnerable and sad, Rabbi Fred Greene from Congregation Har HaShem told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. “We have to show up for one another. “The rhetoric that we hear for months and months is been something of concern for all of us, Greene said. ”Hearing people talk about a globalized, an Intifada, and to think that bringing violence to America's Jewish community is going to help the dignity and save lives of Palestinians is ridiculous and harmful.” None of the victims in the Boulder attack have died, Boulder Police said in a post on X on Monday. At least eight people have been reported injured after the attack, ranging in age from 52 to 88. The suspected attacker was booked into county jail Sunday night on multiple felony charges, including two counts of first-degree murder, though the circumstances around those charges is unclear. CNN has reached out to the District Attorney for more information. The suspect is expected in court Monday afternoon. The Jewish community in Boulder is rallying together after an attack that left at least eight people injured, many of whom were older adults, a local leader told CNN. She talked to a couple of them last night, including one woman who is “healing from horrible burns.” A mother and daughter were also injured in the attack, Funk, said. The mother, “is a Holocaust survivor in her 80's, who's been through certainly enough trauma,” she noted. “This wasn't a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. Funk said she's participated in the walk herself, along with her six-year-old son. Brian Horowitz was sitting in a cafe having brunch with his family when screams and chaos from an attack at a Jewish community event nearby, interrupted their meal. Horowitz, who is from Denver, was in the area to show his teenage niece and nephew the University of Colorado campus in hope that they'd enroll there, he told CNN. You're killing my people so I kill you,'” Horowitz said he heard the man, now identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman said. Horowitz said the attacker then locked eyes with him. “That's when he looked at me and said you're a killer,” Horowitz, recalled. Horowitz called 911, he said, and remembers hearing screams from other witnesses, while most of the injured victims were silent. Not knowing how best to help, he followed the lead of others who grabbed buckets and poured water over people's burns. Horowitz said he found one elderly victim with severe burns to her feet and hands who told him to worry about her friend instead, he said. “She was looking at me and saying ‘please help her. Three minutes after Horowitz called emergency services, police arrived and took the suspect into custody, Horowitz said, noting the wait felt like an eternity. “It was easily the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my life,” Horowitz said. “There's someone who is outraged enough to go and attack these elderly people who are doing absolutely nothing to provoke it other than walk in silence and meet in a courtyard peacefully. Horowitz, who is back in Denver now said after the weekend's incident, he's left to process his own rage and fear. “I can never in my entire life think of another time where I wish I had a gun on me to try and take this guy out in a safe way for everyone else and myself included rather than rushing this guy and potentially risking my life for that,” Horowitz said. He went on to list the recent shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC and the arson of Pennsylvania Gov. Nadler added that he would like to see an increase in funding for the protection of religious institutions so people can feel more safe. That should be increased because we need more security at all these places of worship and congregation,” he added. Calls for multiple ambulances, helicopters and for all units to respond can be heard in dispatch audio during the attack in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday. “1325 Pearl Street, the courthouse, reports that there is a male with a blow torch setting people on fire,” one official with the Boulder City Police can be heard saying in dispatch audio Broadcastify. “There's multiple mixed reports about if people are on fire or not, we're getting lots of 911 calls,” they added. As the incident continued to unfold, all units were advised to assist with the situation and calls for multiple ambulances and helicopters were made. “There was someone who threw two Molotov cocktails, we have multiple injuries, we're sending multiple ambulances,” one official says. “What's the nature?” one Boulder City Fire official asks. “Multiple burns, potential terror attack,” another official responds. Authorities have named Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the accused perpetrator of an attack on a Jewish community gathering in Boulder, Colorado. Witnesses say the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails into the crowd during a weekly gathering in support of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, law enforcement authorities said. Eight people were injured, ranging from 52 to 88 years old. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin wrote on X. Soliman was booked in county jail just before midnight, where records show he is charged with multiple felonies. Run for Their Lives is a global run – or walk – event organized by members of the Jewish community to bring attention to the 58 hostages who remain held in Gaza. The Jewish community in Boulder had gathered on Sunday to take part in the activity before Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set people on fire. Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested in Washington, DC, on May 21, authorities said. One of the victims of Sunday's attack on a group of Jewish community members in Colorado is a holocaust survivor, an individual who was at the march and knows the victim told CNN on Sunday. One victim was “very seriously injured,” according to Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn. A friend of the Holocaust survivor, Chany Scheiner, described her as “an amazing person” when talking to CNN affiliate KUSA. Her life wasn't easy, but she is just a bright light. Scheiner is married to a rabbi at the Boulder County Center for Judaism, KUSA reported. “People are friendly, they're kind, and this was out of left field. And we can't wrap our head around it because this is not Boulder.” People rushed to help in the moments following the Boulder attack, dousing burn victims with water while the suspect was still on a lawn nearby, according to several videos verified by CNN and witness accounts. The owner of a local clothing store, Heady Bauer, who did not want to be named, told CNN he and an employee saw big flames out front. “Everyone was dumping water on the burned people, especially one woman on the ground who was totally torched from her hair to her legs.” “All of a sudden all we saw was police cars, a ton of police cars arriving, and then fire trucks and ambulances,” said Ivan. A, who declined to give his full last name. One woman had a visible burn mark on her body, he told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned an attack on a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado and said he prays for the “full recovery of the wounded in the vicious terror attack.” On Sunday, a man used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack an event in support of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the FBI. At least eight people were injured, Boulder police said. “This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said Monday morning. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the man authorities have accused of carrying out Sunday's attack on a Jewish community gathering in Boulder, Colorado, was booked in the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to online jail records. Among the charges is one count of explosives or incendiary devices used during a felony. Witnesses say the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails into the crowd during a weekly gathering in support of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to law enforcement authorities. Online records also show Soliman, 45, was booked on two counts of murder in the 1st degree, but the circumstances around those charges are unclear, as authorities have not announced any deaths resulting from the attack. Soliman also faces two counts of first-degree assault and crimes against at-risk adults or elderly people, the records show. CNN reached out to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office for comment. Soliman has a court date scheduled for Monday at 1:30 p.m. local time, according to the online jail records, which show he is being held on a bond of $10 million.

David McCormick, R-Pa., discusses the Russia-Ukraine war, President Donald Trump's tariff policies and the Gaza humanitarian crisis on ‘Fox News Sunday.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Monday that he is moving the United Kingdom's military into "war-fighting readiness" to address growing threats from Russia. During a visit to BAE Systems'Govan facility, a navy ship-building yard in Glasgow, Scotland, the prime minister laid out "three fundamental changes" to be made in response to the country's strategic defense review. "First, we are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces," Starmer said. "When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready. We're showing them the respect that they deserve by delivering the biggest armed forces pay rise in 20 years and by pledging today that we will end the hollowing out of our armed forces. "We'll build a fighting force that is more integrated, more ready, more lethal than ever, backed by a stronger strategic reserve, fully trained and ready to mobilize at any time." Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers a speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday, June 2, 2025. The new approach comes as President Donald Trump has warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a "new era" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and "daily cyberattacks," as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out "growing Russian aggression" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming "their reckless actions" for the increased cost of living "hitting working people the hardest." The U.K. government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of "fighting big tank battles on European landmass" are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace. The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring "everything we do will add to the strength of NATO." "As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense, the NATO alliance means something profound, that we will never fight alone," Starmer said. "It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense." Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday, June 2, 2025. He said such advancements would not mean "replacing people" or hardware, but would rather mean "learning the lessons of Ukraine" and ensuring "every capability we have works seamlessly together." "Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035," Starmer said. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, Monday June 2, 2025. GB News noted at the press conference Monday that Starmer hasn't committed to having 3% of the GDP go to defense spending within the next nine years, even as Germany's defense chief warned Russia could invade a NATO ally within the next four years. Starmer said rearming would create a "defense dividend" of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs – a contrast to the post-Cold War "peace dividend" that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 17, 2024. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration on Monday renewed its request for the Supreme Court to clear the way for plans to downsize the federal workforce, while a lawsuit filed by labor unions and cities proceeds. The high court filing came after an appeals court refused to freeze a California-based judge's order halting the cuts, which have been led by the Department of Government Efficiency. By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the downsizing could have broader effects, including on the nation's food-safety system and health care for veterans. In her ruling last month, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston found that Trump's administration needs congressional approval to make sizable reductions to the federal workforce. The administration initially asked the justices to step in last month, but withdrew its appeal for technical, legal reasons. The latest filing is one in a series of emergency appeals arguing federal judges had overstepped their authority. Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire ally Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE. Musk left his role last week. There is no official figure for the job cuts, but at least 75,000 federal employees took deferred resignation, and thousands of probationary workers have already been let go. Illston's order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president's workforce executive order signed in February and a subsequent memo issued by DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management. Illston was nominated by former Democratic President Bill Clinton. It also applies to the National Science Foundation, Small Business Association, Social Security Administration and Environmental Protection Agency. The Supreme Court set a deadline of next Monday for a response from the unions and cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and San Francisco. Some of the labor unions and nonprofit groups are also plaintiffs in another lawsuit before a San Francisco judge challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. In that case, Judge William Alsup ordered the government in March to reinstate those workers, but the U.S. Supreme Court later blocked his order.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American flags are displayed together with Chinese flags on top of a trishaw on Sept. 16, 2018, in Beijing. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China criticized the U.S. on Monday over moves it alleged harmed Chinese interests, including issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and planning to revoke Chinese student visas. “These practices seriously violate the consensus,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, referring to a China-U.S. joint statement in which the United States and China agreed to slash their massive recent tariffs, restarting stalled trade between the world's two biggest economies. But last month's de-escalation in President Donald Trump's trade wars did nothing to resolve underlying differences between Beijing and Washington and Monday's statement showed how easily such agreements can lead to further turbulence. The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Trump imposed last month to 30%. “The United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and trade relations,” while China has stood by its commitments, the statement said. It also threatened unspecified retaliation, saying China will “continue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.” Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States. Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and “hopefully we'll work that out,” while still insisting China had violated the agreement. “The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” Trump posted. Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Lutnick said the U.S. was “taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation,” adding that Trump would “work it out” with Xi. The Trump administration also stepped up the clash with China in other ways last week, announcing that it would start revoking visas for Chinese students studying in the U.S. U.S. campuses host more than 275,000 students from China. Both countries are in a race to develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, with Washington seeking to curb China's access to the most advanced computer chips.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Sunday attack on eight people in Boulder, Colorado, is an illegal immigrant who entered the United States during the Biden administration and failed to depart when his visa expired, according to a Trump administration official. Boulder police on Sunday identified Soliman, 45, as a resident of El Paso County, Colorado. On Monday, administration officials confirmed that he lacked immigration status to be in the U.S. “The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a post to X Monday morning. Soliman would have entered the U.S. on a B2, nonimmigrant visa, meaning he was approved to stay in the country temporarily. The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the White House did not respond to requests regarding Soliman's country of origin. However, Soliman is reported to be an Egyptian national. White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said Soliman had “illegally overstayed” a tourist visa. One month after arriving, Soliman reportedly filed an unspecified claim in September 2022 seeking documents to work legally and was granted them in March 2023, according to CNN. Soliman was immediately detained by local police and has been charged with multiple felonies for allegedly using a flamethrower to set people on fire in what is being investigated as a terrorist attack.</p>

Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst explains the impact of the drone strike on Russian air bases. Russian and Ukrainian delegations have begun talks in Istanbul, Turkey, on Monday, less than 24 hours after a massive Ukrainian drone attack struck Russian airfields. The two delegations entered Ciragan Palace in Istanbul alongside a group of senior Turkish officials. It is the second round of peace talks to take place in the three years since Russia invaded Ukraine. Details of the meeting are not expected to be made public until after its conclusion. Ukrainian forces destroyed 40 aircraft in the drone attack this weekend, which an official says took more than a year to orchestrate. Russia's defense ministry confirmed the attack on Sunday, saying it struck five airfields. The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones reportedly hit 41 planes stationed at several airfields on Sunday afternoon, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M aircraft, the official said. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan chairs Turkey-Russia-Ukraine meeting in Istanbul on June 2, 2025. A series of explosions also struck bridges in Russia near Ukraine's border on Saturday, though Ukraine has not taken responsibility for the attacks. Ukrainian soldiers from the 115th Brigade Mortar Unit conduct mortar training, as members of the Anti-UAV unit test an FPV drone inhibitor in Lyman, Ukraine. A highway bridge over a railway in the Bryansk region was blown up at 10:50 p.m. on Saturday night just as a passenger train carrying 388 passengers to Moscow was passing underneath, Russian investigators said. Just four hours later, a railway bridge over a highway was blown up in the neighboring Kursk region, showering the road with parts of a freight train, the investigators said.

Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs reacts after a Colorado terror suspect involved in an attack at a pro-Israel event was taken into police custody. Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing hate crime, murder, assault and other charges following what the FBI called a "targeted terror attack" in Boulder, Colorado, over the weekend. The violence Sunday against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages left eight people, ages 52 to 88, with injuries, including one in critical condition, according to the FBI. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with a weapon setting people on fire. Soliman has now been charged with a Hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin. At the state level, Soliman was charged with murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent; murder in the first degree – extreme indifference; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; 1st degree assault – non-family; 1st degree assault – heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony. Soliman was also in the United States illegally, Fox News has learned. Boulder Police Department confirmed Monday that no victim has died. Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing multiple charges following the incident in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday, June 1. "We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado," FBI director Kash Patel said. "Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available." Soliman, 45, was arrested and taken to the hospital with minor injuries after his alleged attack on the "Run for Their Lives" group that was gathering on Pearl Street, police said Sunday night. The group is a grassroots organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. This particular chapter of the group meets on a weekly basis, police said. Mohamed Sabry Soliman is seen being taken into custody on Sunday, June 1. Soliman was allegedly yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack, which was near the county courthouse on Pearl Street. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of "ideologically motivated violence," based on early information, evidence and witness accounts. Soliman, 46, was charged with first-degree murder,, crimes against at-risk adults/elderly, assault, criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies and use of explosives or incendiary devices during a felony. Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa. He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said this week he would look into whether pardons are warranted for men convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, reviving national interest in a high-profile case that raises questions on whether FBI malfeasance led to their radicalization and alleged entrapment. In August 2022, Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox were convicted of conspiring to kidnap Whitmer from her vacation home, plotting to destroy a nearby bridge, and hopefully spark a second civil war. Prosecutors described them as anti-government extremists bent on political violence, while defense attorneys argued they were manipulated by a sprawling FBI sting operation involving undercover agents and informants. “This was just giving an overview of what happened in the Whitmer case. Kelly said she spoke to Martin solely in the context of his second role on the newly formed Weaponization Working Group, a special team formed under Attorney General Pam Bondi to reexamine major federal prosecutions from the Biden administration. “We just sort of talked about it in that context,” Kelly said, “and where to look, what sort of records they might be able to get, so they could start compiling the timeline.” Kelly emphasized that she did not recommend any specific action regarding pardons. I will not be involved in any pardon discussions,” she said. At least a dozen confidential informants and undercover agents were involved, not only gathering intel but helping shape nearly every aspect of the plot — from organizing meetings and funding travel to introducing the idea of using explosives. One informant, “Big Dan” Chappel, rose to leadership in the group, while another undercover agent suggested blowing up a bridge to delay police. Defense attorneys argued that their clients were manipulated into fantasizing about violence by the government itself, with one FBI handler even texting Chappel, “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.” “This is a lot more volatile case than the Jan. 6 defendants,” Kelly said. Trump's comments about the case have drawn a sharp rebuke from Whitmer, who claimed Thursday that Trump promised not to issue pardons during a conversation last month. And he said, ‘Okay, I'll drop it,'” Whitmer told Michigan Public Radio. It's unclear if Trump's statement this week indicates a policy reversal, but the comment underscores his broader approach to clemency powers, which he has used aggressively in his second term. And then seeing, gauging the public's opinion about pardons here,” she said. Croft and Fox were found only found guilty by a jury of conspiring to kidnap the governor and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction after their first trial ended with a hung jury, in addition to full acquittals for two other defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. In total, more than a dozen men were arrested in connection with the plot, including eight who were charged in state court with supporting roles such as providing material support for terrorist acts or aiding the conspiracy. Since returning to office, Trump has initiated reforms aimed at addressing perceived political biases within the DOJ. One of his first major acts included the issuance of pardons and commutations to over 1,500 individuals convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. While Kelly declined to offer a public stance on clemency, she noted that the public is far less informed about the Whitmer case than Jan. 6. “It's going to be trickier than the J6 [cases] I think, and more so because the public just is not aware of what happened in this case,” she said. “This is only about the federal indictments and convictions,” Kelly said. “They can't do anything with the guys who are in jail on state charges.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump wants to blow a $3 trillion hole in the budget. (In the case of Republicans' tax legislation this year, its components had to clear 11 different committees.) Currently, the US makes up for any budget deficits it incurs by issuing bonds of various durations to cover the difference. It auctions those bonds — essentially IOUs issued by the Treasury Department — on the open market, where investors (banks, hedge funds, foreign central banks, pension funds, etc.) And when the US borrows a lot, and especially if its fiscal policy indicates that the country may reach a point where it can't pay back what it owes, investors will demand to receive more interest to compensate for the risk of default. That means the US has to pay more every year to service its past debt, and those payments in turn become future debt. If the interest they demand is high enough, the result can be an economic downturn, an upward debt spiral, or both. But now I want to come back as the bond market. History is littered with cases of governments that were forced to abandon policies — or that even fell from power — because the bond market revolted. Just a few years ago in the UK, a mass sell-off by currency and bond traders forced the Tory government to abandon its plans for a massive deficit-ballooning tax cut and axe Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, before then-Prime Minister Liz Truss herself was forced to resign after just 45 days in office. Banks like Citigroup were openly declaring that unless the UK got a different prime minister, the markets would continue to punish it. Now, Congress is weighing a reconciliation bill that would increase the deficit by at least $3 trillion over 10 years, and possibly closer to $5 trillion if some of its temporary components become permanent, as seems likely. This is a big increase in America's already substantial debt burden and markets are responding accordingly. Interest rates are heading higher, especially once you adjust for inflation. It has the ability to make this tax bill much, much more costly for the US government and economy, and that ability could be decisive in shaping where the legislation goes from here. The US issues a lot of different kinds of debt, but the kind you should pay closest attention to are 10-year bonds. If inflation is 4 percent, investors will probably add about 4 percentage points to the real interest rate to make sure their investment doesn't erode in value. In the aftermath of Covid, rates actually went negative after taking inflation into account. This is what's sometimes called the “flight to safety”: In times of crisis, investors often move away from risky assets like stocks and toward reliable, predictable ones, like US government bonds. That drives interest rates down, sometimes even below inflation. But since 2023 or so, rates have been much higher. There's a saying, popularized by economist Scott Sumner, that one should “never reason from a price change”: Changes in the Treasury interest rate (or the price of borrowing) could be from any number of factors, so it's too simplistic to look at what happened and say “investors decided the US government became a riskier bet.” The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis. Other observers in the bond market have been sounding alarms, mostly citing excessive US borrowing. In 2023, Fitch, one of the three big credit rating agencies that issues risk evaluations of bonds, downgraded US debt, which previously had a perfect AAA rating. As the 2023 downgrade indicates, this change isn't entirely due to Trump. Covid did a number on the US debt picture, with trillions of dollars in relief measures passed and implemented, and many months of lower revenues due to the 2020 recession. But in January, as Trump prepared to return to the White House, bond analysts were already forecasting higher rates, noting his penchant for tax cuts and lack of seriousness about deficits. On May 20, amid the tax fight in Congress, a batch of 20-year government bonds had trouble selling at auction, sending rates flying higher still. The nominal (that is, not adjusted for inflation) 10-year Treasury rate has grown from lows of around 3.6 percent in September to above 4.4 percent now. But if you apply even a small increase in interest costs to the tens of trillions of dollars in debt the US government has outstanding, you get a very big number. Case in point: The Congressional Budget Office, as it evaluates Trump and Republicans' tax and spending proposals, is assuming 10-year interest rates of 4.1 percent this year, falling to 3.8 percent over time. What if, instead, rates stayed higher — at 4.4 percent, say? Even that modest-sounding change would cost the US government $1.8 trillion over the next decade, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; for scale, that's about what Trump's more extreme tariff plans are projected to bring in. Same goes for any deficit-financed spending that Democrats may want. Voters care more about tax cuts than the deficit. Why should it matter to me if some number labeled ‘deficit' goes up?” It may be true that voters can't easily parse the difference between a $1 and $2 trillion deficit. But they can definitely tell when things in their daily lives get more expensive, and higher interest costs will make everything more expensive. Thirty-year mortgage interest rates move in almost perfect tandem with long-term government bonds, as this chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows: That's exactly what an investor does when they buy a long-term government bond. Because mortgage borrowers (that is, homeowners) are typically considered riskier than the US government, they pay somewhat higher rates, but the two rates move together. If the US government starts paying more interest, mortgage borrowers will have to pay more interest too, so that banks lend to them rather than the federal government. That means that if the bond market sends rates on US debt higher, it's not just more expensive for the government; it's more expensive for anyone who borrows. That means homeowners with mortgages, anyone with credit card debt, anyone with a car loan, anyone taking a student loan, and, perhaps most importantly, businesses taking out loans to build factories or invest in research. The odds are still high that Congress passes some kind of deficit-exploding tax bill. The House passed its version by a single vote, and while some Republican senators have voiced complaints, Republicans' 53-vote majority there means they can afford a few defectors and still pass something. Many of the Trump tax cuts passed in 2017 are set to expire next year, and the political urge to avoid a sudden spike in taxes will probably overwhelm whatever pressure the bond market brings to bear. House Budget committee chair Jodey Arrington (R-TX) hinted to Politico's Victoria Guida that he thinks the markets may force more budget cuts than his party is inclined to support, saying, “If the bond markets don't think we're serious, I'm not sure it will matter what we do, because they're going to dictate the terms.” “Have you been watching what the bond markets are doing in relation to the one big, beautiful bill?” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) asked. “They're not thinking it's a very big, beautiful bill.” Trump's second term began with him bringing the richest man in the world to DC, with a promise to slash spending, by trillions a year if Elon Musk had his druthers. Now, Musk is leaving DC in a huff, having not meaningfully cut spending at all and by all accounts disillusioned and frustrated at his failure. The bond vigilantes' coming attack may be something much more serious. Our economy isn't built for the biological clock. ﻿To save the humanities, we need to rethink our assumptions about AI — and education. Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US. An unlikely alliance is supporting a new bipartisan bill in Congress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>﻿To save the humanities, we need to rethink our assumptions about AI — and education. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form or email sigal.samuel@vox.com. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity: I am a university teaching assistant, leading discussion sections for large humanities lecture classes. This also means I grade a lot of student writing — and, inevitably, see a lot of AI writing too. But as a TA, I only have limited ability to implement these policies. And in the meantime, AI-generated writing is so ubiquitous that to take course policy on it seriously, or even to escalate every suspected instance to the professor who runs the course, would be to make dozens of accusations, some of them false positives, for basically every assignment. I believe in the numinous, ineffable value of a humanities education, but I'm also not going to convince stressed 19-year-olds of that value by cracking down hard on something everyone does. How do I think about the ethics of enforcing the rules of an institution that they don't take seriously, or letting things slide in the name of building a classroom that feels less like an obstacle to circumvent? I know you said you believe in the “ineffable value of a humanities education,” but if we want to actually get clear on your dilemma, that ineffable value must be effed! So: What is the real value of a humanities education? Just as the engineering department or the math department justifies its existence by pointing to the products it creates — bridge designs, weather forecasts — humanities departments nowadays justify their existence by noting that their students create products, too: literary interpretations, cultural criticism, short films. That's never what they were supposed to be. In other words, while the purpose of other departments is ultimately to create a product, a humanities education is meant to be different, because the student herself is the product. She is what's getting created and recreated by the learning process. Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. This vision of education — as a pursuit that's supposed to be personally transformative — is what Aristotle proposed back in Ancient Greece. But because flourishing is devalued in our hypercapitalist society, you find yourself caught between that original vision and today's product-based, utilitarian vision. It's totally fair for them to be focusing on their job prospects. But your job is to focus on something else — something that will help them flourish in the long run, even if they don't fully see the value in it now. And I'd argue there's nothing more useful you can do for your students than help them cultivate this virtue, which is made more, not less, relevant by the advent of AI. Practical wisdom goes beyond just knowing general rules — “don't lie,” for example — and applying them mechanically like some sort of moral robot. It's about knowing how to make good judgments when faced with the complex, dynamic situations life throws at you. Sometimes that'll actually mean violating a classic rule (in certain cases, you should lie!). If you've honed your practical wisdom, you'll be able to discern the morally salient features of a particular situation and come up with a response that's well-attuned to that context. This is exactly the sort of deliberation that students will need to be good at as they step into the wider world. Unfortunately, that's exactly what using generative AI in the classroom threatens to short-circuit, because it removes something incredibly valuable: friction. Encountering friction is how we give our cognitive muscles a workout. Taking it out of the picture makes things easier in the short term, but in the long term, it can lead to intellectual deskilling, where our cognitive muscles gradually become weaker for lack of use. “Practical wisdom is built up by practice just like all the other virtues, so if you don't have the opportunity to reason and don't have practice in deliberating about certain things, you won't be able to deliberate well later,” philosopher of technology Shannon Vallor told me last year. “We need a lot of cognitive exercise in order to develop practical wisdom and retain it. And there is reason to worry about cognitive automation depriving us of the opportunity to build and retain those cognitive muscles.” So, how do you help your students retain and build their phronesis? Instead, I'd be honest with students about the real benefit of the humanities and about why mindless AI cheating would be cheating themselves out of that benefit. Then, I'd offer them two choices when it comes time to write an essay: They can either write it with help from AI, or without. I'd make it shorter than the original assignment but longer than a paragraph, so it forces them to develop the very reasoning skills they were trying to avoid using. As a TA, you could suggest this to professors, but they may not go for it. You could even stage a debate about AI: Assign half of them to argue the case for using chatbots to write papers and half of them to argue the opposite. If a professor insists on a strict “no AI” policy, and you encounter essays that seem clearly AI-written, you may have little choice but to report them. At least then you know they've achieved the most important aim. I feel for you and all other educators who are struggling in this confusing environment. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some educators are suffering from moral injury, a psychological condition that arises when you feel you've been forced to violate your own values. Generative AI is an existential threat to a humanities education as currently constituted. Over the next few years, humanities departments will have to paradigm-shift or perish. For now, from your pre-paradigm-shift perch, all you can do is make the choices that are left for you to make. A barrage of products promise you can get your hair — and self-esteem — back. Americans are losing faith in their friends and neighbors. Young adults from around the world are struggling.</p>
