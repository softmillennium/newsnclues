            Ukrainian forces have destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes parked at air bases thousands of miles from the front lines, according to a source in the country's security services, in one of Kyiv's most audacious and sophisticated counter assaults since the beginning of the war.
    


            The operation, dubbed “Spiderweb,” saw drones hit targets across a large swathe of Russia, including in Belaya – which is closer to Japan than Ukraine – and at Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, according to the source.
    


            More than 40 Russian aircraft were “burning en masse” at four air bases, the source said.
    


            The SBU, Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency, said the strikes caused an estimated $7 billion in damages and hit 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers at its main air bases.
    


            The drone attacks came on the eve of expected peace talks in Istanbul between Russia and Ukraine, which were already strained by uncertainty and pressure from US President Donald Trump.
    


            The Trump administration was not given a heads-up about the operation, an administration official told CNN.
    


            The strikes appear intended to send a message to Russia that Ukraine could still apply pressure more than three years since Russia's unprovoked invasion. Kyiv has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not wanting to end the war as Moscow ramps up its attacks and offensive operations, including launching its largest drone assault on Ukraine since the war began overnight Saturday.
    


            The operation, more than a year and a half in the making, involved drones being smuggled into Russian territory and hidden in wooden mobile houses atop trucks, according to the security source. The roofs were then remotely opened, and the drones deployed to launch their strikes.
    


            Social media video geolocated by CNN to seven kilometers southeast of the Belaya Air Base in Russia's eastern Irkutsk region, appears to show a drone flying out of a wooden shed loaded onto a truck as smoke rises in the background. Images also show drones stacked inside what appear to be wooden crates with retractable roofs ahead of the operation.
    


            “The planning, organization, and all the details were perfectly prepared. It can be confidently said that this was an absolutely unique operation,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X.
    


            Zelensky said 117 drones were used to carry out the attacks, which were played up as a military and propaganda win for Ukraine that caught Russia off-guard.

            “The ‘office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,” Zelensky said on X.
    


            More than 40 aircraft were known to have been hit, according to the Security source, including TU-95 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers and one of Russia's few remaining A-50 surveillance planes.
    


            “We are doing everything to drive the enemy from our native land! We will strike them at sea, in the air, and on land. And if needed — we'll reach them even from underground,” the SBU said in a statement.
    


            A senior US defense official told CNN that Ukraine's attack showed a level of sophistication that they had not seen before.
    


            US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth received regular updates as he traveled to Joint Base Andrews on Sunday but has not yet spoken to his Ukrainian counterparts, the official said.
    


            The airfields targeted included Belaya in Irkutsk, some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia, and the Dyagilevo base in Ryazan in western Russia, about 520 kilometers (320 miles) from Ukraine, which is a training center for Russia's strategic bomber force.
    


            The Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Ukraine, was also struck, according to the source, as well as the Ivanovo air base, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Ukraine. Ivanovo is a base for Russian military transport aircraft.
    


            The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed Ukraine had targeted Russian airfields across five regions on Sunday, calling the drone strikes “terrorist attacks.”
    


            The ministry said strikes were repelled in the Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions but that “several pieces of aircraft” caught fire after attacks in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions. It added that the fires had since been extinguished.
    


            There were no casualties as a result of the attacks, the ministry continued, adding that “some participants in the terrorist attacks have been detained.”
    


            The governor of Irkutsk region, Igor Kobzev, said that drones had been launched from a truck near the Belaya base.
    


            Kobzev said on Telegram that the exact number of drones deployed had not been determined. Emergency and security services were at the site, he added.
    


            SBU drones were targeting aircraft that bomb Ukrainian cities every night, the security source said.
    


            One video supplied by the source purportedly shows the Belaya airfield in flames and the voice of the head of the SBU, Lt. Gen. Vasyl Malyuk, commenting on the situation. “How beautiful Belaya airfield looks now. Enemy's strategic aircraft,” he says.
    


            CNN was able to confirm the location of that video, as well as two others posted on social media showing smoke rising from the Belaya air base. It was not immediately able to independently verify other videos provided by the SBU.
    


            The security source said that the operation was “extremely complicated from a logistical point of view,” with the drones carried inside wooden mobile homes that had been carried into Russia on trucks.
    


            “The drones were hidden under the roofs of the houses, which were already placed on trucks. At the right moment, the roofs were remotely opened, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.”
    


            One video purportedly of one attack appears to show drones rising from a truck, as vehicles pass on a nearby highway. Another image shows the roof of the truck on the ground.
    


            The source added that people involved were already back in Ukraine.
    


            Ukraine's operation followed a Russian attack overnight Saturday that involved 472 drones – Moscow's largest drone attack since the war began. It came the same day as a Russian missile strike on a training site used by Ukrainian forces, killing at least 12 people and wounding more than 60 others. It also came soon after two bridges collapsed in Russia's western regions bordering Ukraine in unclear circumstances.
    


            This chain of events comes as Russia and Ukraine are set to return to peace negotiations on Monday. The talks, which will take place in Istanbul, have been strained by uncertainty. US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration around Russian President Vladimir Putin's resistance to advancing the peace talks.
    


            Putin proposed holding “direct talks” in Turkey earlier this month – but never showed up, despite Zelensky agreeing to meet. In the end, the two nations sent low-level delegations to negotiate instead.
    


            A framework from the Ukrainian delegation lists key principles for the talks that include a full and unconditional ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, and the release of hostages and return of abducted children.

            Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and other 11 activists set sail on Sunday afternoon for Gaza on a ship aimed at “breaking Israel's siege” of the devastated territory, organizers said.
    


            The sailing boat Madleen – operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition — departed from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy.
    


            It will try to reach the shores of the Gaza Strip in an effort to bring in some aid and raise “international awareness” over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure.
    


            “We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,” Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech.
    


            “Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it's not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,” she added.
    


            Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic “blood libel.”
    


            In mid-May, Israel slightly eased its blockade of Gaza after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory.
    


            Experts have warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.
    


            UN agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly two million Palestinians.
    


            Among those joining the crew of the Madleen are “Game of Thrones” actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent. She has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.

Aid ship bound for Gaza catches fire after alleged Israeli drone attack off Malta



            The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.
    


            Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.
    


            That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the “Conscience”, was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.
    


            The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.
    


            The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
    


            In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.
    


            The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.
    


            “We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that's part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,” said activist Thiago Avila.
    


            Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza – an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media – which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border.

With all ballots counted, Nawrocki, a pro-Trump Eurosceptic, received 50.89 percent of the vote, while his centrist rival, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, garnered 49.11 percent, the National Electoral Commission (PKW) said at a press conference.

It added that Nawrocki, a staunch critic of the country's centrist government, won a total of 10,606,628 votes, while Trzaskowski, the government-backed candidate, secured 10,237,177.

It was the highest turnout for a presidential vote since 1990 and second only to the 2023 parliamentary election, which saw 74.38 percent, Sylwester Marciniak, head of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.

Nawrocki, 42, a historian and amateur boxer who headed the state-run Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), campaigned on a promise to prioritise economic and social policies for Poles over other nationalities, including refugees from neighbouring Ukraine, the Reuters news agency reported.

It said the vote was being closely watched in Ukraine, Russia, the United States and across the European Union.

In the first round on May 18, Trzaskowski narrowly led with 31.4 percent to Nawrocki's 29.5 percent. As no candidate won an outright majority, a runoff was required.

Outgoing President Andrzej Duda, whose second term ends on August 6, congratulated Nawrocki on his victory and thanked voters for turning out in large numbers, as well as ""for fulfilling their duty as citizens"" and ""for taking responsibility for Poland.""

DZIĘKUJĘ! Za udział w wyborach prezydenckich. Za frekwencję. Za spełnienie obywatelskiej powinności. Za wzięcie odpowiedzialności za Polskę. Gratuluję Zwycięscy! Trwaj mocna POLSKO! 🇵🇱

In a separate post, Duda described the closely contested election as ""a difficult, at times painful, but undeniably brave fight for Poland—for how the country's affairs should be run.""

Panu Prezydentowi-Elektowi dr. Karolowi Nawrockiemu jeszcze raz gratuluję zwycięstwa w wyborach. To był trudny, czasem bolesny ale niezwykle mężny bój o Polskę, o to jak mają być prowadzone sprawy naszej Ojczyzny. Dziękuję za tę heroiczną walkę do ostatniej minuty kampanii!…

""Thank you for this heroic effort right up to the final minute of the campaign,"" he wrote, addressing Nawrocki.

US President Donald Trump's nominee for ambassador to Warsaw, Thomas Rose, said on X: ""Congratulations to Poland - proving yet again throughout the ups and downs of a hard fought campaign between two great patriots exactly what a strong, proud and free people and nation they are! If Poland wins the world wins!""

CONGRATULATIONS TO POLAND - proving yet again throughout the ups and downs of a hard fought campaign between two great patriots exactly what a strong, proud and free people and nation they are!! IF POLAND WINS THE WORLD WINS!!

European Union President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Nawrocki early on Monday, saying she was ""confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation"" with Poland.

""We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values,"" she wrote in a post. ""So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home.""

Congratulations to @NawrockiKn.I'm confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland.We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values.So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home.

An initial exit poll released after voting ended on Sunday evening had pointed to a Trzaskowski victory.

Speaking to supporters on election night, Trzaskowski claimed victory but cautioned that his lead was razor-thin.

He thanked voters and all those who backed him in the race, pledging to ""connect and build"" if confirmed as the country's new president.

""This is a special moment in Poland's history, and I am convinced it will help us all move forward ... to focus primarily on the future,"" he told the crowd.

""I will truly be the president of all Poles; I will be your president,"" he declared.

Nawrocki, meanwhile, urged his supporters to wait for the official results.

“We will win and save Poland,"" he vowed.

""We have to win tonight—and we know we will,"" he added, as updated projections and vote counts were expected later in the night.

The Polish president holds veto power over legislation passed by parliament, a key prerogative in a deeply polarised political landscape.

Nawrocki's win could usher in a period of heightened political tension and pose new challenges to the pro-European government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, potentially leading to legislative gridlock, particularly on judicial and social reforms, according to political analysts.

Nawrocki told supporters on Sunday evening that Tusk's government must not hold a ""monopoly"" on power, calling it ""a bad government, one that does a poor job managing public finances and is stripping away our great dreams and aspirations.""

In his speech, he thanked his supporters, including those who backed other ""patriotic"" candidates in the first round.

""We also accomplished something very important—something that will endure for months and years to come,"" he said. ""We've managed to unite the patriotic camp in Poland—everyone who wants a normal Poland, a Poland without illegal immigrants, a safe Poland.""

The election outcome marks a significant shift in voter preferences, signalling a resurgence of right-wing sentiment.

Nawrocki's campaign emphasised traditional values and a cautious approach to European integration.

Trzaskowski's narrow loss underscores the polarisation of Polish society, with urban centres leaning liberal and rural areas favouring conservative policies.

Nawrocki, whose presidential bid was backed by the right-wing opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, pledged to promote Catholic family values and oppose liberal reforms, including any effort to relax abortion rules.

An admirer of Trump's style of leadership, he is also expected to support policies aligning Poland more closely with the United States.

Trzaskowski, a senior figure in Tusk's ruling Civic Coalition (KO), campaigned on a platform of strengthening EU ties and democratic institutions.

The close race highlighted a deep divide among the electorate over the country's future direction.

Britain is moving towards a war footing with the launch of a major rearmament campaign, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a keynote address on Monday.

Starmer unveiled his cabinet's Strategic Defense Review, which includes an expansive armaments program mirroring similar efforts across NATO. Last week, UK Defense Secretary John Healey said London was sending “a message to Moscow” by allocating billions of pounds for new munitions plants, long-range missile systems, and other capabilities. Russia has accused Western nations of using alarmist rhetoric to justify shifting public funds toward military spending.

”We are moving to war-fighting readiness,” Starmer said at a shipyard in Govan, Glasgow, adding that “our defense policy will always be NATO first.” He vowed to transform the UK into “a battle-ready, armor-clad nation with the strongest alliances and the most advanced capabilities equipped for the decades to come.”

According to Starmer, the overhaul will enable Britain to make its “biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.” He also pledged that the country would become “the fastest innovator in NATO,” with defense research operating at a “wartime pace.” The reforms are expected to make the British military “ten times more lethal by 2035,” he claimed.

The prime minister reaffirmed his government's goal to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP. He framed the effort as replacing the post-Cold War “peace dividend” with a “defense dividend” through the creation of thousands of new jobs in weapons manufacturing, including production of nuclear arms.

Starmer blamed Moscow for what he called a series of provocations, accusing Russia of “menacing” the UK, demonstrating “aggression” in British waters, and “driving up the cost of living here at home,” harming British workers.

Russian lawmaker Aleksey Pushkov has accused the UK of planning an “ice war” with Russia, noting that “there is no difference between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party” in their attitude.

Commenting on Starmer's pledge to build additional nuclear submarines, Pushkov asserted that no British investments could bring the country to an equal footing with Russia, the US, and China. However, “Starmer needs them [those boats] to report his achievements” to domestic and international players who stand to benefit financially from the project, Pushkov claimed.

The US proposal for a new nuclear agreement with Iran is unacceptable, an Iranian source familiar with the matter told RT. Washington recently outlined its terms in a letter to Iran after five rounds of talks mediated by Oman.

“Iran views the US written elements as extremely far from what could possibly be regarded as a fair and realistic basis for a likely compromise,” the source said.

“Iranians were dismayed to see such a fanciful, one-sided text that is so out of touch with reality,” the source added.

The White House said on Sunday that President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, sent “a detailed and acceptable proposal” to Tehran. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt reiterated Washington's position that “Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb.”

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the Islamic Republic would provide a response “in line with the principles, national interests, and rights of the people of Iran.”

Trump earlier insisted on a “total dismantlement” of Iran's nuclear program, suggesting the country should not be allowed to enrich uranium even for civilian purposes. Araghchi rejected these terms, saying the US must lift all sanctions and “uphold Iran's nuclear rights, including enrichment.”

During his first term in office, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 UN-backed Iran nuclear deal, accusing the country of secretly violating it, and reimposed sanctions as part of his ‘maximum pressure' campaign. Tehran denied that it violated the 2015 agreement, but has since increased uranium enrichment.

North Korea has slammed a report by a Western sanctions monitoring group's on its ties with Russia, calling it a “political provocation.” Cooperation with Moscow is a “legitimate exercise of the DPRK's sovereign rights,” Pyongyang has insisted.

The report was released last week by the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Group (MSMT), created by the US and South Korea to monitor enforcement of UN sanctions against North Korea.

It alleges “illegal” military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, including purported arms transfers from North Korea to Russia, troop deployments and training, excess petroleum shipments, and financial coordination.

Citing data from its 11 members and open-source intelligence, the report claims these actions violate UN Security Council resolutions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

Pyongyang considers the MSMT report a “hostile act” and the organization a “ghost group without any legitimacy” and a “political tool” operating “according to the geopolitical interests of the West.”

“The hostile acts of the MSMT… are a flagrant violation of the international legal principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs and a mockery of the fair and just international community,” the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in its statement on Sunday, as cited by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The ministry called the report a fabrication and denounced it as politically biased and “provocative.”

Military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang is “aimed at protecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security interests” of the countries and “ensuring peace and stability in the Eurasian region,” the ministry claimed. It stressed that it is a “legitimate exercise of sovereign rights” of both countries in accordance with the UN Charter.

Moscow has not yet commented on the MSMT report.

In June 2024, Russia and North Korea signed the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement, which includes a clause providing for military and other assistance in the event of armed invasion of either side. Several weeks later, South Korean and US media reported the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia's Kursk Region, which at the time was under Ukrainian attack. Moscow and Pyongyang confirmed the military presence in late April after Russian forces declared the region fully liberated.

The MSMT group was created last October after the disbandment of the UN Panel of Experts on DPRK, which had monitored the implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea until a Russian veto ended its mandate. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova at the time called MSMT “illegal,” saying it was created by “uninvited enthusiasts bypassing the UN Security Council” who “demonstrate blatant disregard for international law.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is alleged to have shouted ‘Free Palestine' as he attacked crowd in Boulder, in what the FBI is treating as an ‘act of terrorism'

A man has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple other felonies after he allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to attack a crowd of people who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza, injuring eight.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is alleged to have shouted “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowd on Sunday. The FBI said Soliman told police he planned the attack for a year and had specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the Associated Press reported.

Soliman was booked into Boulder county jail on Sunday and has a hearing scheduled for 1.30pm local time on Monday.

An FBI affidavit said Mohammed Soliman – upon confessing to Sunday's attack after his arrest – told the police he would do it again.

Officials said there was no indication that the attack was associated with any group. NBC reported Soliman was an Egyptian national, and the White House claimed Soliman was in the US without legal status.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old, including a woman that a Department of Justice official said was a survivor of the Holocaust, were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said, with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, close to the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group which aims to draw attention to the people taken hostage following Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel.

Soliman is alleged to have thrown a device into a group of people who had assembled in a pedestrianized zone for the peaceful rally. The Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time on Sunday of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old University of Colorado student, told Reuters she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, Coffman said.

She said she saw a man whom she presumed to be the attacker holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

“Everybody is yelling: ‘Get water, get water,'” Coffman said.

Alex Osante, from San Diego, told the Associated Press he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In a video of the scene filmed by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had been burned during the attack.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a molotov cocktail but appeared to accidentally set himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

The justice department said one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor.

“She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,” said Leo Terrell, a senior counsel on civil rights in the justice department. “This is all caused by the same type of hatred: antisemitism.” Terrell, who leads the Trump administration's antisemitism taskforce, was criticized in March after he shared a post by a white supremacist.

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, identified Soliman as the lone suspect.

“It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek told a press conference, citing witnesses.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, described the incident as a “targeted terror attack”, and Colorado's attorney general, Phil Weiser, said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted”.

Soliman is due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time on Monday, according to Boulder county jail records. He is being held on a $10m bond. Law enforcement officials said Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

On his Truth Social platform Monday, Donald Trump said the attack “will not be tolerated in the United States of America”. The president also said acts of terrorism “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.

In a post on X, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, described Soliman as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed his tourist visa. Miller criticized Joe Biden's presidential administration, whom he said had given Soliman a work permit.

CNN, citing law enforcement officials, reported that Soliman arrived in the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump's presidency.

Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005.

Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”.

In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman's presence in the US to “Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was “illegally in our country”.

“He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said.

The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Israel's war in Gaza, which in the US has spurred both an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes.

It follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Donald Trump's administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel's war on Gaza have taken place.

Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. It is still holding 58 hostages in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be still alive. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement that the Colorado victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mohamed Soliman, who faces potential murder charges, said he targeted what he described as the ‘Zionist group', according to several media reports

Suspect charged with multiple felonies in attack on Colorado rally for Israeli hostages

The FBI have said the man charged in the attack in Boulder, Colorado, that left eight people injured told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”.
 An FBI affidavit says Mohammed Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again, the Associated Press reports.
 The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the justice department earlier today.
 The group that was targeted had gathered in a popular pedestrian park in Boulder to draw attention to the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

The Islamic Center of Boulder has condemned the “targeted violence” of yesterday's attack. “Such actions have no place in the Boulder community,” the center said in a statement today.

The statement reads:

Hate and violence oppose our values and are a threat to all Americans. We call on our neighbors to focus on supporting the victims of this terrible attack, and to reject those who would use this horrible incident to divide our community.

Every individual and every community has the constitutional right to peaceful assembly and free expression. These fundamental freedoms must be respected and safeguarded for everyone, regardless of their views or background.

Earlier this morning, Colorado attorney general Phil Weiser said the Boulder attack was “very cruel” and has “every single hallmark of being a hate crime”.

“This was a peaceful march done every single week by the Jewish community, calling out the injustices of the hostages, and they were attacked because of who they are,” he said on MSNBC. “It is heart-wrenching for all of us in Colorado.”

“It is repulsive,” said Weiser, who is Jewish, of the violence. “It's got to be condemned. There's no possible justification for this.”

Donald Trump has said the suspect in the Boulder attack would be prosecuted to “to the fullest extent of the law” and stressed the need for his deportation policies, saying the suspect “must go”.

“Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “He must go out under ‘TRUMP' Policy.”

Here's the full post:

Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America. He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in yesterday's attack in Boulder, Colorado, on a crowd who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza has been charged with a hate crime, CNN is reporting citing an affidavit filed today.

He was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin”, CNN quotes the affidavit as saying.

Donald Trump's administration has asked the supreme court to halt a judicial order blocking mass job cuts and the restructuring of agencies, Reuters reports.

The justice department's request came after San Francisco-based US district judge Susan Illston blocked large-scale federal layoffs, known as “reductions in force,” in a 22 May ruling siding with a group of unions, non-profit groups and local governments that challenged the administration.

The case involves the departments of agriculture, commerce, health and human services, state, treasury and veterans affairs, among others.

Trump directed federal agencies in February to “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force” as part of his administration's restructuring plans.

Illston wrote in her ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering the downsizing. “As history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,” Illston wrote.

Illston on 9 May had initially blocked about 20 agencies from making mass layoffs for two weeks and ordered the reinstatement of workers who had lost their jobs. She continued most of that relief in her 22 May ruling.

The San Francisco-based 9th US circuit court of appeals in a 2-1 ruling on 30 May denied the Trump administration's request to halt the judge's ruling.

The 9th Circuit said the administration had not shown that it would suffer an irreparable injury if the judge's order remained in place and that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in their lawsuit. “The executive order at issue here far exceeds the president's supervisory powers under the Constitution,” the 9th Circuit wrote, calling the administration's actions “an unprecedented attempted restructuring of the federal government and its operations.”

Trump's administration has sought relief from the supreme court in a growing number of cases following rulings by lower courts impeding various policies since he returned to office in January.

Police found 16 additional molotov cocktails in the area where the Boulder attack suspect was spotted, CNN is reporting citing multiple law enforcement sources.

The suspect arrived in the area of the incident around 1pm local time and lingered there before throwing two incendiary devices, according to multiple law enforcement sources. He was wearing a utility vest over his shirt and was carrying a garden sprayer filled with gasoline, sources said.

Many witnesses said he looked like a gardener, officials added. He used the garden sprayer as the ‘makeshift flamethrower', apparently, by spraying gasoline in the direction of the marchers while holding a lighter in front of the stream of fuel, sources said.

Investigators believe he stopped at gas stations in the area before the attack to fill the bottles and the garden sprayer.

Witnesses said the suspect took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. He was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.

Democratic senator Chris Murphy has launched a new political action committee to help fund groups that are organizing opposition to the Trump administration.

The group, American Mobilization Pac, plans to spend $400,000 to organizations that oppose cuts to Medicaid and register young people to vote. The group expects to spend upwards of $2m in the 2026 midterm cycle, Politico reports.

In an interview with the outlet, Murphy said his Pac is unique because it is not focused on funding campaigns and instead is looking to mobilize people against Trump's agenda. He said:

All of us have to realize that if we don't act aggressively right now to organize and mobilize, we may not have our democracy in 2026. I'm a believer that the only thing that is ultimately going to stop Trump's corruption and his destruction of democracy is mass mobilization.

At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics across seven states have shuttered since the start of 2025 or have announced plans to close soon – closures that come amid immense financial and political turbulence for the reproductive health giant as the United States continues to grapple with the fallout from the end of Roe v Wade.

The Planned Parenthood network, which operates nearly 600 clinics through a web of independent regional affiliates and is overseen by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, is facing a number of threats from the Trump administration.

A Guardian analysis has found that Planned Parenthood closures have occurred or are in the works across six affiliates that maintain clinics in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Utah and Vermont.

In late March, the Trump administration suddenly froze tens of millions of dollars in funding for nine Planned Parenthood affiliates, including at least two that have since closed clinics or are set to do so soon.

The funding, which flowed from the federal family planning program Title X, was used to provide services such as contraception, cancer screenings and STI tests.

Donald Trump is expected to have a direct conversation with Chinese president Xi Jinping in the coming days after his outburst last week accusing Beijing of “totally violating” an interim trade deal reached by the two countries in Geneva last month. According to CNBC the call will come “very soon” but probably not today.

Politico had also reported this morning that cabinet members confirmed yesterday that trade talks with China had slowed but had also hinted at the Trump-Xi conversation likely taking place this week. “That's our expectation,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said a call should come “very soon”, telling CBS that China has slow-walked a critical minerals agreement – which was also cited by US trade representative Jamieson Greer last week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ryan Yarbrough picked up a dazzling World Series ring from his time with the Los Angeles Dodgers last season. Then he went out and beat them.

The New York Yankees starter on Sunday pitched one-run ball over six innings, struck out a season-high five and blanked the Dodgers' top four hitters in a 7-3 win.

“I feel like I'm in a really good place right now and really trying to continue that,” Yarbrough said. “I'm having a lot of fun.”

The 33-year-old left-hander made 44 relief appearances between the Dodgers and Blue Jays last season. The Dodgers designated him for assignment on July 29 and the next day traded him to Toronto.

So even though he was not around for their World Series victory over the Yankees, Yarbrough earned a ring. He accepted it from Dodgers general manager Brandon Gomes on Friday last week behind home plate during batting practice.

“Trying to keep that a little discreet, especially with where we're at now, but kind of cool to be able to get that,” Yarbrough said.

He signed a US$2 million, one-year deal with New York in March and is 3-0 with a 2.83 ERA this season.

Making his first career start against the Dodgers, Yarbrough recorded 17 swings-and-misses — including seven with his sweeper.

The top four hitters in Los Angeles' lineup had produced at least one hit in every game this season. That is until Shohei Ohtani, Teoscar Hernandez, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith combined to go none for 14 in the series finale against Yarbrough and the Yankees.

New York manager Aaron Boone has called Yarbrough a throwback, noting his 1.96m frame creates a “funky” angle for hitters.

“He's got a lot of ways to get you out. Just when you think he's slowing you down, slowing you down, he's able to speed you up enough,” Boone said. “It feels like it's hard to get a bead on him.”

It certainly was for Ohtani. He struck out on five pitches in the first inning, when Yarbrough retired the side in order. Later, he set down 13 of 15 batters before exiting.

“He's not going to light up the radar gun, but all his pitches feel like they get on you,” teammate D.J. LeMahieu said. “His fastballs look like they get on you and his off-speed looks extra slow. He's got good stuff and he knows what he's doing out there.”

Yarbrough conceded his familiarity with his former teammates helped, too.

“It was just a matter of execution and keeping them off balance, and not putting them in counts where they can really hunt for certain pitches,” he said.

It was also a big night for LeMahieu, who had his first four-hit game since 2021. He drove in two runs and raised his batting average to .239.

The second baseman had three singles and a double on a night when Aaron Judge was the only Yankees player without a hit.

“I feel good. Good to get some results,” LeMahieu said.

Elsewhere, the Brewers beat the Phillies 5-2, the Rangers routed the Cardinals 8-1, the Red Sox defeated the Braves 3-1, the Orioles edged the White Sox 3-2, the Giants mastered the Marlins 4-2, the Blue Jays overcame the Athletics 8-4 and the Guardians downed the Angels 4-2.

The Mets downed the Rockies 5-3, the Astros stung the Rays 1-0, the Tigers tamed the Royals 1-0, the Cubs crushed the Reds 7-3, the Diamondbacks defeated the Nationals 3-1, the Padres sank the Pirates 6-4 and the Mariners edged the Twins 2-1.

A global target of having 30 percent of the oceans become protected areas by 2030 is looking more fragile than ever, with little progress and the US backing away, conservationists said.

“With less than 10 percent of the ocean designated as MPAs [marine protected areas] and only 2.7 percent fully or highly protected, it is going to be difficult to reach the 30 percent target,” said Lance Morgan, head of the Marine Conservation Institute in Seattle.

The institute maps the MPAs for an online atlas, updating moves to meet the 30 percent goal that 196 countries signed onto in 2022, under the Kunling-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

The ambition is notably at risk, because “we see countries like the US reversing course and abandoning decades of bipartisan efforts” to protect areas of the Pacific Ocean, Morgan said.

That referred to an April executive order by US President Donald Trump authorizing industrial-scale fishing in big swathes of an MPA in that ocean.

There are 16,516 declared MPAs in the world, covering just 8.4 percent of the oceans.

However, not all are created equal: Some forbid all forms of fishing, while others place no roles, or almost none, on what activities are proscribed or permitted.

“Only a third of them have levels of protection that would yield proper benefits” for fish, said Joachim Claudet, a socioecology marine researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research.

Daniel Pauly, a professor of fisheries science at the University of British Columbia, said “the marine protected areas have not really been proposed for the protection of biodiversity,” but “to increase fish catches.”

A proper MPA “exports fish to non-protected zones, and that should be the main reason that we create marine protected areas — they are needed to have fish,” he said.

When fish populations are left to reproduce and grow in protected areas, there is often a spillover effect that sees fish stocks outside the zones also rise, as several scientific journals have noted, especially around a no-fishing MPA in Hawaiian waters that is the biggest in the world.

One 2022 study in the Science journal showed a 54 percent increase in yellowfin tuna around that Hawaiian MPA, an area now threatened by Trump's executive order, Pauly said.

For such sanctuaries to work, there need to be fishing bans over all or at least some of their zones, Claudet said. 

However, MPAs with such restrictions account for just 2.7 percent of the ocean's area, and are almost always in parts that are far from areas heavily impacted by human activities.

In Europe, for instance, “90 percent of the marine protected areas are still exposed to bottom trawling,” said Alexandra Cousteau, a spokesperson for the non-governmental organization Oceana. “It's ecological nonsense.”

Pauly said that “bottom trawling in MPAs is like picking flowers with a bulldozer... They scrape the seabed.”

Oceana said French MPAs suffered intensive bottom trawling, 17,000 hours' worth last year, as did those in British waters, with 20,600 hours. 

The NGO is calling for a ban on the technique, which involves towing a heavy net along the sea floor, churning it up. Governments need to back words with action, or else these areas would be no more than symbolic markings on a map, said Jacob Armstrong, head of the WWF's European office for the oceans.

17:35 JST, June 2, 2025

NEW DELHI, June 2 (Reuters) – The head of a global airlines industry body said on Monday that growing trade barriers risked damaging the economy and the air travel sector, and “unacceptable” plane delivery delays were frustrating growth plans at a time of record passenger numbers.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) shaved a key forecast for 2025 industry-wide profits, blaming trade tensions and declining consumer confidence.

“Like all forms of connectivity, flying makes the world more prosperous,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said at the group's annual meeting in New Delhi.

“That stands in contrast to isolationism, trade barriers and the fragmentation of the multilateral rules-based system. These destroy wealth and lower living standards. For the times we live in, this is an important message,” he said.

Sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have stoked fears of an economic slowdown and squeezed discretionary spending, prompting many consumers especially in the United States to delay or scale back travel plans.

They also threaten a decades-old pact between more than 30 countries to eliminate duties on aircraft and their parts.

While Walsh said there was no indication aircraft prices had increased due to tariffs, he said airlines would resist any attempt by aerospace manufacturers to raise prices and called for governments to “keep aerospace out of trade wars.”

IATA represents some 300 airlines accounting for more than 80% of global traffic.

On environmental sustainability, Walsh said progress was not what it should be at this point in time. He criticized energy firms for not producing enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is made from waste oil and biomass and costs more than conventional jet fuel.

IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will struggle to meet their sustainability goals, but Walsh said the aviation industry was still aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF.

More people are flying than ever before after a post-pandemic passenger market recovery, but airline growth is being hampered by extended plane delivery delays and supply chain bottlenecks driving up maintenance and repair time.

Walsh called predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade “off-the-chart unacceptable.” He said the airline industry was evaluating legal options over the delays, but it preferred to work with manufacturers collaboratively.

“The manufacturing sector is failing badly,” he said.

IATA said the number of deliveries scheduled for 2025 was 26% less than what was promised a year ago, although at 1,692 this would be the highest number of new planes since 2018.

“Further downward revisions are likely, given that supply chain issues are expected to persist in 2025 and possibly to the end of the decade,” IATA said in the update to its industry outlook.

Tim Clark, president of the world's largest international airline, Dubai's Emirates, said on Sunday that the pandemic was no longer an acceptable excuse for delivery delays and challenged planemakers to take responsibility.

Similar frustration was voiced by Saudi budget carrier flyadeal.

“Delays are becoming inexcusable. Transparency, to be frank, is lacking, and we're getting agitated. How else can we plan? I mean it is just going beyond a joke now,” flyadeal CEO Steven Greenway told Reuters.

U.S. planemaker Boeing BA.N is trying to stabilize and ramp up production after a quality crisis and a labor strike slowed output last year.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Europe's Airbus AIR.PA has been warning airlines it faces another three years of delivery delays.

Despite the challenges, carriers are still looking to purchase more planes to ensure they can meet future travel demand.

Tata Group's Air India is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a major new aircraft order including some 200 extra single-aisle planes, topping up a mammoth deal in 2023 as the former state carrier pursues a multi-billion-dollar revamp, Reuters reported on Sunday.

An operation by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) using first-person-view (FPV) drones smuggled deep inside Russian and hidden inside trucks has hit 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airfields across the country, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on June 1.

The operation — codenamed ""Spiderweb"" and a year-and-a-half in the planning — appears to have dealt a major blow to the aircraft Moscow uses to launch long-range missile attacks on Ukraine's cities.

""The SBU first transported FPV drones to Russia, and later, on the territory of the Russian Federation, the drones were hidden under the roofs of mobile wooden cabins, already placed on trucks,"" the source said.

""At the right moment, the roofs of the cabins were opened remotely, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.""

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

""Currently, more than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3,"" the source added.

The SBU later reported that the drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile carriers in key Russian airbases.

The agency said that more details will be revealed soon. Also, they vowed to continue to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory.

“We will strike them (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we'll get them from underground too,” the SBU said.

A video provided by the source shows what appears to be a row of heavy bomber aircraft on fire at one of the airbases.

Unconfirmed videos posted on social media show FPV drones being launched from trucks parked near the airfields.

Irkutsk Oblast Governor Igor Kobzev later confirmed ""a drone attack on a military unit in the village of Sredny"" and said the ""source"" of the drones was a ""truck.""

Murmansk Governor Andrey Chibis later confirmed that ""enemy drones have attacked the territory of the Murmansk region"" but gave no further details.

Later on June 1, Russia's Defense Ministry acknowledged what it described as a ""terrorist attack"" on the four air bases and said ""several units of aircraft caught fire"" at Murmansk and Irkutsk.

Ukraine has long-struggled to target the Russian bombers used to launch mass missile targets against Ukrainian cities, as Moscow has kept them out of range of weapons Kyiv has developed itself as well as those supplied by its Western allies. 

The use of FPV drones in such a way would mark just the latest stage in the ever-evolving and still relatively fledgling world on drone warfare.

The attack was also likely highly cost effective — FPV drones can be bought for a just a few hundred dollars each but the cost of 41 heavy bombers runs into the billions.

The source said that those behind the operation have ""been in Ukraine for a long time.""

""So, if the Putin regime demonstratively detains someone, it will be another staged performance for the domestic audience,"" they said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky and SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk personally oversaw the operation, they added.

On the evening of June 1, Zelensky described the operation as ""brilliant,"" adding that Russia suffered ""significant losses — entirely justified and deserved.""

""What's most interesting, and this can now be stated publicly, is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,"" he said in a post on social media.

""In total, 117 drones were used in the operation with a corresponding number of drone operators involved,"" he added.

It's genuinely satisfying when something I authorized a year and six months ago comes to fruition and deprives Russians of over forty units of strategic aviation. We will continue this work.

Maliuk publicly confirmed on June 2 the details of the attack, including successful hits against 41 planes parked at the four aforementioned air bases. The SBU chief stressed that ""our strikes will last exactly as long as Russia keeps terrorizing Ukrainians with missiles and Shahed drones.""

Russia ""thought that it could bomb Ukraine and endlessly kill Ukrainians with impunity. But that is not the case. We will respond to Russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere - at sea, in the air, and on land,"" Maliuk added.

In March, Ukraine announced it had developed a new drone with a range of 3,000 kilometers but gave no details about its type, its name, the size of its warhead, or when it would go into mass production.

But even this long-range drone would not be capable of reaching some of the air bases hit in the operation.

The A-50 provides several critical functions for the ongoing war in Ukraine, such as detecting air defense systems, guided missiles, and coordinating targets for Russian fighter jets. 

Russia possesses fewer than ten of these planes. A-50 aircraft have an estimated price tag of around $350 million.

The  Tupolev Tu-95, the Tupolev Tu-22, as well as the Tupolev Tu-160, are all Russian heavy bombers regularly used to launch missiles at Ukrainian cities.

The Tu-95 is the oldest of the three aircraft, a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

It features turboprop engines rather than jet engines, as during the Cold War, their increased efficiency allowed it to fly all the way to the United States without refueling.

The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles, which pose a particular problem for Ukraine. It is supersonic and travels at around 4,000 kilometers per hour. 

Currently, it can only be shot down with the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and potentially the SAMP-T, a joint Italian-French system.

The Tu-160 is Russia's more modern strategic bomber, entering service in 1987. To this day, it remains the largest operational bomber in the world.

It can carry a total of 12 Kh-55 missiles and up to 24 Kh-15s.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:kyivindependent.com","Ukraine, Russia end second round of peace talks, no ceasefire achieved","https://kyivindependent.com/istanbul-talks-june-2/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 13:38:19 GMT","

Editor's note: The story is being updated.

The Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, agreeing on a new prisoners of war (POWs) exchange but failing to reach a ceasefire.

The talks, hosted by Turkish officials, follow the first round of negotiations on May 16. The initial meeting ended with an agreement on the largest prisoner exchange of the war, but without any tangible progress toward a peace deal.

The parties agreed to conduct a major swap, which will include severely injured and young people aged 18 to 25. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the next prisoner exchange would feature at least 1,000 people on each side, and might reach a 1,200-for-1,200 swap that would possibly also include imprisoned journalists and political prisoners held in Russia.

After the talks, Russia pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine and also proposed a ceasefire for two or three days in some areas of the front line in order to retrieve the bodies of the fallen soldiers. 

Zelensky said that only 15% of the mentioned 6,000 are identified and that Ukraine would need to check that the bodies Russia is willing to return are those of Ukrainian soldiers.

""We had instances when they returned bodies that later were identified as their own,"" Zelensky said on June 2.

Kyiv also handed over to the Russian delegation a list of 339 children abducted by Russia, and Moscow passed over its memorandum of proposals for a ceasefire. Ukraine submitted its document on May 28.

Following the talks, the Kyiv Independent obtained the text of the peace proposals that Ukraine presented to Russia in Istanbul.

According to the document, the Ukrainian delegation offered Moscow a complete ceasefire, the exchange of prisoners of war in an ""all-for-all format,"" bringing back the children abducted by Russia, and the release of all civilians from Russian captivity.

Ukraine called for guarantees that would prevent Russia from repeating its aggression, as well as the involvement of the international community to achieve this.

According to Ukraine's proposal seen by the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine will continue on its path toward joining the EU and will become a member of NATO if there is consensus within the alliance.

Ukraine is also ready to agree to the gradual lifting of some sanctions against Russia, but with a mechanism for their renewal if necessary. Frozen Russian assets, in turn, should be used to restore Ukraine and pay reparations.

Umerov was leading Ukraine's 14-member delegation, which includes several figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors who did not take part in the May 16 negotiations.

Before meeting with Russian officials, Umerov held a bilateral meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Suspilne reported.

Russian delegates were led by Medinsky, who represented Moscow both during the first unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul in 2022 and then again in May this year.

Russia has not officially submitted its memorandum outlining peace terms, but Ukraine plans to present a detailed roadmap aimed at securing a lasting settlement.

Before the talks, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia and Ukrainian delegation member Oleksandr Bevz met representatives from Germany, Italy, and the U.K. to coordinate their positions, Tykhyi said on X.

""Members of the Ukrainian delegation reiterated Ukraine's commitment to peace efforts. They elaborated on the items of the agenda, which include leaders' meeting, a full ceasefire, and humanitarian confidence-building measures,"" he added.

Security advisors from the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany also plan to attend the talks, according to U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.

While the U.S. and Ukraine have pushed for an unconditional ceasefire, the Kremlin has rejected it.

Instead, Moscow has regularly voiced maximalist demands that are unlikely to be accepted by Kyiv, such as recognition of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian regions and withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the parts of these regions remaining under Kyiv's control.

Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's reluctance to make concessions and its intensifying and deadly attacks on Ukraine. He has so far refused to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

The talks are taking place only a day after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched a mass drone attack against Russian air bases, allegedly hitting 41 Russian bombers and disabling 34% of Russia's cruise missile air fleet.

Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has taken a narrow lead in the race to become the next president of Poland, but the final result is too close to call and won't be known until Monday. 

Mr. Nawrocki was projected to win 51 per cent of the vote according to two late exit poll released Sunday night that also took into account returns from several regions. A pair of earlier exit polls had given his centrist opponent, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, a slight lead, although those surveys did not include actual results. 

Ballot counting was expected to continue into Monday, but both candidates claimed victory Sunday night. 

“We won,” Mr. Trzaskowski told supporters at an election night gathering in a Warsaw museum. “This is a special moment in the history of Poland. I am convinced that this will allow us to move forward like a torpedo and focus primarily on the future.”

Mr. Nawrocki, who is backed by the populist Law and Justice party, or PiS, told his supporters that “we will win and save Poland. We have to win tonight and we know that we will.”

Poland's president is largely ceremonial, but oversees foreign policy, heads the military and can block legislation passed by parliament. 

If the two earlier polls are correct, Mr. Trzaskowski's win would be transformative for Poland's centrist government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk and a welcome relief for the European Union. 

It would also be a further rebuke of PiS, which ruled Poland for eight years until the party was ousted by Mr. Tusk's Civic Coalition in October, 2023. 

Mr. Tusk has blamed the current President, PiS supporter Andrzej Duda, for thwarting his legislative agenda, which includes liberalizing Poland's strict abortion laws and unwinding changes to the judiciary introduced by PiS. Mr. Duda was elected in 2015 and 2020, but he couldn't run for a third term. 

Mr. Trzaskowski is staunchly pro-EU. His victory would follow a week after Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan, another pro-EU candidate, won the presidential election in Romania – defeating ultranationalist George Simion, who threatened to weaken the country's role in the bloc. 

“Rafał Trzaskowski's victory will be of great importance for Donald Tusk's government, because it will unblock the legislative paralysis,” said Anna Siewierska, a political science professor at the University of Rzeszow. 

“Trzaskowski's election win will also be a clear strengthening of Poland's European course and, importantly, a guarantee of strong and unconditional support for Ukraine fighting Russia.”

But if Mr. Nawrocki wins, he is expected to block Mr. Tusk's reforms, Prof. Siewierska added. 

“Nawrocki is a staunch critic of the European Union, and many of his statements can be perceived as a real risk of Polexit,” she said, referring to Poland possibly leaving the EU. 

Mr. Trzaskowski, 53, has come to epitomize the modern, outward-looking Poland. 

The son of a jazz pianist, he speaks six languages, attended the University of Oxford and earned a doctorate in political science from Warsaw University where he wrote a thesis on “reforming the decision-making system of the European Union.”

He got involved in politics in 1989, when the country held its first free election since the fall of communism. He was a high school student at the time and campaigned for Solidarity, the trade-union movement that opposed Poland's communist leadership for years.

Mr. Trzaskowski served as a Member of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2013, and held a seat in the Polish parliament from 2015. He was elected mayor of Warsaw in 2018 and re-elected last year.

He has been a divisive figure nationally, and critics say his liberal values and support for causes such as LGBTQ rights has put him out of touch with ordinary Poles. 

The fact that Mr. Nawrocki, a political novice with a checkered background, is leading in late polls reflects the deep fractures in the country. Mr. Nawrocki, 42, ran on a platform that focused on Christian values, reducing immigration and fierce opposition to Mr. Tusk.

Despite his background as a soccer hooligan and a series of salacious allegations that he denies – including claims he procured prostitutes for guests while working as a security guard at a resort and swindled an elderly man out of his apartment – Mr. Nawrocki picked up support by tapping into the disgruntlement many Poles have for Mr. Tusk's government and their uncertainty about Mr. Trzaskowski. 

He also proudly sought the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump, who met Mr. Nawrocki in the White House in May. 

Prof. Siewierska said Poland has always had political divisions but that the polarization has become more pronounced in recent years. 

“This polarization is driven by two opposing narratives. One refers to history, tradition, Christianity, to some mythical greatness of Poland,” she said. 

“The second narrative refers more to the future, the concept of a common Europe, a secular state. These are two different stories, two different sets of values, two different emotions.”

She said both PiS and the Civic Coalition have fuelled the division. 

“In this election campaign, it turned out that for a large part of society, the truth no longer matters.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","German court rules turning away asylum-seekers unlawful","https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-rules-turning-away-asylum-seekers-unlawful/a-72763293","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 14:14:15 GMT","

A Berlin court has ruled that turning back asylum seekers at Germany's borders is unlawful without going the EU's Dublin procedure. The ruling challenges a new migration policy, and the government says it will continue. 

The Berlin Administrative Court on Monday ruled that the rejection of asylum-seekers at border controls is unlawful unless carried out under theEU's Dublin procedure.

The urgent decision is a blow to Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has pledged to crack down on migration. Shortly after taking office last month, Chancellor Merz's government advised police that they could turn back irregular migrants at the border, even if they applied for asylum. 

The ruling came in the case of three Somali nationals who were turned back to Poland on May 9 under a new German regulation.

The court said such rejections bypass the necessary legal steps and violate asylum rights.

""Persons who express the wish to seek asylum while at a border check on German territory may not be sent back"" before it is known which country is responsible for processing the claim under the EU's so-called ""Dublin"" system, the court said. 

The three — two men and a woman — had arrived in Germany by train from Poland on May 9.

The Federal Police stopped them at the railway station in Frankfurt an der Oder, in the eastern state of Brandenburg.

The three said they wanted to apply for asylum in Germany. However, they were returned to Poland the same day. The police justified this by arguing that they had entered from a safe third country.

However, the court also ruled that ""the petitioners cannot demand to be allowed into"" Germany, adding that the Dublin asylum procedures ""can be carried out at or close to the border.""

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who is responsable for implementing the migration policy, said Monday evening that the ruling only applied to the case in question, and that the government would stick to its migration policy.

Shortly after taking office last month, Chancellor Merz's government advised police that they could turn back irregular migrants at the border, even if they applied for asylum.

""We will continue with the pushbacks,"" Dobrindt said in a statement, adding that ""we think we have the legal justification for this.""

Dobrindt added that the interior ministry would provide more detailed justifications for the pushbacks, as requested by the court.

The interior minister said that the migrants in question had attempted to cross the border three times, and only on the third attempt, did they invoke the right to asylum. 

A crackdown on irregular migration was a central pledge in Merz's campaign ahead of February's general election.

That vote saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) achieve its best-ever result, winning just over 20% of the vote. Merz has since argued that decisive action on migration is essential to stopping the AfD's rise.

After Monday's ruling, Germany's center-left Green Party, now in opposition, said that the court's decision backed up their stance that Merz's migration policy was bound to fail. 

""This is a severe defeat for the federal government and should serve as a warning to abide by the law in the future and not knowingly exceed its own powers for populist purposes,"" Greens lawmaker Irene Mihalic told the Rheinische Post newspaper.

""The border blockades were a rejection of the European Dublin system and have offended our European neighbors.""

Karl Kopp, managing director of German pro-immigration advocacy group Pro Asyl, told the Rheinische Post that Interior Minister Dobrindt's ""unlawful practice of national unilateral action in asylum policy has failed.""

Last week, Dobrindt said he was hoping for a European Union (EU) agreement on a proposal to send failed asylum-seekers to ""return hubs"" in safe third countries. 

The European Commission has also proposed a scheme to allow member states to reject asylum applications from migrants who have passed through a ""safe"" third country before entering the EU. The proposals have yet to pass in the European Parliament or be adopted by national governments.

The Dublin Regulation is an EU law that determines which EU country is responsible for the application.

However, under the rules, police are not allowed to simply turn asylum seekers back at the border.

Instead, German authorities must initiate a complicated procedure to transfer them back to the country where they first entered the EU.

The first EU country where an asylum seeker enters and where fingerprints are taken is usually responsible for the claim.

The idea is that it ensures that a person doesn't apply for asylum in several EU countries simultaneously.

The system has been criticized for putting too much burden on EU external border countries like Greece and Italy, which are often the first entry points.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Catherine Duleep Singh: The Nazi-defying Indian royal","https://www.dw.com/en/princess-catherine-duleep-singh-the-indian-royal-who-defied-the-nazis/a-72684969","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:18:16 GMT","

Openly living in a same-sex relationship in early 20th-century Germany, she later used her privilege, resources and courage to help Jewish families flee Nazism. 

In the annals of World War II history, few would have expected a British-born Sikh princess from a dethroned royal family to quietly resist Nazi Germany, and live openly with a female partner long before LGBTQ+ rights were acknowledged — let alone accepted.

Yet, that is precisely what Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh did.

The daughter of the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Catherine blazed her own trail and defied social norms. 

The recognition of her legacy is relatively recent. Among those who've brought her acts to the forefront is British biographer Peter Bance, who has spent over two decades researching and writing about the Duleep Singh family, besides piecing together Catherine's extraordinary contributions from scattered records and family documents.

Bance explained to Metro in 2023: ""She didn't do these things for self-promotion, so the stories weren't in books or anything. Her stories have survived through the people she saved. Her intervention at that time have seen families across the world thrive.""

Born in 1871 in Suffolk, England, Catherine was raised far from the land her father once ruled.

At age 10, Maharaja Duleep Singh was forced to surrender the Sikh Empire — and the (in)famous Koh-i-Noor diamond — after the British annexed Punjab. In return, he received a pension from the British Crown on the condition he ""remain obedient to the British Government.""

He later married Bamba Müller, a German-Ethiopian woman, with whom he had six children; Catherine was the fourth. The family lived in exile, but under the patronage of Queen Victoria, who was also Catherine's godmother.

Educated at Somerville College, Oxford, Catherine supported the suffragette cause with her two sisters, campaigning for women's voting rights. But it was her private life — especially her years in Germany — that would come to mark her unconventionality and gumption.

Having lost both her parents during her teens, Catherine had developed a close bond with Lina Schäfer, her German governess. In the early 1900s, Catherine left England and moved with Schäfer to the central German city of Kassel. The villa in which they lived together for more than three decades still stands today. Their relationship, though never formally acknowledged, defied social norms of the time and remained steadfast until Lina's death in 1937.

Catherine initially felt at ease there  — among others, the couple enjoyed annual visits to the Bayreuth Festival — but the 1930s saw Germany degenerating into a police state under Hitler. 

""Being brown-skinned and gay in Germany during the rise of Hitler was dangerous for her,"" according to Peter Bance. ""I remember reading some correspondence between her and her accountant. He urged her to leave the country warning she was going to be targeted. She was being watched by the local Nazis, but she refused to leave.""

As the Nazi regime tightened its grip, Catherine used her resources and influence and helped several Jewish individuals and families escape persecution in Germany and start over in Britain. She wrote letters of recommendation, provided financial support, and personally guaranteed immigration documents that were crucial to survival.

One of the most documented examples involves the Hornstein family. Wilhelm Hornstein, a Jewish lawyer and decorated First World War soldier, was arrested during the November Pogrom of 1938 and imprisoned in a concentration camp. He was later released on condition that he left Germany. Catherine arranged safe passage to England for him, his wife Ilse and their two children.

Catherine hosted them at Colehatch House, her country home in the village of Penn, Buckinghamshire, as well as other Jewish refugees, including a physician named Wilhelm Meyerstein and his partner, Marieluise Wolff, and a violinist named Alexander Polnarioff. She also advocated for those interned as ""enemy aliens"" — a cruel irony for Jews who had fled the Nazis.

""I think she did her part for humanity. There was a lot of atrocities going on at that time which were going under the radar, and some were there blatantly as well, and people were sort of turning a blind eye. And she could have quite easily turned a blind eye and said, it's not my business, but she made it her business,"" Bance tells DW.

In 2002, one outcome of her ""one-woman rescue mission"" resurfaced in a chance encounter.

Bance recalls how, after having published a local article about Catherine, a man named Michael Bowles walked into his office and told him: ""My mother and my uncles and my grandparents were saved by Princess Catherine in Germany. And if it wasn't for her, I would not be alive today.""

Bowles, it turns out, is the grandson of Ursula, one of the Hornstein children saved by Catherine's intervention.

Catherine died in 1942, aged 71. Neither she nor her siblings had any descendants. In her will, she'd requested that part of her ashes be buried at Lina Schäfer's gravesite in Kassel.

Over the decades, the site fell into disrepair and Bance is now working with Kassel's Main Cemetery to formally mark their shared grave. ""I really think it's something Princess Catherine would have liked ... They spent their whole life together. And she loved her so much,"" he explains.

Their bond, though subtle in its time, resonates today. Bance tells DW that while Catherine never hid her relationship ""and her sisters obviously knew about it, but it was very hush hush,"" since in that era ""it was not something they would have sort of flaunted or advertised.""

However, as Catherine's valor gets more media mileage, LGBTQ+ communities have been posthumously embracing her as an icon for having fearlessly loved and lived as she willed. And she has since headlined media coverage during diverse Pride Months, including one by the BBC in 2023.

Bance is now working on a new book set to coincide with a Kensington Palace exhibition titled ""Princesses of Resistance,"" set for March 2026 that will focus on Catherine and her sisters Sophia and Bamba.

""It's a very female-oriented exhibition showing the efforts of these Duleep Singh princesses,"" Bance tells DW, adding that he'll be lending items from his personal archive of nearly 2,000 family artifacts that he's collected over the course of 25 years. 

While details continue to emerge about the Jewish families that Catherine helped, Bance had once described her as an ""Indian Schindler,""  in reference to German industrialist Oskar Schindler (1908–1974), who is credited with saving around 1,200 Jewish lives during the Holocaust.

Acknowledging that Catherine's efforts may not meet the scale of the original Schindler's list, Bance nevertheless tells DW: ""Saving one life or saving 10 lives, it's still 'saving.' You're saving somebody who's not your color, not your religion, not your ethnic background, but you're doing it based on humanity.""

A profile on her alma mater's website sums it up: ""A true LGBTQ+ icon, who put herself at risk for the comfort of her aging lover, and the very essence of the Somerville motto: 'Include the excluded.' Catherine did not just include the excluded: she saved them, campaigned for them, fought for them.""

Witnesses and international relief workers reported shots being fired at people gathered to receive urgent aid in Gaza. At the same time, activists were planning to deliver more aid despite a blockade. DW has the latest.

This blog is now closed. Here is a roundup of the main stories from Israel and the crisis in the Middle East on Sunday, June 1:

The Israeli army's Chief of General Staff Eyal Zamir has ordered an expansion of the Israeli Defense Forces' (IDF) operation in the Gaza Strip.

IDF head Zamir visited troops in one of the enclave's coastal areas while announcing the move, saying Palestinian militant group Hamas ""is losing control"" over the Strip.

""We are in the midst of a powerful and relentless operation,"" Zamir was quoted as saying by the DPA news agency. 

This comes hours after Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the IDF will go ahead with its plans regardless of the negotiations over a potential ceasefire and a hostage deal.
 

The Israeli army said its initial findings suggest it had not shot civilians, neither at the humanitarian aid distribution center nor in close proximity to it, calling the reports saying it did ""false.""

""In the past several hours, false reports have been spread out with severe accusations against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF),"" the statement read.

""The findings of an initial investigation suggest that the IDF did not shoot civilians while they were near or in close proximity to the humanitarian aid distribution center.""

Health officials in Gaza said up to 31 people were killed by an IDF shooting.

Later, the Guardian quoted off the record comments from the IDF admitting that shots were fired ""to prevent several suspects from approaching the troops.""

An international activist coalition is planning to sail to Gazato break Israel's blockade on the enclave.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition departed from Sicily on Sunday, carrying a dozen people, including environmental activist Greta Thunberg. 

The coalition was established in 2010 as a non-violent international movement supporting the Palestinian cause through the combination of humanitarian aid and political protest against Israel's blockade of Gaza.

According to journalist Andrea Legni — who is on board the ""Madleen,"" the small sailboat being used by the group — the vessel is carrying ""fruit juices, milk, rice, tinned food and protein bars donated by hundreds of Catania residents.""

A similar ship carrying aid to Gaza was hit by a drone while on its way to the war-embattled Strip last month.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he had ordered the country's army to go ahead with its plans in the war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza ""regardless of any negotiations.""

""Either Hamas releases the hostages, or it will be destroyed,"" Katz said in a statement.

US envoy Steve Witkoff is still trying to broker a ceasefire deal between the two sides. One of the major stumbling blocks between Israel and Hamas is the latter's demand  to end the war in Gaza entirely, a demand Israel is unwilling to accept. 
 

At least 31 people were killed in an Israeli attack near an aid distribution point, according to authorities in Gaza.

However, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the aid organization backed by Israel and the US which runs the aid distribution points in the enclave, denied the reports, calling them ""untrue and fabricated.""

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Damascus on Saturday.

The two discussed increasing economic cooperation between their two countries after Western sanctions against Syria were recently lifted, in large part.

The US, EU and Britain have all eased sanctions in May that were imposed against former dictator Bashar Assad, a move the Saudi foreign minister said would help in ""reactivating the Syrian economy that had been at a standstill for decades.""

Prince Faisal said Saudi Arabia, as well as Qatar, would provide financial assistance to employees of the public sector. He also brought along a business delegation that would look into cooperating in the sectors of oil, infrastructure, information
technology, telecommunications and agriculture.

""We assert that the kingdom will be a leading state among countries that will stand by Syria in its march for reconstruction and economic revival,"" Prince Faisal said.

Following reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran had increased its production of enriched uranium to over 400 kilograms (around 900 pounds), Iran has said it would retaliate if Germany, France and Britain decided to impose new sanctions.

The report was leaked on Saturday amid talks between the US and Iran to find a deal that seeks to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for a reduction of US sanctions against Iran.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a statement he had urged IAEA chief Rafael Grossi to ensure ""that certain parties do not exploit the agency for political agendas against the Iranian people.""

""Iran will respond to any inappropriate action by the European parties"" to a 2015 deal that aimed to limit Iran's nuclear program. US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal during his first term.

The three European powers have threatened to reimpose sanctions if they consider Iran's nuclear program to be posing a threat.

Witnesses reported on Sunday that Israeli forces fired on Palestinians waiting to receive aid close to a distribution site in Gaza.

At least 21 were killed and scores more injured, according to a Red Cross field hospital and numerous witnesses, cited by The Associated Press.

Hamas said that in total 30 people had been killed and a dozen more injured.

""There was fire from all directions, from naval warships, from tanks and drones,"" The Associated Press cited Amr Abu Teiba, who was in the crowd, as saying. Another eyewitness corroborated the account.

The incident happened on Sunday morning as people gathered to receive food. The population of the Palestinian enclave has been starved by a monthslong Israeli blockade that sparked international outrage, even from some of Israel's closest allies.

The decision by the Israeli government to allow aid into Gaza has also been mired in controversy and chaos. The UN said that the first deliveries of aid had been minimal and even then failed to reach the people in need.



An Israeli and US-backed plan to send in the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has not assuaged concerns. The aim was to avoid aid being diverted to Hamas — something the UN has said there is no evidence for — and as such, the GHF employs private security contractors, similar to mercenaries, to protect the aid distribution sites.

The Foundation on Sunday said it had distributed aid ""without incident,"" and dismissed what it referred to as ""false reporting about deaths, mass injuries and chaos.""

Local health officials have reported that prior to Sunday, six people had been killed and several more wounded by live fire at GHF distribution sites.

UN agencies have refused to work with the GHF, saying it violates humanitarian rules by giving Israel control over who receives aid.

Thank you for joining us as we bring you the latest from Gaza, Israel and the wider Middle East.

Amid repeated and consistent warnings that the population of Gaza is starving as a result of Israel's monthslong blockade, the question of aid distribution and Israel's role in it has become a major story.

The situation in Gaza has sparked unprecedented levels of criticism of Israel's actions, including from Israel's closest allies such as Germany.

There have been increased calls from within the EU to take a tougher stance against Israel's attacks in Gaza and the humanitarian catastrophe there caused by the Israeli blockade. The UN earlier this week called Gaza the ""hungriest place on earth.""

A controversial plan, backed by Israel and the US, to send in a private aid agency — the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation with its private armed security teams — has not dampened the international outrage.

Meanwhile, Hamas said it had responded to a US ceasefire plan. However, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said Hamas' response to the US-led ceasefire proposal was ""totally unacceptable.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, is considered a a terrorist organization by Israel, Germany, US and several other countries.

A man used a makeshift flamethrower to set people on fire in a terror attack at a pro-Israel demonstration in Colorado on Sunday.

The FBI and local police are investigating after at least eight people, aged between 67 and 88, were injured in the attack at the busy Pearl Street Mall area about 1.30pm local time (7.30pm GMT).

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, told reporters that one of the victims is understood to be an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor.

“We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,” FBI director Kash Patel said.

The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was arrested at the scene after using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set demonstrators on fire.

Police officers were seen pinning the suspect to the ground before arresting him. He was taken to hospital.

The FBI said it was investigating the attack as terrorism, while the White House said on Sunday that the suspect was living in the country illegally and was granted a work permit by Joe Biden's administration.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien,” Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said.

“He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden administration, and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden administration gave him a work permit.”

But Steve Redfearn, Boulder's police chief, refused to call the incident a terror attack.

“We are not calling it a terror attack at this point,” Mr Redfearn said. “It is way too early. It would be irresponsible for me to speculate right now on motive and other things.”

Demonstrators with the volunteer group Run For Their Lives, consisting of Jewish community members, had gathered in the mall to call for the release of Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

Mr Redfearn said police were investigating whether the demonstrators were targeted. It was unclear whether they were among the injured victims.

“There was a group of pro-Israel people that were there in a peaceful demonstration, I wouldn't even call it a protest. I believe that [the demonstration] happens frequently down here,” he said.

“We are looking and actively interviewing victims and witnesses to determine whether that group was targeted or others.”

FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said the victims were taken to hospitals, many of whom suffered from burns.

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” he said.

Video of the aftermath of the attack showed Mr Soliman, wearing sunglasses and holding clear spray bottles, pacing as a fire on the grass burned in front of him.

He shouted “end Zionists”, “Palestine is free”, and “they are killers” towards several people as they tended to a person lying on the ground.

At one point, he was confronted by onlookers, including one who said: “He is spraying alcohol... he is making Molotov cocktails.”

Other videos showed victims lying motionless on the ground as bystanders rushed to douse them with water.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old student at the University of Colorado, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs.

She said one woman appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone.

“Everybody [was] yelling, ‘get water, get water',” she said.

Mr Redfearn said officers raced to the scene after receiving reports that people had been set on fire.

“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said.

“When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims who were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”

We're evacuating the 1200, 1300 and 1400 blocks of Pearl Street between Walnut and Pine while we continue to investigate this active incident. PLEASE AVOID THIS AREA pic.twitter.com/8a2wtZjz5h

The popular pedestrian mall is known for attracting tourists and college students.

People were told to evacuate the area due to the “active incident”.

Mr Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable”.

“I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” he wrote on X.

“While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation. More information will be provided as it becomes available.”

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that it was “aware of reports of an attack at today's Boulder Run for Their Lives event”.

The group said the event was a “weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages” who were seized during Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, sparking the war in Gaza.

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in New York, Danny Danon, condemned the attack.

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,” he said in a statement.

“Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing Molotov cocktails at them,” he said.

“Make no mistake – this is not a political protest, this is terrorism.”

The attack comes a week after two Israeli embassy staff were shot dead as they left a reception for diplomats near Washington's Jewish museum.

Elias Rodriguez, 30, was arrested after allegedly shooting Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were soon to be engaged.

He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He was also charged with murder of foreign officials, causing death with a firearm, and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

“The Americans and Israelis set a huge trap for us to lure us here and kill us,” one Palestinian eyewitness said.

On Sunday morning at dawn, Palestinians from southern Gaza headed to the aid distribution point in Rafah run by the Gaza Humanitarian Fund (GHF), the U.S. contractor tasked with delivering aid to Palestinians instead of the UN. Once thousands of aid-seekers arrived at the al-Alam area of Rafah's Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, the Israeli army opened fire on the crowds, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Mondoweiss. 

As throngs of people waited outside the aid site in the early morning hours, waiting for the instructions of the American employees, eyewitnesses described an Israeli quadcopter drone hovering overhead and ordering them via loudspeaker to enter the fenced delivery site at 6:00 a.m.

After hundreds of people had entered, soldiers opened fire on the crowd, killing 31 people and wounding 200 others with live ammunition, Gaza's Ministry of Health said in a statement on Sunday.

 “Every martyr who arrived at the hospital had sustained only one gunshot wound to the head or chest,” the Health Ministry said. “This confirms the occupation's intent to kill civilians.”

Director of Hospitals in Gaza, Muhammad Zaqout, said at a press conference in front of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis that the injured had arrived at the medical compound in animal-drawn carts or were carried on people's shoulders due to the Israeli army's prevention of ambulances from reaching the aid site.

The Israeli army denied that any soldiers had fired at civilians in the center, regarding the allegations as “false reports.” The GHF also denied the reports as “completely false and fabricated,” publishing CCTV footage of aid distribution in Rafah as apparent proof that the day had gone on “without incident.”

Last week, three people were killed at the GHF-run aid distribution point in al-Bureij, north of the Netzarim Axis, and seven others were reported missing in the wake of the chaos last week in the southern GHF site in Rafah. Today, June 2, the Israeli army killed another 3 people at the al-Bureij GHF site.

Ahmed Abu Libdeh, 28, arrived at the aid distribution center in Rafah at 5:00 a.m. from eastern Khan Younis. Instead of receiving food, he witnessed what he described as “one of the most horrific massacres perpetrated by the [Israeli] army” at the Rafah center.

“We were standing outside the distribution point,” Abu Libdeh told Mondoweiss. “At around 6:00 a.m., a quadcopter flew overhead and announced over the loudspeaker that the place was safe and we could enter to get the food.”

“The quadcopter loudspeaker said, ‘walk, you're safe. We'll get the aid out in a little while,'” Abu Libdeh added, stating that after the aid had arrived, “they began bombing and killing us.” 

“As soon as we entered the distribution point and started carrying the aid, the Israeli army opened fire,” he explained. “The scene was horrific. We couldn't see anything because of the dust and the shelling and the heavy gunfire directed at us. Dozens of people were killed. And the airstrikes also killed dozens of people.”

Abu Libdeh noted that the first strike occurred at around 6:15, the first bombing occurred, with a drone bombing a car full of people who had received food and were leaving the area. “After the car was bombed, tanks opened fire on us,” he described.

Ahmad said that the first few minutes were “a shock to everyone,” explaining that they had entered the distribution site according to Israeli army instructions. “We didn't know where the bombing was coming from or from whom. Dust filled the area, and people were running without knowing what was going on. People were falling in the stampede, and I saw dozens lying on the ground, bleeding. They all died because no one could save them.”

“The Americans and Israelis set a huge trap for us to lure us here and kill us by the dozens,” Abu Libdeh concluded. “We don't want America's help. We want to stop the war and stop the hunger.”

The massacre on Sunday has led many Palestinians in Gaza to conclude that the goal of the GHF is not to distribute food to the people but to aid and abet the Israeli army's goal of “exterminating” Palestinians.

Arafat, 49, who preferred not to give his surname, is shown sitting in Nasser Hospital with a small child in his lap in video testimony for Mondoweiss. Both are crying, while Arafat lets out a sigh for his brother, who he says was killed by the Israeli army in Rafah while on his way to secure food for his family.

“Why do they tell us to go get food only to kill us when we get there?” Arafat says. “They are liars. They lie to us and the world. The Americans are conspiring with the Israelis to kill us. They killed my brother because he went to get food for his family.” Arafat explains that the child in his lap is his brother's son.

“They made a place for us to go and be killed in cold blood,” Arafat continued. “They shouldn't say this is a humanitarian area. It's a trap and a massacre of starving people.”

Arafat notes that some people had been queuing near the distribution point since 11 p.m. the night before. “The result is that we're getting death instead of food,” he says. “We don't want America's help. We don't want America's food. If America wants to help us, as it claims, let it stop the war. We don't want anything more from it.”

Right-wing figures around the world celebrated Karol Nawrocki's defeat of Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski.

Far-right candidate Karol Nawrocki emerged Monday as the narrow winner of Poland's presidential election, a contest in which the Trump administration in the U.S. and Hungary's authoritarian leader, Viktor Orbán, weighed in on the side of their ideological compatriot.

Nawrocki's victory over Rafał Trzaskowski, the Warsaw mayor who was representing the party of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, was celebrated by right-wing figures around the world, including Orbán and Jordan Bardella, the head of France's far-right National Rally party.

“The Polish people have spoken and their free and democratic choice must be respected, including by the Brussels leaders who ardently hoped for their defeat,” Bardella wrote on social media following news that Nawrocki, a historian and “former football hooligan” backed by Poland's Law and Justice Party, prevailed in one of the closest elections in the country's history.

Nawrocki's win came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem endorsed him during a speech at a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering in Poland last week.

“[U.S. President] Donald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity to have just as strong of a leader in Karol if you make him the leader of this country,” said Noem. “If you elect a leader who will work with President Trump, the Polish people will have a strong ally. You will continue to have a U.S. military presence here… and you will have equipment that is American-made, high quality.”

In early May, Nawrocki met with Trump in the Oval Office in what was seen as a show of support from the White House ahead of the election.

Franziska Davies, assistant professor of Eastern and Central-Eastern European History at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, wrote that Nawrocki's win is “bad news for Poland, for Europe, for Ukraine, and for democracy.”

As the Financial Times reported, “Nawrocki ran a campaign centred on conservative Catholic values and rhetoric attacking the E.U.'s stance on migration and climate change.”

“The 42-year-old is a political ally of Hungary's premier Viktor Orbán and other Eurosceptic populists, and has suggested that he could seek to alter Poland's strongly pro-Ukraine stance, as one of the NATO alliance's most important Eastern members,” FT added. “While Poland's prime minister holds more political power, the president can block legislation, and nominates senior posts such as the central bank governor.”

Adam Simpson, senior lecturer in International Studies in Justice and Society at the University of South Australia, warned Monday that the ensuing “legislative gridlock could well see Law and Justice return to government in the 2027 general elections, which would lock in the anti-democratic changes the party made during their last term in office from 2015–2023.”

“This included eroding Poland's judicial independence by effectively taking control of judicial appointments and the Supreme Court,” Simpson added. “Nawrocki's win has given pro-Donald Trump, anti-liberal, anti-E.U. forces across the continent a shot in the arm. It's bad news for the E.U., Ukraine, and women.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Live Updates


• Colorado attack: A man used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set people on fire Sunday at a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado, held in support of hostages in Gaza. He injured at least eight people ranging in age from 52 to 88 — including a Holocaust survivor — before being detained.
    


• Suspect identified: The FBI identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman and said he yelled “Free Palestine!” during the attack. He faces both federal hate crime and multiple state felony charges. Soliman is scheduled to appear in a local court this afternoon.
    


• Suspect's history: Soliman had applied for asylum in the US and was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005, sources told CNN. He was in the US illegally, a Homeland Security official said today. The suspect entered the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor and was granted a two-year work authorization in March 2023. That visa expired earlier this year.
    


• Community outcry: Jewish leaders called for action against attacks on their community in the wake of rising antisemitic violence and threats. Less than two weeks ago, two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot dead in Washington, DC, by an attacker who yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested.
    


            Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and acting United States Attorney for the District of Colorado Bishop Grewell will hold a news conference today, according to the Department of Justice.
    


When: 2:30 p.m. local time in Boulder, Colorado (4:30 p.m. ET). It will focus on Sunday's antisemitic attack.
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the attack has been charged with a hate crime, according to an affidavit filed today, in addition to local charges.
    


            The Islamic Center of Boulder condemned the “targeted violence” of Sunday's attack. “Such actions have no place in the Boulder community,” the center said in a statement.
    


                    “Hate and violence oppose our values and are a threat to all Americans,” the statement reads. “We call on our neighbors to focus on supporting the victims of this terrible attack, and to reject those who would use this horrible incident to divide our community.”
                





            The statement also emphasizes the importance of “the First Amendment rights and protections of all people.”
    


            “Every individual and every community has the constitutional right to peaceful assembly and free expression,” the statement says. “These fundamental freedoms must be respected and safeguarded for everyone, regardless of their views or background.”
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in Sunday's attack in Boulder, Colorado, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to an affidavit filed Monday.
    


            He was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin,” reads the affidavit.
    


            President Donald Trump said that the “horrific attack” in Boulder, Colorado will not be tolerated by his administration, in his first comments since yesterday's incident.
    


                    “Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday, nearly a full day after the assault.
                





            The president also said that the incident underscores the need for his administration's crackdown on immigration and said that the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, must “go out under ‘Trump' Policy.”
    


            Soliman was in the US illegally, a Homeland Security official said. He entered the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor and was granted a two-year work authorization in March 2023. That visa expired earlier this year.
    


            “He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under ‘TRUMP' Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” Trump wrote.
    


            Police found 16 additional molotov cocktails in the area where the Boulder attack suspect was spotted, according to multiple law enforcement sources.
    


            The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, arrived in the area of the incident around 1 p.m. local time and lingered there before throwing two incendiary devices, according to multiple law enforcement sources. Soliman was wearing a utility vest over his shirt and was carrying a garden sprayer filled with gasoline, sources said.
    


            Many witnesses said he looked like a gardener, officials added. He used the garden sprayer as the “makeshift flamethrower,” apparently, by spraying gasoline in the direction of the marchers while holding a lighter in front of the stream of fuel, sources said.
    


            Investigators believe Soliman stopped at gas stations in the area before the attack to fill the bottles and the garden sprayer.
    


            Witnesses said that Soliman took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. Soliman was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.
    


            In dispatch audio from the Boulder City Fire Department a person on scene also noted that additional Molotov cocktails were found. “It looks like there is a large box of Molotov cocktails in front of the courthouse,” the official said.

CNN's Sara Smart contributed to this post. 



            The Boulder Police Department have released a mugshot of 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who has been detained and is facing charges related to the attack on members of the Jewish community at an event in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday.
    


            Soliman is expected to appear in court later today.
    


            The weekend attack in Boulder that left at least eight victims injured has left congregants of a local synagogue feeling enraged, vulnerable and sad, Rabbi Fred Greene from Congregation Har HaShem told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


            “My congregants feel wounded,” Greene said. “We have to show up for one another. We have to figure out who's feeling vulnerable and who's feeling angry and respond to them.”
    


            Greene said the weekend's incident is yet another, sad opportunity for the Jewish community to come together and stay resilient, especially on a holy day, Shavuot, which celebrates the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people on Mount Sinai.
    


            “The rhetoric that we hear for months and months is been something of concern for all of us, Greene said. ”Hearing people talk about a globalized, an Intifada, and to think that bringing violence to America's Jewish community is going to help the dignity and save lives of Palestinians is ridiculous and harmful.”
    


            None of the victims in the Boulder attack have died, Boulder Police said in a post on X on Monday.
    


            At least eight people have been reported injured after the attack, ranging in age from 52 to 88.
    


            The suspected attacker was booked into county jail Sunday night on multiple felony charges, including two counts of first-degree murder, though the circumstances around those charges is unclear. CNN has reached out to the District Attorney for more information.
    


            The suspect is expected in court Monday afternoon.
    


            The Jewish community in Boulder is rallying together after an attack that left at least eight people injured, many of whom were older adults, a local leader told CNN.
    


            Elyana Funk, Executive Director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said many of the victims are well known in the community. She talked to a couple of them last night, including one woman who is “healing from horrible burns.”
    


            “She really felt like this happened not just to her, but to the whole community,” Funk said.
    


            A mother and daughter were also injured in the attack, Funk, said.
    


            The mother, “is a Holocaust survivor in her 80's, who's been through certainly enough trauma,” she noted.
    


            In fact, most of those who were injured were older adults, who were walking peacefully, Funk said. The injured range in age from 52 to 88.
    


                    “This wasn't a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who've been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”
                





            The recurring walk is organized in local communities around the globe, and organizers specifically encourage participants not to protest, but rather to keep the gatherings quiet and respectful.
    


            Funk said she's participated in the walk herself, along with her six-year-old son. Now, she says, the walk is on hold, but the community will still find ways to come together.
    


            “The antidote for antisemitism can be Jewish joy, and Jewish community and Jewish connection,” Funk said.
    


            Brian Horowitz was sitting in a cafe having brunch with his family when screams and chaos from an attack at a Jewish community event nearby, interrupted their meal.
    


            Horowitz, who is from Denver, was in the area to show his teenage niece and nephew the University of Colorado campus in hope that they'd enroll there, he told CNN.
    


            Instead, the 37-year-old jumped from the table and ran toward the suspect.
    


            “‘F*** you Zionists. You're killing my people so I kill you,'” Horowitz said he heard the man, now identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman said.
    


            The attacker then singled out people in the plaza saying “'you're a killer, you're a killer,'” Horowitz said.
    


            Horowitz said the attacker then locked eyes with him.
    


            “That's when he looked at me and said you're a killer,” Horowitz, recalled.
    


            Horowitz called 911, he said, and remembers hearing screams from other witnesses, while most of the injured victims were silent.
    


            Not knowing how best to help, he followed the lead of others who grabbed buckets and poured water over people's burns. Horowitz said he found one elderly victim with severe burns to her feet and hands who told him to worry about her friend instead, he said.
    


                    “She was looking at me and saying ‘please help her. Put the water on her,'” Horowitz said. The victim's friend was lying face down on the pavement with severe burns to her calf, the skin barely visible. “She was cool, calm and collected - almost as if she had been there before,” Horowitz said.
                





            Three minutes after Horowitz called emergency services, police arrived and took the suspect into custody, Horowitz said, noting the wait felt like an eternity.
    


                    “It was easily the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my life,” Horowitz said. “There's someone who is outraged enough to go and attack these elderly people who are doing absolutely nothing to provoke it other than walk in silence and meet in a courtyard peacefully. It's unbelievable.”
                


                    Brian Horowitz, witness
                


            Horowitz, who is back in Denver now said after the weekend's incident, he's left to process his own rage and fear.
    


            “I can never in my entire life think of another time where I wish I had a gun on me to try and take this guy out in a safe way for everyone else and myself included rather than rushing this guy and potentially risking my life for that,” Horowitz said. “It's a feeling of helplessness.”
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect charged in the Boulder attack, arrived in the United States in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor, according to multiple law enforcement officials.
    


            He filed a claim a month later, in September, and was granted a work authorization in March, 2023. The authorization expired at the end of March of this year, at which point it appears he remained here illegally, the officials added.
    


More on the incident: After committing the attack, the suspect told police “I did it to avenge my people,” one of the law enforcement officials said.
    


            Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the most senior Jewish member of the House, said that the Boulder, Colorado flamethrower attack was clearly antisemitic.
    


            “Well, it was obviously an antisemitic attack and a latest in a series of antisemitic attacks,” Nadler told CNN. He went on to list the recent shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC and the arson of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's home.
    


            Nadler added that he would like to see an increase in funding for the protection of religious institutions so people can feel more safe.
    


                    “The Jewish community is very on edge and we want the federal government to do more and we'd like to see an increase in the budget for the protection, for the protection of provisions of the law because when someone talks about Israel and attacks Jewish institutions, Jewish people, that's clearly antisemitism,” Nadler said. “The protective law that provides protection for schools and churches and mosques and synagogues. That should be increased because we need more security at all these places of worship and congregation,” he added.
                





            Calls for multiple ambulances, helicopters and for all units to respond can be heard in dispatch audio during the attack in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday.
    


                    “1325 Pearl Street, the courthouse, reports that there is a male with a blow torch setting people on fire,” one official with the Boulder City Police can be heard saying in dispatch audio Broadcastify.
                





                    “There's multiple mixed reports about if people are on fire or not, we're getting lots of 911 calls,” they added.
                





            As the incident continued to unfold, all units were advised to assist with the situation and calls for multiple ambulances and helicopters were made.
    


                    “There was someone who threw two Molotov cocktails, we have multiple injuries, we're sending multiple ambulances,” one official says.
                





                    “What's the nature?” one Boulder City Fire official asks. “Multiple burns, potential terror attack,” another official responds.
                





            Authorities have named Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the accused perpetrator of an attack on a Jewish community gathering in Boulder, Colorado.
    


            Witnesses say the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails into the crowd during a weekly gathering in support of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, law enforcement authorities said. Eight people were injured, ranging from 52 to 88 years old.
    


Here's what to know this morning:



            The suspect charged in the Boulder attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was in the US illegally, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said Monday.
    


            “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin wrote on X.
    


            Soliman was booked in county jail just before midnight, where records show he is charged with multiple felonies. He is expected in court Monday afternoon.
    


            Run for Their Lives is a global run – or walk – event organized by members of the Jewish community to bring attention to the 58 hostages who remain held in Gaza. Of those hostages, 20 are still believed to be alive according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            The Jewish community in Boulder had gathered on Sunday to take part in the activity before Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set people on fire. The FBI said he acted alone and yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.
    


            Attacks on the Jewish community in the US have increased since October 7, 2023. Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested in Washington, DC, on May 21, authorities said.
    


            One of the victims of Sunday's attack on a group of Jewish community members in Colorado is a holocaust survivor, an individual who was at the march and knows the victim told CNN on Sunday.
    


            Eight people attending the event to support hostages in Gaza, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were injured when a suspect used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set them on fire, according to the FBI. One victim was “very seriously injured,” according to Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn.
    


            A friend of the Holocaust survivor, Chany Scheiner, described her as “an amazing person” when talking to CNN affiliate KUSA.
    


                    “She has spoken at our synagogues as well as other synagogues and schools just about her background and the Holocaust and from her own perspective. She is passionate about standing up for good things and she is an extremely exceptional person. Always a smile on her face. Her life wasn't easy, but she is just a bright light. And anybody who is her friend is a friend for life.”
                





            Scheiner is married to a rabbi at the Boulder County Center for Judaism, KUSA reported.
    


            “Boulder is a beautiful place,” she said. “People are friendly, they're kind, and this was out of left field. This is not something that we ever dreamed would be in our neighborhood or in our backyard. And it's horrific. And we can't wrap our head around it because this is not Boulder.”
    


            People rushed to help in the moments following the Boulder attack, dousing burn victims with water while the suspect was still on a lawn nearby, according to several videos verified by CNN and witness accounts.
    


            In one video, a severely injured woman is seen lying on the ground as bystanders pour water on her. The camera then pans toward the suspect, seen shouting at bystanders while holding bottles of liquid in his hands.
    


            The owner of a local clothing store, Heady Bauer, who did not want to be named, told CNN he and an employee saw big flames out front. As they heard people screaming and shouting, they ran to the scene.
    


                    “There were people on the ground and a bunch of others running over with buckets and bottles and whatever they could carry water in” the store owner told CNN. “Everyone was dumping water on the burned people, especially one woman on the ground who was totally torched from her hair to her legs.”
                





            The store owner described the attacker as “pretty calm, pacing around with the spray bottles that were filled with some sort of flammable liquid.”
    


                    “He would spray the liquid and spread the fire. It was pretty intense, honestly.”
                





            Another witness who arrived on the scene as police were apprehending the suspect described the scene as “big, controlled chaos.”
    


            “All of a sudden all we saw was police cars, a ton of police cars arriving, and then fire trucks and ambulances,” said Ivan. A, who declined to give his full last name.
    


            At the scene of the attack, he saw two injured women being treated by paramedics. One woman had a visible burn mark on her body, he told CNN. “A lot of us did not really comprehend the seriousness of the situation,” Ivan said.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned an attack on a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado and said he prays for the “full recovery of the wounded in the vicious terror attack.”
    


            On Sunday, a man used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack an event in support of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the FBI. The suspect yelled “Free Palestine!” during the attack, the FBI said.
    


            At least eight people were injured, Boulder police said. The attack came on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
    


                    “This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said Monday morning.
                





            Netanyahu said he believes the US will “prosecute the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the man authorities have accused of carrying out Sunday's attack on a Jewish community gathering in Boulder, Colorado, was booked in the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to online jail records.
    


            Among the charges is one count of explosives or incendiary devices used during a felony.
    


            Witnesses say the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails into the crowd during a weekly gathering in support of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to law enforcement authorities.
    


            Online records also show Soliman, 45, was booked on two counts of murder in the 1st degree, but the circumstances around those charges are unclear, as authorities have not announced any deaths resulting from the attack.
    


            Soliman also faces two counts of first-degree assault and crimes against at-risk adults or elderly people, the records show. The victims of the attack are between the ages of 52 and 88.
    


            CNN reached out to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office for comment.
    


            Eight people were injured Sunday, including two who were airlifted to Denver-area hospitals, authorities said previously.
    


            Soliman has a court date scheduled for Monday at 1:30 p.m. local time, according to the online jail records, which show he is being held on a bond of $10 million.

            President Donald Trump is using his love of tariffs to threaten high-profile American companies.
    


            Over the past month, Trump has said he'd like to target two specific and very different companies — Apple and Mattel — with tariffs aimed at their key products over comments by their CEOs.
    


            Company-specific tariff threats will likely face legal problems, especially after a decision late Wednesday by the US Court of International Trade questioned the president's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs without action by Congress — a decision that was put on hold by a Court of Appeals decision on Thursday.
    


            But Trump does have levers to pull, and it's clear he sees the threat of tariffs as a way to get companies to comply with his demands.
    


            Even without this week's court decision, Trump would have had problems putting in place tariffs that target a specific company, said Lizbeth Levinson, a trade attorney at the law firm Fox Rothschild.

            “He doesn't have the constitutional power to name names. It has to be a whole class of products, equally against everyone in industry,” she said. “But Trump's modus operandi has always been to take the action and worry about reality later.”
    


            Earlier this year, Trump was praising Apple CEO Tim Cook when the company announced plans for $500 billion in US investments. But when Cook later announced he intends to shift production of iPhones bound for the US market from China to India, he clearly angered Trump, who has promised — without much evidence — that his tariffs would lead companies to bring production to US plants from overseas factories.
    


            “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump posted on Truth Social late last month. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”
    


            Trump later that day clarified that the tariffs would be on all imported smartphones, including those by Apple rivals like Korea's Samsung, noting, “Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair.”
    


            Smartphones are currently exempt from most of Trump's tariffs on imports from China. But one of the tools his administration could use to target imported smartphones is a Section 232 investigation, according to a research note by Morgan Stanley.
    


            Section 232 of trade law, which gives the president the power to impose duties on imports in response to national security threats, is the justification used for the levies on autos, auto parts, steel and aluminum imports. And the administration has already said it is conducting a 232 investigation into products with computer chips.
    


            But trade experts say the point of the threat is not to impose a new 25% tariffs on smartphones, which would raise costs for the companies and ultimately consumers. It's to get the companies to give Trump something else that he wants, like the promise of future US investment or agreeing not to publicly attribute price hikes to tariffs.
    


            “The president is obviously pretty upset with Apple and Tim Cook,” said Clark Packard, research fellow at the Cato Institute in an interview with CNN. “(But) I don't envision a specific action against Apple. The American public would be outraged if their iPhones… became substantially more expensive, right? So he risks hurting a lot of everyday American who are also voters.”
    


            Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Such 232 tariffs on smartphones might be possible but they would take time, according to Packard. Mattel doesn't have the same worry — it would be hard to make the case Barbie is a national security threat.
    


            “Courts are going to be fairly deferential on claims of national security by the executive branch,” said Packard. “You're probably on a little firmer territory there (with smartphones) than you would be on Mattel.”
    


            Earlier this month, Trump threatened Mattel with a 100% tariff on all its toy imports after Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said the company would have to consider raising some toy prices due to tariffs and that it wouldn't shift toy production to the United States, as that would be more expensive than paying the tariffs.
    


            “We'll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won't sell one toy in the United States, and that's their biggest market.” Trump added: “I wouldn't want to have him as an executive too long.”
    


            Unlike Trump's smartphone tariff threat, he hasn't clarified whether he is considering a 100% tariff on all toys rather than just on Mattel. But Trump has not followed through on his Mattel threat since he made the original statement. Neither the White House nor Mattel responded this week when asked for comment.
    


            But imposing prohibitive tariffs isn't actually the point, Levinson said. Similar to Apple, she said Trump is more interested in getting Mattel to blink, agreeing to something he can claim as a victory, like announcing plans for domestic sourcing of at least a fraction of its toys. The same is true for the high tariffs Trump announced against countries around the globe, Levinson said.
    


            “I had a lot of clients who panicked and called me up and said what are we supposed to do about this?” she said. “The fact is, it was never going to go into effect.”

Witnesses recounted the dramatic scenes after eight people, calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd.

The FBI says the suspect in an attack in Boulder, Colorado that injured six yelled “Free Palestine” and used a makeshift flamethrower.

Several people were injured and some may have been set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said. Police said a man was taken into custody in an attack that the FBI immediately described as an act of terror. Boulder police said there were “several victims” in the attack.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — A man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a group in Boulder, Colorado, that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to court documents filed Monday.

The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group,” the FBI said. Eight people were injured in the attack, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the Justice Department on Monday.

Court records show Soliman was scheduled to appear in state court in Boulder at 1:30 p.m.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder.

In New York, the police department said it upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He's right there. He's throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then “two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Law enforcement found more than a dozen unlit Molotov cocktails near where Soliman was arrested. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. Inside his car, law enforcement found papers with the words “Israel,” “Palestine,” and “USAID,” the affidavit says.

Soliman told investigators that he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients. He drove to Boulder with the devices in his car and stopped along the way for gas, according to the affidavit.

He said in his interview that his goal was to “kill all Zionists,” the FBI said, and that he intentionally targeted the group and knew they they would be assembled on Sunday afternoon.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

The group that was attacked has said it was trying to raise attention to the plight of the Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Authorities said Sunday they believe Soliman acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

State and federal authorities planned to hold a news conference Monday afternoon.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after having entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Public records listed Soliman as living in a modest rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene Sunday.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who'd play with Pruiett's kids in front of their building, share food and hellos. But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him.

“There had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,” said Pruiett, leaning on her doorframe and gazing several feet away at Soliman's apartment. Soliman had never been outwardly political, she said, “he didn't push his views or values on anyone.”

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman's home to come out. Nobody came out, and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett. The raid lasted several hours, she said.

An online resume under Soliman's name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.”

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — As the nation's top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s stark comments about children with autism have splintered a community of millions of people who are living with the disorder.

Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.

Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and 2-year-old sister Billie.

At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items.

Lamb said it's unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date — as Kennedy said last month when describing autism — but she also doesn't only view her child's limitations.

“I see where he was going with his comments,” said Lamb, who is also the director of social media at the national organization Autism Speaks. “But I also think that's not how you measure the value of our children's lives. The language we use matters.”

Exit polls in Poland's presidential runoff on Sunday showed the two candidates in a statistical tie with the race still too close to call in the deeply divided nation. The results could set the course for the nation's political future and its relations with the European Union. Though the final result was still unclear with the two locked in a near dead heat, both men claimed to have won in meetings with their supporters in Warsaw.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and staunch nationalist, as its next president in a closely watched vote that signals a resurgence of right-wing populism in the heart of Europe. 

Nawrocki, who is set to take office on Aug. 6, is expected to shape the country's domestic and foreign policy in ways that could strain ties with Brussels while aligning the Central European nation of nearly 38 million people more closely with the administration of President Donald Trump in the United States.

Here are some key takeaways:

Nawrocki's victory underscores the enduring appeal of nationalist rhetoric among about half of the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, and its deep social divisions. 

The 42-year-old historian who had no previous political experience built his campaign on patriotic themes, traditional Catholic values, and a vow to defend Poland's sovereignty against the EU and larger European nations like Germany.

His win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right — even the far right in recent times.

Far-right candidates did very well in Poland's first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.




As his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms. 

“Poland remains a deeply divided country,” said Jacek Kucharczyk, the president of the Polish Institute of Public Affairs. 

“Although the electoral turnout was highest ever in history of presidential elections, Mr. Nawrocki's margin of victory is very small, which means that half of Poland will be cheering his presidency, whereas half of Poland, the other half, remains deeply worried or even disturbed,” he added.

Nawrocki's presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.

But Tusk's coalition — a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives — has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law. 

Nawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk's agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.

Nawrocki's election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.

Poland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.

Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.

While Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid — particularly support for refugees. 

His rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland's assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki's approach could shift Poland's posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.

The election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk's return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement. 

“This is very bad news for the European Union as well as Poland's key European partners, both Germany and France as well as Ukraine,” said Kucharczyk, the analyst. 

“Mr. Nawrocki is well known for his Eurosceptic stand. He's opposed to deepening European integration and European cooperation. He is also opposed to Ukraine's NATO membership,” he added.

Nawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland's national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy. 

While the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki's symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels' efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.

Though an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions. 

Billions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk's government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China criticized the U.S. on Monday over moves it alleged harmed Chinese interests, including issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and planning to revoke Chinese student visas. 

“These practices seriously violate the consensus,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, referring to a China-U.S. joint statement in which the United States and China agreed to slash their massive recent tariffs, restarting stalled trade between the world's two biggest economies.

But last month's de-escalation in President Donald Trump's trade wars did nothing to resolve underlying differences between Beijing and Washington and Monday's statement showed how easily such agreements can lead to further turbulence. 

The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Trump imposed last month to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.

The Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and non-tariff measures taken against the U.S. “reciprocal tariffs” following the agreement.

“The United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and trade relations,” while China has stood by its commitments, the statement said. 




It also threatened unspecified retaliation, saying China will “continue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”

Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States.

Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and “hopefully we'll work that out,” while still insisting China had violated the agreement.

“The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” Trump posted. “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”

In response to recent comments by Trump, the Commerce Ministry said of the U.S.: “Instead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts.” 

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the Chinese were “just slow rolling the deal” from Geneva. 

Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Lutnick said the U.S. was “taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation,” adding that Trump would “work it out” with Xi.

The Trump administration also stepped up the clash with China in other ways last week, announcing that it would start revoking visas for Chinese students studying in the U.S.

U.S. campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.

Both countries are in a race to develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, with Washington seeking to curb China's access to the most advanced computer chips. China is also seeking to displace the U.S. as the leading power in the Asia-Pacific, including through gaining control over close U.S. partner and leading tech giant Taiwan.

PARIS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe's security map.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.

In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron — who they say is “100% aligned” with them on the war — the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing. 

A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West's last chance to choke off the Kremlin's war economy, they said — adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports US Senators warn Russia, as it continues it's war with Ukraine.

“What I learned on this trip was he's preparing for more war,” Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation “bone-crushing” and said it would place Russia's economy “on a trade island.”

“It is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,” he said. 

At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports — targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.




Graham called it “the most draconian bill I've ever seen in my life in the Senate.”

 “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,” he said. “We're going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.”

With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach — blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they're crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it's too late.

Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal — a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.

“Putin is playing President Trump,” Blumenthal said. “He's taking him for a sucker.” The senator said Putin “is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.”

Graham added: “We saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He's preparing for more war.”

Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: “I don't know. I'll have to see it.” Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump's advisers.

Graham backed the president's diplomatic instincts but said, “By trying to engage Putin — by being friendly and enticing — it's become painfully clear he's not interested in ending this war.”

Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate — and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office— may help shift the conversation.

“He needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,” he said of Putin.

In Kyiv, the senators said, the war's human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia — calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.

Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. “Putin is a thug. He's a murderer.”

Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.

After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.

“This visit has been a breakthrough moment because President Macron has shown moral clarity in his conversations with us,” Blumenthal said. “Today, he is 100% aligned with that message that we are taking back to Washington.”

Blumenthal pointed to the rare bipartisan unity behind the sanctions bill. “There are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,” he said. “The cause of Ukraine is doing it.”

Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow.

“President Trump said we'll know in two weeks whether he's being strung along,” Graham said. “There will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.

“All of this rhetoric about cutting trillions of dollars of spending has come to nothing — and the tax bill codifies that,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. “There is a level of concern about the competence of Congress and this administration and that makes adding a whole bunch of money to the deficit riskier.”

The White House has viciously lashed out at anyone who has voiced concern about the debt snowballing under Trump, even though it did exactly that in his first term after his 2017 tax cuts.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened her briefing Thursday by saying she wanted “to debunk some false claims” about his tax cuts. 

Leavitt said the “blatantly wrong claim that the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson piled onto Congress' number crunchers on Sunday, telling NBC's “Meet the Press,” “The CBO sometimes gets projections correct, but they're always off, every single time, when they project economic growth. They always underestimate the growth that will be brought about by tax cuts and reduction in regulations.” 




But Trump himself has suggested that the lack of sufficient spending cuts to offset his tax reductions came out of the need to hold the Republican congressional coalition together.

“We have to get a lot of votes,” Trump said last week. “We can't be cutting.”

That has left the administration betting on the hope that economic growth can do the trick, a belief that few outside of Trump's orbit think is viable. 

Most economists consider the non-partisan CBO to be the foundational standard for assessing policies, though it does not produce cost estimates for actions taken by the executive branch such as Trump's unilateral tariffs.

Tech billionaire Musk, who was until recently part of Trump's inner sanctum as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, told CBS News: “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.”

The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add more than $5 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if all of them are allowed to continue, according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.

To make the bill's price tag appear lower, various parts of the legislation are set to expire. This same tactic was used with Trump's 2017 tax cuts and it set up this year's dilemma, in which many of the tax cuts in that earlier package will sunset next year unless Congress renews them.

But the debt is a much bigger problem now than it was eight years ago. Investors are demanding the government pay a higher premium to keep borrowing as the total debt has crossed $36.1 trillion. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury Note is around 4.5%, up dramatically from the roughly 2.5% rate being charged when the 2017 tax cuts became law.

The White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that its policies will unleash so much rapid growth that the annual budget deficits will shrink in size relative to the overall economy, putting the U.S. government on a fiscally sustainable path.

The council argues the economy would expand over the next four years at an annual average of about 3.2%, instead of the Congressional Budget Office's expected 1.9%, and as many as 7.4 million jobs would be created or saved.

Council chair Stephen Miran told reporters that when the growth being forecast by the White House is coupled with expected revenues from tariffs, the expected budget deficits will fall. The tax cuts will increase the supply of money for investment, the supply of workers and the supply of domestically produced goods — all of which, by Miran's logic, would cause faster growth without creating new inflationary pressures.

“I do want to assure everyone that the deficit is a very significant concern for this administration,” Miran said.

White House budget director Russell Vought told reporters the idea that the bill is “in any way harmful to debt and deficits is fundamentally untrue.”

Most outside economists expect additional debt would keep interest rates higher and slow overall economic growth as the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, businesses and even college educations would increase.

“This just adds to the problem future policymakers are going to face,” said Brendan Duke, a former Biden administration aide now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Duke said that with the tax cuts in the bill set to expire in 2028, lawmakers would be “dealing with Social Security, Medicare and expiring tax cuts at the same time.”

Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the growth projections from Trump's economic team are “a work of fiction.” He said the bill would lead some workers to choose to work fewer hours in order to qualify for Medicaid.

“I don't know of any serious forecaster that has meaningfully raised their growth forecast because of this legislation,” said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the Council of Economic Advisers chair under the Obama administration. “These are mostly not growth- and competitiveness-oriented tax cuts. And, in fact, the higher long-term interest rates will go the other way and hurt growth.”

The White House's inability so far to calm deficit concerns is stirring up political blowback for Trump as the tax and spending cuts approved by the House now move to the Senate. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky have both expressed concerns about the likely deficit increases, with Paul saying Sunday there are enough GOP senators to stall the bill until deficits are addressed.

“I think there are four of us at this point” who would oppose the legislation “if the bill, at least, is not modified in a good direction,” Paul said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”

“The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this,” Paul said. 

Four Republican holdouts would be enough to halt the bill in the Senate, where the party holds a three-seat majority. 

The White House is also banking that tariff revenues will help cover the additional deficits, even though recent court rulings cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump declaring an economic emergency to impose sweeping taxes on imports.

When Trump announced his near-universal tariffs in April, he specifically said his policies would generate enough new revenues to start paying down the national debt. His comments dovetailed with remarks by aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, that yearly budget deficits could be more than halved.

“It's our turn to prosper and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly,” Trump said two months ago as he talked up his import taxes and encouraged lawmakers to pass the separate tax and spending cuts.

The Trump administration is correct that growth can help reduce deficit pressures, but it's not enough on its own to accomplish the task, according to new research by economists Douglas Elmendorf, Glenn Hubbard and Zachary Liscow.

Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said additional “growth doesn't even get us close to where we need to be.” 

The government would need $10 trillion of deficit reduction over the next 10 years just to stabilize the debt, Tedeschi said. And even though the White House says the tax cuts would add to growth, most of the cost goes to preserve existing tax breaks, so that's unlikely to boost the economy meaningfully.

“It's treading water,” Tedeschi said.

Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst explains the impact of the drone strike on Russian air bases.

Russian and Ukrainian delegations have begun talks in Istanbul, Turkey, on Monday, less than 24 hours after a massive Ukrainian drone attack struck Russian airfields.

The two delegations entered Ciragan Palace in Istanbul alongside a group of senior Turkish officials. It is the second round of peace talks to take place in the three years since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Images from the event show many of the Ukrainian delegation wearing military uniforms, while the Russian group exclusively wore suits. 

Details of the meeting are not expected to be made public until after its conclusion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be meeting face-to-face, however.

Ukrainian forces destroyed 40 aircraft in the drone attack this weekend, which an official says took more than a year to orchestrate. Russia's defense ministry confirmed the attack on Sunday, saying it struck five airfields.

The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones reportedly hit 41 planes stationed at several airfields on Sunday afternoon, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M aircraft, the official said.

Moscow has previously used Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-22 long-range bombers to launch missiles at Ukraine, while A-50s are used to coordinate targets and detect air defenses and guided missiles.

A series of explosions also struck bridges in Russia near Ukraine's border on Saturday, though Ukraine has not taken responsibility for the attacks.

Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs reacts after a Colorado terror suspect involved in an attack at a pro-Israel event was taken into police custody. 

Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing hate crime, murder, assault and other charges following what the FBI called a ""targeted terror attack"" in Boulder, Colorado, over the weekend. 

The violence Sunday against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages left eight people, ages 52 to 88, with injuries, including one in critical condition, according to the FBI. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with a weapon setting people on fire. 

Soliman has now been charged with a Hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin. At the state level, Soliman was charged with murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent; murder in the first degree – extreme indifference; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; 1st degree assault – non-family; 1st degree assault – heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

Soliman was also in the United States illegally, Fox News has learned. 

Boulder Police Department confirmed Monday that no victim has died. Soliman was booked into the Boulder County Jail on Sunday evening and remains held on a $10 million bond. 

SUSPECT IN BOULDER TERROR ATTACK DETERMINED TO BE EGYPTIAN MAN IN US ILLEGALLY: FBI 

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing multiple charges following the incident in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday, June 1. 

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" FBI director Kash Patel said. ""Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available."" 

Soliman, 45, was arrested and taken to the hospital with minor injuries after his alleged attack on the ""Run for Their Lives"" group that was gathering on Pearl Street, police said Sunday night. 

The group is a grassroots organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. This particular chapter of the group meets on a weekly basis, police said. 

US POLITICIANS, JEWISH GROUPS CONDEMN ‘HORRIFYING' BOULDER TERROR ATTACK 

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is seen being taken into custody on Sunday, June 1. 

Soliman was allegedly yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, which was near the county courthouse on Pearl Street. 

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of ""ideologically motivated violence,"" based on early information, evidence and witness accounts.

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa. 

He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin joins ICE in Boston as they arrest criminal migrants, including an alleged murderer and child rapists. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reacts to push back to the Trump admin's deportation agenda.

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey took to social media Sunday evening to demand answers after ICE agents arrested a high school student heading to volleyball practice over the weekend.

The student, 18-year-old Marcelo Gomes, is a junior at Milford High School in Milford, Massachusetts. 

In her post, Healey says she is ""disturbed and outraged"" and that she wants answers immediately explaining why the student was taken into immigration enforcement's custody.

""I'm demanding that ICE provide immediate information about why he was arrested, where he is and how his due process is being protected,"" she s.

In the post she blames the Trump admin for what she describes as an attempt to create fear.

""The Trump Administration continues to create fear in our communities, and it's making us all less safe,"" her post states.

In her statement, Healey claims that the student was detained on Saturday without any warning or subsequent explanation provided to state officials.

""Yet again, local officials and law enforcement have been left in the dark with no heads up and no answers to their questions,"" she said.

The community gathered to protest outside of Milford on Sunday. Hundreds demanded Gomes be set free and that ICE stop harassing members of their community.

U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat who represents Milford in Congress, attended the protest and made note on X that Gomes was ""enrolled in honors classes, a coaching assistant for girls volleyball [and] player for boys volleyball, and a member of the school band."" 

""This administration has its public safety priorities backwards. It pardons cop-beaters from Jan. 6 but detains high-school volleyball players. It makes gun-purchaser background checks harder while pushing for tax breaks to buy silencers for pistols. This reckless behavior does not make the residents of Milford safer, and I stand with the community in support of law [and] order,"" he wrote.

Milford School District Superintendent Kevin McIntyre says that Gomes' detention is one of many apprehensions to take place in the southern Massachusetts community.

McIntyre says the district cannot take any role in immigration enforcement, but they will ""support all of our students and families, including those who are immigrants to the United States.""

""They are members of the community, students in our classrooms, athletes that compete representing Milford, musicians, artists, friends, and neighbors. We will do everything in our power to support our students and families during these difficult times,"" he said in his statement.

Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli-American Council, spoke with Fox News Digital about the terror attack on Sunday in Boulder, Colorado.

U.S. lawmakers, Trump administration officials and Jewish groups were among those who condemned the terror attack that left eight people injured in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday, calling it a ""monstrous attack"" and an ""act of vile antisemitism.""

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene, after he allegedly set victims on fire as they peacefully rallied on behalf of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman was heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" and other criticisms of Israel during the attack.

Soliman, an Egyptian national, entered the U.S. in 2022 with authorization but has since overstayed his visa, according to authorities. Local and federal law enforcement continue to investigate the attack.

""My thoughts and prayers go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community,"" Colorado Democrat Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, said in a statement. ""Boulder is strong. We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" he continued. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

The governor said he is working closely with local and federal law enforcement following Sunday's attack. Colorado Democrat Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is also Jewish, said the attack appears to have been motivated by hate.

Colorado's Democrat Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper both slammed the attack as a display of hate against the Jewish community.

""My thoughts are with the victims of the horrifying terror attack that occurred this afternoon in Boulder,"" Bennet said. ""Hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado.""

""Hate of any kind has no home in Colorado,"" Hickenlooper wrote. ""We're monitoring the reports of a horrific terror attack in Boulder this afternoon. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is Jewish, described the attack as a ""vile, antisemitic act of terror"" and stressed that antisemitism ""has no place in America.""

""Less than two weeks after the horrific antisemitic attack at the Capitol Jewish Museum in DC — and after two relentless years of surging antisemitic attacks across the country— the Jewish community is once again shattered by pain and heartbreak,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror. Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.""

SHOOTING AT CAPITAL JEWISH MUSEUM HIGHLIGHTS RISING WAVE OF ANTI-JEWISH HATE CRIMES

""When antisemitism is allowed to fester, when it spreads unchecked, and when too many look the other way, history has shown us where it leads: to hatred, to violence, to terror,"" he continued. ""Tonight is Shavuot—a sacred holiday of learning, renewal, and unity. Thousands of Jews around the world will wake up to this horrific news, just as they did after October 7. For many, it's been over 600 days of unrelenting fear and trauma.""

Schumer added: ""Antisemitism, plain and simple, has no place in America. I am praying for the victims' recovery and am in touch with the FBI as we closely monitor the situation.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said this ""violent, antisemitic attack is heartbreaking and deeply disturbing"" and that he is praying for the victims and for law enforcement ""to deliver swift justice.""

""Terrorist sympathizers have made it clear they will do anything to try and silence the Jewish people and those who support Israel,"" Johnson wrote. ""We CANNOT and WILL NOT let them win.""

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the Jewish community in America has once again become the target of a horrific, antisemitic attack.""

""As residents of Boulder gathered on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot to raise awareness for the hostages still being held captive in Gaza, the peacefulness of their assembly was shattered,"" he said. ""Our heartfelt prayers are with all of our Jewish brothers and sisters impacted by this unconscionable act of terror, and we thank law enforcement for their swift response. Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed. We stand with the Jewish community today and always.""

""Another act of horrific, vile antisemitism and terrorism in our country, as an individual violently attacked a peaceful crowd in Boulder, Colorado, gathered to call for the release of the hostages still held in Gaza since Hamas' terror attacks on October 7, 2023,"" the Democratic mayor said. ""While we see no nexus to NYC at this time, the NYPD is increasing resources at religious sites throughout our city ahead of the sacred holiday of Shavuot out of an abundance of caution. We will not rest until we root out this unacceptable violence and rhetoric from our communities.""

Several Trump administration officials condemned the attack and gave updates on the federal investigations.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" FBI director Kash Patel said. ""Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.""

""DHS is monitoring the terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said. ""We are working with our interagency partners, including the FBI, and will share more information as soon as it becomes available. We are praying for the victims and their families. This violence must stop.""

Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security advisor, said he is praying ""for the victims of the evil and monstrous attack in Boulder, Colorado.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also offered prayers for the victims as they recover from the attack.

""My wife and I and the entire state of Israel pray for the full recovery of the wounded in the vicious terror attack that took place in Boulder, Colorado,"" he said.

""This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,"" the prime minister continued. ""I trust the United States authorities to prosecuting the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law and doing everything possible to prevent future attacks against innocent civilians. The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped.""

Various Jewish groups also sounded off after the attack in Colorado on Sunday, with Israeli-American Council CEO Elan Carr saying it was a ""horrific attack on peaceful demonstrators who were walking in a march to commemorate and demand the release of hostages.""

""I'm not suggesting the answer is censorship, but we have to understand that hateful words that demonize Jews prompt people to take violent action and commit murder,"" Carr told Fox News Digital. ""We've seen this over and over and over again, and it happened today, and it happened a few days ago, and if we don't stop this, it's going to happen again. This is an absolute outrage that we have people who are being poisoned by vicious ideology.""

The American Jewish Committee said the incident represented ""another vile attack against Jews in America.""

""Less than two weeks after the horrific murders in D.C., an attacker in Colorado firebombed a group calling for the release of the 58 Israeli hostages who have been held by terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,"" the group said in a statement. ""This hatred is a dangerous poison, and we need everyone to stand up with us against it. Enough is enough.""

The Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Boulder, Colorado terror attack suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45.

The suspect accused in a ""targeted terror attack"" in Boulder, Colorado, where a pro-Israel group was advocating for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages, was in the United States illegally, Fox News has learned.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested and taken to the hospital with minor injuries after his alleged attack on the ""Run for Their Lives"" group that was gathering on Pearl Street, police said Sunday night. 

The group is a grassroots organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. This particular chapter of the group meets on a weekly basis, police said.

Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa after entering the U.S. during the Biden administration, three Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sources told Fox News.

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa. 

He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 

On March 29, 2023, Soliman was granted work authorization, which was valid through March of this year.

""A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien,"" White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on X. ""He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed.""

Soliman was allegedly yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, which was near the county courthouse on Pearl Street. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with weapon setting people on fire.

The FBI said eight people, ages 52 to 88, were injured and taken to the hospital. One of those victims is considered to be in critical condition.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of ""ideologically motivated violence,"" based on early information, evidence and witness accounts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act would erode Obamacare","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/3424697/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-obamacare-changes/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed by the House last month, would advance one of the long-term goals of the Republican Party: to diminish the number of enrollments in Obamacare.

The numbers are not finalized, but experts estimate that between 8 million and 15 million people may lose health insurance coverage through significant alterations the legislation makes to marketplace exchange plans and the Medicaid expansion included in Obamacare.

President Donald Trump pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare in his 2016 presidential campaign and attempted to follow through on that promise early in his tenure. The repeal effort failed, but now, his “big, beautiful bill” would make changes to Obamacare that would have far-reaching effects for the program.

Although Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) maintain that the legislation is not a healthcare bill, the version of the reconciliation bill passed by the House in May makes a number of substantive changes to Obamacare, including shortening the open enrollment period, barring beneficiaries from self-attesting changes in income, and eliminating automatic enrollments into marketplace plans. 

The bill also makes Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, recipients ineligible to purchase exchange plans, reversing a policy implemented by former President Joe Biden. It also limits subsidized marketplace coverage to lawful permanent residents, or green-card holders, and a small subset of other immigrants.

The “big, beautiful bill” would also change Medicaid expansion under the Obamacare framework in several ways, affecting low-income, able-bodied adults without dependent children. 

Although the bill does not rein in Medicaid expansion spending as much as fiscal hawks in the House hoped, it eliminates the temporary financial incentive for states that newly adopt the expansion instituted under the Biden-era American Rescue Plan Act, according to an analysis from the health policy think tank KFF.

The bill also institutes work requirements for adults covered by the Medicaid expansion, which policy experts say will result in a loss of coverage due to administrative difficulties for beneficiaries reporting their work hours, in addition to coverage losses from marketplace exchange programs.

The work requirements specifically apply to able-bodied adults, ages 19 to 64, with no dependent children, who must show they worked, volunteered, or attended school for 80 hours per month. The bill includes some exemptions for pregnant women and newly released incarcerated people.  

A spokesperson for the Energy and Commerce Committee, from which many of the program changes originated, told the Washington Examiner that “repealing and replacing Obamacare was never part of the conversation.”

“This reconciliation funding exercise was to root [out] waste, fraud, and abuse across the entire federal government. Congressional Republicans achieved this by ensuring program integrity of programs like Medicaid,” the spokesperson said.

White House spokesman Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner that the legislation “offers Americans better options and implements commonsense changes” that address waste, fraud, and abuse in Obamacare. 

“President Trump will continue to deliver on his promises to reduce health insurance costs and empower consumer choice,” Desai said.

Aaron Evans, president of Winning Republican Strategies, told the Washington Examiner that “the ACA is bloated.”

“The bloated subsidies of the ACA have driven up premiums 30% since 2017, and I think that we're seeing Republicans push real reforms to make healthcare more affordable, not just throwing more money at a broken system,” Evans said. 

Enrollment in Obamacare exchange plans reached nearly 24 million during the 2025 open enrollment period, double the level of the 2021 enrollment period, during the last full year of the first Trump administration.

That increase in enrollment is largely due to expanded premium tax credits for people already eligible for assistance, which Democrats implemented in 2021 as part of Biden's American Rescue Plan. Those tax credits were extended in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act but are set to expire by the end of the year. 

While extending premium tax credits could be taken up by the legislature later this year, they are not included in the reconciliation bill. 

Medicaid enrollment also grew substantially over the past few years, largely due to temporary coverage expansions made during the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking at 87.3 million enrollees in April 2023. 

That has fallen to 71.3 million as of December 2024, still significantly higher than the 64.5 million in February 2020.

Cynthia Cox, an expert for the healthcare think tank KFF, said the provisions of the GOP megabill “look pretty similar to a lot of the things that the Trump administration had done before or would have liked to do.”

On his first day as president in 2017, Trump signed an executive order minimizing the economic burden of Obamacare pending repeal, a first step toward repealing the law.

Those efforts failed in 2017, when the late GOP Sen. John McCain famously gave a thumbs-down, signaling a “no” vote on the Health Care Freedom Act. His actions earned him a phone call from former President Barack Obama, to whom he lost the 2008 presidential election, and scorn from Trump. 

Trump scored some success when his signature 2017 tax cut legislation eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate for coverage. Soon after, Congress repealed the Obamacare provision authorizing the Independent Payment Advisory Board, decried by conservatives as “death panels,” which were meant to slow growth in Medicare federal spending. 

In November 2020, Trump's administration, backed by Republican officials in nearly 20 states, asked the Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare. The bid was unsuccessful. In June 2021, the high court ruled 7-2 that the lawsuit had no legal standing. 

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump said during a debate that he had “concepts of a plan” to replace Obamacare.

Several weeks later, now-Vice President JD Vance defended his running mate's plans, claiming that Trump saved Obamacare from collapsing under its own administrative weight during his first term.

In the first five months of his second term, Trump has largely focused on issuing executive orders aimed at lowering healthcare prices for the public.

“We're probably looking at millions more uninsured, but the Obamacare markets will continue to function,” Cox said. “Whereas, with some of the versions of the repeal and replace proposals that had been floated around in 2017, some of those would have left the markets very unstable, to the point that some markets might not have even worked at all.”

Drew Altman, CEO of the healthcare policy think tank KFF,  said in an essay on the bill earlier in May that the policy changes included in the Republican reconciliation bill “are obscure and in the weeds, but enormously important for people and the Marketplaces in every state.” 

Because of the policy nuances, it's difficult to determine the number of people who will become uninsured if the policies take effect as written in the House version of the bill. 

Higher estimates for the number of disenrollees, upward of 15 million, come from including the effects of the expiring premium tax cuts in calculations. 

If Republicans and Democrats come together to renew premium subsidies before the end of the year, apart from the reconciliation bill, then the number of disenrollees could be under 8 million.

Any figures, however, are murky at best. The Congressional Budget Office has not issued its estimates of the House version of the bill, in part because it's tricky to discern how the nuances of the policy provisions will interact with each other in the real world.

“It's hard to say what's going to happen there, because some of those provisions overlap with each other or conflict with each other in different ways,” Cox said. 

Republicans have pushed back against the CBO's estimates that “the expiration of the expanded premium tax credits will increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million in 2034.” In total, the report also estimates that at least 8.6 million people will be without insurance in 2034.

The estimates were released at the behest of the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 

Republicans cited the CBO's past overestimates of Obamacare exchange enrollment as a reason not to trust its current projections. An analysis from the Commonwealth Fund showed that the CBO overestimated marketplace enrollment by 30% and marketplace costs by 28%. In contrast, the CBO underestimated Medicaid enrollment by roughly 14%.

“Under this bill, the integrity of the Medicaid program will be restored as we allow Medicaid to [serve] and assist the Americans it was intended to support: Expectant mothers, children, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities,” the Energy and Commerce Committee spokesperson said.

Evans, the GOP strategist, added that concerns from Democrats, especially about premium prices and uninsured numbers, obfuscate the benefits the bill would give in terms of rectifying the program's administrative problems. 

“One of the things we're going to hear from the Democrats is they're going to talk about 75% premium hikes and all the other things,” Evans said. “But ultimately, what we're really seeing happen here is trying to address some problems that have existed from the very beginning with ACA, most Americans will still get their subsidies. And then, you know, future plans will tackle costs for good, but it has to start somewhere.”

The Republican legislative bill could face sweeping changes during the Senate's half of the legislative process, as a handful of centrist Republicans have expressed disapproval of how the bill will affect Medicaid benefits, along with the healthcare impact on rural hospitals and tribal nations.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said while visiting Maine last Tuesday that she believes the Senate can “make the bill much better.” 

“I've said that if there are deep cuts in Medicaid that would endanger healthcare for low-income families, for disabled children, for other vulnerable populations, and for our rural hospitals, I'm simply not going to support that,” Collins told constituents. 

TRUMP WANTS MORE BABIES AND MARRIAGE. CAN THE GOVERNMENT DELIVER?

A spokesperson for Collins told the Washington Examiner that the healthcare provisions of the bill are unlikely to pass the Senate in their current form but did not elaborate on the negotiation process.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump's effort to raise birth and marriage rates is complicated","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3426542/more-marriage-babies-trump-family-czar/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump has declared himself the “fertilization president.” Vice President JD Vance wants a baby boom. The administration has pledged to put family first, yet so far, some conservatives believe it isn't going far enough. This Washington Examiner series, Baby Boomers, will analyze the Trump administration's early policies and pledges — if they have been successful or if they have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Part 1 is on whether a family czar is needed to advance Trump's goals.At a Women's History Month event in March, President Donald Trump jokingly branded himself the “fertilization president” to the laughter of the group gathered at the White House.

“Fertilization. I'm still very proud of it, I don't care,” he said. “I'll be known as the fertilization president, and that's OK. … I've been called much worse.”

Yet the lighthearted moment wasn't a joke. The Trump White House is ostensibly one of the most pro-family administrations in modern times.

Vice President JD Vance told attendees of the March for Life rally mere days after his inauguration: “I want more babies in the United States of America.”

Trump signed an executive order calling for policy recommendations to make in vitro fertilization affordable for families. The administration is prioritizing birth rates in doling out transportation projects. The White House was even considering a $5,000 cash baby bonus to women who gave birth. 

But the reality of enacting policies that would boost the nation's low birth and marriage rates is easier said than done.

Trump's signature “big, beautiful bill,” which the House recently passed, doesn't include funding for IVF or the $5,000 baby bonus. Another provision in the bill imposes stricter work requirements on single parents who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits.

SENATE FACES PUSH TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFTER HOUSE VOTE

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the reconciliation bill is passed, $723 billion in federal spending will be cut from Medicaid, and it will lead to an increase of 7.6 million uninsured people. The impact will likely be felt by the more than 37.3 million children who are enrolled in the federal-state health insurance program.

The bill does increase the child tax credit to $2,500 until 2028, but only for parents with Social Security numbers. Another provision nationalizes school vouchers for private education tuition and homeschooling programs.

Social conservatives are energized by the efforts of the White House to raise the birth rate, but more work could be done, they said.

“Trump campaigned with promises of big, bold moves to help American families. But so far, we have seen just modest moves to help families from the Republicans in Congress and the White House,” said Brad Wilcox, a senior fellow at the Institute for Family Studies and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia.

“Happy to see a bigger child tax credit, as well as support for adoption and school choice in this bill,” Wilcox continued. “But the child tax credit expansion just barely keeps up with inflation, and the MAGA child accounts don't help parents cover the costs of raising kids today. I'm hoping the Senate can take bigger and bolder moves to help make family life more affordable.”

Tucked into the reconciliation bill is a provision that would set aside $1,000 in an account for a child born during Trump's second term. The “Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement,” renamed the Trump account, allows families to add up to $5,000 a year but is untouchable until the child turns 18.

Patrick Brown, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, claimed some of the provisions on Medicaid and SNAP in the bill couldn't credibly be called pro-family. “I think it's pretty hard to square that with being authentically pro-family if you're going to be taking food off the table from kids who, you know, who are in elementary school and middle school,” Brown said.

Despite the limitations, the White House defended Trump's efforts to create strong families. 

“President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing the border to keep violent criminals out of our communities to lowering taxes and the cost of living,” said press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

“The president wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream,” Leavitt added. “As a mother myself, I am proud to work for a president who is taking significant action to leave a better country for the next generation.”

Social conservatives have expressed some unease with federal funding for IVF, objecting to the morality of assisted conception, and outright anger at the Justice Department's defense of mifepristone, the abortion pill. 

Some advocates have pushed for the Trump administration to consider convening a White House summit solely focused on how to support families or even appointing a “family czar.”

“We believe that a ‘Family Czar' would help the administration push pro-family policies into law,” said Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America, in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

The U.S. birth rate hit a record low in 2023, when roughly 3.59 million babies were born in the United States. In 2024, the birth rate slightly increased to over 3.6 million babies born in the U.S., or roughly 1.6 births per 1,000 women in 2024. It's nowhere near the 2.1 births replacement rate needed to maintain the current U.S. population by births alone.

The marriage rate rebounded in 2022 after a decrease in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, there were 6.2 marriages per 1,000 population — the highest rate observed since 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.

Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-WI) is one of the most vocal members of Congress pushing for the White House to appoint a family czar, preferably Vance, to help two-parent families have more children. 

“I think, given his background, nobody could say that he is being mean-spirited or lacking compassion for families without a father at home,” Grothman said about Vance as a potential czar. “He's also very intelligent, and intelligence is a great asset in any task.”

But a White House official told the Washington Examiner there are no plans for a family czar, instead claiming that it's not necessary because Trump is already the most pro-family and pro-American household president in history.

Brown, the fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, previously lobbied for the Trump administration to hold a White House summit bringing together relevant stakeholders to discuss family and fertility. 

“If they want to shine the light on family policy, they should really do a summit at the White House,” he said. “Invite a bunch of people in and talk about low birth rates, talk about low marriage rates, and what we can do from the federal and state level to make it easier to start a family.” 

Not all conservatives are sold on the idea that the federal government should lead the charge on pro-family policies. 

“I don't think it's the government's job to have a family czar,” said Tim Chapman, president of the Advancing American Freedom. “I think what I'd like to see our federal government doing is creating the stability and the economic environment necessary for families to thrive.” 

“If you create a federal family czar, it's just more of the same,” Chapman added. “And I would like the federal government to divest more power and allow states to produce innovative policies that allow family flourishing in their states.” 

Similarly, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, was hesitant to call for a czar or a pro-family summit. “I think the best stance for pro-life groups and activists is to ask the question first of ourselves. Are we doing enough to reach out rather than asking, are they doing enough to reach out to us?” he said. “And I think that's the more fruitful approach for the pro-life groups to take.”

CONSERVATIVES SPLIT OVER IVF AS WHITE HOUSE WEIGHS POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

Several experts who spoke with the Washington Examiner explained how other industries, such as housing, the job market, education, and Trump's trade policies, also have a vast impact on whether or not marriage and birth rates increase. 

“My own personal view on this is that the best incentive structure for encouraging more children and for encouraging family formation is a really, really good, positive, upwardly mobile job,” said Chapman. “And in a regulatory environment that allows for access to less expensive housing and less expensive goods. And I think that's the name of the game here.”

There is the caveat that Trump's trade policies and the ensuing financial uncertainty could contradict other efforts to help more Americans get married and have children. 

Catherine Pakaluk, an economist at the Catholic University of America and mother of eight children, said in an interview that on the family front, it may be strategically wise for the Trump administration to move away from anti-abortion efforts and focus on issues such as school choice and housing. 

“It is, simultaneously, from my research perspective, more effective. But also politically, I think it would be less alienating,” she said. 

The Trump administration's complicated handling of the antiabortion movement, including removing wording supporting a federal abortion ban from the Republican National Committee platform while embracing funding for IVF, reflects the debate on what exactly pro-family legislation means.

For some conservatives, that may mean policies that lead to religious, heterosexual married couples who conceive children naturally or adopt. For others, that ideology also includes medically assisted conception of children. The ex-DOGE leader Elon Musk's brood of children, several of whom were conceived through IVF, is one notable example of the expanding meaning of a non-traditional family. 

The administration “has wanted to free itself up from the pro-life commitment of the Republican Party, which is why the platform changed in the summer,” Pakaluk said. “I think Trump at least seems to think that you need both sides in the tent.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX) asserted that former President Joe Biden's doctor likely played a role in the cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline, citing how the doctor was “part of the Biden family.”

Jackson explained that Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, served as Biden's doctor for eight years when he was vice president under former President Barack Obama, and was later recruited again once Biden entered the Oval Office in 2021. Because of how “beloved” he was by the offices of Biden and his wife, former first lady Jill Biden, Jackson said he “truly” believes that O'Connor would “say or do anything” asked by the Biden family.

“And I think they purposefully brought him back because they knew that they had somebody that could help cover up anything that might come up,” Jackson claimed on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. “And I think, probably, when he was running back in 2019, they already knew  that he was having cognitive issues, and I think they were probably already behind the scenes assessing that and addressing that, and they realized that Kevin O'Connor would be somebody that could keep that a secret.”

Jackson, who is a former White House physician himself, proceeded to compare Biden's cognitive decline to that of former President Woodrow Wilson, who suffered a stroke during his presidency in 1919. Jackson cited how Wilson's physician and wife, former first lady Edith Wilson, kept this “hidden” from the press, and proceeded to make decisions for the country.

Last month, it was revealed that Biden has prostate cancer, to which Jackson found it “unbelievable” how this cancer was only recently discovered. He then speculated how the news of Biden's cancer became public just before a new book delving into the former president's cognitive decline was released, and the news of Biden's cancer was a bid to create “sympathy” for Biden.

The House Oversight Committee is investigating Biden's decline during his presidency, sending letters to O'Connor and other aides to the former president for interviews. On Sunday, the committee's chairman, Rep. James Comer (R-KY), suggested that Biden's executive orders could be “thrown out in court” if the president's autopen had been used to sign them.

Biden has defended his record as president as well as his initial decision to seek reelection in 2024. He also stated that he is expecting to beat his cancer, citing how “my bones are strong.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

And that's okay.

Know thyself: Many have said this. Socrates—maybe you've heard of him? Though he seems to have gotten the phrase from the oracle at Apollo's temple in Delphi, where it was chiseled into the stone facade. In the Tao-te Ching, Lao-tzu wrote, “If you understand others you are smart. If you understand yourself you are illuminated.” And Shakespeare had his own pithy aphorism, “To thine own self be true,” presupposing that thou knowest enough about thine own self to be true to it.

Good advice, to a point. If you know absolutely nothing about yourself or your likes, wants, values, or personality, you either are a baby or have bigger problems than a dead philosopher can address.

Yet sometimes all of modern life seems to be pushing people toward knowing themselves in more and more granular ways. People are going to therapy in rising numbers to seek self-understanding. They are tracking their steps, reading, and sleep. They are giving their data to corporate marketing databases so they can find out their Myers-Briggs type, Enneagram number, or Harry Potter house. On TikTok, as Rebecca Jennings reported for Vox, creators are inventing new micro-identities for people to resonate with: “Dilly dally-ers” are people who like to fart around and waste time; a “therapist friend” is someone whose friends talk to them about their problems. The quest to find and define yourself can feel never-ending.

It can also feel like a vital part of life, as though if you're not seeking self-understanding, you're missing out. (Our old pal Socrates also said: “The unexamined life is not worth living.”) “If you haven't noticed how pervasive this message is in society, just pay attention for the next few days,” Rebecca Schlegel, a Texas A&M University social psychologist, told me. “It's so baked into our culture that we almost take it for granted.”

But the dream of perfect self-knowledge is unattainable, and chasing it too doggedly can leave you more confused and stuck than when you started. Humans' ability to see themselves clearly and accurately has limitations that neither personality quizzes nor Fitbit data can overcome. “We should never think that we know ourselves very well,” Simine Vazire, a University of Melbourne psychology professor who has studied self-knowledge, told me. “Anyone who thinks they do—by definition, they lack self-knowledge, because they're wrong about that, at least.”

Knowing yourself is difficult, in part, because some behaviors and attitudes stem from the unconscious mind, outside your sphere of awareness. “The mind purrs along under the hood in various ways,” Timothy Wilson, a University of Virginia psychologist and the author of Strangers to Ourselves, told me. One of many examples he gives in his book is how people interpret ambiguous situations (and why). If I tell a joke at a party and no one laughs, my unconscious patterns will determine whether I think I'm a socially awkward fool whom everyone hates or assume that my audience must not have heard me over the din of the party, because I'm clearly charming and hilarious.

Bias is also a hindrance. For example, many people have a tendency to rate themselves as better than average across all kinds of traits, even though, obviously, we can't all be above average. Biases are part of the problem with a personality quiz, Vazire told me. Far from revealing some hidden truth that was locked within, she said, the test is “just repeating to you what you tell it.”

Another tricky thing is that most people aren't fully aware of how much capacity they have for change. A study of 19,000 people that Wilson worked on, called “The End of History Illusion,” found that although people reported having changed a lot in the past decade, on average they believed they were mostly done changing and wouldn't evolve much more in the next 10 years.

Read: I gave myself three months to change my personality

The pursuit of self-knowledge is difficult even when someone goes about it in a thoughtful, deliberate way. Meditating, journaling, or asking yourself the hard questions can be greatly beneficial. But active, conscious introspection has a dark side: rumination, or getting fixated on a problem and going over it again and again, which can make things worse and trap people in a negative thought spiral.

People can also undermine themselves by thinking too much about the good things in their lives. In a small study Wilson conducted, when the researchers asked people to reflect on how their romantic relationship was going, the very act of reflecting seemed to change the subjects' minds. Some got happier with their relationship; some got less happy. But according to Wilson, these changes in perspective didn't necessarily reflect people's true feelings. Love is not fully explainable, after all, and Wilson theorized that the subjects put too much stock in whatever answers they came up with for the study. If they struggled to list a lot of good reasons they loved their significant other, they might conclude that they were less in love than they'd thought. People sometimes “construct a new story about their feelings based on the reasons that happen to come to mind,” Wilson wrote.

Introspection, as he described it in his book, should be understood less as an archaeological dig to uncover the capital-T Truth of ourselves and more as literary criticism “in which we are the text to be understood.” Just as a good novel doesn't have one single truth in it, a person has many truths as well. Rather than seeking a perfectly accurate story about themselves (which is impossible), people should try to construct a narrative that's “pretty positive” and “somewhat reality-based,” according to Wilson. This is one way to think about therapy—as a collaborative process of rewriting your story until it works well enough to let you stop thinking about it quite so much.

The notion that each person has one real, abiding self buried within, waiting to be discovered, is both widespread and difficult for many people to shake, Schlegel told me: When people go through a big change, for instance, particularly a good one, they tend to think of it less as a transformation from one thing to another and more as a discovery of something in themselves that was always there.

Schlegel has found that belief in the true self is linked to seeing greater meaning in your life, but she described herself as a “true-self agnostic.” (She referenced the social psychologist Roy Baumeister, who called the true self a “troublesome myth.”) For all the idea's benefits, “the downside,” she said, is “what happens if we close ourselves off to change. And then we miss out on something we might have loved.”

Most of my life, I thought I was a dog person who hated running. Yet just a couple of weekends ago I ran a 5K then came home to my two perfect cats, Cherry and Ginkgo, whom I am utterly devoted to. If you had beamed a premonition of that Saturday into the mind of my younger self, she would have been confused, perhaps even alarmed. My preference for dogs and my disdain for running were two things I thought I would never change my mind about. But that might have been just a failure of imagination. As Wilson and his co-authors wrote in their “End of History Illusion” study, “People may confuse the difficulty of imagining personal change with the unlikelihood of change itself.”

Why did I change my mind? On the running, I really have no idea. I just got on the treadmill one day for some reason and found it to not be so bad. My husband wanted the cats, and I fell in love the day we brought them home as tiny kittens.

Was I always a cat person, secretly? Did I have an inner runner within me, just waiting to be discovered? Did I actually change or did I just become more myself? I don't know, and I don't really care. Both explanations seem plausible, and I ended up in the same place either way: watching Survivor on the treadmill every now and then and being woken up every morning at 6 a.m. by a scratchy little tongue licking my face.

Vazire, like me, runs “very casually once in a while.” She told me that her well-meaning partner sometimes shares things he's learned about how to improve your form or otherwise optimize your running, and she gets annoyed. “I'm not trying to optimize anything,” she said. “I'm not trying to become a runner.” I wouldn't consider myself a runner, either. I just run sometimes. Not every habit or preference has to become an identity. Sometimes we just do things. As Schlegel put it, “Not everything has to be so weighty.”

Instead of conceiving of our true self as set in stone, the secret to a healthy pursuit of self-knowledge may lie in building a flexible sense of self, one that allows for surprise and even mystery. Research has linked the belief that the self is changeable to positive outcomes: lower stress, better physical health, and less negative reactions to hardships. Maybe we should stop searching for ourselves quite so intensely, put down the Sorting Hat and the label maker, and just, I don't know, live life and try things without overly worrying about what they say about who we really are.

To be found, to be known: These are unreachable destinations. Not only is our ability to know ourselves limited, but scientists can probably only know so much about the nature of self-knowledge. Vazire is highly skeptical that research can solve that puzzle. “I don't think the expertise we need here is quantitative empirical data,” she said. “It's just wisdom, or something like that.” Parts of the self will probably always remain a little lost, resistant to easy categorization—and maybe that's fine.

The Court is encouraging deference to the executive branch—when it likes the results.

An 88-mile rail line in a remote Utah desert was at the center of the Supreme Court's bracing decision last Thursday in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County. The legal battle over that tiny project has now led to a decision from the Court's conservative majority that will shrink the role of environmental litigation across the country.

The case can only be described as a walloping loss for environmental groups that depend on litigation to thwart projects and extract concessions. Much less clear, however, is whether the decision is a blow to the environment. There's much to like in a decision that will reduce the dysfunction arising from the judiciary's disastrous efforts to police compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. In the courts' hands, a law that was meant to be a mild corrective has become a major impediment to desperately needed infrastructure development.

But there's room for concern, too. The Court's deference to the government in Seven County doesn't seem to extend to cases where the government seeks to rein in environmental harms. That mismatch suggests that the Court's approach to NEPA grows out of its skepticism toward environmental regulation generally, and not from an evenhanded legal theory that would apply to all government decisions equally.

When it was signed into law on January 1, 1970, NEPA wasn't meant to be all that powerful. In the fast-building decades after the Second World War, some federal agencies—especially the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Atomic Energy Commission—refused to consider the environment when they made decisions. That wasn't their job, they said.

Congress grew tired of hearing that. As the modern environmental movement took shape, NEPA declared a national policy that environmental concerns ought to factor into any big decisions that government agencies made. The task wasn't supposed to be onerous. Agencies just had to offer a “detailed statement” about the environmental consequences of “major” actions, as well as explore alternatives. The courts weren't mentioned at all.

But it was the fate of this five-page law to be adopted at the very moment when the courts were transforming the field of law that governs executive-branch agencies. Federal judges, like many Americans, had become disenchanted with a government that rammed highways through urban neighborhoods, sent tens of thousands to die in Vietnam, and allowed smog to choke its cities. Much of the public came to think that it was under the thumb of Big Business, Big Labor, and Big Government, as the environmental and legal historian Paul Sabin describes in his book Public Citizens.

For judges hunting for ways to more closely supervise the work of government, and who were taken with the promise of the nascent environmental movement, NEPA supplied a perfect tool. In a seminal 1971 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rebuked federal officials for not taking the environment seriously enough in approving a nuclear plant in Calvert Cliffs, Maryland. “These cases are only the beginning of what promises to become a flood of new litigation—litigation seeking judicial assistance in protecting our natural environment,” the court wrote.

The flood came quickly. Within a couple of years, judges blocked construction of a huge oil pipeline in Alaska; delayed highway construction in Arlington, Virginia; and stopped a new dam in Arkansas. Orders halting projects such as nuclear-power plants and forest-timber sales soon became routine.

Jerusalem Demsas: The great defenders of the status quo

Agencies got the message. They hired environmental scientists, wildlife biologists, and hydrologists. They stitched environmental review into their planning, sought more feedback on their projects, and issued longer and more detailed environmental reviews. To a point, this was healthy. NEPA made bureaucracies think about things that they hadn't thought much about before.

Within just a few years, however, close observers were warning that agencies faced “severe difficulties” in their efforts to satisfy the courts. The chief problem wasn't that agencies were deliberately shirking their responsibilities under NEPA. It was that there were so many different ways to lose. Maybe the agency thought a decision wasn't “major” enough to trigger NEPA, but a judge disagreed. Or maybe the agency ignored an alternative that the court thought should have been studied. Or maybe the environmental review was deemed to be too thin. Combine that with crusading judges and litigious environmental groups, and agencies found themselves on their back heels.

The problem has only grown worse over the decades. Because big projects are complicated and delicate, agencies today work extremely hard to hedge against bad outcomes in court. That means they don't investigate just the reasonable alternatives. They investigate stupid ones, too, in case a judge later says that the agency really ought to have looked into one of them. They're constantly on the defensive, and they waste loads of time, money, and energy bulletproofing environmental reviews instead of doing the work that is at the core of their mission.

By 2020, the average NEPA environmental-impact statement (EIS) was 661 pages long and took four and a half years to complete. Some take as long as a decade. These “detailed statements” were supposed to help educate the public. They are now so long, turgid, and technical that they're basically unreadable.



From time to time over the years, the Supreme Court has intervened to push back on maximalist interpretations of NEPA. But not all the lower courts have gotten the message. The Seven County litigation is a case in point. The D.C. Circuit held that the Surface Transportation Board's EIS—a 3,600-page door stopper—was inadequate. Why?

The 88-mile railroad was meant to connect the rich oil fields in the Uinta Basin to the interstate rail network. Its boosters hoped that a ready connection to Gulf Coast refineries would spur new drilling in the basin. The Surface Transportation Board, which has authority to approve new railroad lines, observed that the additional drilling and refining would have environmental consequences. But the agency didn't study them fully. It thought its job under NEPA was to evaluate environmental impacts of building the railroad, not activities that the railroad might enable.

Environmental groups sued, as they do over just about any project that will lead to more greenhouse-gas emissions. The D.C. Circuit sided with them, ruling that the agency should have considered the upstream and downstream consequences of the oil drilling that the railroad would lead to. That teed up the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the environmentalists. The justices all agreed, even the liberal ones, that the Surface Transportation Board was not legally allowed to consider environmental harms that might arise from third-party use of the railroad. If the agency couldn't take those harms into account, what purpose would be served by forcing it to study them?

If that's all the case said, it wouldn't be such a big deal. But that's not all it said.

In an opinion for the Court written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the six conservative justices chastised judges for going overboard with NEPA. “Some courts have strayed and not applied NEPA with the level of deference demanded by the statutory text and this Court's cases. Those decisions have instead engaged in overly intrusive (and unpredictable) review in NEPA cases. Those rulings have slowed down or blocked many projects and, in turn, caused litigation-averse agencies to take ever more time and to prepare ever longer EIS for future projects.”

That's legalese for, “We keep telling you and you keep not listening. Knock it off!”

The watchword for the courts, the justices insisted, was deference. Deference to the government's choice about how detailed its environmental review should be. Deference on which environmental impacts to study. Deference on which alternatives to investigate. To make sure the lower courts got it, the justices repeated the word a dozen times. “The bedrock principle of judicial review in NEPA cases can be stated in a word: Deference.”

Equally striking was the Court's description of why deference was so important. “NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement,” the Court wrote, “into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents (who may not always be entirely motivated by concern for the environment) to try to stop or at least slow down new infrastructure and construction projects.” It is long past time, the Court insisted, for a course correction.



There are at least two ways to understand the Supreme Court's decision. The first is optimistic and eco-friendly. The second is somewhat grimmer.

The optimistic take is that the decision reflects a healthy regard for how the world has changed over the past 50 years. Back then, we were building much too recklessly. Today, we aren't building enough, and overzealous NEPA litigation is a big reason for that. As the Supreme Court explained, the threat of litigation:

has led to more agency analysis of separate projects, more consideration of attenuated effects, more exploration of alternatives to proposed agency action, more speculation and consultation and estimation and litigation. Delay upon delay, so much so that the process sometimes seems to “borde[r] on the Kafkaesque.” Fewer projects make it to the finish line. Indeed, fewer projects make it to the starting line. Those that survive often end up costing much more than is anticipated or necessary, both for the agency preparing the EIS and for the builder of the project. And that in turn means fewer and more expensive railroads, airports, wind turbines, transmission lines, dams, housing developments, highways, bridges, subways, stadiums, arenas, data centers, and the like. And that also means fewer jobs, as new projects become difficult to finance and build in a timely fashion.

Here, the Supreme Court sounds like it's taking a page from Abundance, the best-selling book by Ezra Klein and The Atlantic's Derek Thompson. Klein and Thompson also see overzealous legalism, and NEPA in particular, as a root cause of why America has become so bad at building things.

Jerusalem Demsas: Liberals can't blame Trump for California

That inability to build is not just a problem for roads and subways and trains. It's a problem for the green transition too, which is subject to a disproportionate number of recent lawsuits under NEPA. As the environmental-law professors J. B. Ruhl and James Salzmann have written, building enough solar and wind facilities to drive our carbon emissions to zero will demand “the most ambitious infrastructure project in our nation's history. To succeed, it must start now, go nationwide, and progress rapidly. Based on past experience with opposition to deploying renewable infrastructure—good luck with that.”

But if courts pull back on NEPA, will agencies become too heedless of the environment? Not as much as one may think. Even under the Supreme Court's decision, agencies still must consider the immediate environmental consequences of their actions. Ignoring them is still going to be a basis for reversal. Agencies must also comply with all the substantive environmental laws on the books—the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund law, and more. All the Seven County case says is that agencies don't have to go hog wild with their environmental reviews. The added value of that extra year or the additional hundred pages is often very small.

Nor is it true that environmental litigation always advances environmental protection. Many local chapters of the Sierra Club, for example, are quick to ally with NIMBY homeowners to stop renewable projects. And they routinely exploit NEPA to challenge new solar facilities and wind farms. Another favorite target of environmental groups is the Forest Service, which aims to suppress wildfires out West by doing controlled burns and mechanical timber thinning. But the Forest Service's fuel-reduction efforts keep getting snarled in NEPA litigation—so much so that it has become common for forests to burn down while the Forest Service studies how to protect them.

The optimistic take, then, is that the Supreme Court has cleared away legalistic sludge to needed development, at little or no cost to the environment. The groups may complain bitterly over losing a main source of leverage and fundraising appeals. But let them complain. They do not speak for the trees, much less for the American public.



There's a less rosy way to tell the story. The Supreme Court's paean to agency deference is oddly selective. At the end of the last term, for example, the Court invalidated the Environmental Protection Agency's effort to adopt a rule that would have prevented upwind states from polluting the air of downwind states. “The EPA's sin,” as I explained for this magazine at the time, “was failing to adequately respond to a single oblique comment that it received.”

That's the opposite of deference. It's intensive, even hyperactive, scrutiny of the EPA's decision to protect the environment. Instead of deferring to the agency's lengthy, technical defense of the rule, the Supreme Court flyspecked it—just as the D.C. Circuit flyspecked the agency decision approving the 88-mile railroad in the Uinta Basin. That's exactly the kind of “overly intrusive (and unpredictable) review” that the Supreme Court criticized the lower courts for.

It sure looks like the conservative majority is adjusting the intensity of judicial scrutiny to suit its policy preferences. When agencies downplay environmental harms, Seven County says they should get a free pass. When agencies move to protect the environment, the courts will tie them into knots.

Zoë Schlanger: American environmentalism just got shoved into legal purgatory

That's not the way administrative law is supposed to work. If deference is the touchstone in NEPA cases, it ought to be the touchstone across the board. If the Supreme Court means it when it says that “the political process, and not NEPA, provides the appropriate forum in which to air policy disagreements,” that same line of thinking should extend to other government decisions that aren't about NEPA.

But it doesn't seem to. That's why I fear that the Supreme Court in Seven County may not have been motivated by a principled desire to pare back counterproductive judicial scrutiny in order to improve government performance. It may instead reflect a frankly partisan belief that efforts to protect the environment are intrinsically suspect.

Which is why it's reasonable, even for NEPA skeptics, to have misgivings about Seven County. Judicial review under NEPA really has gone too far, and I am not sad to see it taken down a peg. But environmental protection remains a worthy goal, and the Court's apparent doubt about its value is disquieting.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Melissa Febos's new book, The Dry Season, recounts a year of celibacy and the freedom it gave her to reconnect with the world.

By the time she was in her mid-30s, the writer Melissa Febos had been in relationships for 20 straight years. One romance would end and another would begin immediately, if it hadn't already started: a long relay race of partners. In the rare stretch of singlehood, she would always have a crush ready to grab the baton soon enough.

This might sound, to a lot of people, like great luck. “Our culture tells us that such abundance is a privilege,” Febos acknowledges in her new book, The Dry Season: A Memoir of Pleasure in a Year Without Sex. But abundance, in her experience, felt more like constraint. In one terrible two-year relationship, she writes, she cried so often that the skin near her eyes began peeling off; texts from her girlfriend made her so anxious that she had to keep changing the alert sound. Other times, she details quieter torments: always thinking about her latest flame, always expected to tell them her whereabouts, never really able to work or read or daydream in peace. Her body didn't feel like her own anymore—but rather like “a work animal who slept in a barn behind the house of my mind.” She recalls feeling like “a hungry ghost”: always starved for affection, but never sated. “You can't get enough of a thing you don't need,” her therapist tells her.

Finally, she resolves to take a break. Or rather, she has another five flings—“like the last handful of popcorn you cram into your mouth after you decide to stop eating it”—and then resolves to actually take a break: She will be celibate for three months.

Read: How a recession might tank American romance

Yes, three months. Febos appreciates the laughable modesty of her goal. But she argues that, for her, it was ambitious: an attempt not only to take a breath, but also to find the bottom of her “bottomless need.” The Dry Season is an account of this period, which turns into a year, during which she abstains from sex, dates, and flirting. It doesn't call for an end to romance, but it is an indictment of a dependence, individually and societally, on partnership. Febos doesn't want to lose passion, but she needs to find balance.

The particular abundance of which Febos speaks—I can't say I'm personally familiar with it. I don't think too many people are, or not to this degree. In her handful of celibate months, she must resist suitor after suitor popping up like road obstacles in a racing game. There's the writer who, at a conference, literally begs her to have sex; the friend who confesses her attraction; the acquaintance who thinks their dinner is a date; the playwright who keeps texting. There's a hot stranger on a plane.

But Febos never claims her journey is anything near universal. She unpacks how she learned early on to catch and hold people's attention, to make them want something from her. When she left home at 16 and supported herself with restaurant work, her tips, and thus her survival, depended on it. She also recounts her history of addiction—how she's no longer using heroin, but still, to some extent, chasing the next reward. And anyway, I'd guess that most readers, whether or not they're serial monogamists, have struggled at some point to shut off whatever autopilot setting cuts against their own best interests. As I read, Febos's celibacy challenge went from feeling like a humblebrag to a deeply relatable effort. And as she settled into her solitude, her observations began to resonate. She details parts of singlehood that I, too, have treasured—and which I've heard extolled again and again in my reporting on romance, even from people whose celibate season resulted from a dearth, not an excess, of options.

One of the qualities that Febos discovers is absolute tranquility. She luxuriates in her quiet mornings, with no one hogging the bed or waiting to hear back from her; she spends whole weekends reading paperback mysteries, carrying them with her to the bathroom, getting lost in them as she hadn't since she was young. The calm is not just physical but, more importantly, mental. When I spoke with people who quit dating out of frustration, several told me they'd discovered immense peace. With Febos's attention freed up, she notices the smells of a New York summer; the flowers she passes along the streets; the “tart explosion” of each raspberry she eats, one by one, from a whole carton.

As romantic distractions fall away, the quiet also makes way for freedom. When researchers ask people what they most appreciate about singlehood, many mention a sense of autonomy. Febos expresses delight in running her own schedule, forgoing meal times and eating when she's hungry—grazing on green apples and cheese, olives and nuts, pickles right out of the jar. Her liberation isn't just related to action; it has to do with possibility, open-endedness. Every partnership she'd been in had, inevitably, structured her life according to a certain narrative. “Identity is a story other people tell us, that we learn to tell ourselves, that is housed inside relationships,” she writes. It can be comforting, but also suffocating. When she wakes in her bed alone, or returns to the world after immersing herself in a book, she's not hit with the recollection that she's Melissa, someone's girlfriend. She just exists.

That's not to say that Febos spends her dry season in oblivious solitude; quite the opposite. She describes gabbing on the phone with her mom and her friends about a million things other than her crushes. While staying overnight with an old pal, she writes, she's startled to find that she has “nothing else to do, no one to call and wish good night, no higher priority than to be with my friend.” This might be the greatest benefit of singlehood: the deepening of other connections. Surveys have found that single people, on average, have more friends than married people, and feel closer to them; they are more likely to spend time with parents and siblings, and to know their neighbors; they volunteer more for certain organizations. Many couples, meanwhile, have a tendency to look inward; to remain in a cozy bubble, thinking mostly of each other. For a variety of reasons, not all of them bad, partners today spend more time together than those in the 1960s did.

Febos recognizes the appeal of a more circumscribed life. The outside world seems to be growing only more dissonant and chaotic. Focusing on a partner can be a way to protect oneself from fully processing a barrage of bad news and angry discourse. “It seemed impossible to keep an open heart in this world,” she writes. “It made sense to keep the channel of one's heart narrowed the width of a single person, to peer through the keyhole at a single room rather than turn to face the world.”

But when Febos stops looking through the keyhole and turns around, she finds that being single feels like anything but a dry season; it's the most emotionally and spiritually fertile time of her life. The ties she strengthens aren't only social: She also starts connecting with nature, with art, with her surroundings. “Instead of narrowing the aperture of my feeling,” she writes, “I expanded it. A light that shone not on specific objects, but illuminated everything in proximity.” She isn't in love with a partner; she's in love, full stop.

Febos is clear that, as much as she enjoys singlehood, she never intended to linger there forever. And she doesn't. Pretty much as soon as her year of celibacy comes to a close, she falls for the woman who becomes her wife. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a small stab of disappointment, as if she'd abandoned the whole venture she claimed to champion, only confirming that the luckless are indeed losing out. But Febos's greatest challenge, really, begins as the book ends. Being single is easier, in a sense, than being partnered and still preserving your other relationships, your interests, and yourself.

Read: The new singlehood stigma

She's been preparing for this test. Febos makes clear, throughout The Dry Season, that what she wants isn't just to stop defaulting to romance. She also aims to divest from a relationship culture that is rooted in patriarchy; one that so often leads women, even those who aren't dating men, to make themselves so small that they disappear. She finds historical role models in women who chose celibacy or solitude over a partnered domestic life and thus were allowed to retain an unusual amount of agency. Hildegard von Bingen, a Benedictine abbess and eventual saint, lived in the Middle Ages, when women's lives were severely restricted. By claiming a direct line to God, though, she was able to become a composer, lyricist, and the author of numerous scientific texts. The Beguines, a group of medieval laywomen, traveled and lived independently, teaching and working in service to the poor, instead of becoming the property of husbands.

Febos studies these models and also makes a list of all of her past entanglements, analyzing each in hopes that she can discover—and break—her own patterns. She comes to believe that she's been conditioned to identify what someone wants from her and measure her value through her power to grant it. My worth is contingent on my lovability, she writes down on a slip of paper. Then she goes to Coney Island, digs a hole in the sand, and burns it to ash. She promises herself “to remain faithful to what I had found.”

Can she be, though, now that she's no longer single? Febos seems to have come a long way from where she started. When she first has lunch with her wife-to-be, at the writing conference they're both attending, she knows they have chemistry—but doesn't let that knowledge consume her. She pulls her attention to the world around her: the trees just beginning to bud, the crowds of people, the pinch in her left shoe.

I want to believe this is enough: that if you're intentional, you can be someone's partner without losing any of yourself. I'm not sure I do. Maybe Febos still eats pickles straight out of the jar, and sleeps alone, splayed across the whole bed. But when she wakes up, she will know that she can no longer “be anyone or no one.” She will be shaped by the story of her relationship. She will, in some way or another, be bending herself into half of the whole. You can't turn toward someone without turning away from something else.

That doesn't mean she should have stayed celibate, or that she's failed to accomplish what she set out to do. On the contrary, she seems well aware of what gets sacrificed for love—she wrote a whole thoughtfully argued book on it. She's simply chosen, I think, to risk some of her own losses for gains she considers worth it. These are the trade-offs we make. Even a conscientious objector cannot disentangle themselves completely from a society that worships partnership. Better to notice where your attention goes. Better to keep drawing it back, again and again, to the world around you: to the pinch in your shoe, to the buds in the trees, to the people—all the many, many people—who are right there beside you.

Memories of the past shape the choices of nations in the present.

I have taught strategy in war colleges in the United States and other countries. Like most instructors, I describe strategy as an endeavor that strives to match ends and means in a rational way, a dialogue between soldiers and politicians seeking to use force for political purposes. That is certainly what the senior officers who attend such institutions believe.

A recent multiweek swing through European capitals, however, has emphasized for me that among the most important influences on the choices that countries make about war and peace are ghosts: memories—be they accurate, fanciful, or, more typically, something in between—of historical experiences and personalities from a remembered past, sometimes reaching back centuries.

Several days in London spent speaking to all manner of generals and spymasters, scholars, and advisers to government, for example, brought home the long shadow of empire that still shapes British military policy, for good and for ill. It was tangible while walking through the House of Lords and seeing the coats of arms of field marshals and admirals of the fleet, as it was during the celebration of V-E Day by veterans, admittedly of later wars, wearing the regimental ties and bonnets of defunct but storied regiments.

Imperial self-assurance and memory helps explain Britain's remarkable leadership in dealing with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Boris Johnson, whatever his peccadilloes, channeled Churchill's ghost by dashing off to Kyiv, pushing advanced weapons on Ukraine well before America did, and offering a security guarantee to Sweden as it began to move toward NATO membership. Not only Churchill but Palmerston or Pitt the Younger would have approved of such statecraft. Johnson is well read and eloquent enough to summon their spirits.

Unfortunately, however, the reality of actual British power does not match its reach. The U.K. possesses outstanding niche capacities in the world of special operations and intelligence gathering, but its navy now has barely a quarter as many surface combatants as it did during the Falklands War; its nuclear force is obsolescent; and its army is tiny, albeit of high quality. The suggestion by British politicians that the U.K. could regularly deploy a brigade—say, some 4,000 soldiers—as part of a reassurance force to Ukraine in the event of a cease-fire was privately mocked by experts. The U.K. does not have enough troops to do that.

The countries of Eastern Europe wrestle with different ghosts. Estonia is haunted by the Soviet Union's brutal occupation after World War II and the mass deportations of tens of thousands of Estonians, including the family of Kaja Kallas, the European Union's current high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. After the war, as in the other Baltic states, partisans fought the Soviets for another decade, and in some cases even beyond. The memories of those deported, killed, imprisoned, or tortured are with current leaders; so, too, are the ghosts of those who achieved a precarious independence after World War I only to lose it again to the Muscovites. It has led Estonians not only to arm themselves to the teeth and commit utterly to Ukraine's aid, but to disdain the condescending lectures of West Europeans who sought reconciliation with Russia after the Cold War.

“I was studying in Sweden in 1975,” one retired Estonian statesman told me, “and no one then referred to the Federal Republic of Germany as the ‘former Nazi Third Reich.' But somehow the West Europeans, 30 years after we regained our independence, think it's okay to refer to us as ‘former Soviet republics.'” The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has changed much of that, but the ghosts of the Soviet period still haunt the relationship between edgy and exposed frontline states and those more comfortably situated to the West that never felt the Russian lash.

Finnish and Polish ghosts are rather different. Conversations with Finns about the Russian threat invariably turn to the Winter War, the spectacular fight that Finland put up against the Red Army in 1939–40. The heroism, the sense of having to be ready to fight alone and the payoff for being prepared to do so, has shaped Finnish strategic culture to the present day. But NATO membership—and with it the need to fight as part of an alliance elsewhere than along the 850-mile Russian-Finnish border—is something Finns struggle with.

For Poland, the national strategic ghosts are those of betrayal. France and Britain failed to do much while Poland was crushed between Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. In the Polish understanding, the country was betrayed again at the Yalta Conference in 1945. If past glories lead British statesmen to offer more than they can deliver, past horrors incline Poles to be suspicious of requests to do more than they deem prudent. When discussing whether Poland should contribute to a reassurance force stationed in Ukraine (rather than just over the border), a Polish general first explained the operational requirements of Poland's large army to fend off various other threats and then offered this response: “You Americans asked us to follow you into Iraq. I lost men there, whom I still mourn. And now you want us to do this, when you are not willing to do it yourselves?”

He had a point. But a rich and increasingly powerful Poland, with the best and largest land army in Europe outside Ukraine, will need to assume a leadership role for which its history has not prepared it. Europeans now speak of an E-4, composed of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, that may steer the West's support to embattled Ukraine. That is a step in the right direction, at least.

The millions of Ukrainian ghosts, victims of suffering at Russia's hand, explain Ukraine's extraordinary tenacity. Russia's predatory imperial ghosts, who have gathered in legions over centuries of conquest of neighboring lands, have lured Vladimir Putin into a project to restore the Russian empire, one that Russians insist to this day “has no borders.” The ghosts who fell in America's ill-starred wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are among the reasons (including others far less worthy) for J. D. Vance's and Donald Trump's snarls about renouncing the use of American military power abroad. But even Trump's government cannot quite dispel the worthier ghosts of its past—the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, recently avowed America's commitment to the alliance, despite “America First,” in a speech in Tallinn.

In Europe, at least, some of the ghosts may be gradually dissipating. Germany's new government is willing to break with its past in sacrificing thrift for the imperatives of continental defense. It is also willing to put to rest some of the (self-serving) ghosts of guilt-based aversion to military spending. Sweden has set aside its romanticized history of neutrality for participation in an alliance, although not without misgivings. As one shrewd Swedish strategist put it, “There we were in our sailboat, the good sloop Nonalignment. A storm blew up, and we were delighted to be rescued by the mighty ocean liner SS NATO. The other passengers were wonderful, the bar excellent—and then we learned that there was a new captain who has decided he wants to play games of chicken with icebergs.”

“War has a way of masking the stage with scenery crudely daubed with fearsome apparitions,” Carl von Clausewitz wrote. Although it is true that we can never quite escape the ghosts, be they benign or malignant, that surround strategists, it is also necessary to lay many of them to rest, if only to find the ways and means to protect this and later generations from murderous madness. For Ukraine and the European future, this exorcism is a moderate sign of hope in a world that is indeed haunted by perfectly reasonable forebodings.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Instead of killing off faith, modernity has supercharged some of its most dramatic manifestations.

In Durham, North Carolina, just a few miles from major universities, teaching hospitals, and other temples of science, the Holy Spirit remains formidable. When I attended a gathering at Catch the Fire Church one Friday evening last year, a petite blond woman made her way down the aisle, laying her hand on heads and shoulders, calling on the Holy Spirit. Her magenta tunic glowed under the can lights. She breathed hard into her microphone. Here and there, the woman, a Toronto-based evangelist named Carol Arnott, paused to point a finger down a row of worshippers and shout, “Fire on them, Lord!” Knees buckled; people collapsed back into their seats.

As Arnott continued her circuit, a man in a hoodie—the “catcher”—followed closely behind, ready to help any person “slain in the Spirit.” One touch from her hand sent more supplicants falling to the floor. “Don't get up too soon,” Arnott urged one dazed individual lying on the carpet. “You're like a steak, marinating.” She preached as she walked, describing a vision in which Jesus gave her a bouquet of lilies of the valley and adorned her with a flowered crown and wedding veil. “The bridegroom is coming. Are you ready?” Arnott asked. It was hard to hear her over the moans and guffaws, the bursts of holy laughter.

Catch the Fire belongs to the fastest-growing group of Christians on the planet—charismatic Christians, who believe that the Holy Spirit empowers them to speak in tongues, heal, and prophesy, just as Jesus's first apostles did 2,000 years ago. By some measures, they represent more than half of the roughly 60 million U.S. adults who call themselves “born-again.” This flourishing and vigorously supernatural faith points to the paradox of the secular age: The modern era of declining church attendance has nurtured some of religion's most dramatic manifestations. Instead of killing off religion, secularism has supercharged its extraordinary elements.

Timothy Keller: American Christianity is due for a revival

Charismatic Christians aren't the only ones embracing a spirituality that might seem out of place in our modern, rationalist age. Eighty-seven percent of Americans subscribe to at least one New Age belief, such as karma, reincarnation, or telepathy. During my time researching charismatic Christianity for my new book, Spellbound, I also interviewed podcast bros who hawk ayahuasca in Silicon Valley and self-described spiritual coaches who offer treatments ranging from Reiki to reviewing their clients' past lives.

At a New Age congregation outside Denver, I attended a healing workshop on harnessing the invisible energies of the universe to treat cancer and arthritis, as well as a shamanic drum circle where a former software engineer named Greg led participants on a journey to the spirit world to meet their power animals. If this is a “secular age,” then perhaps we need to rethink what secularization means.

These thriving subcultures are, in part, proof that channeling the Holy Spirit or seeking an animal spirit guide doesn't carry the same stigma in America that such otherworldly adventuring once did. While I was visiting Catch the Fire, one pastor surveyed the auditorium full of chuckling, sprawling worshippers and declared that “we choose to look silly.” But he no longer has to worry—as Christians who spoke in tongues did a century ago—about police shutting down the worship service or local doctors asking a judge to declare the worshippers legally insane. Nowadays, Americans are more inclined to shrug off other people's theological eccentricities and save their purity tests for politics.

Charismatic Christians preach a message that is as much about letting go of inhibitions as submitting to the strictures of the Bible. Early in his ministry, Randy Clark, a pastor with long-standing connections to Catch the Fire Church, confessed to a friend that when he watched others get slain in the Spirit, he didn't feel anything special himself. The friend told him: “You just resist it. Next time, don't fake it, but don't fight it either. Just become a sail in the wind.” Clark followed the instructions, and the next time someone prayed for him, “I had a physical manifestation,” he told me. “It started in my right thumb. I saw it moving, and thought, That is weird. I could stop that. But I made a decision. I'm going to use my will to be open, to not stop anything, not work up anything.”

Openness to the Holy Spirit does not preclude adherence to orthodox religious teaching. Indeed, most charismatic churches subscribe to a traditional interpretation of the Bible, and plenty of Catholics—a distinctly doctrinal group—call themselves charismatic. Alpha, one of the most successful evangelistic enterprises in the world today, emphasizes the tangible experience of God's presence alongside classical arguments for the truth of Christianity. Founded in 1977 by a charismatic Anglican parish in London, Alpha evolved into an 11-week course on the basics of Christianity that is now available in 112 languages worldwide and culminates in a prayer-filled “Holy Spirit weekend.”

“People who have been quite skeptical often experience something powerful, and then they try to figure out what happened,” Graham Tomlin, an Anglican priest who has been involved with Alpha for many years, told me. “As a means of evangelism, this is not primarily a set of programs, or the explanation of doctrines—although it does that—but at its heart, an invitation to encounter God.”

From a certain angle, these groups are merely taking mainstream aspirations to their supernatural conclusion. The rising popularity of Spirit-filled worship and emphasis on personal contact with God has paralleled secular society's exaltation of private experience over tradition or reasoned argument. Charismatic worship began surging across Protestant and Catholic churches in the 1960s, in tandem with pop psychology's increasing stress on “self-actualization” and authenticity as the primary conditions of happiness. Growing interest in individualistic, experiential religion also dovetails with the erosion of Americans' trust in established institutions and expertise over the past half century.

From the February 2025 issue: The Army of God comes out of the shadows

Some religious leaders are wary of taking this subjective impulse too far. “The emphasis on feelings and emotions is a good one, but the danger is that it starts to counter objective truth. It becomes: ‘I feel it, therefore it's my truth,'” says Nicky Gumbel, an Anglican priest who led the global expansion of the Alpha course and remains involved with the program. “Lived experience becomes the arbiter of everything.”

Yet self-optimization is the riptide of American culture. It pulls hard against any traditional mandate to find and proclaim universal truth. At the New Age congregation I visited in Denver, the minister preached that all humans should claim their “unique, authentic, God-expressed self.” On another occasion, a spiritual coach told me: “I've done the new-moon and the full-moon ceremony. I've practiced with crystals quite a bit and sage, sweat lodges. I've done so many things, just trying to find my way, what feels right.”

Understanding this cultural landscape requires resisting the temptation to reduce these groups to their voting patterns. Of course, many New Age spiritual experimenters would clash with charismatic Christians on a range of moral questions and policy issues. But the default culture-war rubric disguises the deeper, pre-political impulses that these varieties of American religion have in common: a desire for tangible contact with divine power, and trust in personal experience over so-called experts. Together, these attitudes explain the country's politics better than any theory resting on blue-versus-red narratives.

This combination of spiritual hunger and distrust of elite authority invites a certain type of leader. Over the past decade, Donald Trump has drawn supporters into a story about America's breakdown and recovery that is more spiritual than political. He is the president of an anti-institutional, tradition-skeptical, experience-worshipping age, when fewer Americans go to church but plenty of them follow gurus on YouTube. The feelings of frustration and grievance that a candidate personifies are more important than his policy platform.

His message that institutions are weak, corrupt, and deserve no loyalty; his tacit promise that you can imagine prosperity into existence regardless of what the economists say; his personal domination of the Republican Party: All of this has succeeded because public confidence in every institution, not just traditional churches, has collapsed. That cynicism extends to the workplace—the institution that makes the greatest stamp on most people's daily life. Only 21 percent of U.S. employees strongly affirm trust in their organization's leaders. Meanwhile, the social habits that we associate with a more devout, less tolerant age—policing boundaries, banishing heretics, expecting divine retribution to rain down on your enemies—have migrated from churches to politics. Many Americans are ready to put their faith in a political savior who says he was “saved by God.”

From the January/February 2024 issue: My father, my faith, and Donald Trump

Even as partisan politics have come to display the dynamics of fundamentalist sects, there are signs that the 60-year slide of organized religion in the West has slowed. And it might be starting a quiet recovery. After steadily rising for 20 years, the number of Americans who say they have no religious affiliation seems to have leveled off. More young men are going to church, and many of them are joining Catholic or Orthodox congregations. In England and Wales, Gen Z is leading a spike in church attendance, which has risen from 8 to 12 percent of the population in just six years.

During my reporting, I kept meeting people who had grown tired of cynicism and DIY meaning-making and made their way into ancient institutions and supernatural faith—such as Christine Flynn, who lives with her family outside Milwaukee. She spent her young-adult years perusing the New Age sections at bookstores and seeking self-actualization through her own instincts. “I figured I'd do the research, and wherever my thoughts landed, that was correct. I didn't need to talk to anyone,” she told me. But after becoming a mother, and watching her atheist husband explore Christianity, she “got tired of being so cynical.” She began reading the books on Christianity that her husband left lying around. Now a mom of six who homeschools her kids, Flynn published a memoir last year about her path into the Catholic Church.

Conversions such as Flynn's are part of a global story. Both Christianity and Islam are exploding outside the West. Worldwide, the proportion of people who identify as atheists—about 7 percent, according to some studies—will likely decrease in coming years. Nicky Gumbel, the Anglican priest who works with Alpha, told me that the program has found some of its greatest success in Chinese-speaking communities that are reckoning with a history of communism. “Pure secularism doesn't satisfy,” he says. In a globalized society such as the United States, prophecies of the long-term collapse of religious faith and practice seem premature.

Humans are fundamentally religious, in the sense that we yearn to impose order on the chaos of existence and worship some source of ultimate meaning. As the Catholic philosopher Charles Taylor wrote in his 1989 book, Sources of the Self, everyone aspires to a sense of fullness—a “pattern of higher action” that connects their lives “with some greater reality or story.” He warned that “it would be a mistake to think that this kind of formulation has disappeared even for unbelievers in our world.” Secularization may reshape how we act on these instincts, but it has not eliminated them: Unbelievers will always have more in common with the Holy Rollers than they realize.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The fight over South Korea's democracy is also a fight over women's rights.

Opposition to women's rights has helped fuel authoritarian movements in Russia, Hungary, Brazil, and the United States. That the same is true in South Korea, which is holding an early presidential election tomorrow, is perhaps less well known. There, the role of anti-feminists is particularly stark, helping to put women's issues at the very center of the country's fraught contest.

To appreciate the stakes, recall that just a few months ago, South Korea nearly lost its democracy: On December 3, then-President Yoon Suk Yeol shut down the parliament, banned all political parties, and suspended the free press. His power grab was swiftly defeated by mass demonstrations and a heroic parliamentary effort—members climbed fences to reach the chamber, where they unanimously voted to lift martial law—but the shock remained. Why was a country known for technological prowess, slick horror films, and dreamy boy bands descending into chaos?

The answer lies in part with the country's struggle over women's rights. Even as South Korea has raced ahead economically, gender equality has lagged behind other indicators. Out of 146 countries indexed by the World Economic Forum, South Korea comes 112th in women's economic participation and 100th in women's educational attainment (only slightly better than Iran).

For longer than it has had a democracy, South Korea has had a women's-rights movement pressing to improve these conditions. In the late 1980s, a labor activist named Kwon In-sook filed charges against the government for sexual assault she allegedly suffered at a police station. Dozens of women's organizations came together to support her in a coalition known as the Korean Women's Associations United. KWAU wound up playing an important role in the country's democratic transition, and Kwon herself served as a member of parliament until last year.

Read: South Korea's crisis is nowhere near over

In recent decades, women's rights have advanced steadily, if slowly. Advocates successfully pushed for sexual- and domestic-violence legislation in the 1990s. In 1999, they managed to abolish a system that awarded extra points on civil-service exams to military veterans, who are overwhelmingly male due to South Korea's male-only conscription. They got rid of the hoju family-registration system, which automatically counted men as the heads of households.

But legislative advocacy has not eradicated violent crime against women, a grim reality that has spurred a particularly dramatic upsurge in women's activism in the past 10 years. In 2016, a woman was murdered near the world-famous Gangnam metro station in Seoul by a man who complained about being “ignored” by women. In 2019, a criminal network implicated K-pop stars, corrupt police officers, and elite businessmen in a slew of crimes—among them, administering date-rape drugs and nonconsensually filming sexual encounters to distribute online. South Korean feminists have demonstrated against gender violence and objected to its glorification in popular culture. In 2015, for example, Maxim Korea featured a “bad guy” theme on its cover: A man was shown smoking by his car with a woman's legs, bound at the ankles, jutting out of his trunk. “Girls like ‘bad guys'?” the story demanded. “This is a real bad guy. Are you dying to love it?”

In recent years, some elements of the South Korean feminist movement have attracted attention for their radicalism; others, for their media-savvy tactics. Adherents to the 4B movement refuse to date, have sex with men, marry them, or have children (these tenets all start with bi, which roughly means “no” in Korean). In 2018, in an action called Escape the Corset, women threw out cosmetic products and cut their hair—making headlines in a country where about a third of women in their 20s have had plastic surgery, largely to meet exacting beauty standards. That same year, a news anchor became the first woman in her field to wear eyeglasses on major-network TV.

The ever-higher profile of the feminist movement has inspired right-wing forces to present themselves as the champions of disgruntled men. The story is a familiar one: South Korea has some of the classic problems of an industrialized society, including a housing crisis affecting young people, a declining birth rate, and a short supply of well-paying jobs. Anti-feminist forces have galvanized supporters by blaming these problems on women and feminists.

The gambit has worked. In 2016, anti-feminists went after the actor Kim Jayeon, who voiced one of the characters in the popular Korean video game Closers, because she wore a T-shirt that read girls don't need a prince. A backlash among gamers led the company to fire her. The episode spoke to a broader phenomenon in South Korean society. According to one poll, a whopping 79 percent of men now believe they are being discriminated against because of their gender.

Much as Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro did in 2016 and 2018, respectively, Yoon capitalized on men's grievances in his 2022 run for president, using anti-feminism as a cudgel against the outgoing center-left president. In his campaign, Yoon promised to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. He repeatedly claimed that South Korea did not have a misogyny or gender-violence problem. His wife, Kim Keon-hee, mocked victims of sexual assault in a highly circulated YouTube interview. Gender issues became central to the campaign, and the young male voters Yoon attracted formed a base of support as he swung toward authoritarianism.

Read: South Korea's warning for Washington

Yoon was impeached after his aborted December coup, but South Korea's political crisis did not end there. Only on April 4, when the constitutional court upheld his impeachment, was Yoon formally removed from office. His party is in turmoil over his legacy and only recently settled on its candidate for tomorrow's election. The Democratic Party is running Lee Jae-myung, the same candidate Yoon faced in 2022, and he is now the front-runner.

Lee mostly shied away from women's issues when he ran against Yoon in 2022, but this year, he has promised to empower the gender-equality ministry. In the past, he has rebuked Yoon for claiming that there is no gender inequality in South Korea; he has also promised to reduce the gender-wage gap, strengthen laws against stalking and dating violence, offer free HPV vaccines to adolescents, and establish a system for reporting and monitoring businesses with discriminatory employment practices. Feminists will likely support him to prevent the right's return to power. Kim Jae-yeon of the Progressive Party ran to become “South Korea's first feminist president,” but she ended her campaign on May 9, asserting that the priority should be to “deter far-right insurrectionist power from seizing presidential authority again.” She has endorsed Lee.

Do voters want Democrats to fight “corporate power” or red tape? Bad question.

by  Eric Levitz

In the months since Kamala Harris's defeat, Democrats have debated the party's political and policy mistakes. This argument has centered in part on (Vox co-founder) Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson's bestselling book, Abundance. Those political columnists argue that Democrats have failed to deliver material plenty: Blue states don't provide their residents with adequate housing, and federal Democrats have struggled to build anything on time and budget. Klein and Thompson attribute these failures partly to flawed zoning restrictions and environmental review laws.

In making this case, they echoed the analysis of many other commentators, policy wonks, and activist groups, while also lending their ideology tendency a name: abundance liberalism.

Some on the left distrust this movement, seeing it as a scheme for reducing progressive influence over the Democratic Party — and workers' power in the American economy. In this view, Democrats must choose between pursuing abundance reforms and “populist” ones. The party can either take on red tape or corporate greed. 

A new poll from Demand Progress, a progressive nonprofit, suggests that the party should opt for the latter.

The survey presented voters with a hypothetical Democratic candidate who argues that ‬America's “big problem is ‘bottlenecks' that make it harder to produce housing, expand energy‬ production, or build new roads and bridges.” The candidate goes on to note, “Frequently these bottlenecks take the form of‬‭ well-intended regulations meant to give people a voice or to protect the environment — but‬‭ these regulations are exploited by organized interest groups and community groups to slow‬ things down.” 

The lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.

It then presented an alternative Democrat who contends that “The big problem is that big corporations have way too much power over our economy and our‬ government.” 

By a 42.8 to 29.2 percent margin, voters preferred the populist Democrat.

This is unsurprising on a couple levels. First, advocacy organizations rarely release polls that show voters disagreeing with their views. Demand Progress's mission is to “fight corporate power” and “break up monopolies.” It did not set out to disinterestedly gauge public opinion, but to advance a factional project. And this is reflected in the survey's wording. The poll embeds the mention of a trade-off in its “abundance” message (signaling that the candidate would give people less “voice” and the environment, less protection) but not in its anti-corporate one. Had the survey's hypothetical populist promised to fight “well-intentioned, pro-business policies meant to create jobs and spur innovation,” their message might have fared less well.

This said, I think it's almost certainly true that populist rhetoric is more politically resonant than technocratic arguments about supply-side “bottlenecks.” According to the Democratic data firm Blue Rose Research, Harris's best testing ad in 2024 included a pledge to “crack down” on “price gougers” and “landlords who are charging too much.”

But that doesn't have much bearing on whether Democrats should embrace abundance reforms for two reasons. First, the political case for those reforms rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal. And second, Democrats don't actually need to choose between pursuing abundance liberalism and populism — if by “populism,” one means a politics focused on redistributing wealth and power from the few to the many. 

The Demand Progress poll aims to refute an argument that Abundance does not make. Klein and Thompson do not claim that politicians who promise to combat regulatory “bottlenecks” will outperform those who vow to fight “corporations.” And I have not seen any other advocate of zoning liberalization or permitting reform say anything like that.

Rather, the political case for those policies primarily concerns their real-world consequences, rather than their oratorical verve. 

The starting point for that case is a diagnosis of the Democratic Party's governance failures. Klein and Thompson spotlight several:

Klein and Thompson attribute these results partly to zoning restrictions and environmental review laws. The former prohibit the construction of apartments on roughly 70 percent of America's residential land, while the latter empower well-heeled interests to obstruct infrastructure projects through lawsuits.

Abundance argues that this is a political problem for Democrats in at least three ways: First, the party's conspicuous failure to contain the cost-of-living in New York and California undermines its reputation for economic governance nationally. Second, the public sector's inability to build anything efficiently abets conservative narratives about the follies of big government. Third, and most concretely, Americans are responding to high housing costs in blue states by moving to red ones — a migration pattern that's about to make it much harder for Democrats to win the Electoral College. After the 2030 census, electoral votes will be reapportioned based on population shifts. If current trends persist, California, Illinois, and New York will lose Electoral College votes while Florida and Texas gain them. As a result, a Democrat could win every blue state in 2032 — along with Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — and still lose the presidency.

Klein and Thompson therefore reason that enacting their proposed reforms will aid Democrats politically by improving the party's reputation for economic management, boosting confidence in the public sector's efficacy, and increasing blue states' populations (and thus, their representation in Congress and the Electoral College). 

Therefore, you can't refute the political argument for “abundance” policies with a messaging poll. Rather, to do so, you need to show 1) that “abundance” reforms will not actually make housing, energy, and infrastructure more plentiful, or 2) that making those goods more plentiful won't actually increase support for the Democratic Party, or 3) that people will keep moving away from blue states and toward red ones, even if the former start building more housing. 

For the record, I think the substantive case for the abundance agenda is stronger than the political one. I'm confident that legalizing the construction of apartment buildings in inner-ring suburbs will increase the supply of housing. I'm less sure that doing so will win the Democratic Party votes. A lot of Americans are homeowners who don't want tall buildings (and/or, lots of nonaffluent people) in their municipalities. But that isn't the argument that Demand Progress is making.

The Demand Progress survey is premised on the notion that Democrats must choose between an “abundance” agenda and a “populist” one. But this is mostly false. 

There is no inherent tension between vigorously enforcing antitrust laws and relaxing restrictions on multifamily housing construction. To the contrary, there's arguably a philosophical link between those two endeavors: Both entail promoting greater competition, so as to erode the pricing power of property holders. (When zoning laws preempt the construction of apartment buildings, renters have fewer options to choose from. That reduces competition between landlords, and enables them to charge higher prices.)

More fundamentally, abundance liberalism is in direct conflict with traditional environmentalism.

More broadly, abundance is compatible with increasing working people's living standards and economic power. The more housing that a city builds, the more property taxes that it can collect — and thus, the more social welfare benefits it can provide to ordinary people. And this basic principle applies more generally: If you increase economic growth through regulatory reforms, then you'll have more wealth to redistribute, whether through union contracts or the welfare state.

This isn't to say that there are no tradeoffs between “abundance” reforms and economic progressivism, as some understand that ideology. For example, individual labor unions sometimes support restricting the supply of socially useful goods — such as housing or hotels — for self-interested reasons. Some populists might counsel reflexive deference to the demands of such unions. Abundance liberals generally would not. But policies that make a tiny segment of workers better off — at the expense of a much larger group of working people — are not pro-labor in the best sense of that term. 

More fundamentally, abundance liberalism is in direct conflict with traditional environmentalism. The first aims to make it easier to build green infrastructure, even at the cost of making it harder to obstruct fossil fuel extraction. Many environmental organizations have the opposite priority. Yet fighting to limit America's supply of oil and gas — even if this means making infrastructure more expensive and scarce — is not an especially populist cause, even if one deems it a worthy one. 

Ultimately, abundance liberalism is less about how Democrats should message than about how they should govern. It's useful to know whether a particular analysis of the party's governance failures is politically appealing. But it's more important to know whether that analysis is accurate. Democrats can rail against corporate malfeasance on the campaign trail, no matter what positions they take on zoning or permitting. If they operate from a false understanding of why blue states struggle to build adequate housing and infrastructure, however, they will fail working people.

Critics of abundance liberalism should therefore focus on its substance. To their credit, many progressive skeptics have done this. I think their arguments are unconvincing (and plan to address them in the future). But they at least clarify the terms of the intra-left debate over abundance. Demand Progress's poll, by contrast, only obscures them.

﻿To save the humanities, we need to rethink our assumptions about AI — and education.

by  Sigal Samuel

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form or email sigal.samuel@vox.com. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I am a university teaching assistant, leading discussion sections for large humanities lecture classes. This also means I grade a lot of student writing — and, inevitably, see a lot of AI writing too. 

Of course, many of us are working on developing assignments and pedagogies to make that less tempting. But as a TA, I only have limited ability to implement these policies. And in the meantime, AI-generated writing is so ubiquitous that to take course policy on it seriously, or even to escalate every suspected instance to the professor who runs the course, would be to make dozens of accusations, some of them false positives, for basically every assignment.

I believe in the numinous, ineffable value of a humanities education, but I'm also not going to convince stressed 19-year-olds of that value by cracking down hard on something everyone does. How do I think about the ethics of enforcing the rules of an institution that they don't take seriously, or letting things slide in the name of building a classroom that feels less like an obstacle to circumvent?

Dear Troubled Teacher, 

I know you said you believe in the “ineffable value of a humanities education,” but if we want to actually get clear on your dilemma, that ineffable value must be effed! 

So: What is the real value of a humanities education? 

Looking at the modern university, one might think the humanities aren't so different from the STEM fields. Just as the engineering department or the math department justifies its existence by pointing to the products it creates — bridge designs, weather forecasts — humanities departments nowadays justify their existence by noting that their students create products, too: literary interpretations, cultural criticism, short films. 

But let's be real: It's the neoliberalization of the university that has forced the humanities into that weird contortion. That's never what they were supposed to be. Their real aim, as the philosopher Megan Fritts writes, is “the formation of human persons.” 

In other words, while the purpose of other departments is ultimately to create a product, a humanities education is meant to be different, because the student herself is the product. She is what's getting created and recreated by the learning process.

This vision of education — as a pursuit that's supposed to be personally transformative — is what Aristotle proposed back in Ancient Greece. He believed the real goal was not to impart knowledge, but to cultivate the virtues: honesty, justice, courage, and all the other character traits that make for a flourishing life. 

But because flourishing is devalued in our hypercapitalist society, you find yourself caught between that original vision and today's product-based, utilitarian vision. And students sense — rightly! — that generative AI proves the utilitarian vision for the humanities is a sham. 

As one student said to his professor at New York University, in an effort to justify using AI to do his work for him, “You're asking me to go from point A to point B, why wouldn't I use a car to get there?” It's a completely logical argument — as long as you accept the utilitarian vision. 

The real solution, then, is to be honest about what the humanities are for: You're in the business of helping students with the cultivation of their character. 

I know, I know: Lots of students will say, “I don't have time to work on cultivating my character! I just need to be able to get a job!”

It's totally fair for them to be focusing on their job prospects. But your job is to focus on something else — something that will help them flourish in the long run, even if they don't fully see the value in it now. 

Your job is to be their Aristotle. 

For the Ancient Greek philosopher, the mother of all virtues was phronesis, or practical wisdom. And I'd argue there's nothing more useful you can do for your students than help them cultivate this virtue, which is made more, not less, relevant by the advent of AI.

Practical wisdom goes beyond just knowing general rules — “don't lie,” for example — and applying them mechanically like some sort of moral robot. It's about knowing how to make good judgments when faced with the complex, dynamic situations life throws at you. Sometimes that'll actually mean violating a classic rule (in certain cases, you should lie!). If you've honed your practical wisdom, you'll be able to discern the morally salient features of a particular situation and come up with a response that's well-attuned to that context. 

This is exactly the sort of deliberation that students will need to be good at as they step into the wider world. The breakneck pace of technological innovation means they're going to have to choose, again and again and again, how to make use of emerging technologies — and how not to. The best training they can get now is training in how to wisely make this type of choice. 

Unfortunately, that's exactly what using generative AI in the classroom threatens to short-circuit, because it removes something incredibly valuable: friction. 

Encountering friction is how we give our cognitive muscles a workout. Taking it out of the picture makes things easier in the short term, but in the long term, it can lead to intellectual deskilling, where our cognitive muscles gradually become weaker for lack of use. 

“Practical wisdom is built up by practice just like all the other virtues, so if you don't have the opportunity to reason and don't have practice in deliberating about certain things, you won't be able to deliberate well later,” philosopher of technology Shannon Vallor told me last year. “We need a lot of cognitive exercise in order to develop practical wisdom and retain it. And there is reason to worry about cognitive automation depriving us of the opportunity to build and retain those cognitive muscles.” 

So, how do you help your students retain and build their phronesis? You add friction back in, by giving them as many opportunities as possible to practice deliberating and choosing. 

If I were designing the curriculum, I wouldn't do that by adopting a strict “no AI” policy. Instead, I'd be honest with students about the real benefit of the humanities and about why mindless AI cheating would be cheating themselves out of that benefit. Then, I'd offer them two choices when it comes time to write an essay: They can either write it with help from AI, or without. Both are totally fine. 

But if they do get help from AI, they have to also write an in-class reflection piece, explaining why they chose to use a chatbot and how they think it changed their thinking and learning process. I'd make it shorter than the original assignment but longer than a paragraph, so it forces them to develop the very reasoning skills they were trying to avoid using.

As a TA, you could suggest this to professors, but they may not go for it. Unfortunately, you've got limited agency here (unless you're willing to risk your job or walk away from it). All you can do in such a situation is exercise the agency you do have. So use every bit of it.

Since you lead discussion sections, you're well-placed to prompt your students to work their cognitive muscles in conversation. You could even stage a debate about AI: Assign half of them to argue the case for using chatbots to write papers and half of them to argue the opposite.

If a professor insists on a strict “no AI” policy, and you encounter essays that seem clearly AI-written, you may have little choice but to report them. But if there's room for doubt about a given essay, you might err on the side of leniency if the student has engaged very thoughtfully in the discussion. At least then you know they've achieved the most important aim.

None of this is easy. I feel for you and all other educators who are struggling in this confusing environment. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some educators are suffering from moral injury, a psychological condition that arises when you feel you've been forced to violate your own values.

But maybe it can comfort you to remember that this is much bigger than you. Generative AI is an existential threat to a humanities education as currently constituted. Over the next few years, humanities departments will have to paradigm-shift or perish. If they want to survive, they'll need to get brutally honest about their true mission. For now, from your pre-paradigm-shift perch, all you can do is make the choices that are left for you to make.

Our economy isn't built for the biological clock. But it can be.

by  Rachel Cohen

Everyone should have the right to decide if and when they have children. Yet over the past 50 years, the United States has built an economy that increasingly works against fertility — demanding more years in school and longer hours at work for people, especially women, in the years when it is biologically easiest for them to have children, and concentrating wealth and income among those past their reproductive prime. 

As a result, American schools and workplaces are particularly ill-suited for supporting those who hope to start families earlier than average.

 “If I were to complain about how society ‘has wronged me as a woman,' it would be that it has treated my limited ‘fertility time' with extreme disregard,” wrote Ruxandra Teslo, a genomics PhD student, recently on Substack. “At each step of the way I was encouraged to ‘be patient,' do more training, told that ‘things will figure themselves out,' even when I wanted and could have speedrun through things.”

The average age of a new mom is now 27.5, up from age 21 in 1970. I had no interest in having kids in my early twenties, but there are certainly reasons others might want that: Fertility decreases with age, and some find it easier to keep up with young children when they themselves are younger and have more energy. Others hope for larger families so may need to start conceiving earlier, or may prioritize making sure their own parents have many years to spend with grandkids. 

Of course, discussing reproductive timelines is fraught. Having others invoke the fact that women experience a decline in fertility with age feels intrusive and insensitive. And the conversation is even trickier today, when anti-abortion activists are pushing a conservative pro-baby agenda from the highest echelons of government and the Heritage Foundation is putting out literature blaming falling birth rates on too many people going to graduate school. (The evidence for that is very weak.)

Yet it's precisely in such moments that progressive leaders should offer clear alternatives that both respect women's autonomy and ensure people can make less constrained choices. 

If mainstream feminism ignores the barriers to early parenthood, the right will be all too eager to fill the void. “If the so-called feminists, as long as they play it by the elite rules, refuse to take seriously what [we] can do to support young families, then the right can move in and say, ‘You might as well give up on your stupid ideas and career aspirations,'” marriage historian Stephanie Coontz told me. 

Not everyone wants to become a parent, but most women do still say they wish to have children one day. If we're serious about reproductive justice, then it's a mistake to ignore how our schools and workplaces have evolved to be broadly hostile to both fertility and parenthood. Having kids at a younger age is not inherently better — but for those who want to do it, the economy shouldn't be working against them at every step.

Many women believe, correctly, that college and graduate education are important paths not only for their own financial well-being, but also to afford raising kids in a country that offers so little support to families. The idea that people can just up and abandon higher education to have kids, per the Heritage Foundation, isn't serious.

“We've just done so much to obscure the reality and to make it seem like, oh, moms are asking for too much, or they're postponing too long, or maybe they shouldn't be going to school so much,” said Jennifer Glass, a sociologist at University of Texas Austin who studies fertility and gender. “What an idiotic thing to say. The only way that women can get wages that are at all comparable to what's necessary to raise a family is by getting a college degree.”

Yet the US has built one of the longest, most expensive educational pipelines in the world. 

One reason many American students take longer to finish undergraduate degrees (or don't finish at all) is because of financial pressures that students abroad don't face. 

Nations like Germany, France, and Norway offer free or heavily subsidized university education, while others, including the UK and Australia, have manageable, easily navigable income-based repayment systems. American students are more likely to be juggling multiple jobs alongside coursework, stretching the time to graduation.

The timeline stretches even longer for medical, legal, and doctoral degrees — tacking on years of extra training and credentialing that aren't required elsewhere. 

“There's been an increase in the number of years of schooling that is totally unnecessary,” Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and Nobel Prize winner, told me, pointing to, among other factors, the explosion of post-docs and pre-docs, plus pressure for applicants to acquire some work experience before even beginning their graduate studies. 

“I went to graduate school immediately after college, and schools like UChicago and MIT had rules then that if you were there for more than four years, you paid tuition, so that incentivized people to finish,” she said.

When educational timelines keep stretching with no structural support for parenting, the result is predictable: some people delay having children — or abandon those plans entirely.

This isn't to say there are no parents on university campuses. There are roughly 3 million undergraduates — one in five college students — in the US today who have kids. But student parents are too often rendered invisible because most colleges don't collect data on them and harbor outdated assumptions about who even seeks higher education. 

“Colleges and universities still cater to what is considered ‘traditional students' — so 18- to 24-year-olds who are getting financial assistance from their parents,” said Jennifer Turner, a sociologist at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. 

Student parents are far less likely to be receiving financial help from their own families than students of the same age and background without kids — and in general they're more likely to struggle to afford basic needs. But most campuses neglect their unique challenges and fail to provide them with resources like on-campus housing, kid-friendly spaces, and child care support. 

The Trump administration's new budget proposal calls for gutting the only federal program that helps student parents with child care. And while pregnant students are entitled to some federal protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title IX, in practice many students never even learn about them, or face intense stigma for using them.

For graduate students in particular, there's no shortage of examples of students receiving both implicit and explicit signals to delay childbearing. Research found women were twice as likely as men to cite child care and parenting as reasons for leaving academia. 

Whether or not women want to have children in their early or mid-twenties, many feel they can't — because the career paths they pursue require longer routes to stability. 

Women are more often funneled into professions that demand extra time, whether through extended schooling, slower advancement, or the need to earn extra credentials to prove themselves. Many fields where women are concentrated, like education, social work, psychology, and nursing, require graduate training for higher-paying roles. In contrast, men are more likely to enter skilled trades or businesses where higher earnings are possible without advanced degrees.

Goldin, the economist, pointed to the problem of the “rat race equilibrium” — where individuals over-invest accumulating credentials not because doing so is intrinsically valuable, but because everyone else is doing the same. In this situation, falling behind the pack carries high costs.

“People want a great job, so they stay in graduate school ‘too long.' Firms want the best lawyer, so they keep associates for ‘too long.' I don't know what the optimal length is. But I do know that the addition of so many more years means that women will be more discouraged than will men,” she told me.

These extended educational timelines feed directly into jobs that are also not designed to support parenting during a woman's prime childbearing years. Early-career workers typically earn less, have more precarious roles and rigid schedules, and often face more pressure to be fully available to employers to prove their commitment and worth.

Some then move on to what Goldin calls “greedy careers”: Law firms, consulting companies, and hospitals that demand total availability, rewarding those who can work weekends and penalizing those who seek more predictable schedules. For many parents it's a double bind: the educational trajectories and high-paying jobs that make raising kids affordable are often the same ones with demands that make balancing family life nearly impossible.

Fertility tech hasn't yet conquered the biological clock, but we did build this economy — which means we can rebuild it differently. 

Advocating for more efficient and more affordable education isn't a retreat from academic rigor, but a clear-eyed confrontation with institutions that remain indifferent at best to having children. The most forward-thinking places will see that compressed, focused educational paths aren't diluting standards, but respecting the fullness of human lives and creating systems where intellectual achievement doesn't demand reproductive sacrifice.

Exactly how to help students manage timelines will vary. For those looking at careers in math and science, for example, there may be opportunities to take advanced courses in high school. Others would benefit from more financial aid, or using experiential learning credit, or enrolling in accelerated BA/MA programs. Some employers should be rethinking their mandates for college degrees at all.

But even with educational reforms, parents would still face legal barriers that other groups don't. It's still legal in many cases to discriminate against parents in hiring or housing. Making parents a protected class would be a straightforward step toward making parenthood more compatible with economic security. 

Stronger labor regulations could also curb workplace coercion, and policies like those in Scandinavia — which allow parents to reduce their work hours when raising young children — could make it easier to balance kids with holding down a job.

The rise of remote work offers additional paths forward, and expanding it could reduce the stark either/or choices many prospective parents face. And there are other policy ideas that could make parenthood more affordable even when people are early in their career. Other high-income countries offer parents monthly child allowances, baby bonuses, subsidized child care, and paid parental leave. The US could follow suit — and go further — by investing in affordable housing, reducing the cost of college, and decoupling health care from employment. 

For now, our current system abdicates responsibility. As Glass points out, while parents are paying more to have children, it's employers and governments that reap the benefits of those adult workers and taxpayers, without shouldering the decades-long costs of training and raising them. 

“What no one wants to face is that 150 years ago, when everyone lived on farms, having children did not make you poor, but they do today,” said Glass. “Children used to benefit their parents, they were part of the dominion of the patriarch, and when children did well the patriarch benefited. Now it's employers and governments who benefit from well-raised children.” 

I understand the reluctance to have these conversations. We don't want the government poking around in our bedrooms, especially when some lawmakers are already on a mission to restrict reproductive freedom. It's tempting to say policymakers and institutions should just shut up about any further discussion regarding having kids.

But that's not serving people, either. Many other countries already confront these challenges with much more deliberate care. Honest conversations about fertility don't need to be about telling women when or whether to have children — they should be about removing the artificial barriers that make it feel impossible to have kids at different stages of life.

This would all certainly be much easier if men stepped up to take these pressures more seriously. “If men felt as compelled as women to take time off, if men were experiencing the same thing, I think we'd get a lot more creative,” said Coontz. 

We should continue investing in fertility technology, and expanding access to those options for people who want to delay childbearing or may need help conceiving. But IVF and egg freezing are never going to be the right tools for everyone, and people deserve the support to have children as they study and enter the workforce, too. Biology isn't destiny, but we shouldn't ignore it.

﻿Is flying into Newark safe?

by  Devan Schwartz and  Sean Rameswaram

Air travel is such a common part of modern life that it's easy to forget all the miraculous technology and communication infrastructure required to do it safely. But recent crashes, including near Washington, DC, and in San Diego — not to mention multiple near misses — have left many fliers wondering: Is it still safe to fly?

That concern is particularly acute at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, which has recently experienced several frightening incidents and near misses in as radio and radar systems have gone dark. This has left an under-staffed and overworked group of air traffic controllers to manage a system moving at a frenetic pace with no room for error.

Andrew Tangel, an aviation reporter for the Wall Street Journal, recently spoke to Jonathan Stewart, a Newark air traffic controller. When Stewart saw two planes potentially headed for a crash, he was worried that radar and radio communication systems might fail as they had days earlier.

According to Tangel, Stewart “sent off a fiery memo to his managers, complaining about how he was put in that situation, which he felt he was being set up for failure.” Stewart now is taking trauma leave because of the stresses of the job. After many delayed flights, United Airlines just announced that it will move some of its flights to nearby John F. Kennedy International Airport. 

To understand how we arrived at our current aviation crisis, Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram spoke with Darryl Campbell, an aviation safety writer for The Verge.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You've probably seen some of the news articles about it, and it's really only in the last couple months because everybody's been paying attention to aviation safety that people are really saying, Oh my gosh!

Newark airport is losing the ability to see airplanes. They're losing radar for minutes at a time, and that's not something you want to hear when you have airplanes flying towards each other at 300 miles an hour. So it is rightfully very concerning. But the thing is, what's been happening at Newark has actually been happening for almost a decade and a half in fits and starts. It'll get really bad, and then it'll get better again. 

Now we're seeing a combination of air traffic control problems; we're seeing a combination of infrastructure problems, and they've got a runway that's entirely shut down. And the way that I think about it is, while Newark is its own special case today, all of the problems that it's facing, other than the runway, are problems that every single airport in the entire country is going to be facing over the next five to 10 years, and so we're really getting a preview of what's going to happen if we don't see some drastic change in the way that the air traffic control system is maintained.

We heard about some of these issues after the crash at DCA outside Washington. What exactly is going on with air traffic controllers?

The first problem is just one of staff retention and training. On the one hand, the air traffic control system and the people who work there are a pretty dedicated bunch, but it takes a long time to get to the point where you're actually entrusted with airplanes. It can be up to four years of training from the moment that you decide, Okay, I want to be an air traffic controller. 

Couple that with the fact that these are government employees and like many other agencies, they haven't really gotten the cost-of-living increases to keep pace with the actual cost of living, especially in places like the New York and New Jersey area, where it's just gone up way faster than in the rest of the country.

This is bad at Newark, but you say it promises to get bad everywhere else too. 

The cost of living is still outpacing the replacement level at a lot of these air traffic control centers. And the washout rate is pretty high. We've seen the average staffing level at a lot of American airports get down below 85, 80 percent, which is really where the FAA wants it to be, and it's getting worse over time. 

At Newark in particular, it's down to about 58 percent as of the first quarter of this year. This is an emergency level of staffing at a baseline. And then on top of that, you have — in order to keep the airplanes going — people working mandatory overtime, mandatory six-days-a-week shifts, and that's accelerating that burnout that naturally happens. There's a lot of compression and a lot of bad things happening independently, but all at the same time in that kind of labor system that's really making it difficult to both hire and retain qualified air traffic controllers.

These sound like very fixable problems, Darryl. Are we trying to fix them? I know former reality TV star and Fox News correspondent — and transportation secretary, in this day and age — Sean Duffy has been out to Newark. He said this: “What we are going to do when we get the money. We have the plan. We actually have to build a brand new state-of-the-art, air traffic control system.”

To his credit, they have announced some improvements on it. They've announced a lot of new funding for the FAA. They've announced an acceleration of hiring, but it's just a short-term fix. 

To put it in context, the FAA's budget usually allocates about $1.7 billion in maintenance fees every year. And so they've announced a couple billion more dollars, but their backlog already is $5.2 billion in maintenance. And these are things like replacing outdated systems, replacing buildings that are housing some of these radars, things that you really need to just get the system to where it should be operating today, let alone get ahead of the maintenance things that are going to happen over the next couple of years. It's really this fight between the FAA and Congress to say, We're going to do a lot today to fix these problems.

And it works for a little while, but then three years down the road, the same problems are still occurring. You got that one-time shot of new money, but then the government cuts back again and again and again. And then you're just putting out one fire, but not addressing the root cause of why there's all this dry powder everywhere.

People are canceling their flights into or out of Newark, but there are also all these smaller accidents we're seeing, most recently in San Diego, where six people were killed when a Cessna crashed. How should people be feeling about that?

There's really no silver bullet and all the choices are not great to actively bad at baseline. Number one is you get the government to pay what it actually costs to run the air traffic control system. That empirically has not happened for decades, so I don't know that we're going to get to do it, especially under this administration, which is focused on cutting costs.

The second thing is to pass on fees to fliers themselves. And it's just like the conversation that Walmart's having with tariffs — they don't want to do it. When they try to pass it on to the customer, President Trump yells at them, and it's just not a great situation. 

The third option is to reduce the number of flights in the sky. Part of this is that airlines are competing to have the most flights, the most convenient schedules, the most options. That's led to this logjam at places like Newark, where you really have these constraints on it. Right before all of this stuff happens, Newark was serving about 80 airplanes an hour, so 80 landings and takeoffs. Today, the FAA's actually started to admit restrictions on it, and now it's closer to 56 flights an hour, and that's probably the level that it can actually handle and not have these issues where you have planes in danger.

But no airline wants to hear, Hey, you have to cut your flight schedule. We saw that with United: Their CEO was saying that the air traffic controllers who took trauma leave had “walked off the job,” which seemed to suggest that he didn't think they should be taking trauma leave because you have to have more planes coming in. That's a competitive disadvantage for him, but you also have to balance safety. It's difficult to understand. It costs a lot of money to fix. This is your textbook “why governments fail” case study and it's not really reassuring that in 24 hours I'm going to be in the middle of it again, trying to fly out of Newark.

Correction, June 2, 10:40 am ET: A previous version of this piece misstated what happened when Jonathan Stewart saw two planes potentially headed for a crash; he was worried that radar and radio communication systems might fail as they had days earlier.

Trump wants to blow a $3 trillion hole in the budget. The bond market is saying “no way.”

by  Dylan Matthews

To pass a law in the United States, you need to jump through a lot of hurdles. 

A bill has to first clear a committee in the House or Senate. (In the case of Republicans' tax legislation this year, its components had to clear 11 different committees.) The House Rules Committee has to agree for it to come to the floor for a vote. It has to pass that vote. In the Senate, it has to get 60 votes to beat a potential filibuster, or else obey a set of byzantine rules allowing it to pass with a simple majority.

But another entity gets a vote, an entity not mentioned in the Constitution or in congressional rules or even physically located in Washington, DC. That entity is the bond market, and right now, it is very pissed.

Currently, the US makes up for any budget deficits it incurs by issuing bonds of various durations to cover the difference. It auctions those bonds — essentially IOUs issued by the Treasury Department — on the open market, where investors (banks, hedge funds, foreign central banks, pension funds, etc.) can bid on them. 

To get them to bid, the US has to pay interest on the bond. And when the US borrows a lot, and especially if its fiscal policy indicates that the country may reach a point where it can't pay back what it owes, investors will demand to receive more interest to compensate for the risk of default. That means the US has to pay more every year to service its past debt, and those payments in turn become future debt. If the interest they demand is high enough, the result can be an economic downturn, an upward debt spiral, or both.

While politicians pay attention to all kinds of economic indicators, from the unemployment rate to the stock market, the bond market is a different and more powerful animal. The most famous quote about the bond market's power comes from former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville: “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” 

History is littered with cases of governments that were forced to abandon policies — or that even fell from power — because the bond market revolted. Just a few years ago in the UK, a mass sell-off by currency and bond traders forced the Tory government to abandon its plans for a massive deficit-ballooning tax cut and axe Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, before then-Prime Minister Liz Truss herself was forced to resign after just 45 days in office. Banks like Citigroup were openly declaring that unless the UK got a different prime minister, the markets would continue to punish it. That is power.

Now, Congress is weighing a reconciliation bill that would increase the deficit by at least $3 trillion over 10 years, and possibly closer to $5 trillion if some of its temporary components become permanent, as seems likely. This is a big increase in America's already substantial debt burden and markets are responding accordingly. Interest rates are heading higher, especially once you adjust for inflation. Countries once infamous for fiscal mismanagement — Greece, Spain, even Italy — can now borrow more cheaply than the United States can.

The US is not the UK; the bond market cannot depose a president the way it can a prime minister, simply because prime ministers are far easier to swap out. But that doesn't mean that the bond market is powerless over US policy. It has the ability to make this tax bill much, much more costly for the US government and economy, and that ability could be decisive in shaping where the legislation goes from here.

The US issues a lot of different kinds of debt, but the kind you should pay closest attention to are 10-year bonds. These reflect the market's views on the medium- to long-run trajectory of the government and economy, whereas 30-day or six-month bonds are much shorter-run indicators. The interest rate that's most informative about government policy and long-run prospects is the “real” rate, adjusted for inflation. If inflation is 4 percent, investors will probably add about 4 percentage points to the real interest rate to make sure their investment doesn't erode in value. The real rate thus reflects how much they expect to earn for essentially lending money to the US government in addition to just keeping up with overall prices.

Here's the 10-year, adjusting for inflation, since the start of President Donald Trump's first term:

In the aftermath of Covid, rates actually went negative after taking inflation into account. This is what's sometimes called the “flight to safety”: In times of crisis, investors often move away from risky assets like stocks and toward reliable, predictable ones, like US government bonds. That drives interest rates down, sometimes even below inflation.

But since 2023 or so, rates have been much higher. There's a saying, popularized by economist Scott Sumner, that one should “never reason from a price change”: Changes in the Treasury interest rate (or the price of borrowing) could be from any number of factors, so it's too simplistic to look at what happened and say “investors decided the US government became a riskier bet.”

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

That said, when Fed economists analyzed the spike that occurred in 2023, they concluded the spike in rates was indeed due to investors reacting to changing economic conditions: The US was issuing more debt, the Federal Reserve was tightening to try to control inflation, and future economic growth in the US was looking sluggish.

Other observers in the bond market have been sounding alarms, mostly citing excessive US borrowing. In 2023, Fitch, one of the three big credit rating agencies that issues risk evaluations of bonds, downgraded US debt, which previously had a perfect AAA rating. On May 16 of this year, Moody's, another of the three, followed suit, amid tax cut negotiations in Congress. Standard & Poor's, the third rater, had already downgraded the US after the 2011 debt ceiling fight, meaning there now isn't a single rating agency giving US debt top marks.

As the 2023 downgrade indicates, this change isn't entirely due to Trump. Covid did a number on the US debt picture, with trillions of dollars in relief measures passed and implemented, and many months of lower revenues due to the 2020 recession. But in January, as Trump prepared to return to the White House, bond analysts were already forecasting higher rates, noting his penchant for tax cuts and lack of seriousness about deficits. On May 20, amid the tax fight in Congress, a batch of 20-year government bonds had trouble selling at auction, sending rates flying higher still. The bond market, it is fair to say, is not pleased with the direction this administration is going.

The nominal (that is, not adjusted for inflation) 10-year Treasury rate has grown from lows of around 3.6 percent in September to above 4.4 percent now. That, on its own, might not sound like a lot: only a 0.8-point increase?

But if you apply even a small increase in interest costs to the tens of trillions of dollars in debt the US government has outstanding, you get a very big number. Case in point: The Congressional Budget Office, as it evaluates Trump and Republicans' tax and spending proposals, is assuming 10-year interest rates of 4.1 percent this year, falling to 3.8 percent over time.

What if, instead, rates stayed higher — at 4.4 percent, say? Even that modest-sounding change would cost the US government $1.8 trillion over the next decade, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; for scale, that's about what Trump's more extreme tariff plans are projected to bring in.

A bond market reaction that persistently pushes up rates like this could turn a “merely” $3.1 trillion bill into a $5 trillion bill, raising the price tag by nearly 60 percent, without a single additional dollar in tax cuts or spending. By 2035, the US would be spending $2.1 trillion a year on interest, more than on defense or on Social Security, or on Medicare — some of the biggest portions of the federal budget.

That constrains politicians in both parties quite severely. It makes it harder for Republicans to pass the tax cuts they want, because they now are meaningfully more expensive. Same goes for any deficit-financed spending that Democrats may want.

Some politicians might say, “Who cares? Voters care more about tax cuts than the deficit. Why should it matter to me if some number labeled ‘deficit' goes up?” It may be true that voters can't easily parse the difference between a $1 and $2 trillion deficit. But they can definitely tell when things in their daily lives get more expensive, and higher interest costs will make everything more expensive.

Thirty-year mortgage interest rates move in almost perfect tandem with long-term government bonds, as this chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows:

This makes sense, if you think about it. When a bank issues a mortgage (or buys one from an issuer), it's lending money on a long-term basis in exchange for regular interest payments. That's exactly what an investor does when they buy a long-term government bond. Because mortgage borrowers (that is, homeowners) are typically considered riskier than the US government, they pay somewhat higher rates, but the two rates move together. If the US government starts paying more interest, mortgage borrowers will have to pay more interest too, so that banks lend to them rather than the federal government.

That means that if the bond market sends rates on US debt higher, it's not just more expensive for the government; it's more expensive for anyone who borrows. That means homeowners with mortgages, anyone with credit card debt, anyone with a car loan, anyone taking a student loan, and, perhaps most importantly, businesses taking out loans to build factories or invest in research. Good luck getting a US manufacturing renaissance going with persistently high interest rates driven by high deficits.

The odds are still high that Congress passes some kind of deficit-exploding tax bill. The House passed its version by a single vote, and while some Republican senators have voiced complaints, Republicans' 53-vote majority there means they can afford a few defectors and still pass something. Many of the Trump tax cuts passed in 2017 are set to expire next year, and the political urge to avoid a sudden spike in taxes will probably overwhelm whatever pressure the bond market brings to bear. The bond market is powerful, but Republican hatred of taxes may be more powerful.

But important Republican policymakers are paying attention. House Budget committee chair Jodey Arrington (R-TX) hinted to Politico's Victoria Guida that he thinks the markets may force more budget cuts than his party is inclined to support, saying, “If the bond markets don't think we're serious, I'm not sure it will matter what we do, because they're going to dictate the terms.”

And senators needed to get the package to the president's desk are watching too. “Have you been watching what the bond markets are doing in relation to the one big, beautiful bill?” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) asked. “They're not thinking it's a very big, beautiful bill.”

Trump's second term began with him bringing the richest man in the world to DC, with a promise to slash spending, by trillions a year if Elon Musk had his druthers. Now, Musk is leaving DC in a huff, having not meaningfully cut spending at all and by all accounts disillusioned and frustrated at his failure. But Musk is not the last figure who might try to impose austerity on DC, and while he may have hundreds of billions of dollars, the bond market wields tens of trillions. DOGE was, in retrospect, a bad joke. The bond vigilantes' coming attack may be something much more serious.

Elon Musk said the White House DOGE office was treated unfairly by its critics and became a ""whipping boy for everything.""

Musk was speaking to CBS in an interview that aired on Sunday when he was asked about the backlash he faced over his work at the cost-cutting outfit.

""It was a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything,"" Musk said.

""So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE. I've had people think that, like, somehow DOGE is gonna stop them from getting their Social Security check, which is completely untrue,"" he continued.

The Trump administration said in March that it ""will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits."" This clarification came after Musk called Social Security ""the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time"" in an episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" which aired in February.

Musk told CBS he is a ""proponent of smaller government, not bigger government.""

President Donald Trump announced in November that Musk would co-lead DOGE with Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk became the sole leader of DOGE after Ramaswamy left the cost-cutting outfit in January.

Musk served as DOGE's leader from January to May. He announced his departure from DOGE on Wednesday, concluding his 130-day stint as a special government employee.

During his tenure, DOGE tried to slash government spending by shutting down foreign aid programs and laying off thousands of federal workers. The cuts sparked boycotts and protests against Tesla, Musk's EV company.

The blowback Musk faced alarmed investors as well, who repeatedly told him to focus on Tesla. Last month, Musk told investors in a Tesla earnings call that he would be scaling down his involvement with DOGE to spend more time on Tesla.

Musk, however, told CBS that he will still be working on DOGE, albeit on a part-time basis.

""DOGE is going to continue, just as a way of life, and I will have some participation in that. But as I've said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point,"" Musk said.

Uber's chief product officer has one AI tool on his to-do list.

In an episode of ""Lenny's Podcast"" released on Sunday, Uber's product chief, Sachin Kansal, shared two ways he is using AI for his everyday tasks at the ride-hailing giant and how he plans to add NotebookLM to his AI suite.

Kansal joined Uber eight years ago as its director of product management after working at cybersecurity and taxi startups. He became Uber's product chief last year.

Kansal said he uses OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini to summarize long reports.

""Some of these reports, they're 50 to 100 pages long,"" he said. ""I will never have the time to read them.""

He said he uses the chatbots to acquaint himself with what's happening and how riders are feeling in Uber's various markets, such as South Africa, Brazil, and Korea.

The CPO said his second use case is treating AI like a research assistant, because some large language models now offer a deep research feature.

Kansal gave a recent example of when his team was thinking about a new driver feature. He asked ChatGPT's deep research mode about what drivers may think of the add-on.

""It's an amazing research assistant and it's absolutely a starting point for a brainstorm with my team with some really, really good ideas,"" the CPO said.

In April, Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, said that not enough of his 30,000-odd employees are using AI. He said learning to work with AI agents to code is ""going to be an absolute necessity at Uber within a year.""

Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

On the podcast, Kansal also highlighted NotebookLM, Google Lab's research and note-taking tool, which is especially helpful for interacting with documents. He said he doesn't use the product yet, but wants to.

""I know a lot of people who have started using it, and that is the next thing that I'm going to use,"" he said.

""Just to be able to build an audio podcast based on a bunch of information that you can consume. I think that's awesome,"" he added. Kansal was referring to the ""Audio Overview"" feature, which summarizes uploaded content in the form of two AIs having a voice discussion.

NotebookLM was launched in mid-2023 and has quickly become a must-have tool for researchers and AI enthusiasts.

Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former director of AI and OpenAI cofounder, is among those who have praised the tool and its podcast feature.

""It's possible that NotebookLM podcast episode generation is touching on a whole new territory of highly compelling LLM product formats,"" he said in a September post on X. ""Feels reminiscent of ChatGPT. Maybe I'm overreacting.""

AI is already taking human jobs, but Google DeepMind's CEO says the disruption will lead to the creation of new, ""very valuable"" roles.

Speaking at SXSW London on Monday, Demis Hassabis said he expects AI to be a bigger transformation than the Industrial Revolution, but he is optimistic because humans are ""infinitely adaptable.""

""I think new jobs will appear, new very valuable jobs,"" he said, adding that AI over the next five to 10 years will ""supercharge sort of technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies.""

Hassabis said today's children will grow up ""AI native"" in the way the previous generation did with the internet. However, when it comes to choosing what to study, Hassabis said he would still recommend studying STEM subjects.

He said it's ""still important to understand fundamentals"" in areas including mathematics, physics, and computer science to understand ""how these systems are put together.""

Speaking at Google's I/O developer conference last week, Hassabis and Google cofounder Sergey Brin predicted AGI — the moment AI reaches or surpasses human intelligence — will arrive around 2030.

But AI is already rapidly transforming the job market. Some companies are dialling down hiring for roles that can be done with AI, and companies such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google are increasingly using the technology to write code.

While Hassabis said he'd still study STEM subjects, he recommended that people get experience using AI tools.

""I'd also be experimenting with all the latest AI systems and tools and seeing what's the best way of utilising them and making use of them in useful and novel ways, so I would be embracing that and hacking around with those tools,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Priced out of Austin, he bought a one-way ticket out of the US. Now, he lives on a Thai island for a fraction of the cost.","https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-living-koh-samui-thailand-left-america-cheaper-island-life-2025-6","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:14:00 GMT","

Seven years ago, Mike Holp was riding through the streets of Austin as a food delivery worker, earning between $15 and $20 an hour.

He lived just outside downtown in a shared rental with three roommates. Even with a computer science degree, the tough competition made it hard for him to get the tech job he'd hoped for.

""Basically, the only thing that I could find to do to pay expenses was to deliver food on my bike,"" Mike Holp, now 38, a digital creator, told Business Insider.

Each day blurred into the next as he worked long hours just to cover rent, only to repeat the same grind the following month. It was a relentless cycle, and the lifestyle started to wear him down.

He felt disillusioned, and the rising cost of living wasn't helping his situation.

""At that point, I was like: 'What am I doing all this for? Just to get by?'"" Holp said.

His life in Austin didn't feel sustainable, and he knew he had to get out.

In 2019, with money saved from delivering food and working real estate photography gigs on the side, Holp bought a one-way ticket to Asia.

After a brief stint in Bali and then Singapore, Holp decided to make Thailand his next stop.

He spent time living in different parts of Thailand, including Chiang Mai — where he met his now fiancée, Mary. She was on vacation at that time but was based in both Bangkok and Koh Samui for work.

Wanting to be closer to her, Holp decided to move to Samui because he preferred its slower pace over the bustle of the Thai capital.

House hunting was fairly easy: He found their first home on Facebook Marketplace. It was a one-bedroom house in Lamai, a laid-back area along the southeastern coast of the island. Rent was 9,000 Thai baht a month.

After three years in that house, it was time for a change. His fiancée had left her previous job and now works at a school, and they wanted to live close by. They're still in Lamai but in a bigger one-bedroom property that costs 20,000 Thai baht, or about $600, each month.

""It's a modern village-style home. It's on a raised platform, about 12 feet off the ground, so if there's any flooding, we don't have to worry about that,"" Holp said.

Though Holp has learned a little bit of Thai, the good thing about Samui, being a tourist destination, is that many locals can speak and understand basic English, he said.

It was also fairly easy for him to connect with new people.

""There's a large Facebook group called Koh Samui Expats — they've got about 40,000 people in there,"" Holp said. ""And I'm actually a moderator in that group, so that helps to meet people.""

Holp said his life in Samui is ""completely different"" from that in Austin.

He starts his mornings by dropping off his fiancée at work. After that, it's time for a walk along the beach and a quick workout session at an outdoor gym on a tiny islet linked to the Samui mainland by a wooden bridge.

Post-workout, it's time for a coffee at a nearby café before he heads home to start work for the day. Apart from creating content for his own social pages, Holp also runs a photography business and a consulting business that helps others relocate to Thailand.

""I have a flexible schedule,"" he said. ""It's just a much more carefree, relaxed lifestyle compared to Austin.""

The fact that he's no longer in the rat race also means he has the time and energy to spend on his hobbies, such as exploring the island on his bike and meeting with friends.

The lower cost of living in Thailand helps, he said.

""It frees up my time so that I can focus on passion projects like the YouTube channel, and I don't have to worry about just paying rent all the time and stressing out,"" he said.

Holp said he and his fiancée typically spend between 50,000 and 60,000 Thai baht, or about $1,500 and $1,800, a month.

""We sometimes cook at home, but the meals are usually very affordable here, so going out to eat is very easy,"" Holp said.

Their weekly grocery run costs about 2,000 Thai baht, and it's also fairly easy to find international brands and products at the larger stores, he said.

""Even going to the grocery store, you can get 30 eggs for five bucks,"" he added.

Holp estimated a comparable lifestyle for two in Austin would cost about five times as much.

A 2025 SmartAsset analysis based on data from MIT's Living Wage Calculator found that a single person needed to earn at least $101,587 annually to live comfortably in Austin.

The average rent in Austin is $2,000, according to the latest May data from Zillow Rentals.

Holp said he loves the warm weather and the friendliness of the locals. He also feels very safe living in Samui.

""I don't even really have to worry about locking the door, whereas back in Austin, I probably have to worry about how somebody might break in and rob me,"" he said.

He hasn't been back to the US in five years, not even to visit. There isn't much that he misses anyway.

""There's a big car culture in the US. I do kind of miss driving a car around here. I just use the motorbike for everything since it's really easy to get around the little roads and stuff,"" he said.

""But I can't think of much that I really miss about the US other than my family, obviously, and friends. That's about it,"" he added.

War in Ukraine:

A truck apparently used to release Ukrainian drones burns in the Irkutsk region, in a photo released by Irkutsk region Governor Igor Kobzev.

Ukraine's drone strike deep inside Russian territory left Kremlin officials angry and alarmed over the sudden vulnerability of a nuclear-capable air fleet far from the battlefield, according to people close to senior officials in Moscow. 

Sunday's dramatic attack on Russian long-range bombers in air fields in Siberia helped to disrupt an arsenal that Moscow deploys to hit Ukraine with some of its most powerful missiles. It also demonstrated Ukraine's ability to hit key assets thousands of miles from the front lines, which the Russian military had thought were safe.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Russia and Ukraine wrapped up a second round of talks in Istanbul that failed to bring the two sides closer to ending the war, but laid the groundwork for a new exchange of prisoners.

The Russian delegation handed over peace proposals that include Kyiv surrendering control of territory it still holds in four partially occupied regions, a Ukrainian official said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Trump administration wants to put a 1 million barrel cache of diesel fuel on the market, saying the reserve meant to provide an emergency supply of home heating oil for the Northeast has never been used for its intended purpose. 

The sale and closure of the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve would generate $100 million to be used for deficit reduction, according to Department of Energy budget details recently made public. The sale of the reserve would require approval by Congress, which gave the Biden administration the green light to sell off and close a 1 million barrel emergency cache of gasoline last year.

The revenge of “places that don't matter” is increasingly palpable from Portugal to Poland.

Karol Nawrocki (right) with his wife Marta in Warsaw following the Polish presidential runoff election on Sunday, June 1, 2025. 

Last week, the US State Department posted an essay calling for “civilizational” allies in Europe. In keeping with MAGA rhetoric, it attacked the region's governments, the rule of law and its Big Tech regulation in the name of “democracy and Western heritage.” While this call has failed to tip the balance of power in recent elections from Canada to Germany, it seems to have been heard loud and clear in Poland, where nationalist Karol Nawrocki's presidential victory sends a wider warning to a geopolitically squeezed continent.

It's now increasingly clear that Trumpian attacks on the old certainties and dependencies of the transatlantic relationship aren't creating an equal and opposite reaction. Polarization on issues like migration, abortion and Europe was on full display in the 51% to 49% victory of boxer Nawrocki, a kind of fight-club-right candidate whom Donald Trump backed as essential for military support. Nawrocki wore his Catholic values on his sleeve, attacked Brussels' Green Deal and opposed Ukraine's membership in NATO. Coupled with the shattering of 50 years of two-party dominance in Portugal, the recent centrist victory in Romania is starting to feel more like the end of a trend than the beginning.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets ended the first trading day of the week lower.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.1%, France's CAC 40 was lower by 0.2%, and Germany's DAX was off by 0.3%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed marginally in the black, with a 0.02% gain.

President Donald Trump's move to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% is likely to bite wind energy developer Orsted, according to analysts.

The Danish multinational booked a loss of 1.2 billion Danish kroner ($183 million) in its first-quarter results in May after the U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. The company suggested the levy had hit the profitability of its Sunrise and Revolution Wind projects, as it had yet to import wind turbines into the U.S.

""Assuming Orsted have yet to move these equipment into the US in the weeks following the results, the announced 50% tariff is likely to lead to another c.DKK1.2bn impairment in 2Q,"" said Citi analysts led by Jenny Ping in a note to clients on June 2. ""We continue to wait for clarity around the outcome of US/EU tariff negotiation, which Orsted said a 20% tariff could add c.DKK 0.6bn, which has yet to be recognized in its accounts.""

The Wall Street bank analysts downgraded the stock to a ""Sell"" rating, saying ""these tariff risks does not help Orsted's equity story.""

Sydbank analysts agree that the raised tariff will hurt Orsted, but maintain their ""Buy"" rating.

""Ørsted is particularly hard hit by the steel and aluminum tariffs because the company does not have a local offshore wind turbine supply chain in the US,"" said Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank.

""We do not expect the increased tariffs to have an impact on Ørsted's plans to implement the two American projects. However, the tariff increase will again reduce the profitability of Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind compared to Ørsted's original assumptions.""

Shares of Sweden's SSAB were 6.36% higher at 2 p.m. in London. The steel producer is ""a beneficiary of higher US plate pricing,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a Monday note, as investors assess the impact of a potential increase in U.S. steel tariffs to 50% from 25% starting Wednesday.

More broadly, the higher tariffs are a headwind for European steel companies which export to the U.S., analysts Cole Hathorn and Tommaso Castello also noted.

However, they continued that higher prices would benefit SSAB's Americas division, which the company says is the largest heavy plate producer in North America.

Oil and gas stocks remain on the rise, moving in tandem with higher crude prices after OPEC+ announced a supply hike rate lower than some analysts expected.

The Stoxx aerospace and defense index is 0.45% higher. Germany's Hensoldt has jumped 11.6% after analysts at JPMorgan upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral.

The sector is also getting a boost from U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who outlined a series of new defense spending commitments, including new attack submarines.

Shares of Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk climbed 3% Monday as telehealth platform Hims & Hers is reportedly set to cut 4% of its workforce amid a U.S. ban on copycat weight loss drugs.

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo has been battling a slowdown in sales in its largest market as a drug shortage ruling by the Food and Drug Administration had permitted the rise of cheaper compounded obesity drugs.

The FDA declared the shortage over in February and gave compounding pharmacies until May 22 to cease selling copies of the drug.

The British pound is up 0.7% against the U.S. dollar at 8:45 a.m. in London, nudging it back above the $1.35 level it has largely traded below for the last week.

The euro is 0.75% higher on the greenback, which is suffering as trade tensions escalate.

""Trump's protectionist policies, speculated desire for a weaker [U.S. dollar] and tax bill seem to have accelerated the USD decline of late,"" analysts at Maybank said Monday.

""Trump's capricious nature may continue to inject volatility in the markets but unlike past episodes of risk aversion, the USD was punished most discernibly as part of the ""Sell America"" narrative.""

European equities are seeing a broadly negative start to the new trading week and month.

The regional Stoxx 600 index is down 0.18%, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX lower by 0.43% and 0.22%, respectively. The U.K.'s FTSE 100, however, pushed 0.08% higher, helped by an 0.57% rise in oil and gas stocks as prices jump.

Autos stocks fell 1.4% amid fears that a slew of recent developments in the Trump tariff story could lead to more stringent tariffs on the sector, particularly after the U.S. president unexpectedly announced a hike in steel duties to 50%. Risk-sensitive technology stocks dropped 1%.

Spot gold prices are up by around 1.5% ahead of the stock market open at $3,337 an ounce, the highest level for a week.

The market safe haven may be holding more appeal as investors ponder whether U.S. President Donald Trump will take even more aggressive tariff action against certain countries and sectors, and as fighting escalates in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Oil prices are also gaining — ICE Brent Crude futures with August expiry are trading 2.29% higher at $64.22 per barrel. Producer association OPEC+ on Saturday announced a supply increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July, similar to its hikes in May and June.

ING strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said in a Monday note that prices may nonetheless be rallying because there were suggestions the supply increase could have been even bigger.

French pharmaceutical group Sanofi announced this morning that it will acquire Massachusetts-based Blueprint Medicines Corporation for an equity value of $9.1 billion, a move to expand its portfolio in rare immunological diseases.

Key to the deal is the drug Ayvakit/Ayvakyt, which has been approved in the U.S. and EU and is used to treat advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis.

Good morning from London, where futures data from IG suggest stock markets will nudge higher at the open — following declines in France, Germany and Italy.

U.S. tariffs will be in focus yet again this week, after President Donald Trump said Friday that he will double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50% on June 4. The European Union criticized the move over the weekend, saying it undermines wider trade negotiations and will lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

Investors will also be monitoring any developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China, which soured last week. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett suggested Sunday that Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could have a conversation as soon as this week.

Trade frictions between Washington and Beijing have flared up after a hiatus following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng in Geneva, Switzerland, that had led them to suspend most tariffs on each other goods for 90 days.

The Trump administration has ratcheted up export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, while announcing it would revoke visas for Chinese students, drawing ire from Beijing.

The global economy may be facing an uncertain 2025 in light of trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts, but there's a bright spot that investors can take solace in: aviation.

The profitability of the aviation industry is expected to improve in 2025, despite global gross domestic product growth being forecast to drop to 2.5% in 2025 from 3.3% in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association.

In a report released on Monday, the IATA said revenue, operating profits and net profits of the industry are expected to increase from 2024, although some of those were lower than projections made in December.

For example, net profits for the industry are projected at $36 billion for 2025, up from the $32.4 billion earned in 2024, but slightly lower than the December projection of $36.6 billion.

The aviation industry's net profit margin is also forecast to rise to 3.7% in 2025, from 3.4% the previous year.

Total revenues are projected to hit a record high of $979 billion, 1.3% higher than the previous year, but down from the $1 trillion in its last forecast.

The IATA attributed the better results mainly to two factors: lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency.

It expects passenger load factors will reach an all-time high in 2025 with a full-year average of 84%, ""as fleet expansion and modernization remains challenging amid supply chain failures in the aerospace sector."" PLF shows how efficiently an airline is filling its seats.

Jet fuel costs are expected to average $86 per barrel in 2025, down from $99 in 2024, the IATA noted, saying it will translate into a total fuel bill of $236 billion, $25 billion lower than the $261 billion incurred in 2024.

""Recent financial data show minimal fuel hedging activity over the past year, indicating that airlines will generally benefit from the reduced fuel cost. It is not expected that fuel will be impacted by trade tensions,"" IATA said.

Airline CEOs told CNBC that airlines are holding up despite the uncertainty.

Air India CEO Campbell Wilson told CNBC's Monica Pitrelli at the World Air Transport Summit over the weekend that 2025 has been ""a year of surprises"" for the airline, ""whether it's politics, tariffs, geopolitics, [or] closer to home, some conflict issues.""India and Pakistan recently closed their airspace to each other's aircraft after military strikes carried out by both sides in May. Pakistan planes are banned from Indian airspace till June 23, and Indian planes are barred from Pakistan till June 24.

""Uncertainty is not helpful for business, but the underlying fundamentals of this market ... and the upside we see ahead of Air India is driving us forward, because we think there's massive opportunity to be realized,"" Wilson added.

He said India is the third-largest air travel market in the world, and estimated that it's growing at an annual growth rate of 8% to 10%. ""So if Indians start traveling... at the intensity of China, it's going to absolutely explode in volume internationally,"" he said.

Adrian Neuhauser, president and CEO of Colombian flag carrier Avianca, said in an interview Sunday ""When the world sneezes in any way ... Airlines just get sick very quickly.""However, he said, Avianca's passenger load factors are still holding up and revenue has improved. ""So the concern is there, but as of today, we're still seeing the numbers be there.""

North America is expected to generate the highest absolute profit among all regions in 2025, and the Asia-Pacific region is set to see the largest demand growth in 2025, with revenue per passenger kilometer projected to grow 9% year on year, the IATA said.

Revenue passenger kilometers, or RPK, is a measure of the volume of passengers carried by an airline. The metric is used to assess airline performance and passenger demand. The IATA said that ""if an airline sees a consistent increase in RPKs on a particular route over several months, this might prompt the carrier to increase flight frequency or deploy larger aircraft to meet growing demand — potentially boosting revenue and market share.""

It attributed strong passenger demand in the Asia-Pacific to the relaxation of visa requirements in several Asian countries, especially China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.The IATA did note, however, that the economic landscape poses some challenges, with the GDP forecast for the region, particularly China, having been lowered.

China on Monday refuted Washington's claims that it had broken the Geneva trade agreement, instead accusing the U.S. for breaching deal terms, signaling talks between the worlds top two economies have taken a turn for the worse.

Trade frictions between Washington and Beijing have flared up after a hiatus following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng in Geneva, Switzerland, that had led them to suspend most tariffs for 90 days.

The Trump administration has ratcheted up export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, while announcing it would revoke visas for Chinese students, drawing ire from Beijing.

Those steps ""seriously undermine"" the deal reached in Geneva, a Chinese commerce department spokesperson said, while vowing that Beijing would take measures to safeguard its rights and benefits, if the U.S. presses ahead with actions that ""damage China's interests.""

China has kept a firm grip on its rare earths exports, contrary to Washington's expectations. Chinese state media in an article Monday touted coordinated efforts across the nation on scrutinizing and curbing illicit mining and exports of critical minerals.

Beijing is ""comfortable taking an extremely firm stance in these negotiations"" and ""sees no reason to roll over,"" said Stephen Olson, visiting senior fellow at Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.

""It is well understood in Beijing that any deal reached with the U.S. will only buy some short-term peace, not the end of the story,"" Olson added.

The U.S. has continued to “unilaterally provoke new economic and trade frictions, increasing the uncertainty and instability in the bilateral economic and trade relations,"" the Chinese spokesperson said.

Last Friday, President Donald Trump accused China of violating its preliminary trade agreement with the U.S. In a social media post, Trump wrote, ""China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!""

Trump appears to be reacting to frustration over China's ""slow moves"" on easing rare earths' exports, which he sees as conflicting with the Geneva agreement, said Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore.

Chinese commerce ministry said the U.S. accusations were ""seriously contrary to the facts,"" claiming that Beijing had ""strictly implemented and actively upheld"" the agreements, citing its steps to cancel and suspend certain tariff and non-tariff measures announced in April in response to Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

Bessent said in a Fox News interview last week that bilateral trade talks were ""a bit stalled,"" requiring the two countries' leaders to speak directly.

Dennis Wilder, a former senior White House intelligence official, attributed the deteriorating bilateral relations in part to the lack of coordination across U.S. government agencies. Bessent might not have been a part of the decision-making for the new chip export curbs and student visa policy, Wilder added.

The National Security Committee was in charge of coordinating inter-agency government work at the White House, but it is now ""in turmoil"" as Trump ordered a major overhaul that will shrink its size, he said.

""Bessent is desperate for the president to get on a call with Xi ... to weigh in and install some coherence in the government policies,"" Wilder added.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett signaled Sunday that Trump and Xi could talk on trade as early as this week. While the U.S. appears to seek a call, it is unlikely for that to happen in the near term, experts said, citing deep-seated differences between the two governments.

""The U.S. side seems very keen on a Trump-Xi meeting or phone call. This caters to Mr. Trump's desire to be seen as the master dealmaker. In contrast, the Chinese tradition is the opposite:  leader's meeting or call should take place once lower level officials have reached major agreements, with few if any points outstanding,"" said Hofman.

Tensions between the U.S. and China have risen beyond just trade, further diminishing chances of talks between the two leaders.

Addressing the annual defense summit Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday in Singapore, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth warned that the threat from China's mounting military pressure in the Indo-Pacific region was ""real"" and ""imminent,"" urging allied nations to boost defense spending to push back against Beijing.

China's defense minister was absent at this year's summit, a rare departure from its tradition of dispatching the top military official to the annual event for the first time since 2019.

Responding to Hegseth's remarks, China's embassy in Singapore said ""the U.S. itself is the biggest 'troublemaker' for regional peace and stability."" A spokesperson for China's defense ministry criticized Hegseth on Sunday for ""instigating cold-war mentality"" and ""severely challenging China's sovereignty and rights.""

When threatened, birds puff up their feathers to appear larger than they actually are, and squawk to signal aggression.

On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested he would no longer be ""Mr. NICE GUY"" to China after the country ""totally violated"" its trade agreement with America. The same day, Trump said he would raise tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%.

The escalations follow a détente in May, during which Trump reached a trade deal with the U.K., agreed with Beijing to sharply reduce reciprocal import duties and delayed for more than a month a tariff of 50% on the European Union — two days after announcing it.

Those glad tidings lifted stocks. For May, the S&P 500 rose 6.2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 9.6%, with both indexes enjoying their best month since November 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 3.9% for the month.

But the mood among investors might change quickly, depending on communication coming from the White House.

The word ""chicken"" is used as a metaphor for cowardice. In reality, they can be dangerous — there have been reports of humans being killed by Colonel Sanders' favorite bird.

Mixed U.S. markets for end of May U.S. markets traded mixed Friday. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.32%. Futures tied to the three indexes ticked down Sunday evening stateside. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.14% Friday, breaking a two-day losing streak. Germany's DAX climbed 0.27% as the country's inflation eased to 2.1% in May from 2.2% the previous month — but was still higher than expected.

Expected Trump-Xi talkTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could discuss trade negotiations ""this week,"" U.S. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on Sunday. The conversation might ease tensions, which rose after Trump on Friday said that China has ""TOTALLY VIOLATED"" its preliminary trade agreement with America, and Chinese U.S. embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu responded by accusing the U.S. of engaging in ""abuse of export control measures.""

Trump says he'll double steel tariffsTrump on Friday told steelworkers at U.S. Steel that he will raise import duties on steel to 50% from 25%. The new import duties will start June 4, the president posted on Truth Social. On Saturday, the European Union said it is ""prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase."" Even so, ""tariffs are not going away,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Mild U.S. inflation in AprilThe U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation reading, was muted for April. Prices ticked up 0.1% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones forecast. On an annual basis, it rose 2.1%, 0.1 percentage points lower than expected. Excluding food and energy, the core reading on which Fed policymakers tend to focus came in at 0.1% and 2.5%, against respective estimates of 0.1% and 2.6%.

Musk cuts himself from DOGEElon Musk bid farewell to his role at the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency Friday. At the press conference, Musk deflected a reporter's question about a New York Times article detailing his alleged drug use last year. Tesla shares lost 14% this year amid Musk's involvement in politics — but they gained 22% in May following Musk's April statement he would spend less time at DOGE.

[PRO] May jobs report in focusThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for May, out Friday, will provide more information on how the economy is holding up amid Trump's multiple tariffs —and play a big role in determining whether the May rally in stocks still has legs. Economists expect the number of jobs added in May to dip from April. It misses the forecast, markets could take a downturn as the White House appears to ratchet up its tariff rhetoric.

Investors are piling into big, short Treasury bets alongside Warren Buffett

Investors always pay close attention to bonds, and what the latest movement in prices and yields is saying about the economy. Right now, the action is telling investors to stick to the shorter-end of the fixed-income market with their maturities.

Long-term treasuries and long-term corporate bonds have posted negative performance since September, which is very rare, said Todd Sohn, senior ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities, on ""ETF Edge.""

The only other time that's happened in modern times was during the Financial Crisis,"" he added. ""It is hard to argue against short-term duration bonds right now."" 

It would seem that Warren Buffett agrees, with Berkshire Hathaway doubling its ownership of T-bills and now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries, according to a recent JPMorgan report.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia-Pacific markets were mostly lower Monday after President Donald Trump told U.S. steelworkers that he will double tariffs on steel imports to 50%, effective from Wednesday.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.30% to close at 37,470.67 while the Topix declined 0.87% to 2,777.29. South Korea's Kospi was nearly flat to end the trading day at 2,698.97, while the small-cap Kosdaq rose 0.81% to 740.29 ahead of the country's presidential election on June 3.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.24% to close at 8,414.1.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined 1.2% while India's Nifty 50 was down 0.10%.

China, Malaysia and New Zealand markets are closed for the holidays.

""We're going to bring it from 25% to 50%, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America,"" Trump said during remarks at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, adding that the steep tariffs would ""further secure the steel industry.""

Trump also posted on Truth Social that the steel tariffs will start on June 4.

U.S. stock futures fell as Wall Street looks to the start of a new month of trading following a strong performance in May. S&P 500 futures traded down 0.3%, along with Nasdaq-100 futures. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 108 points, or 0.3%.

Last Friday, the three major averages closed mixed. The S&P 500 was little changed on Friday to close out a big winning month, inching down by 0.01% to end at 5,911.69. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.32% to 19,113.77, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 54.34 points, or 0.13%, to finish at 42,270.07.

— CNBC's Brian Evans and Alex Harring contributed to this report.

Shares of Hong Kong real estate firm New World Development fell Monday after it announced last Friday in a filing that it will defer coupon payments on four perpetual bonds, raising alarm bells that the company is sinking further into financial trouble.

New World's financial troubles emerge amid ongoing property sector struggles in both Hong Kong and mainland China. Last year, the developer's statements indicated that it has been burdened by high debt levels.

Hong Kong listed stocks of New World Development fell 6.47% as of 3.38 p.m. local time.

China on Monday refuted Washington's claims that it had broken the Geneva trade agreement, instead accusing the U.S. for breaching deal terms, signaling talks between the worlds top two economies have taken a turn for the worse.

Trade frictions between Washington and Beijing have flared up after a hiatus following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng in Geneva, Switzerland, that had led them to suspend most tariffs on each other goods for 90 days.

The Trump administration has ratcheted up export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, while announcing it would revoke visas for Chinese students, drawing ire from Beijing.

Australia's manufacturing sector saw a slight slowdown in May, with the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI easing to 51 for the month, down from 51.7 in April. The reading also marked a shrinking of Australia's manufacturing sector production first time in three months.

According to S&P Global, incoming new orders climbed at a slower pace in spite of renewed export growth.

""Despite a moderation in the pace of growth, anecdotal evidence suggested that the slower rate of expansion, including a slight reduction in output, was partially driven by the election and may therefore prove temporary,"" said Jingyi Pan, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

South Korea's manufacturing output declined at its fastest pace in 31 months, mainly due to headwinds from domestic economic conditions and global trade policies.According to S&P Global, the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 47.7 in May, better than the 47.5 seen in April, but also marking the fourth straight month of contraction.

A PMI figure above 50 indicates expansion, while a figure below 50 indicates contraction.

Usamah Bhatti, Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said that ""firms often mentioned that the contraction was attributed to a continuing stagnation in the domestic economy, as well the continued impact of higher U.S. tariffs on the home market as well as on key export markets.""

Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, also known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks surged after both companies announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger.

Shares of Soul Patts traded 13.78% higher, while Brickworks, Australia's largest brickmaker, jumped 22.32% as of 1 p.m. local time.

As part of the deal, a new company listed in Sydney will acquire all outstanding shares of Soul Patts and Brickworks. The merged entity is projected to be worth around $9 billion, with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion.

""Merging Soul Patts with Brickworks makes a lot of strategic and financial sense,"" Soul Patts CEO and Managing Director, Todd Barlow, said in a statement. He added that the deal ""simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company.""

The merger will unwind a 56-year mutual ownership that was designed to fend off hostile takeovers and promote long-term investment strategies. Soul Patts owns 43% of Brickworks, while the brickmaker has a 26% stake in Soul Patts. However, critics argued that it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency.

Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday.

Pitt Capital Partners is acting as adviser to Soul Pattinson, and Citigroup Global Markets Australia is advising Brickworks.

The merger follows several unsuccessful attempts to unwind the cross-shareholding between Soul Patts and Brickworks, including a concerted effort by Perpetual Investment Management and venture capitalist Mark Carnegie between 2012 and 2017, which was dismissed after the Federal Court ruled that the structure was not detrimental to shareholders.

""The structure [was] odd, set up in 1969 as a share swap between two companies with similar market caps to protect against each other being taken over,"" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer of Atlas Funds.

""Historically, we have avoided both as the cross holdings/complicated structure saw both companies trade at a discount to their peers,"" Dive added.

While the move is not significant in terms of the M&A scene in Australia, the investors ""clearly like it,"" he said, pointing to the share move.

Nationalist Karol Nawrocki, backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, clinched the Polish presidency in a tight run-off race that spells trouble for the country's current pro-EU government.

A final count showed Nawrocki, who stood for the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party that lost its majority in 2023, secured 50.89% of votes against the 49.11% of rival Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. Early results released before polls closed had put the liberal in the lead.

Nawrocki will succeed fellow conservative Andrzej Duda — who himself won the leadership with a razor-thin advantage against Trzaskowski in 2020 — for a five-year term and can then stand for re-election once. 

The Polish election was closely watched in Europe, the United States and battling Eastern European neighbors Russia and Ukraine as it raises questions over the solidity of Warsaw's future alignment with Brussels and Kyiv.

The head of state's role in Poland is overshadowed by that of parliament, but the president retains a critical veto over legislation. Duda has exercised this to block several reforms spearheaded by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition.

Eurosceptic Nawrocki can likewise deliver considerable setbacks to former European Council President Tusk's pro-EU government, which repaired fractured relations with Brussels and last year unlocked payments of up to 137 billion euros ($156 billion) of EU funds that had been frozen over rule-of-law concerns.

The country of 37 million and the EU's sixth-largest economy was the largest net beneficiary of EU funds in 2024.

""I'm confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland. We are all stronger together in our community of peace, democracy, and values,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Monday on the X social media platform. ""So let us work to ensure the security and prosperity of our common home."" 

A previously staunch supporter of Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion to date, Poland has offered extensive security and logistical aid to Kyiv and earlier in January assumed the rotating one-year EU presidency from the Kremlin's chief European ally Hungary under the motto ""Security, Europe!""

Nawrocki has taken a more critical stance toward Kyiv during his campaign, citing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's alleged poor treatment of Poland. He also ruled out the embattled country's long-held ambition of adhering to NATO — a move feared to pit the military coalition against Russian hostilities.

Critically, the Polish presidential runoff was the latest test of the rise of right-wing populism in Europe, rekindled since the U.S. Trump-led MAGA victory in November. Nawrocki's win broke the streak of more liberal victories achieved in Romania and Portugal in May.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had urged Polish voters to extend their support to Nawrocki during the first-ever Conservative Political Action Conference in Poland last week, decrying his pro-EU opponent Trzaskowski as an ""absolute train wreck of a leader.""

""Donald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity to have just as strong of a leader in Karol, if you make him the leader of this country,"" she said. ""You can be that shining city on a hill that the rest of Europe and the world will watch and know how strong you are, how free you are because you've elected the right leader that will protect it and defend it.""

Poland has maintained a good relationship with Washington, particularly on security, where it evades Trump's broader criticism against — largely European — NATO allies who have historically failed to meet the coalition's defense spending target of 2% of GDP. Poland has exceeded this benchmark for the past five years, logging a 4.12% contribution in 2024 — ahead of the U.S.' own 3.38% — and investing in U.S. arsenal ranging from F-35 jets to Abrams tanks.

Michael Saylor during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Turns out, buying Bitcoin to boost your share price might not be the corporate panacea that it once seemed.

 Meta shareholders shut down a proposal to assess whether Bitcoin should be added to its balance sheet, with just 0.08% of votes in favor of the idea. 

Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to assess whether the tech giant should add Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

A “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal put before shareholders received 3.92 million votes in favor — a mere 0.08% of the total — while nearly 5 billion voters decided against the measure, a May 28 regulatory filing shows. 

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company's voting power, according to an April regulatory statement, which could indicate that he voted against the proposal.

The lopsided vote followed a shareholder proposal in January from Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who called on Meta to invest a portion of its $72 billion cash and cash equivalents position into Bitcoin (BTC), claiming it would be a hedge against inflation.

“Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28% of Meta's total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value,” he argued in his supporting statement.

Peck, who serves as Bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive, also noted that Meta's second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable.

The Bitcoiner submitted the proposal on behalf of his family's shares in the social media giant.

Peck has also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon last year on behalf of the conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR).

Microsoft shareholders voted against Peck's proposal in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to allocate at least 5% of the company's assets to Bitcoin.

Nick Cowan, CEO of fintech firm Valereum, told Cointelegraph in December that Amazon has a better track record of adopting emerging tech and exploring novel investments than many other Big Tech companies.

However, the opportunity cost of holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin instead of investing it into research and development or acquisitions may weigh heavily on shareholders, he said.

While the Bitcoin proposals were knocked back by Meta and Microsoft, publicly traded firms from all around the world have started to buy Bitcoin.

BitcoinTreasures.NET data shows that 116 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with some of the newest entrants being GameStop and Swedish health tech firm H100, which both bought Bitcoin for the first time last month.

Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,250 Bitcoin — worth $60.9 billion — while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, each hold over $1 billion in Bitcoin.

				“It was so ultra-legal that it couldn't be more legal,” claims ousted justice minister.			

AI generated Text-to-speech

A Czech government scandal involving a drug-dealing dark web entrepreneur and millions of euros in bitcoin threatens to help populist opposition leader Andrej Babiš's prospects in this fall's parliamentary elections.

Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blažek from Prime Minister Petr Fiala's conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS) resigned Friday in a scandal involving a €40 million bitcoin donation to the ministry — auctioned off by the institution in exchange for cash in a public auction — gifted by a convicted drug dealer.

The cryptocurrency came from Tomáš Jiřikovský, who formerly ran an illegal darknet market that had drugs for sale, and served time in prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking and illegal possession of weapons. Czech newspaper Deník N broke the news last week that police are investigating the donation.

Blažek, who is also known as Don Pablo in Czech political circles due to his previous scandals that included attending the party of a pro-Russian lobbyist  or alleged corruption related to municipal apartments, said he acted legally, but quit because he didn't want the current coalition to suffer.

“It was so ultra-legal that it couldn't be more legal,” said Blažek, adding that Jiřikovský might have donated bitcoin to the ministry as a “form of penance.”

But the scandal is a boon for opposition election front-runner Babiš, the leader of the right-wing populist ANO party who previously governed Czechia between 2017 and 2021 — and it arrives at a critical moment. Though it is still leading, ANO has been slowly declining in polls over the last few weeks, while the Together (SPOLU) coalition has been rising.

Political analyst Ladislav Mrklas from CEVRO Institute in Prague, said the opposition will try to use the scandal for political gain for weeks.

“The whole affair broke out at a very inopportune time, just when it seemed that the government parties were finally gaining some ground and their support was starting to rise from the bottom,” he said, adding that it is a “major inconvenience” for the government.

Petr Kaniok, from the international relations department of Masaryk University in Brno, said that the coalition managed to dampen the impact of the scandal by having the minister resign.“To put it bluntly: no body, no crime. If Blažek is no longer in government, the opposition will struggle to attack it,” said Kaniok, adding that he does not expect the case to have a major effect — also because Blažek has long been a polarizing figure.

Babiš was quick to accuse Blažek and ODS of money laundering and called for the government to resign.“Are you taking people for a joke, Mr. Prime Minister? You were literally laundering drug money! … This is grounds for the whole government to fall! … You're the most corrupt government this country has ever had,” Babiš wrote in a post on X.The police and the National Headquarters for Combating Organized Crime are now investigating whether the donation came from laundered money.

Prices are still rising in Europe — but not as fast as in recent years, and nothing like in the U.S.

The SEC has raised serious legal questions about the proposed Solana and Ethereum ETFs by REX Shares and Osprey Funds.

Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds have stumbled on a major regulatory roadblock. In a filing dated May 30, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission flagged legal concerns regarding the proposed REX Shares and Osprey Funds ETFs.

The agency highlighted seven ETFs, including the REX-Osprey ETH ETF and REX-Osprey SOL ETF, citing “unresolved questions” surrounding their legal structure. Specifically, the SEC questioned whether these funds, as currently structured, qualify as “investment companies.”

For a fund to meet that definition, it must primarily invest or trade in securities, or have securities make up at least 40% of its assets. As such, the SEC indicated that the Form N-1A filing submitted may be improper. If the funds do not qualify as investment companies, the filing could be considered misleading to investors.

The SEC also raised concerns about compliance with Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act, which governs exchange listing standards for ETFs. Before approval can proceed, the agency has asked REX Shares and Osprey Funds to update their filings.

The proposed Solana and Ethereum ETFs by REX Shares and Osprey Funds are legally unconventional. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the funds use several “clever workarounds” to bypass standard listing requirements.

BIG NEWS: @REXShares just filed an effective prospectus for Solana and Ethereum staking ETFs to list here in the US. Don't know launch date but could be within the next few weeks. These are 40-act funds with a unique structure and do not go through the 19b-4 process pic.twitter.com/cqUCWlFAZW

For example, the funds are structured as C corporations—an uncommon setup for ETFs. This theoretically allows them to sidestep whether ETH or SOL are considered “securities” under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the companies are using Cayman Islands subsidiaries to avoid regulations governing crypto custodians.

Due to these regulatory maneuvers, the funds went into effect on May 30 without requiring SEC approval through the 19b-4 process. However, as of June 2, no exchange has listed the fund.

Bitcoin has just crossed a major psychological threshold by surpassing 64% dominance in the crypto market. This steady progression over several weeks now places the queen of cryptos in a zone of historic resistance. 

Bitcoin crossed this week 64.2% dominance in the crypto market, a level that marks a crucial turning point. This continuous progression over several months places the leading crypto in an unprecedented position of strength against its competitors, notably Ethereum.

Crypto analyst Astronomer observes that this 64% zone acts as a true technical ceiling. His analysis reveals that bitcoin is now struggling to continue its rise. Last May, several attempts to surpass this level had already failed.

Technical signals show a clear slowdown in momentum. Despite bitcoin's recent historic highs, its dominance seems to stall. Trading volumes are declining and investors hesitate to continue migrating towards the queen of cryptos.

This situation recalls that of May, when dominance bounced above 63.5% before quickly falling again. This repetition of technical behaviors reinforces the hypothesis of an imminent reversal.

Technical analyses point towards a reversal in the coming weeks. Bitcoin dominance could drop back to 63%, finally creating the long-awaited opportunity for other cryptocurrencies.

This rotation benefits from a favorable context. China has recently injected massive liquidity into global markets. This capital could turn to altcoins once bitcoin dominance stabilizes.

Ethereum already shows signs of awakening with a 2.01% gain in 24 hours, reaching 9.4% dominance. Solana and Dogecoin are also among the favored candidates to benefit from this rebalancing.

Established cryptos like XRP, Cardano, and Chainlink could also stand out. These mature projects have survived several cycles and have the strength needed to attract investors.

Bitcoin currently hovers around 63.5%, a critical level. Maintaining above 64% at the end of the month would delay the emergence of an altcoin season. Conversely, a drop would likely trigger a massive redistribution towards alternative cryptocurrencies.

In short, bitcoin's 64% dominance marks a decisive turning point that could redefine the balances of the crypto market. Technical signals converge towards an imminent reversal, potentially opening the way for a much-anticipated altcoin season awaited by investors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","How to Use AI (ChatGPT + Grok) to Find the Next Big Altcoin","https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-research-altcoins-using-chatgpt-and-grok","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:40:47 GMT","

 ChatGPT and Grok can help you analyze altcoins, compare projects, and stay ahead in crypto research. 

Investments in the fast-paced cryptocurrency market require real-time insights and efficient research. With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. 

AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. 

This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.

Both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. 

You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. 

Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.

On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.

ChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. 

With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:

Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”

Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project's breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” 

Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”

Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. 

Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.

ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. 

For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” 

Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:

And this is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.

To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: 

“Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” 

Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:

Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:

These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.

Did you know? Elon Musk's Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.

Developer traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin's long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.

You could use prompts like:

“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”

You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:

“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”

ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:

Here is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:

“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”

Here is ChatGPT 4o's response for this prompt:

This is Grok 3's response for the same prompt:

Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.

For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.

AI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.

When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.

Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.

In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.

Not all Layer-1s are built the same, and Coldware ($COLD), Cardano (ADA), and Render (RNDR) each bring something different to the table. 

Cardano is known for its careful, academic approach. Render is positioning itself in GPU rendering and AI. And Coldware is all about making blockchain usable in real life. 

Here's what you need to know. 

Cardano has always leaned heavily on academic research and peer-reviewed development. It's consistently evolving, with a strong focus on scalability, sustainability, and long-term impact.

One thing that sets Cardano apart is its proof-of-stake protocol, Ouroboros, which is energy-efficient and fits nicely into today's push for greener blockchain tech. 

The network has also seen a bump in activity lately when it processed over 50,000 daily transactions.



There's also a buzz building around a potential ADA ETF. Analysts give it a 71% chance of being approved, and that alone has led to more interest in the project. 

ADA is currently trading around $0.79, up 27% over the past month. Price targets for 2025 range from $1.30 to as high as $2.60.

Render Network is helping fix a real problem: access to affordable, high-performance computing. Whether it's 3D rendering, AI model training, or other GPU-heavy tasks, Render gives creators and developers a way to get the power they need, without paying cloud provider prices.

The platform connects people who need computing power with those who have idle GPUs. 

Lately, Render has also been expanding into the AI compute space, which opens up even more use cases beyond just animation and visuals.



As of today, RENDER is trading at around $4.38, with a market cap of roughly $2.29 billion. It's still well below its March 2024 high of $13.61, but the interest is building again, especially as AI and digital content tools continue to grow.

Coldware ($COLD) is already building the stuff that makes Web3 useful now—real devices, simple tools, and features that work for people who aren't deep into crypto.

Here's what makes it stand out:

The project is currently in presale and picking up serious momentum—over $4 million raised and 67% of the tokens already sold. There's still time to get in, but probably not for long. If you're looking for something practical in the blockchain space, this might be it.

Cardano is pushing ahead with its research-first approach, Render is powering up the future of AI and 3D with decentralized GPUs. 

But Coldware ($COLD) stands out because it's built for everyday use, not just industry headlines. With real devices, built-in tools, and an easy way to interact with Web3, Coldware is quietly making blockchain work for real people. 

And with its presale moving fast, now might be a good time to take a closer look.

This article draws on insights from a joint report by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and Chainlink, exploring how blockchain-based identity systems can enhance trust and efficiency in global financial services.

Digital assets are rapidly reshaping the financial landscape, from tokenized assets and onchain funds to the continued growth and development of decentralized finance (DeFi). But as capital flows increasingly migrate to blockchains, one critical standardization issue remains unresolved: digital identity verification. This process is critical to both traditional finance and the still-burgeoning digital asset industry, yet it lacks an efficient, scalable, and secure solution.

In traditional finance, verifying the identity of legal entities is a prerequisite to virtually any institutional financial activity. Whether opening a bank account, trading in public markets, or investing in a fund, legal entities must prove who they are, and this requirement remains fundamentally important when interacting with digital assets. If anything, the complexity multiplies when interactions occur across multiple blockchains, jurisdictions, and financial instruments.

A recent survey by Fenergo on Know-Your-Customer (KYC) practices revealed that financial institutions across the UK, U.S., and Singapore dedicate approximately a third of their compliance budgets specifically to KYC activities. Globally, financial firms employ an average of 1,566 staff members for AML and KYC tasks, incurring an onboarding expense averaging $2,598 per customer. According to Fenergo, these costly and inefficient onboarding procedures have caused client attrition for 67% of banks and 74% of asset managers. These figures highlight the limitations of current identity frameworks and the rising need for scalable, verifiable alternatives—precisely the role Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) are designed to play.

What is an LEI?

The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities participating in financial transactions. It connects to validated reference data about the entity, such as its legal name, ownership structure, and jurisdiction.

Born out of the 2008 financial crisis, the LEI was created to improve transparency in markets after the collapse of Lehman Brothers revealed major gaps in how entities were identified and linked. Without a standard to map exposure, regulators and counterparties struggled to assess systemic risk.

Today, LEIs are required in more than 250 jurisdictions for activities like derivatives trading and securities issuance. Over 2.7 million LEIs have been issued globally. The global LEI system is governed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a not-for-profit organization established by the Financial Stability Board to ensure transparency and open access to trusted entity identification data.

From LEIs to vLEIs: Bringing organizational identity onchain

The LEI standardized organizational identity in traditional finance—but the process remains offchain and of little use in real-time interactions with blockchain-based assets. The verifiable LEI (vLEI), developed and governed by GLEIF, can be connected to blockchains via the Chainlink Platform. Bringing vLEI onchain has the potential to reshape the traditional finance industry's involvement in onchain financial activities by building confidence and clarity through standardization.

The vLEI uses cryptographic technology to prove the authenticity of an entity's identity and credentials in real time. It renders traditional LEI data as a verifiable credential—a tamper-evident, machine-readable identity asset that can be validated across platforms, including blockchains. Once an organization has an LEI, a qualified issuer can generate a vLEI credential tied to a wallet or smart contract address. This can include role-based credentials—proving, for instance, that a CFO has authority to approve a transaction. 

Both GLEIF's work on global digital organizational identity and blockchain infrastructure built by Chainlink, the standard for onchain finance, support identity systems that are secure, work across different platforms, and easily connect with existing systems. GLEIF's vLEI enables organizations to prove their identity off and onchain, while Chainlink's technology enables firms to verify identity without exposing sensitive information and make identity portable across multiple blockchains and legacy systems.

Now, when that organization transacts—subscribing to a fund, issuing an asset, or joining a liquidity pool—counterparties can validate its identity with full cryptographic assurance.

The vLEI addresses key challenges:

Just as Chainlink has helped proof of reserves and net asset value (NAV) become foundational data points in digital assets, GLEIF's vLEI can serve as a foundational identity primitive—enabling secure, transparent participation in onchain markets.

Unlocking trust in digital asset transactions

Digital assets are programmable. They can move fast and span multiple networks. But without trusted identity standards, they operate in a vacuum of verification. This, in turn, creates additional friction for asset managers, fund administrators, and institutional investors looking to engage more fully with blockchain-based markets.

Bringing LEIs onchain through vLEIs bridges that gap by enabling organizations to assert their legal identity within blockchain environments in a cryptographically verifiable way. It ensures that tokenized assets can be held, traded, and managed by known organizations under known authorities.

Larry Fink, BlackRock

As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink noted in his 2025 letter to investors: 

“One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs — provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification.”

For digital assets to achieve their full potential—as a new layer of global financial infrastructure—digital identity must not only meet but exceed the expectations of the traditional financial industry and global regulatory bodies. vLEI shows real promise in addressing this need.

Blockchain-enabled identity in financial services

Blockchain-enabled identity offers a new approach: rather than uploading documents or manually validating entities, organizations can rely on cryptographic proofs tied to a digital identity. These proofs can be shared across platforms and verified instantly, without exposing sensitive underlying data. Chainlink's infrastructure can help facilitate this process by enabling secure delivery and validation of identity proofs across diverse blockchains, supporting greater interoperability across the digital asset ecosystem.

Chainlink can make digital identity portable, secure, and interoperable. Whether issuing tokenized funds or accessing cross-chain liquidity pools, validating counterparties in a standardized, tamper-proof way is a game-changer.

To realize this opportunity, the industry needs a common identity language—one that bridges traditional finance and digital assets. Regulatory initiatives like the EU's European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) are already exploring decentralized identity as a trust layer for digital ecosystems, reinforcing the momentum behind this shift. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and its digital platform-agnostic evolution, the verifiable LEI (vLEI), offer a promising foundation for building that shared identity standard.

All signs point toward a future where institutional-grade identity standards are a prerequisite for the next phase of financial innovation. Organizations like GLEIF are working to ensure that these identity standards remain open, globally recognized, and usable across both traditional and blockchain-based systems, with Chainlink enabling secure interoperability across blockchains and legacy systems.

Telegram-linked blockchain has suffered previous breakdowns during demand spikes.

The TON blockchain, closely tied to cloud-based messaging app Telegram, suffered a brief outage on Sunday that halted block production. 

The issue was traced to an error in the masterchain dispatch queue affecting how the main chain processed its data queue.

This story is an excerpt from the Unchained Daily newsletter.  

To get these updates in your email for free, subscribe here.

TON's development team announced the problem at 9:21 a.m. ET on Sunday and restored network functionality about 40 minutes later. Only a few masterchain validators required updates to resume block production, and no funds were lost during the incident.

It's not the first time TON has seen outages. In August last year, several similar incidents occurred due to high demand for the DOGS memecoin, causing network congestion and halts in block production.

								By 

	Elsa Keslassy


International Correspondent


	Mediawan Kids & Family, the youth content arm of the European powerhouse that owns Plan B, See-Saw Films and Chapter 2, has struck a deal with Claynosaurz Inc., the company behind the viral NFT brand. Together, they'll co-produce an animated series based on the digital-native franchise.


	The series, running 39 episodes of seven minutes each, underscores the strategy deployed by Mediawan Kids & Family to partner up with up-and-coming talent from the creator economy and develop original transmedia projects.

	Aimed at children aged 6 to 12, the comedy-filled series will follow the adventures of four dinosaur friends on a mysterious island. Jesse Cleverly, the award-winning co-founder and creative director of Mediawan-owned, Bristol-based banner Wildseed Studios, is on board as showrunner. 




			Popular on Variety		







	Claynosaurz, created in 2021 by Nicholas Cabana, Dan Cabral and Daniel Jervis (former VFX artists at Sony Pictures, Animal Logic and Framestore) has already garnered over 450 million views and 200 million impressions across digital platforms, as well as an online community of over 530,000 subscribers with its humorous short videos. The brand has won 11 Collision Award, as well as a Webby Award.


Julien Borde, Mediawan Kids & Family president, told Variety that the series will likely be the first of its kind and addresses a demand from buyers for content that “comes with a pre-existing engagement and data.” 


	“I think it's the very first time a digital collectible brand is expanded into a TV series so it's a milestone, not just for Mediawan Kids & Family but for the industry,” Borde said. The project also allows the company to keep up with its mantra to “empower talents all around the world,” the veteran youth content exec said, adding that the Claynosaurz team “are really into animation, have done fantastic shows in the past and are trying to do things a different way.” Borde also said the show is part of Mediawan Kids & Family's ambition to diversify and build a new line-up of premium content coming from different platforms. 

	











	Cabana said he created Claynosaurz with a “group of artists from all sorts of studios, including Illumination, Dreamworks, Sony, Disney and Ubisoft.” Having entered the market through collectibles and NFTs gave them the opportunity to monetize early in their development cycle and focus on building the characters rather than building long-form content, he said. The way they “flipped the traditional model” and “built the IP directly with fans” felt right because they could “prepackage the brand within the audience” at a time when it's “tough for large studios to take a risk on nascent brands if they're not proven or battle-tested,” Cabana said.


	When Mediawan approached them, they “immediately understood the tone, warmth and irreverent humour that define Claynosaurz, and share our belief that great franchises can emerge from unexpected places,” Cabana said. He noted that “this type of community-driven development isn't just different, it's necessary.” 


	The series will aim at getting the digital franchise to an even wider audience with “hyper relatable” content, while keeping the comedy-driven, quirky DNA of the hit IP, Cabana said. He also explained how the banner will test creative ideas on social media and “treat it as our test kitchen” to “find out what's sticking and what's not sticking,” he said. 


	The show will launch on Youtube and will be available for licensing by traditional TV channels and platforms. Nicolas Fisch, who is producing the series for Mediawan Kids & Family, said Claynosaurz's creative teams and Mediawan's will come together in a writers room. 


	Katell France (“Vic the Vicking”) at Method Animation (“The Little Prince”), a Mediawan label, is producing the show with Cabana at Claynosaurz.


	Mediawan was at the Cannes Film Festival this year with the animated feature “Marcel et Monsieur Pagnol” directed by Sylvain Chomet (“The Triplets of Belleville”).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Polygon NFTs hit $2B sales milestone as network defies downturn","https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-nft-sales-2-billion-rwa-courtyard-growth-2025","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 13:22:44 GMT","

 Polygon's NFT growth in 2025 is fueled by real-world asset marketplace Courtyard, which now rivals DraftKings in all-time sales. 

Polygon-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have surpassed the $2 billion milestone in all-time sales volume, marking a significant achievement for digital collectibles on the network. 

The milestone comes amid consistent growth in monthly sales over the last several months, highlighting interest and adoption within Polygon's NFT ecosystem. CryptoSlam data shows that since November 2024, monthly sales in Polygon have been on an upward trend. 

The sales volume started from $16.3 million in November 2024 and increased each month, reaching nearly $20 million in December, $25 million in January 2025 and $37 million in February. 

The momentum has continued throughout the first half of 2025, with March showing $62.5 million in sales, April rising to $71 million and May reaching $74.7 million.

CryptoSlam data shows Polygon's consistent growth throughout 2025 has been driven by sales in the real-world asset (RWA) NFT marketplace Courtyard. A majority of the NFT sales volumes within the network were from tokenized RWAs associated with Courtyard. 

The marketplace holds the record for the second-largest Polygon collection, next to DraftKings. Courtyard has an all-time sales count of $277 million, while DraftKings has $287 million. If the RWA sector continues to gain steam, the collection could take the top spot next month. 

The growth of Polygon's NFT ecosystem isn't limited to sales volumes. Transaction activity and user engagement have also surged throughout 2025. From March to May, monthly NFT transactions in the network passed 800,000. 

Unique buyers have also remained strong throughout the year, peaking at 134,000 in February. In addition, the average sales value increased to nearly $89 in May, up 242% from about $26 in November and December.

Polygon NFTs' growth has defied a broader market trend among digital collectibles. Since volumes peaked at $900 million in December 2024, monthly NFT sales went on a five-month decline, hitting their lowest point in April, when NFTs had an overall volume of $373 million. 

The downward trend was finally broken in May when NFT monthly sales rose to $430 million, a 15% uptick month-on-month. The number of users buying NFTs also increased to over 900,000 in May, up 50% from April.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Yuga Labs sells Moonbirds IP to Orange Cap Games","https://cointelegraph.com/news/yuga-labs-sells-moonbirds-ip-orange-cap-games","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 06:42:33 GMT","

 Orange Cap Games has acquired the Moonbirds, Mythics and Oddities NFT collections from Yuga Labs, just a year after the NFT conglomerate acquired them. 

Crypto gaming startup Orange Cap Games (OCG) has acquired the intellectual property of the Ethereum-based non-fungible token collection Moonbirds from Yuga Labs.

OCG said on May 30 that it bought the Moonbirds, Mythics and Oddities NFT collections from Yuga, but did not disclose details or pricing of the deal.

It comes a little over a year after Yuga acquired the three collections when it took over the company that created them, PROOF, in February.

“Moonbirds deserve a team whose whole world is the birds, and there's no one better than Orange Cap Games to help them reach their potential,” Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano said.

He added that Yuga was “laser-focused” on its original collections, which includes the once high-priced Bored Ape Yacht Club and its various spinoffs, including the Mutant Ape Yacht Club as well as its long-in-development metaverse, Otherside.

As part of the deal, Moonbirds will still launch on Otherside and any new onchain assets created by the team will be hosted on Ethereum or Yuga's layer-2 network, ApeChain.

Moonbirds have more than tripled in price to 0.9 ETH after news of the acquisition. However, the collection is still down nearly 98% from its all-time high of 38.5 ETH in April 2022, according to CoinGecko.

Yuga has continued to offload its NFT collections and intellectual properties as the NFT market has taken a sharp dive and continues to see low trading volumes.

Earlier in May, Yuga sold the intellectual property rights of CryptoPunks, considered by many to be a pioneering NFT collection, to the nonprofit organization Infinite Node Foundation. The terms of the deals were not disclosed.

In February, The Meebit Company acquired Meebits from Yuga Labs; however, Yuga still has a minority stake, with venture firm 1confirmation also being part of the deal.

Last year, Yuga sold off the IPs of two of its games, HV-MTL and Legends of the Mara, in a move to refocus the organization's core collections.

Meanwhile, on May 30, Disney announced that it had teamed up with Dapper Labs, creators of NBA Top Shot and CryptoKitties, to launch its new loyalty program. Disney+ subscribers will receive a digital pin each month.

The downtrend for NFTs is seemingly coming to an end. 

In May, unique NFT buyers increased by 50% to 936,000 from the previous month, whereas NFT volume increased to $430 million, an increase of 15% from April.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Tech, Trust and Teamwork: How the FCA & ICO are Helping Innovation Take Off","https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/06/tech-trust-and-teamwork-how-the-fca-ico-are-helping-innovation-take-off/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 15:29:43 GMT","

A joint blog from John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, and Nikhil Rathi Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

From AI to digital ID, data-driven technologies are transforming financial services. And how we harness these technologies is key to delivering the Government's mission on growth.   

But innovation only succeeds when it's underpinned by confidence to try new ideas, trust, and a joined-up regulatory approach even where it is challenging to provide clarity with the frontiers of technology moving fast.  

That's why the FCA and ICO are working closely together to support firms navigating data protection and financial regulation in a way that helps them innovate confidently. 

Done right, regulation isn't a brake on innovation. It's a bridge, connecting creativity with public trust. With the right approach, regulation becomes an enabler, providing the certainty firms need to invest, experiment, and grow responsibly. 

The FCA and ICO frequently collaborate to make it easier for firms to navigate UK financial and data protection regulations. 

In 2023, we clarified that data protection rules don't prevent banks from telling customers about better savings deals. Since then, firms have significantly ramped up their communications, with over 100 million savings messages sent out. A small change, but a big impact. 

Similarly, we engaged firms to bust myths about barriers to sharing data between organisations and sectors in order to prevent, detect and investigate scams and fraud. More regulatory clarity, more people protected.  

Our cooperation extends to the services that we provide to innovators – ensuring that whether firms enter the FCA's AI Lab or the ICO's Regulatory Sandbox, they can have confidence that they are getting joined-up regulatory positions. 

Through the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF), our partnership continues to grow – for example through the pilot of the AI and Digital Hub alongside Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority. The DRCF is actively reviewing the pilot project and developing its refreshed offer for innovators.  

When we are made aware of challenges firms face, we look to take action. The FCA's latest joint AI survey with the Bank of England showed 85% of the 118 financial services firms surveyed were currently using or planning to use AI. 33% of firms cited data protection as a constraint on AI adoption and 20% cited FCA regulations.  

That's why we hosted a roundtable on May 9 with industry leaders to better understand the challenges firms face when deploying AI, and to explore how we can support responsible innovation and personal information use.  

What came through was very little about specific regulations standing in the way of innovation.  

Rather firms understand the broad rules, but many – especially smaller ones – want clearer examples of ‘what good looks like' in practice and more opportunities for engagement to build confidence in trying new technologies.  

So what are we doing about it? The ICO has already published extensive guidance on AI. To support good practice into the future we will be developing a statutory code of practice for organisations developing or deploying AI and automated decision making – enabling innovation while safeguarding privacy. We will also be helping firms to develop, test, and evaluate AI as part of the FCA's AI Lab.  

The FCA plans to host a roundtable with smaller firms later this year to better understand challenges around AI adoption. The new DRCF workplan also commits regulators to develop our collective understanding of how one another's regulatory regimes might apply to AI – including agentic AI systems - and work to identify and resolve any points of conflict.  

Firms are concerned about who holds responsibility when AI tools are developed by third parties, particularly when they make automated decisions that impact their customers or when things go wrong. This can lead to reluctance, especially under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime.  

As part of the ICO's consultation series on generative AI, the ICO published detailed analysis on allocating controllership across the generative AI supply chain. The FCA has also provided information on the responsibility of firms when seeking to adopt generative AI.  

We know some firms have been able to move forward with confidence in line with their risk appetite, while others find these to be complex issues. We will continue to work together and with other regulators in the DRCF to explain our expectations, while recognising many choices are about firms' own risk appetites and choices.  

Some firms simply aren't aware of the tools and services already available including the Digital Sandbox, Supercharged Sandbox and AI Live Testing within the FCA's Innovation Hub. The ICO also offers the Innovation Advice Service, Regulatory Sandbox and Innovation Hub under its Innovation Services.  

We're increasing visibility of these services and signposting practical help.  

The DRCF workplan also notes how we will be cooperating over the coming year to support regulatory clarity for financial services firms. This includes continued engagement on the Consumer Duty and its intersections with data protection, supporting the development of open finance data sharing, sharing insights on scams and fraud mitigation efforts and convening a DRCF symposium on digital ID.  

The message from industry was clear: regulation is not the main blocker to innovation but uncertainty and lack of familiarity are. We want to reduce that uncertainty. We can support in building familiarity, while firms themselves are also developing their capabilities. All this means being clearer, more joined-up, and more visible with the support we offer.  

But this isn't something regulators can do alone. We need firms and trade bodies to keep talking to us – not just when there's a problem, real or perceived, but earlier in the innovation journey.  

We can help firms do things differently. But we need their insight to do things better. 

With regulatory agility and confidence to innovate and invest in new technologies, businesses will provide the UK with the fuel to power economic growth.

The UK's data regulator has announced plans to relocate its national headquarters to Manchester in what the city has described as a landmark move.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has agreed a lease for a 20,000 sq ft facility at No.3 Circle Square in Manchester's city centre.

The site is owned by Bruntwood SciTech, a prominent property developer focused on the science and technology sectors backed by Bruntwood, L&G and Greater Manchester Pension Fund.

The Manchester facility will position the ICO alongside fellow tenants Roku, BlueSkeye AI, Avalere Health and HP Enterprise.

The agency, responsible for regulating data protection and digital privacy, has said the move will give it access to a pool of highly-skilled tech workers and supports its ambition to establish a broader, more diverse workforce.

“Our relocation to Circle Square will create a working environment that better supports how we operate now and into the future,” said Jen Green, executive director of strategy and resources at the ICO.

“Moving to Manchester puts us close to universities and other organisations working in data and digital, and will also support our efforts to attract new and diverse talent and strengthen the way we engage with the wider sector.”

The move, expected to take place in autumn 2026, will see the watchdog leave its old headquarters in Wilmslow, Cheshire, where it has been based since its foundation in 1984.

“This move underlines Manchester's momentum and how Circle Square, which has recently also attracted Puma's national headquarters, is contributing to it,” added Bev Craig, leader of Manchester City Council.

“It is further evidence of how attractive our city – with a huge talent pool, access to expertise including from our world class universities, and national and global connections – is proving to employers considering the best place to be.”

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has signed for 20,000 sq ft of office space at Bruntwood SciTech's No.3 Circle Square in Manchester city centre for its new HQ.

The ICO intends to relocate to the 15-storey development from its current home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, in autumn 2026.

The £87m, 267,000 sq ft innovation hub is the latest phase of the Circle Square neighbourhood to be brought forward by Bruntwood SciTech, a joint venture between Bruntwood, L&G and Greater Manchester Pension Fund.

Josh Whiteley, commercial director at Bruntwood SciTech, said: “This latest commitment underlines our vision for Circle Square as a destination of national significance for digital, data and technology-led organisations. The ICO's decision to relocate its UK headquarters here reflects the strength of Manchester's knowledge economy and the value of being part of a dynamic innovation community.

“At Circle Square we've created an environment that brings together forward-thinking businesses, academic institutions and emerging talent in a place purpose-built for collaboration and growth. Whether they're global leaders or scaling disruptors, our customers benefit from access to tailored support, a connected ecosystem, and workspace designed to meet the needs of modern, mission-driven organisations.

“Manchester has long been recognised as one of the UK's most ambitious and innovative cities – and this letting further reinforces its position as a hub for data, digital services and policy leadership. It's also a significant milestone in Bruntwood SciTech's mission to support the UK's knowledge economy through long-term, place-based investment – ensuring that businesses have the infrastructure and community they need to thrive.”

Jen Green, executive director – strategy and resources at ICO, added: “Our relocation to Circle Square will create a working environment that better supports how we operate now and into the future. The new space will provide a more flexible, collaborative setting for our teams, with improved access to the facilities and connections we need.

“Wilmslow has been a welcome home for the ICO for 40 years, and we will continue to have a small presence in the area beyond next year. Moving to Manchester puts us close to universities and other organisations working in data and digital, and will also support our efforts to attract new and diverse talent and strengthen the way we engage with the wider sector.”

Knight Frank and Avison Young advised Bruntwood SciTech and the ICO respectively.

 Taiwan-based exchange BitoPro confirmed an $11.5 million crypto exploit weeks after the breach, saying user funds and withdrawals were unaffected. 

Update June 2, 12:26 pm UTC: This article has been updated to include quotes from Hacken analysts.

Taiwan-based cryptocurrency exchange BitoPro confirmed a security breach that led to the loss of more than $11.5 million in digital assets from its hot wallets on May 8.

The suspicious transactions, which occurred across hot wallets on Ethereum, Tron, Solana and Polygon, saw asset outflows to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) where they were later marked as sold, according to onchain investigator ZachXBT.

Despite the incident, BitoPro did not disclose the exploit on X or Telegram for several weeks, ZachXBT said in a June 2 post on X.

Blockchain data shows assets were deposited into cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash or bridged to Bitcoin via THORChain, patterns often employed by hackers to make funds anonymous and untraceable.

On May 9, BitoPro announced a maintenance period for the exchange, which was resolved on the same day. However, many users have since reported being unable to withdraw USDt (USDT).

Cointelegraph reached out to BitoPro for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.

Three weeks after the incident, BitoPro confirmed that it had suffered a wallet exploit. In a June 2 Telegram post, the exchange said the breach occurred during a wallet system upgrade, when an attacker exploited an “old hot wallet” during internal fund reallocation.

The platform has “sufficient virtual asset reserves,” and user withdrawals are “completely unaffected,” BitoPro stated.

Deposits, withdrawals and all trading functions remained operational, while a third-party blockchain security firm was commissioned to trace the stolen funds, it added.

In a push for more transparency, BitoPro said it would share the new hot wallet address for external investigation in the “near future.”

Hackers continue targeting the growing value locked into exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

On May 22, decentralized exchange Cetus was exploited for over $220 million, but validators managed to freeze $162 million, which was subsequently returned to the protocol after a governance vote on May 30. 

On June 2, modular blockchain network Nervos was exploited for $3 million in digital assets.

The stolen funds were all swapped to Ether (ETH) via Tornado Cash, while the team “has paused all contracts and is actively investigating the incident,” Cyvers Alerts said in a June 2 X post.

It took the attackers over six hours and multiple failed attempts to steal the funds, according to analysts from blockchain security firm Hacken.

“Access control failures are now one of the most critical threats in Web3,” a Hacken analyst told Cointelegraph, adding that “Extractor” was purpose-built to catch warning signs for similar exploits in real-time.

Cryptocurrency is a growing sector in finance, influencing how we approach financial systems and investment opportunities. Each digital asset in the market has its own features and potential. But with thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence, knowing which ones might be right for you can be a challenge.

Whether you are new to digital assets or just looking to stay informed in the global financial conversation, understanding the more prominent cryptocurrencies can provide perspective on how the space is developing. 

Here are the top 15 digital assets that stand out for their market value, innovation, and adoption potential.

2 / 17

Classified as a stablecoin — a type of cryptocurrency intended to maintain a consistent value — DAI is designed to minimize volatility through smart contracts (digital contracts stored on a blockchain) that adjust for supply and demand. It's governed by the MakerGAO protocol and backed by overcollateralized cryptocurrency assets, meaning the value of the collateral backing the crypto is always higher than the total value of the issued DAI. 

The goal of DAI is to maintain a ratio of 1 DAI to $1 USD. DAI is generally more stable than other cryptocurrencies, but it may fluctuate during times of market stress. DAI is widely used in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem — a system of financial applications built on blockchain technology that allows users to borrow, lend, trade, and earn interest without relying on traditional banks. It appeals to those who value decentralization and transparency.

3 / 17

Tronix is the native cryptocurrency of the TRON blockchain platform. It gives users more control over their data and enables developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) — programs that run on a distributed network of computers rather than a central server. This decentralized approach often increases security and user control.

After purchasing TRX through a cryptocurrency exchange, you can use it to tip content creators and purchase games and apps on platforms built on the TRON network.

4 / 17

The SHIB cryptocurrency started as a meme-based joke, but it quickly became popular among crypto investors because of its community-driven nature and viral appeal. It was created by an anonymous figure known only as “Ryoshi” to compete with Dogecoin, Elon Musk's favorite memecoin. It enticed buyers and captured attention with its playful mascot. SHIB also immediately stood out because it was one of the first to be controlled by community members who could actively participate.

5 / 17

Like DAI, USDC is a stablecoin designed to keep the value of one unit as close to $1 USD as possible. The biggest difference between the two is that USDC is backed by fiat currency, government-issued money not backed by a physical commodity like gold and silver, which includes U.S. government securities and cash. 

USDC originally launched on the Ethereum blockchain but is now available on multiple platforms, including Polygon, Base, and Avalanche, increasing its accessibility across crypto ecosystems.

6 / 17

Tether Limited introduced its cryptocurrency several years before USDC, DAI, and other stablecoins entered the market. Like USDC, Tether is pegged to the U.S. dollar, so its value remains stable over time. USDT is available on more than a dozen platforms, so it has a relatively high trading volume compared to other stablecoins.

7 / 17

Instead of facilitating individual transactions, Ripple's XRP gives banks and other financial institutions a faster, more secure way to transfer money across borders. Another difference between XRP and other digital currencies is that it provides liquidity and converts one fiat currency to another. For example, XRP can be used to convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan in Ripple's cross-border payment system.

8 / 17

Polygon isn't a separate network — it's a sidechain or scaling solution designed to work alongside Ethereum. Because of its popularity, Ethereum can be slow and costly. High transaction fees make it difficult for users to earn a return on small investments. Polygon helps by processing transactions off the Ethereum chain, reducing costs and preventing delays. MATIC, Polygon's native token, can be used for purchases, staking rewards on your crypto balance, and voting on proposed network upgrades.

9 / 17

Developed by Ava Labs, the Avalanche network offers a faster and more scalable alternative to Ethereum and other high-traffic blockchain platforms. AVAX, its native token, is used for staking (earning rewards), transactions, and trading. What makes the Avalanche network stand out is its eco-friendly design. AVAX uses less energy than proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, appealing to investors who want to trade crypto while minimizing their carbon footprint.

Telegram, a cloud-based messaging service, originally developed the Telegram Open Network (TON) with the intention of launching a cryptocurrency known as Gram. The company raised more than $1 billion in a private token sale, but had to abandon its plans when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit alleging that Telegram raised the funds by selling unregistered securities.

After Telegram withdrew from the development and launch of the TON blockchain and Gram token, the project continued to develop under the name “The Open Network” and became community-led. Telegram continues to allow its users to send TON cryptocurrency directly within the messaging app, despite no longer controlling the project.

Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus created Dogecoin as a satire to highlight the volatility of the early cryptocurrency market. While it started off as just a memecoin, DOGE gained traction, becoming a viable alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Elon Musk further boosted DOGE by frequently referencing it on social media, and eventually using its ticker symbol as the shorthand for his Department of Government Efficiency. Like other cryptocurrencies, DOGE can be used for online tipping, charitable donations, investing, and quick, low-cost payments.

Named after Ada Lovelace, a mathematician whose work helped make modern computer programming possible, ADA is the native coin for the Cardano platform. While Cardano supports smart contracts, it doesn't consume as much energy as other blockchain platforms, giving users a more sustainable option. Cardano also uses a unique proof-of-stake system to validate transactions, making the platform more secure and scalable.

The Solana platform offers the same basic functions as other blockchain platforms, but with faster transaction speeds. You can send money to someone thousands of miles away in seconds. Solana's founders also wanted to keep fees low, making the platform highly attractive to users who want to make small payments rather than deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Developed by Binance, one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, BNB enables users to earn rewards, send payments, play games, and cover transaction fees. One reason for BNB's popularity is that Binance regularly burns a portion of its digital tokens, reducing supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining cryptocurrency.

Less than a year after Ethereum launched, hackers stole $50 million from the DAO, one of the network's largest decentralized apps. The theft led to a split in the Ethereum community and resulted in the creation of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Despite this, the platform's momentum stayed strong, and developers continued to use Ethereum to build decentralized applications and make payments, which resulted in unprecedented growth. Ethereum has even been able to reduce its energy consumption by switching from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system — a move that began with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.

As the original digital payment token introduced to the public in 2008, Bitcoin is used by investors and consumers for value exchange — trading digital assets for other assets — and purchases. 

Developed by an anonymous group or individual using the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto,” BTC is one of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrencies. This worldwide cryptocurrency is open source, meaning it isn't owned by any one person and everyone can use it. 

It was also one of the first cryptocurrencies to receive support from major companies, including Tesla, PayPal, and Microsoft. Since its launch, Bitcoin has undergone several updates, making it faster, more efficient, and more scalable.

The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) has agreed to form a technical committee to draft a framework for digital and virtual assets, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday.

The PCC was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country's financial landscape.

According to a press release by the finance ministry, the meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and attended by PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, governor of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and government officials.

“The meeting focused on the draft regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets in Pakistan, aiming to align with international standards and evolving technological trends,” the press release said.

It added that the participants discussed options for establishing “an autonomous regulatory authority to oversee and regulate the digital finance and crypto ecosystem in the country”.

“It was agreed to constitute a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, Law Division, and IT & Telecom Division,” the ministry said, adding that the committee will review the draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure to be reviewed by the PCC in the next meeting.

The press release said that the PCC members gave valuable input for “a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment” which aims to promote “responsible blockchain adoption, safeguarding investors, and advancing financial inclusion”.

The finance minister appreciated the contributions of all stakeholders and reaffirmed the government's commitment to creating a “future-ready financial infrastructure that supports innovation while maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance”, it added.

 
 


Last week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance held a meeting, where PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations. Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that the ban on cryptocurrency was still in place across Pakistan, stressing the need for its regulation during the meeting.

The same day, Saqib had unveiled the country's first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.

Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal. However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.

In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.

The US Department of the Treasury has taken action against Funnull Technology Inc. for enabling massive pig butchering crypto scams. This move targets the backbone of fraudulent virtual currency investment platforms, aiming to protect Americans from billions in losses.

The US government has taken a major step to fight online financial scams, particularly those involving cryptocurrency. On May 29, 2025, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced strict financial penalties (sanctions) against Funnull Technology Inc.

This Philippines-based company and its administrator, Liu Lizhi, are accused of providing the essential tools and support for a huge number of fake online investment schemes. These widespread frauds, aka pig butchering scams, have already caused Americans to lose billions of dollars, and the government's action aims to stop these criminals by cutting off their financial lifelines.

Pig butchering refers to a sophisticated type of scam where criminals build trust with victims, often through social media or dating apps, over an extended period. Once a relationship is established, the scammers convince victims to invest in fake virtual currency platforms, promising high returns.  Victims are led to believe their investments are growing, only to find they cannot withdraw funds, and the scammers disappear, taking all their invested money.

Reportedly, in 2024, US citizens lost billions of dollars to these scams, with Funnull-linked operations being responsible for over $200 million in reported losses. The average individual loss for victims linked to Funnull's network was over $150,000.

Reportedly, Funnull Technology Inc. was a key player in fraudulent activities by buying large numbers of IP addresses from global cloud service providers and selling them to cybercriminals. This allowed them to create fake websites that resembled legitimate investment platforms. Funnull also provided web design templates and used domain generation algorithms to create similar website names.

In 2024, Funnull acquired web development code and used it to redirect visitors to scam and online gambling sites, some connected to Chinese criminal money laundering. Liu Lizhi, a Chinese national, managed Funnull's daily operations, overseeing tasks like assigning domain names for fraud, phishing, and illegal gambling sites.

OFAC's sanctions included two cryptocurrency addresses, Ethereum and TRON, likely used for Funnull's services. These addresses are linked to other illicit financial activities, including Huione Pay, a company identified by FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) as a primary money laundering concern. The FBI has issued a cybersecurity advisory (PDF) to help the private sector identify and remove websites linked to Funnull.

As a result of these sanctions, all property and assets of Funnull and Liu Lizhi within the United States or under US control are blocked. Additionally, US individuals and companies are prohibited from doing business with them and any entity owned 50% or more by Funnull or Liu. The public is encouraged to report any online scams or illegal activities to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).

Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, has introduced a new structured bond that tracks the price of bitcoin BTC$104,470.02 and the dollar-to-ruble exchange rate.

Initially available over the counter to a limited pool of qualified investors, the bonds let holders earn based on two variables: the future performance of BTC in U.S. dollars and any strengthening of the dollar relative to the ruble.

Investors can access these instruments without opening a crypto wallet or using foreign crypto exchanges, with all transactions being processed in rubles within Russia's “legal and infrastructure systems.”

The bank plans to list similar structured products with cryptocurrency exposure on the Moscow Exchange, according to a recent announcement.

Sberbank, per the announcement, is also launching a bitcoin futures product via its SberInvestments platform on June 4, aligning with the launch of the product on the Moscow Exchange.

The announcement comes just after the Bank of Russia said financial institutions in the country can offer cryptocurrency-linked instruments to qualified investors.

This latest acquisition was made at an average price of $106,495 per bitcoin, which adjusts the company's overall average purchase price to $70,023 per bitcoin.

To fund this purchase, Strategy utilized a series of at-the-market (ATM) equity offerings, drawing from the perpetual preferred share classes STRK and STRF. 

Between May 26 and June 1, the company raised capital by selling 353,511 shares of STRK preferred stock for $36.2 million and 374,968 shares of STRF preferred stock for $38.4 million. 

At the current market price of $104,000 per bitcoin, the company's total bitcoin holdings are now valued at roughly $60 billion, reinforcing its position as the largest corporate holder of bitcoin and underlining its continued commitment to bitcoin as a core treasury asset.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","The Dark Times Are Here. Where Is Bitcoin?","https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/02/the-dark-times-are-here-where-is-bitcoin","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 13:54:30 GMT","

Bitcoin emerged in the darkness of the global financial crisis in 2008. The Bitcoin white paper represented a genuine breakthrough in thinking about coordinating complex systems in a decentralized environment. Though not every idea in it was new, Bitcoin's combination was ground-breaking in its scope and potential for reliability.

The Bitcoin white paper was something else as well: a political statement about the inherent untrustworthiness of central banks, banking regulators and governments more generally. Satoshi Nakamoto expressed strong distrust of central banks in early emails introducing Bitcoin, and the Genesis Block itself contains a copy of a London Times headline from 2009, announcing that Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer was considering a second bank bailout.

Bitcoin is supposed to be an alternative to the corrupt and corruptible governments, a bulwark against totalitarian states that removes their power to debase currency and seize assets from the population. Proof-of-Work, its consensus mechanism, is designed to prevent bad actors from corrupting the overall path of the network and self-custody means that no central authority can expropriate your assets. It was designed not just as a system of money, but a source of strength and independence in dark times.

But, now the dark times are here, and Bitcoin is missing its moment. The U.S. dollar is the world's leading safe-haven asset, and it is under attack. Huge deficits (6.7% of GDP) and a high debt ratio (121%) along with a deeply dysfunctional government should point to a lot of good reasons for bitcoin to soar. It's mostly treading water (priced at $104,500 as we publish this).

I can think of several reasons why. First, Bitcoin simply does not have the track record and staying power of other safe-haven assets. It is not that people are not seeking alternative safe havens; they are. The dollar is sinking against foreign currencies and gold, the oldest of all safe-haven assets, is hitting new highs. Fears about the regulatory position of bitcoin have eased, but access is still limited for many investors.

Despite its recent history as a risk-on asset, in theory, bitcoin could be the very best asset in the world for de-risking a portfolio. Its issuance is fixed and the Proof of Work system, if no longer state-of-the-art, is still extremely well-proven. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin and, no matter how high the price goes, it is not possible to create any more of it. Unlike gold and other precious metals, when prices increase, ever more challenging mining options become feasible, and more gold gets mined.

So, is this game over for bitcoin? I think not. Though it would be nice if bitcoin were soaring, this moment may simply have come too soon for bitcoin to be the haven of choice. Fear not; this is certainly not the world's last economic and political crisis. Between now and the next one, bitcoin has some work to do.

Bitcoin has one assignment before the next upheaval hits: Prove it can still evolve.

That means fixing the three doubts now blocking mainstream capital. First, make self‑custody idiot‑proof—hardware, recovery, and insurance. Serious investors do not want to go dumpster-diving to find their lost hard drives. Memories of past crises, including caps on insurance and “bail-ins” for wealthy investors, are a reminder that if they are “not your keys, they are not your coins.”

Second, ship a quantum‑resilient signature scheme before quantum computers make private keys passé. Quantum computing's future path is uncertain, but clever people are slowly but steadily making progress in this space. The risk to network security is real, even if the timeline is uncertain. The recent approval of NIST post-quantum signature schemes suggests that this reality is approaching.

Third, reverse the miner‑consolidation trend with incentives that keep hash power distributed. Ethereum has done a great job working on resilience, distributing staking activity and building multiple client models. Bitcoin is lagging far behind in this space.

We know hard pivots are possible. Five years ago, Ethereum's fees were choking growth; one merge and a roll‑up boom later, it looks nimble and more decentralized than ever. Bitcoin does not need to imitate Ethereum, but it must borrow its urgency. If the community can tick those three boxes, the next flight‑to‑safety could finally land on bitcoin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","How James Wynn's $100M Implosion Is Familiar Leverage Tale","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/how-james-wynn-s-usd100m-implosion-is-a-leverage-tale-as-old-as-time","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 14:04:30 GMT","

Derivatives trader James Wynn emerged out of the woodworks a few weeks ago, flaunting 9-figure bitcoin positions on HyperLiquid as he went on a seemingly undefeatable run that culminated in around $100 million worth of profit.

But that run, as is often the case with highly-leveraged crypto derivative trading, came to a shocking end — Wynn liquidated his entire account despite BTC only moving by a couple of percent.

""I've decided to give perp trading a break,"" Wynn wrote on X after the final blow up. ""Its been a fun ride. Approximately $4 million into $100 million and then back down to a total account loss of $17.5 million.""

Wynn's story is nothing new. In 2021, for instance, the industry saw the public rise of Alex Wice — a poker player turned derivatives trader — that also lost $100 million after making huge bets with leverage. And even in 2017, in the BitMEX trollbox days, pseudonymous figures like SteveS and TheBoot used to boast about their 10s of millions in profit and loss before forever fading into obscurity.

Cryptocurrency derivatives can be an incredibly useful tool; if a trader holds 500 BTC ($52 million) and believes the market will go down, they can hedge their position by going short -- reducing exposure without having to sell their spot assets, which in itself could cause slippage or front running.

An array of delta neutral strategies can also be employed like the classic basis trade that became popular amongst institutional traders on the bitcoin CME futures market, which involve simultaneously going long and short to harvest the funding rate as a yield.

But issues begin to form when crypto traders, the majority of whom are inexperienced retail traders, use platforms that offer up to 100x leverage.

Imagine a newcomer had $5,000 in trading capital, sure, they could make a few intraday trades and make $50 or $100 per trade, but if they used 100x they could make $50,000 per 10% move. This is the slippery slope of gambling-induced emotional trading that many fall into.

Data from NewTrading shows that just 3% of day traders make a profit and 1% do so consistently. And the game becomes even tougher when, in this case, traders are opening positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

James Wynn's downfall came in part due to his inability to deal with the emotional swings of trading, but also the sheer size of his positions.

Wynn would often post about getting partially liquidated and re-opening the position at a worse break-even point. This is indicative of a trader out of his depth through over-leverage. As Wynn used in some cases 40x leverage, his liquidation point left no margin for error, this meant that astute traders or trading firms could hunt his liquidation point and force him into an impulsive trade.

HyperLiquid is a relatively liquid derivatives venue, it has millions in market depth within 1% of an asset's price but it does not have hundreds of million, which was required to absorb Wynn's leveraged positions. 

In reality, Wynn's trade thesis was based around the Bitcoin Las Vegas event and any potential announcements that could lift bitcoin above a new record high. If this came into fruition, Wynn would have had hundreds of millions in unrealized profit, but unfortunately in his case, bitcoin began to slump during the conference as speeches from Michael Saylor and Ross Ulbricht failed to spark any upside momentum.

The lack of volatility and Wynn's insatiable appetite to keep betting led to him getting chopped out of the market. His losses became so notable that one trader decided to counter trade every position by going short at the same time as Wynn went long, this trader made $17 million, according to Lookonchain.

As the sun finally set on Wynn's derivatives journey he announced he was ""going back to the trenches"" to trade meme coins, of course.

 Ether led last week's $286 million of net inflows to crypto ETPs, while Bitcoin investment products saw outflows of $8 million, CoinShares reported. 

Cryptocurrency investment products maintained their multi-week inflow streak last week despite significant selling pressure stemming from Bitcoin's drop to $103,000.

Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded $286 million of inflows in the week ending May 30, bringing a seven-week run of inflows to $10.9 billion, CoinShares reported on June 2.

Despite the inflows, total assets under management (AUM) declined from the all-time high of $187 billion to $177 billion by the weekend amid market volatility triggered by uncertainty over US tariffs, said CoinShares' head of research, James Butterfill.

The new inflows came as Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled about 6% from $110,000 last Monday to an intraweek low of $103,400 by May 30, according to data from CoinGecko.

Ether (ETH) ETPs led last week's crypto ETP buying with inflows totaling $321 million, marking the strongest run since late December 2024 and reflecting a significant sentiment improvement.

Bitcoin ETPs saw $8 million in outflows after a major flow reversal following a New York Court decision to declare US tariffs illegal, Butterfill said.

XRP (XRP) investment products posted the biggest outflows last week, totaling $28 million. The outflows marked a second week running of losses for XRP, Butterfill noted.

BlackRock's iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) led inflows among issuers last week despite seeing massive outflows from Bitcoin ETFs at the end of the week.

According to CoinShares, iShares ETFs saw $790 million of inflows, with YTD inflows surging to $12.4 billion. At the same time, iShares' AUM slipped from $74.8 billion in the previous week to $72.9 billion last week, reflecting a downward trend in Bitcoin ETFs.

ARK Invest and 21Shares' crypto investment products saw the biggest losses among issuers last week, totaling $282 million and bringing YTD flows to $22 million of outflows.

The flow reversal in Bitcoin ETPs came after six weeks of healthy inflows in BTC products, with the new losses being attributed to many factors supporting the overall decline of crypto markets last week.

According to Cointelegraph Markets, crypto prices have historically seen mixed performances in the month of June, suggesting potential seasonal weakness.

Previous reports also suggested that some investors have been taking advantage of Bitcoin surging past $110,000, with long-term investors quietly capitalizing on the recent price drops.

Ether's renewed growth followed a long bearish period, which forced some trading firms to drop ETH support in early May and view it “like a memecoin.” On the other hand, some ETH supporters speculated that Ether's decline in May marked the asset's bottom, which hinted at a potential reversal of the negative trend.

According to CoinGecko, Ether was trading at $2,486 by publishing time, down from $2,771 on May 28. The cryptocurrency has added 36% to its value in the past 30 days.

 Bitcoin fell 11% from its $111K all-time highs as traders say BTC price could drop to $97K if key support levels don't hold amid rising trade tensions. 

Key takeaways:

The emergence of a bear flag on the four-hour chart projects a Bitcoin price drop to $97,000.

Traders say BTC price may drop as low as $85,000 if key support levels are broken, including the $100,000 psychological level and the yearly opening at around $92,000.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price is forming a classic bearish pattern on lower time frames, triggering fears that a breakdown could lead to a drop toward $97,000.

Bitcoin's price action has formed a textbook bear flag pattern on the four-hour chart, a bearish continuation setup formed when the price consolidates upward in a parallel channel after a sharp downward move.

In Bitcoin's case, the flag began forming after BTC bottomed at nearly $103,100 on May 31. The consolidation persisted over the weekend, with the price continuously retesting the support line of the flag.

The bearish continuation will be confirmed once the price breaks below the lower boundary of the flag at $104,800. The pattern's projected downside target is now sitting near $97,690, measured after adding the height of the initial flagpole to the breakout point.

Momentum indicators, including the relative strength index (RSI), are also supportive, with the RSI currently at 44, suggesting that the market conditions still favour the downside.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the BTC/USD pair has dropped 6.3% from its all-time highs above $111,000. 

While BTC price closed 11% higher in May, traders are questioning which direction the price might take moving forward. The month of June has historically produced mixed results with an average of 0.3% losses.

For crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, the mid-range at $99,600 and the previous all-time high at $108,000 are crucial levels to watch during the first week of June. 

“I think there's a good chance that the first week is likely a move that can be faded upon seeing the first signs of local reversals” at either of these points, the trader said in a June 1 post on X.

An accompanying chart showed that a break above $108,000 would see the BTC/USD pair rise toward its $111,900 all-time high, where it would likely meet strong resistance, occasioning a drop back into the range. 

Similarly, a break below $99,600 would see the pair drop lower before finding solace from the 200-day simple moving average at $97,600. 

“BTC looks like it has started a larger correction, which is likely to take it into the 2nd week of June,” said fellow analyst AlphaBTC in a June 2 post on X.

According to the analyst, a breakdown of the bear flag in the four-hour timeframe could see Bitcoin's price drop toward the $102,000 demand zone. Losing this support would bring the yearly open above $92,000 into the picture.

“The question will be what happens at around 92K?” AlphaBTC asked, adding that if it provides a buying opportunity, BTC could rebound from here to initiate a sustained recovery into price discovery.

Conversely, if tariff tensions continue, BTC may drop further toward $85,000, as shown in the chart below.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin traders are analysing the weekly and monthly closes for cues as to where BTC price action may be headed next, with the psychological levels at $100,000 and $97,000 remaining key areas of interest.

 Meta shareholders shut down a proposal to assess whether Bitcoin should be added to its balance sheet, with just 0.08% of votes in favor of the idea. 

Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to assess whether the tech giant should add Bitcoin to its balance sheet.

A “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal put before shareholders received 3.92 million votes in favor — a mere 0.08% of the total — while nearly 5 billion voters decided against the measure, a May 28 regulatory filing shows. 

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company's voting power, according to an April regulatory statement, which could indicate that he voted against the proposal.

The lopsided vote followed a shareholder proposal in January from Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who called on Meta to invest a portion of its $72 billion cash and cash equivalents position into Bitcoin (BTC), claiming it would be a hedge against inflation.

“Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28% of Meta's total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value,” he argued in his supporting statement.

Peck, who serves as Bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive, also noted that Meta's second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable.

The Bitcoiner submitted the proposal on behalf of his family's shares in the social media giant.

Peck has also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon last year on behalf of the conservative think tank, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR).

Microsoft shareholders voted against Peck's proposal in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to allocate at least 5% of the company's assets to Bitcoin.

Nick Cowan, CEO of fintech firm Valereum, told Cointelegraph in December that Amazon has a better track record of adopting emerging tech and exploring novel investments than many other Big Tech companies.

However, the opportunity cost of holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin instead of investing it into research and development or acquisitions may weigh heavily on shareholders, he said.

While the Bitcoin proposals were knocked back by Meta and Microsoft, publicly traded firms from all around the world have started to buy Bitcoin.

BitcoinTreasures.NET data shows that 116 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with some of the newest entrants being GameStop and Swedish health tech firm H100, which both bought Bitcoin for the first time last month.

Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,250 Bitcoin — worth $60.9 billion — while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, each hold over $1 billion in Bitcoin.

AI Found a ‘Magic Potion' That Can Bring Dead Batteries Back to Life

Electric vehicles leave behind mountains of dead lithium-ion batteries. A new “injection” brings them back to life

By You Xiaoying edited by Andrea Thompson

A team of researchers in China has found a way to bring dead lithium-ion batteries back to life, potentially reducing both the amount of waste that's quickly piling up from spent electric vehicle (EV) batteries and the need to produce as many new ones.

“The team's work is revolutionary because it provides a new idea to reuse end-of-life batteries,” says Jiangong Zhu of Tongji University in Shanghai, who researches battery use in EVs and was not involved in the new study, which was published recently in Nature.

The amount of spent lithium-ion batteries that need disposal is expected to soar from an estimate of 900,000 metric tons this year to 20.5 million metric tons by 2040, according to a report released by the United Nations Development Program last September. As the world's leader in deploying EVs, China is already handling 2.8 million metric tons of retired cells ever year, according to Huang Jianzhong, chairman of China Electronic Energy Saving Technology Association, a government-approved trade body.

With consumer markets and waste piles both growing rapidly, Yue Gao, a chemist at Fudan University in Shanghai, and his colleagues anticipated a rising demand for longer-life lithium-ion batteries.

An EV battery usually reaches the end of its lifetime, or when its capacity drops below 80 percent of its original level, after about eight to 10 years. The battery accounts for around 40 percent of the cost of the entire vehicle.

Gao and his colleagues wanted to find a molecule that could replenish a dead cell by infusing it with lithium ions. But “we had no idea what kinds of molecules could do that job or what their chemical structures would be, so we used machine learning to help us,” says Chihao Zhao, a Ph.D. student at Fudan University, who is a member of Gao's team but was not a co-author of the new study.

Lithium ions were restored to a spent battery pack by injecting an electrolyte solution.

Zhao Chihao

The researchers used an artificial intelligence model trained on the rules of chemistry. They fed it a database of electrochemical reactions and had it look for molecules that would meet their requirements, such as dissolving well in an electrolyte solution and being relatively cheap to produce. The model recommended three candidates, and the team identified one of them, a salt called lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3), as ideal.

The researchers tested this lithium-ion salt by dissolving it in an electrolyte solution, which allows ions to pass between a cell's positive and negative terminals. Gao likens this to giving a human patient an IV. “If we can give an injection to a sick person to help them recover,” he says, “why can't we have a magic potion for drained batteries, too?”

Gao and his colleagues found that the chemical mixture could significantly prolong the lifespan of a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cell. An LFP battery that powers an EV can typically be charged and then discharged about 2,000 times before it is considered “dead” (when its capacity is below the 80 percent mark). By adding the electrolyte whenever the battery neared that threshold, the team was able to restore most of the cell's capacity each time—and it carried on working almost as well as a new battery. By the end of the experiment, the cell regained 96 percent capacity after nearly 12,000 charge-discharge cycles.

A follow-up experiment showed the method also worked on NMC (nickel, manganese and cobalt) lithium-ion batteries, Gao says.

Fudan University is currently working with China-based battery-material maker Zhejiang Yongtai New Material to commercialize the method, according to a social media post published by Yongtai. Gao envisions a widespread system of “battery-boosting stations” where EV owners will be able to bring dead power sources to be rejuvenated.

The idea is “promising,” says Chenguang Liu of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in China, who researches battery materials and was not involved in the study. But he cites a few challenges. For example, the method will need to be made compatible with various battery chemistries—and the safety of the revived cells must be tested.

And EV power comes not from a single, simple cell but from a battery pack that can comprise hundreds or even thousands of cells, along with heat-control systems and other components. “We have only conducted experiments on cells, and we need to find a way to apply it onto a whole battery pack,” Gao says.

His team's method is the closest thing yet to a “direct-recycling process” for EV batteries in China today, says Hans Eric Melin, an analyst of battery reuse and recycling and managing director of Circular Energy Storage, a London-based consultancy. (In China, some degraded EV batteries are currently used to power other products that require lower energy outputs, such as electric mopeds and energy storage stations. Others are crushed and shredded into industrial waste called “black mass,” from which valuable raw materials, such as lithium and graphite, can be harvested.)

Melin believes there could be commercial opportunities for the researchers' proposal—though he says the market is likely to be small because the lifespan of an EV battery can be as long as 15 years. It will also require battery packs that are designed in a way to allow for injections of the electrolyte, he notes.

“The question,” he adds, “is whether the benefits are worth it if [the required changes] in some way interfere with other design aspects necessary for the battery's performance.”

Black Death Plague That Killed Millions Became Less Fatal because of This Genetic Tweak

Reducing the copies of one gene in the bubonic plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, made it less deadly but potentially more transmissible

A small genetic change makes the bacterium that caused the plague less fatal but possibly more transmissible, allowing for greater disease spread in smaller populations, a study in Science reports.

The bacterium Yersinia pestis caused the Black Death — killing up to 50 million people in the mid-fourteenth century — as well as an earlier plague across the Mediterranean in the sixth century ad . The bacteria still circulate in low levels in parts of the United States, Africa and Asia, and are typically transmitted to humans by infected fleas carried by rats or other rodents.

Previous research found that some strains of Y. pestis had reduced amounts of pla, a gene associated with disease severity, but it was unclear why, says Ravneet Sidhu, a palaeogeneticist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and a co-author of the latest work. “Our findings in this study characterize a case in which a pandemic-causing pathogen has independently evolved to cause what we believe is a slightly weaker form of the disease,” she says.

To understand the impact of the genetic change, the team infected mice with modern strains of Y. pestis that had normal levels of pla , had reduced levels of the gene or were unable to express it at all. When the bacteria were injected beneath the skin to mimic the form of plague that affects lymph nodes, mice infected with the reduced- pla strain lived for almost two days longer than did those infected with the normal strain. Mortality also decreased from 100% with the normal strain to 85% with the reduced- pla strain. However, when the team infected mice intravenously or through the nose to mimic blood- or lung-based infections, the pla -reduced strain was as fatal as the normal strain.

The team also looked at the genomes of ancient and modern strains of Y. pestis to find out how prevalent pla depletion was. Between 30% and 50% of ancient strains obtained from previously published studies showed signs of depletion, as did three modern strains, isolated from a human and two rats in 1994. Wanting to understand why pla was depleted, the researchers analysed the genetic data from these ancient and modern strains. They found that the reduction was caused by deletion of a 2,100-base-pair-long region of DNA containing the pla gene in one region of the genome, and the integration of a DNA molecule called a plasmid carrying the gene into other regions.

Sidhu says the team hypothesized that pla depletion occurred because repeated outbreaks of the plague decreased the density of rodent populations. Increasing the time for which rats were infectious would have given them more time to travel between fragmented populations, increasing the chance of them spreading the disease, she adds.

The findings show how small genetic changes can have significant effects on pathogen transmission, says Francesca Short, a microbiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “This isn't even a deletion of a gene,” she adds. It is a dosage change that has emerged multiple times in history, and the authors have plausibly linked that change to reduced virulence and potentially increased transmission, Short says.

Sidhu is hesitant to extrapolate the findings on Y. pestis to other pandemic-causing pathogens, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, because it is likely that the genetic change was favourable only at the end of outbreaks, when the more fatal strain was unable to survive. “In reality, to understand how other diseases behave, we require specific research into those diseases from multiple fields, including theoretical and experimental evolution,” Sidhu adds.

These ‘Real-Life Mermaid' Divers Have Remarkable Underwater Abilities—and Genetics

The Haenyeo, an all-female group of divers on South Korea's Jeju Island, spend much of their lives underwater without equipment—a “superpower” that may be written into their DNA

Often likened to mermaids in media reports and popular culture, South Korea's famed Haenyeo (“sea women”) spend much of the day underwater, diving without scuba gear to collect abalone, octopus, kelp and other prized seafood. Admired both culturally and scientifically, they have been plunging into the frigid waters of Jeju Island since as early as 503 C.E.

Now, for the first time, a study has found both genetic adaptations and training effects that are unique to these women and could explain how the Haenyeo withstand the intense physical stresses that come with continuous diving. The findings, published in Cell Reports, zero in on specific genetic features of the Haenyeo that allow the bodies of these divers to more efficiently control blood pressure, for example. The researchers hope closer investigations into such genetic traits could inform future approaches to certain disorders or illnesses in the general population.

“The Haenyeo are really like superhumans,” says Melissa A. Ilardo, senior author of the study and an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Utah. “You cannot watch the Haenyeo dive and not think these women have superpowers.”

It's easy to see the Haenyeo as enigmatic. For centuries, they have conspicuously maintained their own culture and style. They sport unique broad-rimmed sun visors and tattooed eyebrows, and their skin is tanned and weathered by a lifetime of wind and saltwater. After Haenyeo divers age past their diving years, they still stick close to the sea and work along the shoreline, often tying a cushion to their backside to rest on as they lay kelp out to dry. They have kept their tradition afloat through Japan's decades-long occupation of the Korean Peninsula, massacres under dictatorships and relentless industrial development. And the new study suggests that there might even be a ring of scientific truth to “superpower” analogy.

“Given that [the Haenyeo] have this unique culture, unique language—all these things that are so different—it seems obvious that there would be some genetic differences,” Ilardo says. “But that wasn't something that had ever been investigated.”

Ilardo, who studies genetics of medically resilient humans around the world at her aptly named Superhuman Lab, had previously examined the physiology of a diving people called the Bajau in Southeast Asia. Her team found the Bajau had an extra large spleens that could store additional oxygenated blood for lengthy dives.

“If one group of divers had evolved to dive, then maybe others have as well,” Ilardo says. The Haenyeo—with their long diving history—stood out to the crew at the Superhuman Lab as another population that could have developed diving advantages.

“What's interesting about studying populations who have lived in a particular environment for many, many generations is that if there's been a selective pressure in that environment, you can look at their genomes and start to pull out regions that appear to be essential for their survival,” explains Tatum Simonson, a geneticist at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the new study. Those essential genetic irregularities are “probably linked to some aspect of physiology that has been beneficial over time in that environment.”

For the new study on the Haenyeo, the Superhuman Lab collaborated with physiologists from South Korea to simulate the effects of submersion on the divers themselves, compared with non-Haenyeo Jeju residents and mainland South Koreans. Participants laid on their stomach with their head over a bowl of cold water, periodically plunging their face under while the researchers measured how their reflexive submersion responses changed their heart rate and blood pressure.

The participants were all from the same country, yet they showed striking differences in these changes. Ilardo thinks that could be a direct result of natural selection. For example, “sleep apnea—which is kind of like unintentional diving in your sleep [in that it reduces oxygen availability]—increases the risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy,” she explains, adding that these can include preeclampsia (a pregnancy complication that can dangerously raise blood pressure). The Haenyeo are known to continue diving while pregnant, she notes. “If diving is increasing [a Haenyeo diver's] risk of preeclampsia, that could take out an entire generation,” Ilardo says.

But the Haenyeo aren't known to have a particularly high risk of hypertensive pregnancy disorders, and they have obviously birthed many generations of babies. Ilardo's research suggests it's likely that a gene allowing for better regulation of blood pressure has been passed down through the years.

Interestingly, the team found that all Jeju residents—even those without a Haenyeo family member—had a similar genetic variation that suppressed a reflexive blood pressure increase when diving. This suggests that the variation may have naturally spread throughout the island. It would also support Jeju's surprisingly low stroke death rate, which is around 24.3 per 100,000 for not just the Haenyeo but all of the island's residents—lower than the mainland city of Seoul's rate of 25.7 per 100,000 and the U.S.'s rate of 37 per 100,000.

But Ilardo notes that some physiological differences, such as heartbeat changes, were unique to the Haenyeo. During the face-dunking experiment, Haenyeo participants' heart rates slowed by 50 percent more, on average, compared with nondiver Jeju residents. This helps their bodies manage oxygen circulation through their bodies during a long dive, letting them “spend that resource as frugally as possible,” Ilardo says. She adds that this acquired trait could also develop in nondiver individuals who are not from Jeju Island. While the study did not test participants' cold tolerance, that is something the Superhuman Lab is planning to investigate in future work with the Haenyeo.

Researchers can learn vital lessons about human evolution from such unique adaptations, says Ben Trumble, an Arizona State University biologist who specializes in human biology and was not involved in the new study. Cataloging the lifestyle and genes of special populations such as the Haenyeo could inform research into areas such as precision medicine, which requires a specialized understanding of how certain genetic variations translate into physiological traits, Trumble explains.

“We're absolutely allowed to plagiarize from natural selection” in approaching health care, he says. “How natural selection solves a particular problem with a particular gene can give us clues for developing new drugs to treat some of the problems that people have in our society today.”

Studies such as Ilardo's take the “first step” toward medical applications, Trumble says, although he and Simonson believe any actual drugs that could emerge from such research will probably take longer to develop. In any case, Ilardo says, being able to pinpoint the genetic cause behind certain populations' remarkable abilities could offer remarkable solutions in medical genetics.

“I was just blown away by how amazing [the Haenyeo] are, how strong they are and how they balance that with this kindness and sensitivity and femininity,” Ilardo says. “I think by focusing on what makes the population special and unique..., it brings a health focus instead of a disease focus [to medical genetics research]. And it's certainly a much more fun way to do the science.”

And it'll take you less than two minutes.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

We've seen electric automakers attempt swappable battery packs with varying levels of success. However, the battery experts at Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited are collaborating with Chinese automakers to develop a standard that enables a new battery to be swapped with a depleted battery in just a minute and a half. The technology is promising enough that it's already being tested in a small-scale pilot program at the time we're writing this.

Unfortunately, it appears that CATL's Choco Swap technology will require a subscription to gain access. Once you've ticked the right boxes—and it comes time to charge up—you'll drive to the nearest Choco Swap station, where the battery pack is dropped out from under the car and swapped for a fully-charged replacement. As you'll see above, the technology is surprisingly simple. 

When we said the next-gen battery-swappable car already exists, we should clarify that it's not what we'd call a sportscar. A fleet of 1,000 Changan Oshan 520s, a four-door taxi cab, were the first to arrive with a 56 kilowatt-hour battery. It costs $23,000 and it's actually pretty brilliant. Along with its removable battery, the Oshan can also be plugged in like a conventional EV. It didn't take us long to realize that these swappable batteries are the perfect solution for fleet vehicles like taxi cabs—at least in areas that still use them. Less downtime to charge means more time working and, well, making money.

Each vehicle is fitted with CATL's Choco-SEB battery, named for its chocolate-bar-like appearance. It's currently available in two different form factors: one for smaller vehicles like the Changan, and another larger size for commercial “A- or B-Class” vehicles. For context, CATL has already helped Chinese automakers release 10 different “Choco Swap” compatible vehicles.

First and foremost, charging a battery is best done slowly. Your automaker might not tell you, but charging—especially fast charging—produces a lot of heat. And that can potentially decrease your battery's lifespan. 

Information regarding the charging and distribution of the “spent” batteries remains sparse, but the Choco system would theoretically allow much more time to recharge them. This would allow the batteries from the discard pile to be charged much slower than many of the existing rapid charging solutions we have at the moment. And that's good news, as slow charging promotes battery longevity. 

One of the biggest questions that came up for us is what EV owners should do if they merely need to top up their battery before a road trip; what if you theoretically had 65-percent charge and wanted to top up to 100 before you set off again? Is it really worth the hassle to swap in an entirely new battery? Thankfully, that's why vehicles like the Oshan 520 can be charged just like many of the other EVs on sale today. 

It's all too easy with these new and exciting technologies for stories to claim that it “makes the gas station obsolete” or “change the EV game” forever. While we admire that it's a brilliant innovation, we should clarify that it isn't perfect. Along with many unanswered questions about logistics, the fact remains that automakers still can't decide on one single charging standard. We don't disagree that the new battery swap technology is fast, but we do wonder about other factors including how much it will cost, how much demand there will be, vehicle compatibility, and what happens if the new battery doesn't work. 

CATL states that it's already operating 34 battery-swap stations in Chongqing, China, with plans to have 50 stations by year's end. Looking at the bigger picture, the Chinese battery giant is targeting a rollout of 1,000 swap points across China in the same timeframe—end of 2025. As of right now, Chinese automakers GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW, and BAIC, are also looking to adapt to the new standard.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A Theory Says We Can't Find Advanced Aliens Because They're Not Trying to Be Found","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a64907942/fermi-paradox/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Sustainability may be an unavoidable feature of advanced civilizations, making advanced technology “indistinguishable from nature.”

For more than 40 years, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) organization has turned its gaze toward the cosmos in search for an answer to one of humanity's greatest questions: Are we alone? Often taking the form of the “Fermi paradox”—a 75-year-old thought experiment that explores why there are so many worlds, yet seemingly no alien civilizations—this grand question has inspired a lot of possible solutions. Maybe life is much rarer than we imagine? Maybe it's incredibly difficult to evolve into a modern civilization like ours? Or maybe aliens are speaking in a language we simply don't understand. 

However, there's one possible solution that eerily speaks to our current moment. Known as the “Sustainability Solution,” this idea posits that endless economic growth may simply be impossible to sustain, so alien societies either adapt by creating sustainable civilization in harmony with their host planet, or they simply die out. First proposed by Pennsylvania State University scientists Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum in 2009, the “Sustainability Solution” suggests that if aliens do exist, they likely wouldn't create the technosignatures we often attribute to advanced civilizations, such as Dyson Spheres or interstellar spacecraft. Instead, these structures (part of the “technosphere”) would blend with the natural world, making them difficult to distinguish.

In a new study uploaded to the preprint server arXiv, New York University researcher and philosopher Lukáš Likavčan revitalizes this solution to the Fermi paradox as a lens through which to view humanity's own development. The paper re-conceptualizes technology, history, and sustainability on a planetary scale. 

“The ecological limits constrain the topology of viable planetary histories to those evolutionary trajectories where the technosphere successfully folds back into the biosphere,” Likavčan wrote. “The major result of this reconceptualization is the problematization of the analytical import of technosphere as a category denoting some new geological layer—it seems to be more of a transitory armature of the biosphere's evolution and less of an emerging permanent layer.”

Humans play a strange, transitory role in this conceptualization. Of course, being primates, we are of the biosphere. But our creations—at least, as argued by this theory—become part of the theoretically detectable technosphere (whether this region is a permanent fixture or a temporary arm of the biosphere is up for debate). Drawing on a sample size of one (i.e. human civilization), it's easy to think that progress will continue unabated until we become masters of our own Solar System and beyond. However, as Haqq-Mistra and Baum originally stated in 2009, this “Sustainability Solution” questions the assumption of the unimpeded exponential growth of such civilizations. 

“It is still possible that slower-growth ETI civilizations exist but have not expanded rapidly enough to be easily detectable by the searches humans have yet made,” the original authors wrote. “It is also possible that faster-growth ETI civilizations previously expanded throughout the galaxy but could not sustain this state, collapsing in a way that whatever artifacts they might have left have also remained undetected.”

Additionally, Likavčan's idea of “folding back into the biosphere,” means that advanced civilizations might instead create technologies that are essentially biological in nature in order to remain in balance with their finite resources. To support this point, Likavčan quotes Canadian sci-fi author Karl Schroeder, who wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature,” itself a reformulation of sci-fi Arthur C. Clarke's famous words that compared technology to magic. This could also explain why we haven't found civilizations while looking for technosignatures alone. 

Magic or no, the nature of the Fermi paradox makes it a “we won't know until we know” kind of question. But the exploration of possible solutions can also provide a valuable lens through which to value our own society, its future perils, and how we might—against all odds—survive long enough to one day solve this perplexing question.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A New Study Says You Can Delay Death—but Not the Speed of Aging","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64908925/speed-of-aging/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The rate of human aging is remarkably constant, even if it does begin later in life.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

To say that “anti-aging” is an obsession in the U.S. would be a bit of an understatement. In 2024, for example, experts valued the anti-aging industry at around $52 billion, with every expectation for it to grow beyond $100 billion by the end of the decade. The promise of these products to stop—or, at the very least, curtail—aging's most deleterious effects is a convincing one. After all, haven't we proven over the past decade that improved habits and living conditions can shoot a population's life expectancy into the atmosphere?

However, this picture is much more complicated for scientists studying aging, which is also known as “senescence.” It can be argued that life expectancy—mostly due to improved nutrition and medical advancements (especially the lowering of the infant mortality rate)—has improved across generations, and it's now expected that the centenarian population in the U.S. will quadruple over the next 30 years. But one question in decades of research in human aging remains unanswered: Could the rate of human senescence somehow be changing across generations? 

It's a question that's been pondered for quite some time. The foundations of this mortality-related research date back to the early 19th century, when mathematician Benjamin Gompertz first devised mortality rates. His work showed that, initially, rates started very low, but increased the same percentage year after year. However, the rates continue to grow as we age, sort of like compounding interest in a 401(k). It starts off slow and first, but then it really takes off. 

In a new study uploaded to the preprint server aXiv by Silvio Patricio, a research assistant at the Interdisciplinary Centre on Population Dynamics at the University of Southern Denmark analyzed this question by revisiting a theory first postulated by James W. Vaupel in 2010. In his study, Vaupel discovered that the rate of human senescence—the one largely calculated by Gompertz in 1825— hadn't changed among generations, but that the process of aging had been delayed by a decade. Vaupel built this hypothesis from a variety of research dating back to 1994, and found that the slope of mortality largely remained unaltered. However, other studies challenged this theory by finding small-but-persistent variations among aging rates.

“These patterns raise a deeper question: are we seeing real biological change in how humans age—or are we seeing something else?,” Patricio wrote. “One possibility is that what looks like a change in [the rate of aging] is not biological at all, but historical. Period events—such as World War I, the 1918 flu, or World War II—affect many cohorts at once, just at different ages […]. If such events have lasting consequences, they could subtly distort cohort-level mortality patterns.”

Patricio sets out to settle the matter once and for all. Using a mixture model, the researcher separated senescent mortality (that is, age-related deaths) from general cohort mortality data from France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden (he also refined the data to lessen the influence of early-life mortality). After developing cohort-specific estimates of the Gompertz slope, Patricio found that aging wasn't perfectly constant across cohorts, and that this was likely due to a drift caused by population shocks that cohorts carry as “echoes” of these past events—even if they occurred outside their own lifespan. 

“Once we filter out non-senescent mortality and account for the accumulation of shared period effects, [the rate of aging] becomes strikingly consistent,” Patricio wrote. “There is no meaningful trend, and no evidence that the biology of aging is shifting across cohorts. The variation that remains is not biological drift, but the footprint of history—the cumulative result of shocks experienced in calendar time.” 

So, if the rate of aging is truly immutable, is the anti-aging industry basically one big snake oil salesman? Well, yes and no. While the rate of aging is remarkably constant across generations and populations, eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep will still do wonders for your longevity and make sure that the compounding interest of your mortality doesn't catch up with you prematurely. 

The rate at which we gray may be an immutable fact of our biology, but that doesn't mean we can't do so with some measure of grace.

A clinical trial using engineered immune cells to hunt cancer cells has reported impressive results for solid tumours, a type of cancer that is difficult to treat. Compared with standard treatments, the immunotherapy lengthened survival of people with cancer1.

The phase II clinical trial in China tested chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in people with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, which are solid tumours. To create CAR-T-cell therapies, T cells are collected from a person with cancer and tweaked to produce proteins that target cancer cells. The T cells are then infused back into the same person. CAR-T-cell therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but has been most successful against blood cancers.

“Solid tumours generally don't respond well to CAR-T-cell therapy,” says Lisa Mielke, a cancer researcher at the Olivia Newton John Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg, Australia. The trials are among the first in which CAR-T-cell therapy has had promising results against solid tumours. They provide “evidence that there is potential for CAR T cells to be further optimized for future treatment of patients with solid tumours”, adds Mielke.

The treatment, called satricabtagene autoleucel (satri-cel), targets CLDN18.2, a molecule expressed in large quantities in gastrointestinal tumours.

The trial included 156 participants, aged 18–75, who had received at least two unsuccessful treatments for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer and had tumour-tissue samples that were positive for CLDN18.2. Satri-cel was given to 88 people up to 3 times over the study period, along with a regimen that removed non-specific immune cells to make the treatment more effective. The remaining 52 people formed the control group, receiving standard therapies such as nivolumab, paclitaxel or rivoceranib.

Of the people treated with satri-cel, 35% responded to it, compared with just 4% of people receiving standard care. Those receiving CAR-T-cell therapy also lived an average of 2.4 months longer and were 31% less likely to die than the people in the control group.

Metrics details

Higher habitual intakes of dietary flavonoids have been linked with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic disease. Yet, the contribution of diversity of flavonoid intake to health outcomes remains to be investigated. Here, using a cohort of 124,805 UK Biobank participants, we show that participants who consumed the widest diversity of dietary flavonoids, flavonoid-rich foods and/or specific flavonoid subclasses had a 6–20% significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we report that both quantity and diversity of flavonoids are independent predictors of mortality and several chronic diseases, suggesting that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity is better for longer-term health than either component alone. These findings suggest that consuming several different daily servings of flavonoid-rich foods or beverages, such as tea, berries, apples, oranges or grapes, may lower risk of all-cause mortality and chronic disease.

Flavonoids are (poly)phenolic compounds that occur abundantly in the human diet1. Sources are quite diverse, ranging from fruits and vegetables to nuts and legumes, as well as wines and teas2. A wide range of flavonoids are found in foods and beverages, and these can be classified into several subclasses including flavonols, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavanones and flavones1. Following their consumption and absorption, flavonoids—through their downstream metabolites—have the potential to improve human health1. Since the early 1990s3, numerous prospective cohort studies have observed that a higher habitual consumption of several flavonoid subclasses is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality4,5,6, cardiovascular disease (CVD)2,7, type 2 diabetes (T2DM)8,9, cancer10, respiratory disease11 and neurodegenerative disease12,13. Due to variations in their chemical structure, bioavailability and metabolism, different flavonoid compounds exert a range of biological effects14. Among these, some of their most widely recognized activities include anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects, which are fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of many chronic diseases15. Additionally, flavonoids exhibit more specific protective functions, including promoting endothelial integrity and function16, crucial for cardiovascular health, and anti-senescence effects17 that may delay age-related tissue deterioration, in addition to antiproliferative activities18 that contribute to cancer prevention. These represent just some examples of the many mechanisms through which flavonoids exert their beneficial effects across diverse chronic conditions1,15.

Because different flavonoid compounds can exert different biological benefits, we hypothesized that consuming a higher diversity of dietary flavonoids may afford better health protection than consuming a low diversity of flavonoids. However, to date, no prospective studies have considered the impact of consuming a higher diversity of dietary flavonoids on the risk of all-cause mortality or major chronic disease. In several research fields, including in the assessment of gut microbial diversity19,20,21, the diversity of a system can be calculated using Shannon's equation for entropy22 converted to Hill's effective numbers23,24. Using this approach, we can determine the diversity of flavonoid intake, accounting for both the variation (or number of different flavonoids consumed) and their distribution of intake (wherein those flavonoids consumed in smaller amounts relative to others are weighted less). The aims of this study, therefore, were: (1) to estimate diversity of flavonoid intake across levels of total dietary flavonoids, individual flavonoid subclasses and flavonoid-rich foods, and then examine their associations with the risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of chronic disease including CVD, T2DM, total cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease; and (2) to assess the potential benefits of consuming both a higher quantity and a wider diversity of flavonoid intake on the risk of these outcomes in participants from the UK Biobank.

In this cohort of 124,805 UK adults, aged ≥40 yr (median [Q1–Q3], 60.2 [53.0–65.2] yr; Q, quintile), ~56% (n = 69,674) were female and most were non-smokers (>90%; n = 115,961) (Table 1). Around 60% (n = 75,111) of participants were either overweight or obese (Table 1). At baseline, ~4% (n = 5,162) had diabetes (type 1 or 2), ~25% (n = 32,877) were hypertensive and ~15% (n = 19,827) had high cholesterol. Over a range of 8.7–10.6 median years of follow-up for the different outcomes (maximum, 11.8 yr), there were 5,780 deaths, 6,920 CVD cases, 3,421 T2DM cases, 9,441 cancer cases, 12,945 respiratory disease cases and 1,921 cases of neurodegenerative disease. Participants had a median flavonoid intake of 792 mg d−1 (range, 0.05–3,611 mg d−1), which was comprised of a wide diversity of an effective (Hill) number of 9.4 flavonoid types per day (range, 1.8–19.0) (Fig. 1). Flavan-3-ols were the main subclass contributing to total flavonoid intake, accounting for 87% of consumption. Anthocyanins, flavonols and flavanones each contributed ~4.5% of total flavonoid intake; <1% was from flavones. Tea (black and green) was the main source of total flavonoid intake (67%), followed by apples (5.8%), red wine (4.7%), grapes (1.9%), berries (1.9%), dark chocolate (1.2%), oranges and satsumas (1.1%) and orange juice (1.1%), which collectively comprised ~85% of total intake; numerous other food sources contributed to the remaining intake (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Overall, those with a higher quantity of flavonoid intake tended to have a lower diversity (r = −0.44), although this varied for individual subclasses (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Compared to participants with the lowest diversity, those with the highest diversity had a better distribution of flavonoid intake, consuming more anthocyanins (for example, malvidin, cyanidin), flavanones (for example, hesperidin, naringenin) and proanthocyanidins (for example, dimers to polymers) relative to thearubigin, a compound derived exclusively from tea, and which dominated intake in those with the least diverse consumption (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). Analysis of flavonoid-rich foods showed those with the lowest diversity consumed mostly tea, and those with the highest diversity consumed relatively more berries, apples, grapes, red wine and oranges (Supplementary Table 4). Those with the highest flavonoid diversity were more likely to be female, older, have a lower body mass index (BMI), be more physically active and have a higher education and were less likely to be current smokers (Table 1).

Data from participants with ≥2 Oxford WebQ dietary questionnaires (n = 124,805).

Following mutual adjustment, and after accounting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, dietary and medical risk factors, both the quantity and diversity of total dietary flavonoid intake were independently associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and several chronic diseases (model 5; Fig. 2). Holding the quantity of flavonoid intake constant, participants with the highest (compared to lowest) diversity (Q5 versus Q1), characterized as consuming an additional 6.7 effective flavonoid types per day, had a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)), 0.86 (0.78, 0.95)), a 10% lower risk of CVD (0.90 (0.82, 0.98)), a 20% lower risk of T2DM (0.80 (0.70, 0.91)), an 8% lower risk of total cancer (0.92 (0.85, 0.99)) and an 8% lower risk of respiratory disease (0.92 (0.86, 0.98)); no association was observed for neurodegenerative disease (model 5; Table 2 and Fig. 2). For quantity of flavonoid intake, when holding diversity constant, participants in the second quintile (median intake, ~500 mg d−1), were at a 16% (0.84 (0.78, 0.92)), 9% (0.91 (0.84, 0.98)), 12% (0.88 (0.79, 0.98)) and 13% (0.87 (0.83, 0.92)) lower risk of all-cause mortality, CVD, T2DM and respiratory disease, respectively, compared with those in Q1 (median intake, ~230 mg d−1 (model 5; Table 2)). At higher levels of exposure, these HRs remained relatively constant, except for T2DM, for which the lowest risks were observed for those in Q5 (0.75 (0.66, 0.84)). The lowest risks for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases were seen in Q5 (median intake, ~1,400 mg d−1), reaching an 8% (0.92 (0.85, 0.99)) and 20% (0.80 (0.68, 0.94)) lower disease risk, respectively, compared with Q1 (model 5; Table 2 and Fig. 2). In general, progressive adjustment for participant demographics (model 2), lifestyle (model 3), dietary (model 4) and medical risk factors (model 5) attenuated, but did not materially alter, the associations (Table 2). We then tested for interactions between quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake (across the aforementioned outcomes), and although no interactions were observed (Pinteraction all >0.05 (model 5)), the independent prediction of both quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake with all-cause mortality and several chronic diseases still suggests that higher intakes of both is associated with greater disease risk reduction compared with higher intakes of either aspect alone.

HRs (95% CI) for all-cause mortality and major chronic disease according to the quantity and diversity of dietary flavonoid intake (in quintiles). HRs are from Cox proportional-hazards models using age as the underlying timescale. Quantity of flavonoid intake is mutually adjusted for diversity of flavonoid intake and vice versa. Further adjustments are made for covariates in model 5 including sex, region of residence, number of dietary assessments, BMI, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, education, ethnicity, socioeconomic status plus intakes of red and processed meat, refined grains, whole grains, sugary drinks, coffee, saturated fatty acids, sodium and dietary energy, and history of diabetes (type 1 or 2; not adjusted in T2DM analysis), hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia and for analysis of all-cause mortality, further adjustments were made for prevalent CVD, cancer, respiratory disease, and neurodegenerative disease at baseline. Corresponding sample sizes, event rates and additional details are provided in Table 2.

Minimally (model 1) and multivariable adjusted models (models 2–5) for diversity of individual flavonoid subclasses and the risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic disease are presented in Supplementary Table 5. Overall, following adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors (model 3), further adjustments for diet (model 4) and medical history (model 5) did not substantially alter the findings. In the fully adjusted model (model 5), the wider diversities of intake of compounds within the flavan-3-ol and flavanone subclasses were each associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, independent of absolute intake; the HR remained stable after both Q4 and Q2 respectively (HR (95% CI) for flavan-3-ols Q4 versus Q1, 0.91 (0.83, 0.99); flavanones Q2 versus Q1, 0.90 (0.83, 0.98); model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). When the corresponding model terms for quantity of consumption were examined, only flavan-3-ol intake was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality; the HRs were relatively stable beyond Q2 (Q2 versus Q1, 0.85 (0.78, 0.93); Supplementary Table 6). The data for chronic disease outcomes reveal that, compared with lower intakes (Q1), significant associations mostly emerged in those with the widest diversity at and above Q4; for flavan-3-ols there was a 13% (Q5, 0.87 (0.77, 0.98)) and an 8% (Q4, 0.92 (0.86, 0.99)) lower risk of T2DM and cancer; for flavanone there was a 7% (Q5, 0.93 (0.88, 0.99)) and a 6% (Q5, 0.93 (0.87, 0.99)) lower risk of cancer and respiratory disease; and for flavones there was a 13% (Q4, 0.89 (0.80, 0.99)) and an 18% (Q5, 0.82 (0.71, 0.95)) lower risk of T2DM and neurodegenerative disease, respectively (model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). When we examined the models for the subclasses showing beneficial associations for diversity, associations for quantity of intake emerged with T2DM wherein participants at and above Q3 for flavones and Q4 for flavan-3-ols were at a lower risk (flavones Q3, 0.89 (0.80, 0.99); flavan-3-ols Q4, 0.85 (0.77, 0.95); model 5; Supplementary Table 6). No interactions were observed between quantity and diversity of intake of any subclass with any outcome (Pinteraction all >0.05 (model 5)).

Minimally (model 1) and multivariable adjusted models (models 2–5) for diversity of flavonoid-rich foods are presented in Supplementary Table 5. Adjustment beyond demographic and lifestyle factors (model 3) for participant diet (model 4) and medical history (model 5) did not appreciably affect the associations. In the fully adjusted model, when holding the quantity of intake constant, the risk of all-cause mortality was progressively lower among those with a higher diversity of flavonoid-rich food intake; compared with an effective serving of 1.3, those with 2, 2.7, 3.4 and 4.5 different effective servings were associated with an 8% (0.92 (0.85, 1.00)), 10% (0.91 (0.84, 0.99)), 13% (0.88 (0.81, 0.96)) and 16% (0.84 (0.76, 0.91)) lower risk of all-cause mortality, respectively (model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). Holding the diversity of intake constant, there was no clear association for consuming a higher quantity of flavonoid-rich foods (model 5; Supplementary Table 6). Examination of chronic disease outcomes revealed that those with the highest (versus lowest) diversity of flavonoid-rich food intake had an 8% lower risk of respiratory disease (0.92 (0.87, 0.98)); there were no compelling associations with other endpoints (model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). Holding diversity constant, a higher quantity of flavonoid-rich foods, beyond Q2 (Q2, 0.87 (0.78, 0.97)), associated with a lower risk of T2DM; there were no compelling associations with other endpoints (model 5; Supplementary Table 6). No interactions (Pinteraction all >0.05 (Model 5)) were observed between quantity and diversity of flavonoid-rich food consumption.

Neither removing energy intake nor adjusting for a healthy plant-based diet score substantively altered the HR (sensitivity analyses 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables 5 and 7). Excluding participants who had an event in the first two years of follow-up tended to marginally strengthen the relationships between our exposures and outcomes (sensitivity analysis 3; Supplementary Tables 5 and 7).

In >120,000 UK Biobank participants, we observed that participants who consumed the widest diversity of dietary flavonoids, flavonoid-rich foods and/or specific flavonoid subclasses had a lower risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of cause-specific chronic disease, ranging from cardiometabolic disorders (including CVD and T2DM) to other major conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease. We also found that both the quantity and diversity of total dietary flavonoids are independent predictors of mortality and several chronic diseases, suggesting that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity is better for longer-term health than higher intakes of either component alone.

Our findings highlight the importance of consuming a diverse range of flavonoids for the management of chronic disease risk, which, from a public health perspective, provides support for consuming a variety of flavonoid-rich foods such as green and/or black tea, berries, apples, oranges and grapes25. This fits with our current understanding that different flavonoid compounds can exert different biological benefits1,26,27,28. For example, in the regulation of blood pressure alone, compounds from each subclass appear to act on a variety of different mechanisms, increasing nitric oxide bioavailability, reducing endothelial cell oxidative stress and modulating vascular ion channel activity29,30. Indeed, the health-promoting effects of flavonoids are wide ranging, with multiple flavonoid compounds implicated in multiple biological activities, including, among others, inhibiting platelet aggregation, lowering low-density lipoprotein oxidation, mitigating atherosclerotic lesion formation, improving insulin sensitivity indices, inducing antioxidant defences, and reducing inflammatory responses in addition to specific anticarcinogenic actions, such as an ability to induce apoptosis in tumour cells, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and prevent angiogenesis and tumour cell invasion15,28. As a result, the collective actions of multiple flavonoids appear to lead to greater health protection compared with single subclasses or compounds.

We found that consuming both a higher quantity and wider diversity of dietary flavonoids appears better for longer-term health than higher intakes of either component alone. To date, epidemiological research has focused on the quantity of flavonoid intake, finding that higher consumption of several flavonoid subclasses is associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases2,7,8,9,10,11,12,31,32. Indeed, the first proposed dietary guideline for flavonoids was released in 202233, and recommended consumption of 400–600 mg d−1 of flavan-3-ols for potential cardiometabolic health benefits. Our results suggest that future guidelines could be reframed to also consider recommending intake from a range of sources. Further studies are also ongoing to determine the environmental footprints of different flavonoid-rich foods to ensure their consumption also supports environmental sustainability and planetary health34. Moreover, our findings also align with our other recent work in which we propose a composite measure of flavonoid intake (termed the Flavodiet score) which is a sum of servings of flavonoid-rich foods6. We observed that those who had a better Flavodiet score had a lower risk of all-cause mortality6. Our current study on flavonoid diversity and health outcomes supports the Flavodiet score concept as means to promote higher intakes of flavonoids from different sources. Our analysis of diversity also complements existing analyses that evaluate associations between specific flavonoid food sources and health outcomes, which enhance the evidence base for the health benefits of specific flavonoid-rich foods35,36. However, by studying diversity specifically, our results suggest that consuming a greater variety of such sources appears better than their intakes in isolation.

To estimate flavonoid diversity, we used Shannon's equation with Hill's numbers22,23,24. This provides an approach to explicitly separate out and study the independent benefits of flavonoid diversity, versus quantity, for health outcomes. A fundamental feature of the Shannon equation is that it considers the most diverse diets to consist of all flavonoids consumed in equal proportions. Although this reflects a technical definition of diversity, such an intake is unlikely to occur in the real world and may not be the pattern of consumption that offers the greatest health benefits. Shannon's equation also only permits calculation of diversity among flavonoid consumers (omitting non-consumers), and results should be interpreted within this context (although <0.01% of participants in this cohort did not consume any flavonoids). We must also consider that calculating diversity within individual subclasses does not account for diversity of other subclasses (which appears important) and that calculating diversity by way of major flavonoid-rich foods does not account for other flavonoid sources (which may potentially be major sources for some individuals). While calculating flavonoid diversity by way of total flavonoid compound intake appears to overcome these limitations, this method relies on the precision of compound intake estimates, and these estimates, given the inherent limitations of dietary assessment methods and nutrient composition databases37, are likely to be relatively crude. Nevertheless, even with these constraints, we observed a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality and cause-specific chronic disease among those with the most (compared with the least) diverse flavonoid intakes when using this method. Indeed, beyond flavonoids this method could be further used to estimate and evaluate diversity of other (poly)phenolics, or groups of bioactives, or potentially various food groups. Although there have been recent discussion and some previous use of various diversity indices in nutrition science38,39,40,41, Shannon's equation (with Hill numbers) does not seem to have been used before to partition and study the independent roles of diversity and quantity. Hence, this work introduces a potential approach to study these characteristics of other dietary components in the future.

No previous works appear to have reported on the human health benefits of a flavonoid-diverse diet. Consequently, replication of our findings in other cohorts and clinical trials will be critical, as will the exploration of flavonoid diversity with other disease outcomes. Interpretation, however, requires careful consideration. For the most part, we observed that both quantity and diversity were independent predictors, suggesting there is a benefit to consuming a higher diversity beyond that of simply consuming a high quantity (and vice versa), although this relationship did not interact such that the benefit together was even greater than the combination of the individual parts42. On other occasions we observed quantity but not diversity was a predictor, which could suggest consuming a higher amount of any type provides benefit. Or perhaps a wider diversity of intake within the population under study is required before a role for diversity becomes observable, or that the average compositional make-up of diversity within the population was not relevant to the disease in question. Certainly, the biological relevance of diversity within subclasses may be less important if at least some compounds have similar biological effects. Indeed, those with the lowest diversity could theoretically consume one flavonoid type alone; hypothetically speaking, if this was considered the reference group and compared to those with a wider diversity, then after adjustment for quantity, the comparison compares one against multiple different flavonoid types, holding total quantity constant. If the one flavonoid type was overly protective against the disease in question, then there may be no benefit to consuming a wider diversity if the other flavonoids do not collectively provide a benefit larger than the reference. In other analyses we observed that only flavonoid diversity, but not quantity, predicted the outcomes. This could be due to synergies between different flavonoids, whereas simply consuming higher amounts of less diverse compounds may afford no benefit. We also observed that the quantity and diversity of flavonoid compound intake but not servings of flavonoid-rich foods were significantly associated with more outcomes, suggesting that the absolute intake of flavonoids matters more than the servings of flavonoid-rich foods per se, potentially because different foods have varying flavonoid densities and serving sizes. Moreover, combinations of some foods will probably provide a greater diversity of flavonoids than others—or example, consuming red wine and grapes will probably be less diverse than consuming oranges and grapes because there is less overlap in the flavonoid profiles of the foods.

The strengths of this study include the prospective design, large sample size, high number of cases and long follow-up time of ~10 years. Several limitations, however, should be noted. First, the observational design restricts our ability to infer causality or to exclude the possibility of residual confounding. To this end, we must consider whether the associations observed represent a benefit of higher diversity of flavonoids per se, or a signal that the various flavonoids act synergistically with other compounds found in flavonoid-rich foods, such as phenolic acids, lignans or other bioactives2. Indeed, the possibility of flavonoids being a marker of other unobserved and potential protective factors cannot be discounted. Second, although the Oxford WebQ has been validated against biomarkers and 24-h recalls for selected nutrients43,44, it does not capture data on certain types of flavonoid-rich foods (for example, specific types of berries), which potentially leads to imprecision in the assessment of diversity for certain subclasses (for example, anthocyanins), and as with all self-reported dietary assessments, common limitations and reporting biases apply2,45. Moreover, due to the limited number of dietary assessments, our analyses may have been affected by regression dilution with a probable underestimation of the strengths of associations46; this may be of specific importance when assessing diversity, assuming variation in intake is greater over longer timeframes. Third, incidence of T2DM was ascertained based on hospital and death records, which may not capture all cases, such as those diagnosed and treated in primary care. This may have introduced some degree of error, particularly if hospitalized individuals have different health-seeking behaviours or characteristics than those treated in primary care, highlighting the need for additional studies. Fourth, potential confounders were only assessed at baseline, and it is unclear how potential changes in their trajectories may have impacted upon the observed associations. Fifth, although we conducted extensive analysis showing that the associations of our exposures with the outcomes appear robust, we acknowledge that multiplicity issues should be considered when interpreting the results. Sixth, given our sample is not representative of all populations in terms of age, ethnicity, health status or socioeconomic standing, and so on, the generalizability of our results requires confirmation in other populations.

In conclusion, we found that a wider diversity of intake of total flavonoids, flavonoid-rich foods and/or specific flavonoid subclasses is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of chronic disease, including CVD, T2DM, cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease. We also observed that a higher quantity and wider diversity of dietary flavonoids, when consumed together, may represent the optimal approach for improving long-term health, compared with increasing either flavonoid quantity or diversity alone. Overall, our findings suggest simple and achievable dietary changes such as including several different daily servings of flavonoid-rich foods or beverages, such as tea, berries, apples, oranges or grapes, might have a major impact on population health, lowering the risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic disease.

For the present investigation, we used data from the UK Biobank—a large, prospective, population-based cohort study47. Between 2006 and 2010, >500,000 male and female adults, aged 40–69 yr, were enrolled47. Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres located across England, Scotland and Wales, where they undertook a comprehensive baseline assessment, completing questionnaires and physical measures, and provided biological samples. The UK Biobank study received ethical approval from the NHS North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (reference 11/NW/0382) and all participants provided informed consent.

For the current analysis, we excluded participants who withdrew their consent during follow-up or who completed fewer than two 24-h dietary questionnaires (by first removing individual recalls without plausible energy intakes: <800 or >4,200 kcal d−1 for men and <500 or >3,500 kcal d−1 for women) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Additionally, for the respective outcomes of interest, we excluded participants with prevalent CVD, T2DM, cancer, respiratory disease or neurodegenerative disease, prior to the last date of dietary assessment (Supplementary Table 8). Lastly, because Shannon's equation requires intake of at least one kind of flavonoid compound, those with zero total flavonoid intake were excluded, and then, depending on the exposure of interest (flavonoid-rich foods or intra-subclass diversity, and so on), participants with zero intake of flavonoid-rich foods or specific subclasses were excluded on a per-analysis basis, because the collective exclusion at the flavonoid-rich food or intra-subclass level would bias diversity of other levels (for example, compounds (Supplementary Fig. 1)).

Dietary information was collected using the Oxford WebQ 24-h dietary questionnaire44, which participants completed on up to five separate occasions, between 2009 and 201248. Flavonoid intake was estimated from the Oxford WebQ 24-h dietary questionnaire using the US Department of Agriculture flavonoid and proanthocyanidin food content databases49,50, with food codes derived from the updated version of the nutrient calculations for the Oxford WebQ for food items and composite recipes13,51. Flavonoid intakes (mg d−1) from all completed questionnaires with plausible energy intakes were averaged. We derived intakes of several flavonoids subclasses as follows: flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin and isorhamnetin), anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, petunidin and peonidin), flavan-3-ols ((+)-catechin, (+)-gallocatechin, (−)-epicatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin, (−)-epicatechin 3-gallate and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, plus dimers, trimers, 4–6-mers, 7–10-mers and polymers, plus theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3′-gallate, theaflavin-3,3′-digallate and thearubigins), flavanones (eriodictyol, hesperetin and naringenin) and flavones (luteolin and apigenin). Total flavonoid intake was calculated as the sum of all compounds. Intakes of isoflavones were not calculated due to the low consumption of isoflavone-containing foods in the general UK population52.

Diversity of flavonoid intake was calculated using Shannon's equation for entropy22 which was subsequently converted to Hill's effective numbers23,24. Calculations of diversity were made for total flavonoid intake, which considered diversity of all 31 flavonoids as described above. In an exploratory analysis we examined (1) intra-subclass diversity, which considered diversity of intake within individual subclasses, and (2) servings of flavonoid-rich foods, which included the key contributors to each flavonoid subclass, including tea (black and green), red wine, apples, berries, grapes, oranges (including satsumas), grapefruit, sweet peppers, onions and dark chocolate. The key contributors were determined as the three foods that contributed the highest percentage to the intakes of each flavonoid subclass (excluding fruit juices), and dark chocolate was included as it is typically high in flavan-3-ols13. Shannon's equation is as follows:

In Shannon's equation, pi is calculated as the proportion of individual flavonoids consumed per day (that is, the quantity of compounds (mg d−1) or flavonoid-rich foods (servings per day)) relative to total intake (that is, the total quantity of flavonoids (mg d−1) or flavonoid-rich foods (servings per day)) and s is the total number of individual flavonoid types (that is, compounds or flavonoid-rich foods) consumed. Diversity of flavonoid intake was calculated using the R package Vegan53. Conversion of Shannon's score into Hill's effective numbers was undertaken by exponentiating H (refs. 23,24).

The purpose of using effective numbers is to convert Shannon's non-linear score into an interpretable metric that quantifies diversity23. The resulting output, termed effective numbers, shows the number of different types of flavonoids that would need to be consumed in a specific proportional make-up to meet the same relative diversity as the diet from which it was calculated, wherein a higher value indicates wider diversity (a detailed explanation of effective numbers can be found in the Supplementary Methods). The Shannon equation and Hill numbers produce a measure of diversity that is relative to, and independent of, the quantity of flavonoid intake, such that it is possible that two individuals can have exactly the same diversity score, yet one of them may consume, for example, a threefold higher quantity of flavonoids. Therefore, following statistical adjustment for quantity of flavonoid consumption, it is possible to study the independent benefit of diversity of flavonoid intake.

The outcomes in the current study were all-cause mortality and incidence (first-time fatal or non-fatal events) of CVD, T2DM, total cancer, respiratory disease, and neurodegenerative disease. Date of death was obtained from death certificates held by the National Health Service Information Centre (England and Wales) and the National Health Service Central Register Scotland (Scotland). Dates and causes of hospital admissions were identified via record linkage to Health Episode Statistics (England), the Patient Episode Database (Wales) and the Scottish Morbidity Records (Scotland) as well as the National Cancer Registries (England, Scotland and Wales). Incident outcomes were defined as a hospital admission or death identified through primary or secondary diagnosis codes using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) as follows: CVD (I20-I25, I63 and I70-I74), T2DM (E11), cancer (C00-C97, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (C44)), respiratory disease (J09-J98, I26 and I27) and neurodegenerative disease (F00–03, G12.2, G20, G21, G23.1–23.3, G23.8, G23.9, G30 and G31). Hospital admission follow-up data for CVD, T2DM, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease were available until 31 October 2022 for England, 31 August 2022 for Scotland and 31 May 2022 for Wales. Follow-up data for cancer were available until 31 December 2016 for Wales, 31 December 2020 for England and 30 November 2021 for Scotland. Mortality data were available until 30 November 2022 for England, Scotland and Wales. We therefore censored outcome analyses on these dates.

Information on demographics, lifestyle factors and medical history including sex, age, ethnicity, anthropometry, physical activity, education, smoking and alcohol habits were obtained from the baseline assessment. Anthropometric measurements (height and weight) were obtained by trained personnel. BMI was calculated as weight/(height2) (kg m−2). Physical activity was derived using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form, and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking, moderate and vigorous activity measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-h per week). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postal code of residence using the Townsend deprivation score. History of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) was derived from self-reported physician diagnosis of disease or medication use at recruitment, and from ICD codes dated prior to the last date of dietary assessment (Supplementary Table 8). History of hypercholesterolaemia was identified by physician diagnosis (self-reported) or the taking of cholesterol-lowering medication (Supplementary Table 8). To identify other baseline comorbidities, self-reported physician-diagnosed CVD, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and respiratory disease at recruitment was combined with ICD codes dated prior to the last date of diet assessment (Supplementary Table 8). The Oxford WebQ was used to calculate average daily intakes of foods, nutrients, energy intake via information recorded in the UK Nutrient Databank as previously reported54. The healthful plant-based diet index was derived from 17 food groups55.

Cox proportional-hazards models were used to investigate relationships between diversity of flavonoid consumption and all outcomes of interest. Participants were followed up from the completion of the last valid diet questionnaire until the first occurrence of the outcome event, death, loss to follow-up or the end of follow-up (as described above), whichever occurred first. Flavonoid diversity was modelled as quintiles with low flavonoid diversity (Q1) as the reference group. All models examining diversity were mutually adjusted for quantity (quintiles) of the same flavonoids that contributed to flavonoid diversity. All models used age as the underlying timescale56. Five models of adjustment were computed: model 1 minimally adjusted for sex, region of residence (entered as a strata variable: London, North West England, North East England, Yorkshire, West Midlands, East Midlands, South East England, South West England, Scotland and Wales) and number of dietary assessments completed with plausible energy intake (2, 3, 4 or 5); model 2 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 1 plus demographic factors including: ethnicity (White, Black, Asian, mixed or other), BMI (<18.5, 18.5–24.99, 25–29.99, ≥30 kg m−2), education (low (GSEs/O levels/GCSEs or equivalent), medium (NVQ/HND/HNC/A levels/AS levels or equivalent), high (other professional qualifications, college/university degree)) and socioeconomic status (Townsend deprivation index in quintiles); model 3 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 2 plus lifestyle factors including: smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol intake (<1 g d−1, 1–7 g d−1, 8–15 g d−1, 16+ g d−1) and physical activity (MET-h per week in quintiles); model 4 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 3 plus dietary factors including: intakes of sugary drinks (0 d−1, >0–1 d−1, >1–2 d−1, 2+ d−1), cups of coffee (0 d−1, >0–1 d−1, >1–2 d−1, 2+ d−1), and red and processed meat, whole grains, refined grains, saturated fatty acids and sodium (all g d−1) and energy (kcal d−1) (all as quintiles); model 5 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 4 plus medical history including history of diabetes type 1 or 2 (yes versus no), hypertension (yes versus no) and hypercholesterolaemia (yes versus no), and for analysis of all-cause mortality, further adjustments for prevalent CVD, cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease at baseline. For variables where participants could select ‘do not know' or ‘prefer not to answer', or for those with missing data, responses were combined into an ‘unknown' indicator group. The proportional-hazards assumption was confirmed using Schoenfeld residual plots. Absence of multicollinearity among predictors was verified using variance inflation factors. To address concerns that occult chronic diseases in the years preceding diagnosis may have influenced dietary patterns, we conducted sensitivity analysis excluding participants who developed events within 2 years of follow-up. We conducted further sensitivity adjustments for the healthful plant-based diet index in place of other dietary factors in model 5. To assess the influence of flavonoid intakes irrespective of dietary energy, model 5 was rerun without calorie adjustment. To assess the potential independent benefits of quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake on the risk of our outcomes, we report the terms for quantity of flavonoid intake following adjustment for diversity of flavonoid consumption. To evaluate whether the joint effect of quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake was together larger (or smaller) than the combination of the individual parts42, likelihood ratio tests were used to compare models with and without interaction terms. We observed and interpreted the magnitude and direction of observed associations through estimated HRs and associated 95% CIs with a HR of 1 indicating no association. All analyses were undertaken using Stata/IC 14.2 (StataCorp) and R statistics (v.4.2.1).

Metrics details

Governments in many European countries have high hopes for cheap green hydrogen (H2) from Africa to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. Using geospatial levelized cost models, this study evaluates the economic feasibility of exporting green H2 in the form of ammonia from Africa to Europe under four realistic financing scenarios by 2030. Our findings suggest that without European policy interventions, green H2 from Africa remains prohibitively expensive with least costs from €4.2 kgH2−1 to €4.9 kgH2−1 depending on the interest rate environment. Using de-risking policy, we identify 214 locations in six African countries that may be competitive in the current interest rate environment, yet many of these face a challenging security situation casting doubt on long-term investments. Under optimal policy and interest rate scenarios, we find a least cost of €3.2 kgH2−1 in Mauritania by 2030. Overall, de-risking and strategic location selection are key to make African green H2 exports competitive on the global stage.

In 2022, 99% of hydrogen (H2) was produced using fossil fuels1. This ‘grey' H2 mainly serves demand from the refining and industrial sectors. Achieving net zero requires a change to ‘green' H2 using renewable energy to meet current demand at low emissions and to decarbonize further hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel production1. Decarbonizing such hard-to-abate sectors is projected to cause an almost sixfold increase in global H2 demand by 20501.

However, deploying green H2 at scale will require market-competitive costs. As of 2022, green H2 constituted a mere 0.1% of global H2 production1, with costs 2–3 times higher than grey H2 (refs. 2,3). To become competitive, technical and operational cost reductions could be pursued, projected at up to 85% through lower-cost renewable electricity, reduced electrolyser costs, enhanced electrolyser efficiency and optimized operating hours2. Additionally, shifting green H2 production to more cost-efficient locations with better availability of renewable energy, including overseas4,5, could increase its competitiveness against other types of hydrogen production.

The European Union explicitly supports the creation of green H2 export markets and aims to import 10 megatons (MT) of green H2 to support decarbonization6. Over 70 potential supply regions, many in Africa7 due to often abundant renewable energy, have been identified, and bilateral agreements have already been signed, for example, between the European Union and Namibia8. African countries have started implementing domestic H2 policies too, with countries such as Namibia, South Africa, Morocco and Kenya developing strategies focused on export9.

Geospatial modelling including variable capital expenditure (CAPEX) or energy cost10 is commonly used to inform policymakers on the economic viability of different green H2 (ref. 11) production locations. We complement the available green H2 cost estimates for the African continent, such as H2Atlas Africa12, in at least three substantive ways. We provide spatially more comprehensive and more precise results for 10,300 locations across the entire continent. We base these on realistic demand scenarios, and we do so in a transparent and replicable way. Yet, irrespective of the granularity, these models typically use a uniform financing cost or cost of capital (COC) set to 4–8% (refs. 10,13,14), which is problematic as energy infrastructure research indicates large variations in COC across Africa15. The few studies that account for these variations leverage data from the oil and gas sector16 or country-specific ratings17,18,19, which do not adequately represent the specific risks associated with green H2 investments and lack empirical calibration. Consequently, current modelling risks producing overly optimistic green H2 levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) estimates for export from African countries due to inaccurate representation of their investment and policy environments20. Given the existing north–south disparities regarding decisionmaking power and future visions for the sector21, this is ever more concerning because it could result in unviable infrastructure investments and stranded assets without development benefits in African countries.

To tackle this issue, here we estimate COC across potential green H2 exporters in Africa for four realistic financing scenarios and use these to calculate LCOH. Differentiating COC by country, financing structure and interest rate environment—verified through expert interviews—we optimize green H2 production locations using GeoH2 (refs. 13,14), a geospatial least-cost model that optimizes production, transport, storage and conversion using granular spatial data. On the basis of an overview of currently planned projects, we model the case of ammonia production, which is shipped and reconverted to H2 in Europe. For simplicity, we choose Rotterdam as the entry port, and we exclude the possibility of pipeline construction or refurbishment for transport to Europe as we analyse the cost of projects to be operational in 2030. A flowchart in Supplementary Fig. 9 depicts the process, which is described in Methods.

To understand the status of green H2 development throughout the African continent, we identified all projects planned to be operational by 2030. We restricted the analysis to African countries with port access, as landlocked countries would need to negotiate agreements to secure transportation to ports, introducing further complexity and uncertainty. Somalia and Libya are excluded due to political instability, and small island states are excluded due to infrastructure and space constraints, resulting in a sample of 31 countries (Methods). Thirty-four projects are found across seven countries (Fig. 1), 89% of which are either at concept or feasibility stages. Two of the projects have reached a financial investment decision and are under construction, and only one small-scale project (that is, 3.5 MW) in South Africa is operational. Planned project sizes vary from 3.5 MW to 6.9 GW. Whereas Egypt and South Africa have numerous smaller projects planned, Mauritania has three large projects planned, totalling 7 GW of capacity. This includes giga-scale projects Nour and Aman, two of the largest green H2 export projects planned globally22,23.

Only projects planned to go online by 2030 are included. Projects can have more than one end use; hence, shares in b add up to 112%. Information on local versus export end use is unavailable. Note that capacity figures were not available for two planned projects in Mauritania and Morocco. Methods provide data sources and details on sample selection. Data as of December 2023. FID, final investment decision.

Figure 1 shows that 74% of planned electrolyser capacity is intended for ammonia (NH3) production. NH3 offers advantages as a H2 carrier for long-distance transport, including higher volumetric energy density compared to gaseous or liquid H2, and avoiding the boil-off rate of liquefied H2 (refs. 24,25). Moreover, unlike gaseous or liquid H2, international trade networks for NH3 are well established, so existing port facilities and trade routes can be utilized for shipping. Finally, the 2024 H2Global auction for African green H2 to be exported to Europe has resulted in a winning bid from an Egyptian project shipping NH3 to Rotterdam, illustrating the practical relevance of the case. For the remainder of this Article, we therefore analyse the economic viability of exporting green H2 by producing NH3, maintaining this state for transport and shipping and converting NH3 to H2 upon import. This excludes the consideration of other shipping carriers, such as liquid organic hydrogen carriers or methanol (CH4), as the intent of this work is not a comprehensive cost modelling of different theoretical options but providing guidance on the expected cost competitiveness of green H2 exported from African countries to Europe by 2030.

To date, only three green H2 deals have reached financial closure on the African continent, as shown in Fig. 1. Consequently, it is impossible to draw on empirical data regarding the COC for green H2 projects across African countries. Therefore, we developed four financing scenarios shown in Table 1, estimated the COC for each and triangulated the approach through 12 semi-structured expert interviews conducted in February–September 2023 (Methods). The scenarios are defined based on two dimensions: the general interest rate environment (reflecting the risk-free rate) and the policy environment. On interest rate, we depict an investment-friendly world with low interest rates reflective of the time after the financial crisis in 2008 (2009–2013) and a cash-constrained world with high interest rates reflective of the most recent full year of data available (August 2023–July 2024; Methods). For policy, we contrast a de-risked scenario, where European policymakers issue a complete price and off-taker guarantee to lower investment risk, with a commercial scenario, where investment risk lies entirely with the project sponsor. The COC in the de-risked scenario differs by country despite identical offtake guarantees because, based on expert interviews, we assume projects require insurance against expropriation and war by the World Bank Group (Methods provide operationalizing scenarios). As such, the COC can be understood as an aggregate financial metric, which includes underlying techno-economic and socio-political risks. Contrary to many existing reports12, which calculate the cost of green H2 first and then incorporate risk as a qualitative contextual factor, this approach allows us to consider these risks and their variance by country explicitly in the modelling of the cost of green H2 via the COC.

Figure 2 shows the calculated COC for green H2 projects by country, including investment into dedicated renewable generation and transport infrastructure, for scenarios 1 and 2. These are most representative of the current macroeconomic environment where interest rates are relatively high (Methods), and they illustrate the de-risking effect of offtake guarantees by European governments. Data on scenarios 3 and 4 are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1.

a, COC for a private commercial and a public de-risked scenario in a high general interest environment (scenarios 1 and 2). b, Average COC for all scenarios. Country COC for a low interest rate environment is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Country differences result from different investment risks based on default spreads, whereas differences between policy scenarios—commercial versus de-risked—are the result of different sources of capital and premia (Methods). Excludes landlocked countries and Libya and Somalia (Methods).

Figure 2 shows the large variance in commercial COC across the sampled countries, from 26.5% in Sudan to 10.6% in Morocco with an average of 15.5%. It also shows that de-risking projects has two effects. First, it lowers the COC for all countries to 9.0% on average (a 42% reduction). This improves the economic viability of green H2 substantially as shown in subsequent analyses (Figs. 3–5). Second, de-risking reduces the variance of COC across countries. Whereas in the commercial scenario, COC varies by 15.9 percentage points across countries, this variance reduces to 1.9 percentage points in a de-risked scenario. Hence, de-risking acts as a leveller, bringing green H2 costs across different countries much closer together.

Each violin plot shows the distribution of LCOH for imports from all modelled locations to Rotterdam. The width of the violin indicates the density of the distribution. Scenarios are defined as shown in Table 1. The orange line represents the cost of producing green H2 in Rotterdam by 2030 as described in Methods; the green line shows green H2 least cost realized in the European Hydrogen Bank auction closed in February 2024 with production scheduled to start in 2029 at the latest (Supplementary Table 6). Colours indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of green hydrogen produced in Rotterdam. Note that violin plots are fizzy at the end points, which exceed the minimum/maximum of the distribution. Supplementary Fig. 8 provides a boxplot for clear minimum/maximum values. The dotted line on the colour bar denotes the mean modelled cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam across the four scenarios. Dashed black lines within the violin plots indicate the median, and dotted black lines indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles. Supplementary Table 2 provides exact values. Excludes landlocked countries and Libya and Somalia (Methods).

The orange line represents the cost of producing green H2 in Rotterdam by 2030 as described in Methods. Colours are on the same scale as in Fig. 3 and indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam, yellow is near the European cost and red is likely to be uncompetitive. Dashed black lines within the violin plots indicate the median and dotted black lines indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles. Supplementary Fig. 2 details scenarios 3 and 4. Excludes landlocked countries and Libya and Somalia (Methods).

The detailed map costs shown are for scenario 2, cash-constrained de-risked. Supplementary Fig. 4 details scenario 1. Supplementary Fig. 3 provides continent maps for scenarios 3 and 4. Countries are not shown to scale to improve readability; each hexagon is the same area across all sub-figures. Colours indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam, yellow is near the European cost and red is likely to be uncompetitive. The dotted line on the colour bar denotes the mean modelled cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam across the four scenarios. Stars denote planned projects, as listed in Fig. 1. Triangles denote the respective port of the country. Basemaps from GADM.

Finally, the absolute de-risking effect amounts to 6.5 percentage points, irrespective of the interest rate environment (Fig. 2b), which translates into a relative reduction of 42–52% depending on the interest rate scenario. Hence, the policy effect of 6.5 percentage points exceeds the difference between the two interest rate scenarios of 3 percentage points, and the combined difference of policy and interest rate environment amounts to a staggering 9.5 percentage points (average difference between scenarios 1 and 4).

The GeoH2 model is employed to calculate the LCOH achievable in each country by optimizing location-specific production, transport, storage and conversion. The greenfield cost of NH3 production from renewable electricity is modelled for 10,300 hexagons (~1,770 km2 each) covering the 31 sample countries (Methods). A plant size of 300 MW, the median size of African projects with a planned operation by 2030, is modelled (Fig. 1). Hourly solar and wind data are used to optimize solar PV, onshore wind, battery storage, electrolysis, H2 storage and NH3 storage, subject to realistic technical constraints (Methods). As we consider plants to be operational by 2030, we focus on shipping to Europe (that is, Rotterdam) rather than pipeline transport, a potential option for North African countries. Given the recent results of H2Global auctions, shipping is confirmed to be the most realistic option for North African countries, such as Egypt, too. We assume the NH3 is transported from the production location to the closest domestic port and shipped to Rotterdam, where it is converted into green H2. Pipeline and trucking transport to the port are considered; the cheapest option is selected for each hexagon. Shipping costs to Rotterdam are calculated per distance based on the literature (Methods). LCOH is calculated for each hexagon using country-specific COC values (for example, as in Fig. 2) for the four scenarios in Table 1. The results are contrasted with a European green H2 cost estimate inferred from our model and triangulated with values from literature.

Figure 3 shows the resulting LCOH distribution across the sampled coastal African countries under each financing scenario. In a high interest environment (scenarios 1 and 2), least costs for green H2 exported from Africa are €4.9 kgH2−1 without policy support and €3.8 kgH2−1 when fully de-risked by European governments. In a low interest environment (scenarios 3 and 4), these costs come down to €4.2 kgH2−1 and €3.2 kgH2−1, respectively. Recent auction results from H2Global point to a price of green H2 around €4.5 kgH2−1 for de-risked delivery to Rotterdam from 2027 until 203326, well in line with our results. Our results also demonstrate the importance of de-risking, which reduces least costs by €1.1 kgH2−1 and median costs by €3.9 kgH2−1 (average between high- and low interest environment).

The lowest achievable costs in the sampled African countries are roughly in the range of estimates for European green H2 by 2030, around €3–5 kgH2−1 (Methods), demonstrating that achieving cost competitiveness with European green H2 will be challenging. In the current high interest macroeconomic environment, cost-competitive production (that is, below costs in Rotterdam estimated at €4.67–4.75 kgH2−1 with slight variations according to scenarios; Methods and Supplementary Table 2) is unattainable without de-risking. With de-risking, only 2.1% of all studied locations are economically competitive (Supplementary Table 2 and compare Fig. 4). These are situated in Algeria, Kenya, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia and Sudan. In a low interest rate environment, the proportions of locations reaching cost competitiveness without de-risking remains minimal at 0.5% (11.0% with de-risking). We find no location competitive with the first round of auction results by the European Hydrogen Bank, which yielded a lowest bid of €2.8 kgH2−1 in Spain (Supplementary Table 6).

De-risking not only increases the number of cost-competitive African locations but also narrows the cost distribution substantially across countries. Costs range from €4.9–22.8 kgH2−1 without de-risking in the current macroeconomic environment but only from €3.8 to €12.0 kgH2−1 with de-risking. Irrespective of the interest rate environment, the lowest-cost locations for green H2 production without de-risking are mainly in Morocco and Algeria, due to their relatively good institutional quality, exceptional wind resources and relative proximity to Rotterdam. With de-risking, the lowest-cost locations shift to Mauritania with a few in Algeria and Namibia. Whereas Mauritania shares Morocco's advantages in wind resources and proximity to Europe, it has lower institutional quality, reflected in its higher COC compared to Morocco (that is, 13.6% versus 10.6% without de-risking, 8.6% versus 8.1% with de-risking).

To further clarify spatial cost variance, Fig. 5a,b maps continent-wide LCOH for scenarios 1 and 2 alongside planned project locations (Supplementary Fig. 3 for scenarios 3 and 4). It also shows detailed LCOH for countries with planned projects above 1 MW for scenario 2 (Fig. 5c–i and Supplementary Fig. 4 for scenario 1). Most low-cost regions are north of the Equator, with some in the Southern Hemisphere. Equatorial costs are high due to moderate wind resources and consistent cloud cover, increasing renewable energy cost and thus LCOH. We identify least-cost green H2 production locations in the Western Sahara (modelled as part of Morocco, the authors make no statement about its political status), Mauritania, Central Algeria, at the Sudanese–Egyptian border and Lake Turkana's shores at the Kenyan–Ethiopian border. Some coastal areas in Namibia and South Africa also exhibit low costs as shown in Fig. 5h,i.

To increase the number of cost-competitive African green H2 production locations, cost drivers and cost-reduction levers must be identified. To this end, a detailed cost breakdown for the least-cost green H2 location by country is provided in Fig. 6. This figure shows that the lowest LCOH is achieved by leveraging excellent onshore wind resources, which facilitate lower-cost green H2 production than solar photovoltaics (PV) systems due to their more consistent electricity output. Scrutinizing the temporal optimization results, we find that NH3 and compressed H2 storage are used to balance intermittent renewable energy generation and demand more cost competitively than battery storage in all examined countries' least-cost production locations (Supplementary Fig. 5). Nevertheless, more consistent wind resources reduce the expenditure required for any form of storage, driving down costs.

Cost for the least-cost location in each country under scenario 2, cash-constrained de-risked. Supplementary Fig. 6 shows scenario 1. ‘Other' contains costs for H2 compression and decompression, trucking transportation, battery interface, Haber–Bosch process, H2 fuel cell and a ramping penalty. Excludes landlocked countries and Libya and Somalia (Methods).

Figure 6 also shows that renewable energy investment constitutes the largest cost component for all countries. This points to two levers for cost reductions. First, lowering renewable energy costs would directly reduce the cost of green H2. This could potentially enhance the cost competitiveness of African green H2 exports, depending on concurrent impacts on European electricity prices, as these would probably move too if renewable energy costs shift drastically. Note that we currently consider a Rotterdam reference case using grid electricity. If contrasted with a newly built renewable energy production facility, wind energy cost changes would only affect the relative cost advantage to the extent that African projects face a higher COC and therefore benefit from a CAPEX reduction slightly more. Secondly, efficient de-risking (that is, maximally reducing the COC) can lower COC-intensive investments into renewables and consequently green H2 costs. Whereas movements in the general interest rate would affect the cost competitiveness of African projects compared to European ones only to the extent that African projects are more capital intensive because they require greenfield renewable energy, strong de-risking would improve the cost competitiveness of African projects directly. Finally, shipping costs are shown to have a marginal impact on LCOH. This suggests that potential economies of scale in NH3 shipping or repurposing existing pipelines from northern Africa to southern Europe may not notably enhance cost competitiveness of African green H2. On the upside, it indicates that uncertainties around NH3 shipping costs should not constitute a major impediment to planning green H2 export projects in African countries. We conduct a sensitivity analysis shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 where we vary the most important and most discussed input costs (that is, wind, solar PV and electrolyser CAPEX) by ± 20% for each financing scenario, indicating that a combination of wind and electrolyser CAPEX reductions could lower costs by roughly €0.5 kgH2−1 depending on the scenario. We note that battery storage costs may also decrease substantially making solar PV a more viable electricity source by powering the electrolyser at night (compared with Supplementary Fig. 5). However, for the purpose of this analysis, we subsume this effect into the modelled cost decrease of solar PV, which yielded minimal benefits as shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Our findings indicate that using African green H2 to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors in Europe might be unrealistic without de-risking from European countries, at least in the near-term. In a commercial scenario, green H2 from Africa is not cost competitive by 2030. With de-risking, several locations (2.1% of all studied) become cost competitive, yet questions around the economic feasibility of large infrastructure projects in many of these locations remain, as they face challenging localized security situations. Notwithstanding these challenges, de-risking is probably necessary to develop a market with a sufficient portfolio of potential locations, and future research is required to assess the potential for improved competitiveness beyond 2030.

Results also illuminate potential issues beyond cost that could hinder investment. First, many low-cost locations are in regions that are either politically contested or encounter relatively regular flares of armed conflict where the UK and German governments advise against travel. These include Western Sahara (partly), Central Algeria (border areas), the Sudanese–Egyptian border (entire Sudan) and the Kenyan–Ethiopian border (border areas in Ethiopia)27,28. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or off-taker guarantees are probably unavailable in these areas, limiting de-risking potential. While beyond the scope of this paper, future analyses could consider investment risk variations within countries, including in specific regions with severe political instabilities. Second, the size of the planned investments relative to the GDP raises questions on feasibility. For example, as of 2021, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Mauritania is roughly US$10 billion; however, the planned green H2 project Aman is estimated to require an investment of US$40 billion, four times the country's GDP29,30. This situation is concerning as many African countries face massive foreign debt burdens31. Third, whereas we find that wind resources are critical to low-cost green H2 production, local expertise to install this wind capacity may be insufficient. For context, there were 7.7 GW of installed wind capacity on the continent in 2022 (versus 12.5 GW of solar PV)15; meanwhile, wind plants on GW scale will be needed for each H2 production site (for example, up to 1.6 GW in Morocco), requiring massive upskilling efforts. Finally, some low-cost locations, such as those near the Red Sea or the river Nile in Egypt, may also face challenges of water insecurity potentially disrupting consistent production. Whereas water costs are considered in GeoH2, the potential for water depletion and associated conflict risks are not at present.

African countries will face global competition for cheap green H2 production from countries such as Chile32, Oman33 and Saudi Arabia1 with plans to expand production of H2 and downstream products (for example, iron). These countries have the domestic financial resources to fund infrastructure development, institutional frameworks to attract large international private investment and strategic locations along major international trading routes. European countries such as Spain also offer favourable H2 production costs, low COC and proximity to demand locations17. Tailored de-risking support from international organizations, such as the World Bank or the United Nations Development Program34,35, may therefore be necessary for African nations to compete. The use of such support tools should be contingent on the provision of benefits of green H2 production for local economies beyond export revenues only.

Similarly, African countries should consider such benefits in bilateral negotiations with prospective green H2 importers. Considering the prospects for local industrial use of green H2 (for example, in creating value-added downstream products) when designing policy support schemes may favour countries such as Morocco, Egypt, South Africa or Kenya, in contrast to Mauritania or Namibia, as the latter exhibit less fitting industrial pre-conditions, which are relevant for the successful implementation of green H2 production value chains36. African countries could also strike intra-continental agreements concerning the optimal production, use and trade of green H2, which may necessitate modelling costs for countries that are excluded in the present analysis. International organizations may consider de-risking local use in such cases. Whereas potentially more challenging, such multi-use projects may improve developmental impacts and avoid neo-colonial extractive patterns of excessively large, export-only projects—a risk evident in planned projects. Comprehensive plans for economic development around green H2 production will be crucial to ensure a beneficial industry for decarbonization in Europe and development in Africa alike.

As described in the flowchart in Supplementary Fig. 9, we start by describing the sample. We model the LCOH for all African countries with access to ports, excluding landlocked countries, due to the logistical and infrastructural complexities that hinder H2 export from these areas. Further, Somalia and Libya are excluded from our analysis given that in the past 5 years, both countries were in the bottom 5% of the World Bank Governance Indicators in terms of political stability37. It is therefore likely that investors would refrain from any project in these countries, irrespective of the theoretical COC. Finally, we exclude small island states such as Cape Verde or Mauritius from our analysis due to space and infrastructure constraints. This yields a list of 31 African countries for our sample, which constitutes 85% of total African GDP38.

To collect planned green H2 projects, we use the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Hydrogen Database, which lists 1,991 H2 projects as of December 202322. Of these, 66 projects are located in our sample countries and plan to produce H2 from electrolysis using renewable electricity from either wind or solar. Note that our scope excludes two projects in Zimbabwe, one of which was decommissioned in 2015, and one project in Niger. We further restrict our sample to projects planned to go online by 2030 for two reasons. First, announced projects with live dates beyond 2030 are probably speculative, and it is difficult to assess the credibility of the plans. Second, the COC and several other cost factors, such as the cost of renewables or the cost of NH3 shipping are changing over time, making cost projections beyond 2030 difficult.

The final green H2 project sample consists of 34 projects, for which we include the project's development status, planned first year of operation, designated end-use applications and size in standardized electrolysis capacity as calculated by the IEA in MW H2 output (LHV) for all Power-to-X projects (Supplementary Table 3)22. We use the median planned capacity of 60.6 kt H2 yr−1 as the green H2 demand for the LCOH modelling. Capacity affects the LCOH via economies of scale (for example, in the electrolyser) and space constraints as larger projects need more space, mainly for renewable energy build-out.

Between February and August 2023, F. Schneider and F. Egli conducted 12 virtual exploratory expert interviews with 13 representatives to inform the financing scenarios shown in Table 1. Because green H2 projects at scale are currently hypothetical on the African continent, the interviews served to understand the planned financing structures. All interviews followed the same question guide provided in a slide deck to interviewees. Interviewees were sampled from organizations that would probably be involved in financing deals if de-risked by European policymakers. Early interviewees were contacted using the researchers' network and subsequent ones via snowball sampling. Systematic sampling is impossible because few experts globally can comment on the planned financing structures. Note that interviews only served to triangulate our COC estimation approach, which is based on peer-reviewed literature. Hence, we are less concerned about potential sampling biases regarding gender or region. Interviews took place under Chatham House rules, and consent to use provided information in research was obtained at the beginning together with shared information on the research project in the form of a slide deck. No personal information beyond participants' names and affiliations was obtained and interviewees are listed anonymously only. An overview of the interview sample is provided in Supplementary Table 4.

The COC is the price that a profit-maximizing capital provider demands for investing equity into a project or issuing debt (for example, loans) for a project. The COC increases with the risk for an investor of being unable to recoup their investment, for example, due to uncertain policy environments or novel risky technologies. In financial economics, it is common practice to decompose the COC into a risk-free rate (reflecting the time value of money) and a risk premium (reflecting the investment-specific risk). The latter typically differs between countries, technologies and over time39. A standard project-level specification of the COC is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), where capital is sourced from equity and debt financing. The WACC reflects the costs of obtaining debt and equity financing, respectively, and the share of each type within the total capital budget. In line with the literature39, a standard notation ‘vanilla-WACC' (no consideration of potential tax deductions for debt payments) can be defined as follows:

where \({K}_{{\mathrm{e}},{{i}}}\) and \({K}_{{\mathrm{d}},i}\) denote the cost of equity and the cost of debt, respectively, for investments in a specific country i. \(E\), \(D\) and \(V\) denote total equity, debt and capital; the debt share is denoted as \(\frac{D}{V}\). As we model the case of exporting green H2 from Africa to Europe, it is uncertain which entities would be liable to pay tax where and we do not consider a country-specific tax rate. We use the terms COC and WACC interchangeably in this paper, focusing on COC in the main text for simplicity. In the absence of a track record for the financing of green H2 projects globally and certainly in Africa, we define four financing scenarios to model the COC based on insights from the finance literature and expert interviews (Table 1, main text).

Across all financing scenarios, we use a separate COC for the plant investment encompassing H2 production facilities (for example, the electrolyser), the renewable energy generation assets and the supporting infrastructure encompassing roads, pipelines and so on. The risk-free rate \({r}_\mathrm{f}\) is based on two indicators: a long-term risk-free bond, commonly depicted with the 10-year US treasury bond yield and an overnight interbank rate reflecting the current interest rate environment, commonly depicted with the Effective Federal Funds Rate (FFR). In line with previous work40, we estimate \({r}_\mathrm{f}\) for a high and a low interest rate scenario to account for the fact that the interest rate environment has a large impact on the cost of renewables. We set \({r}_{\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{low}}}\) to 2%, which is reflective of the 5-year average of the 10-year treasury bond in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 between 2009 and 2013 (2.68%), considering the FFR was substantially lower during that period (0.14%)41,42. Conversely, \({r}_{\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{high}}}\) is set to 5%, which is representative of the high interest environment over the last year (August 2023–July 2024) at the time of writing. During this period, the average 10-year US treasury bond yield stood at 4.33% and the FFR at 5.33% (refs. 41,42). In this Article, we therefore consider the high interest rate environment (Table 1) to be representative of the status quo. The share of debt in total financing, \(\frac{D}{V}\), is assumed to be 75% across all scenarios18.

We model a commercial scenario in both interest rate environments (Table 1, main text). For these commercial scenarios 1 and 3, we define the cost of debt to reflect lending to a large infrastructure project in a specific country. Namely, we add a country default spread to reflect country risk43 (\({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\)) and a lender margin (\({L}_\mathrm{m}\)), which we set to 2% in line with the literature15,44,45, to reflect infrastructure risk. The country default spreads are reflective of country risk at the time of writing in 2023. The cost of debt for the plant is therefore given by:

Similar to the cost of debt, the cost of equity contains a country mark-up. Furthermore, we add an equity risk premium and a technology premium to reflect the additional risk of equity compared to debt and the risk of green H2 investments, as there is a very limited track record. The cost of equity for commercial scenarios was calculated as follows:

where ERP is the equity risk premium of a mature market, set to 5% in July 202343. \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) varies by country i and accounts for the return that investors require as compensation for the risk of an investment in a publicly listed company in each country. In addition, the technology premium (Tp) reflects that green H2 is a relatively immature technology with a limited track record of successfully constructing large-scale projects. Following a recent IRENA report15, Tp is set to 3.25%, reflecting an investment premium for novel technologies. Because ref. 43 does not provide \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) and \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) for Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Djibouti and Mauritania, \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) is obtained using Wikiratings as described in Supplementary Table 5. Thereafter, \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) is calculated following the approach suggested by ref. 43.

Finally, we assume that any supporting infrastructure will be financed by a project's host government at its sovereign rate. Consequently, the COC for infrastructure is given by:

For the de-risked scenarios 2 and 4 (Table 1, main text), we model a situation where a green H2 project on the African continent benefits from access to below-market terms financing due to an offtake guarantee from a western European government entity. This assumption follows developments driven in particular by Germany, which has established diplomatic relations to support the transition of current fossil fuel exporting nations such as Angola or Nigeria to a decarbonized energy export industry by substituting fossil fuel exports at least partially by H2 (ref. 46). Moreover, Germany has recently announced a joint declaration of intent with the Netherlands to implement a joint tender under the H2Global Instrument, offering 10-year purchase agreements to suppliers to kick-start the emergent European green H2 import market47. Finally, Germany has signed further bilateral partnership agreements with countries such as South Africa48, Namibia49 and Kenya50.

In these scenarios, the cost of debt can be represented as follows:

where \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{\mathrm{WesternEU}}\) represents the average default spread of a western European country weighted by its GDP, where western Europe includes Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom43. In July 2023, this amounted to 0.96% (ref. 43). Despite the offtake guarantee, certain risks, such as the risk of expropriation or war, will remain. Consequently, we assume that in scenarios 2 and 4, investors will seek insurance against such political risks, which could disrupt operations or damage assets. Informed by the expert interviews and because private political risk insurance is not available in most countries in our sample, we assume political risk insurance by the World Bank Group's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). \({\mathrm{MIGA}}_{{\mathrm{expr}}_{i}}\) and \({\mathrm{MIGA}}_{{\mathrm{war}}_{i}}\) represent the price for obtaining such coverage for war and expropriation risk. As the MIGA pricing is confidential, we develop a heuristic to approximate the pricing based on reports and the expert interviews. Reference 51 states that the price per MIGA risk ranges from 0.5% to 1.75% of the total sum insured, depending on the country and project risk. Assuming that in a de-risked scenario, only country risk will remain as the project is fully de-risked, the distribution of in-sample country risk, reflected by the credit default spread provided by ref. 43 can be mapped onto the pricing range indicated by ref. 51. Formally, the approach can be represented as follows:

where \(x\) is the percentile of the default spread of a country based on ref. 43, \(g\left(x\right)\) returns the percentile of the CDS in the sample distribution and f() maps the percentile to the corresponding percentile of the MIGA pricing range51.

The cost of equity was calculated as follows:

where \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{\mathrm{WesternEU}}\) reflects the average equity country risk premium in Western Europe weighted by GDP. In July 2023, this premium was 1.37% (ref. 43).

Finally, we assume that infrastructure in the de-risked scenarios is either financed by the host government, that is, as in the commercial scenarios or financed by the project sponsor backed with an offtake guarantee from a western European government. We therefore define the COC for infrastructure investments in the de-risked scenarios as the minimum of the host government's sovereign rate \({\mathrm{WACC}}_{\mathrm{commercial},\mathrm{infra}}\) and the de-risked COC based on \({K}_{\mathrm{e},i,\mathrm{derisked},\mathrm{plant}}\) and \({K}_{\mathrm{d},i,\mathrm{derisked},\mathrm{plant}}\). A detailed breakdown of how the COC components were obtained and the corresponding data sources are provided in Supplementary Table 5.

The GeoH2 optimization model is used to calculate the lowest possible cost of H2 achievable throughout each country, assuming an electrolyser lifetime of 20 years. Electrolyser lifetimes are subject to some uncertainty, but do not have a major impact on LCOH52 and most importantly for this analysis, affect the LCOH in European and African countries alike except for a small penalty for Africa-based production due to higher financing costs on the CAPEX. The model tessellates the country into hexagons and calculates the costs to (1) produce the specified quantity of green H2 (or here green NH3) in each hexagon, (2) convert it to the required state for transport and (3) transport it to a specified demand location. In each hexagon, a cost-optimal off-grid H2 plant powered by PV and wind turbines is designed to meet the specified demand. The electrical infrastructure (that is, PV, turbines, battery storage) and plant infrastructure (that is, electrolyser, NH3 storage, compressed H2 storage) are sized for cost optimality using site-specific, hourly weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 dataset53. Here data for the duration of 2022 are used. The Corine Land Cover54 and OpenStreetMap55 datasets are used to constrain land availability in each hexagon, and country boundary base maps are from GADM, which allows free academic re-use. The costs to transport the H2 to port are calculated for both road transport (that is, trucking) and pipeline transport, including construction of necessary infrastructure. Water costs for either desalination or freshwater processing are included as applicable—however, no limit is placed on water consumption to avoid depletion in either case. Cost parameters used in the modelling are available in Supplementary Table 1 and harmonized to 2023 euros using average annual US$/€ exchange rates from the Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and an annual average of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices from Eurostat. Further details on the GeoH2 model implementation are available in the model descriptor14.

The model is applied to each country in the project sample. A demand of 60.6 ktH2 yr−1 is simulated at each country's main port. This demand is assumed to be met in the form of green NH3 (that is, 341.4 ktNH3 yr−1) due to its cost advantages in shipping and to be temporally uniform (that is, evenly spaced truck pick-ups throughout the year or a consistent pipeline flow rate). As NH3 is utilized as a transport vector, we build on the ammonia trade literature. A first stream of this literature investigates green ammonia costs in/from specific countries56,57 and trading routes58 whereby a second stream of literature looks at global ammonia trade. Reference 59 applies a global optimization model to locate optimal ammonia production sites, however the site selection is based on a previous paper and planned projects, considering a total of 112 sites. Such models are great to assess the cost competitiveness of planned projects; however, they cannot compare these to alternative possibilities as we do for the African continent. Finally, ref. 60 applies a geospatial model in 28 countries with a less granular resolution within country and abstracting from water costs and transportation options to port (pipeline vs trucking), which are included in this paper. Hence, whereas the key contribution of this paper is the inclusion and comparison of different financing and policy scenarios and the explicit calculation of the cost differentials for the entire African continent, we also apply a state-of-the-art bottom-up model, which can serve to improve within-country cost comparisons.

Country-specific figures are used for energy prices, heat prices and interest rates. Level-four H3 hexagons61 are used to define the spatial resolution. Land availability is constrained such that H2 production and associated generation are not permitted to be built on wetland, built-up areas, water bodies or within 250 m of coastlines or protected areas. PV is additionally not permitted to be built on agricultural land. Whereas elevation is not considered as an exclusion criterion here due to data constraints, future work may also wish to exclude high elevations or steep slopes. All maps are based on the authors' own analysis of publicly available input data. Note that this work leverages a model of the Haber–Bosch process in plant optimization in place of the H2 production process available in the standard GeoH2 model14. This variant of the codebase is made available on GitHub (Code Availability).

To account for shipping costs, the sea distance from each of the exporting ports to Rotterdam is first calculated using the ShipTraffic website62. Previous work has estimated the cost of shipping NH3 over a distance of approximately 13,800 km to be €0.39 kgH2−1 (ref. 13). Following ref. 24, shipping cost projections depend approximately linearly on transport distance. Consequently, we scale this estimate linearly to km, resulting in our cost parameter of €0.00003 kgNH3−1 km−1, which we multiplied with each of the obtained distances from the African port to Rotterdam. Implementing this approach yields a shipping cost range of €0.09 kgH2−1 (Morocco)–€0.44 kgH2−1 (Mozambique), in line with other estimates in the literature, according to which shipping could add up to €0.46 kgH2−1 by 203063.

The interest rates for Rotterdam are obtained following the same approach as for all other countries described in Methods and following previous work, heat costs of €0.06 kWh−1 are assumed for converting NH3 to H2 (ref. 13). Note that the cost of this process is subject to some uncertainty because it does not yet exist at scale. Electricity costs are assumed to be €0.1 kWh−1 and are calculated as the combination of the average price of Dutch Power Base futures64 and the price of a guarantee of origin for renewable electricity. At the time of writing, Dutch Power Base futures are available until October 2028, and the average price obtained is €0.097 kWh−1. Ideally, we would base our calculation on a Dutch Power Base future that matches our modelling period of 20 years. As this is not available, we took the longest available market-based future as input for our simplified model in Rotterdam using constant electricity prices. Moreover, future prices reflect the current interest rate environment; hence, we deem our Rotterdam costing most representative for scenarios 1 and 2, on which all results in the main text are based and suggest some caution when using it for scenarios 3 and 4. On the basis of grey literature65, an average price of a guarantee of origin of €0.055 kWh−1 by 2030 is assumed. Whereas Rotterdam serves as our comparison case, the resulting electricity cost is deemed representative of the European Union as a whole, given that historically, Dutch wholesale electricity prices were strongly correlated with German wholesale electricity prices, and the Dutch wholesale price roughly represents the average wholesale electricity price in Europe66.

Our modelling excludes two cost components: namely, (1) costs associated with upgrading ports to enable large-scale NH3 shipments and (2) costs for last-mile distribution in Europe. Both would require detailed information (that is, on port design and demand locations respectively), which is beyond the scope of this analysis. Furthermore, our model does not account for potential cost reductions in onshore wind, solar PV, electrolysers and battery storage that may occur by the year 2030. Such cost decreases will not only reduce the cost of green H2 projects in Africa but may also influence renewable deployment in Europe and, therefore, European wholesale electricity prices. As such, the net effect on the cost competitiveness of African green H2 exports vs European green H2 production remains inconclusive.

Finally, we calculate the LCOH in Rotterdam to create a European cost benchmark. We use the same assumptions for electricity and heat costs as mentioned above to model LCOH for green H2 produced in Rotterdam using grid electricity due to space constraints for renewable energy. Due to the absence of renewable energy investments, these projects are much less capital intensive, and variations in the COC, therefore, are less important for LCOH. Note that recent auctions by the European Hydrogen Bank have yielded winning projects using grid electricity and/or greenfield renewable energy. Here we consider the former case only, whereas future research could model European least costs more comprehensively by considering all locations in Europe with their respective transport costs to demand centres. We calculate an LCOH for production in Rotterdam for each financing scenario shown in Table 1 and obtain an LCOH of €4.74 kgH2−1 for scenario 1, €4.72 kgH2−1 for scenario 2, €4.69 kgH2−1 for scenario 3 and €4.67 kgH2−1 for scenario 4 (Supplementary Table 2). Because large green H2 production plants do not currently exist, cost estimates are not commonly available, but several reports have tried to estimate costs. These are broadly in line with our costs; for example, Aurora Energy Research estimates the least-cost LCOH in Germany by 2030 between €3.9 and €5 kgH2−1 (ref. 67). Other research reports even lower 2030 costs for Germany of US$3.1 kgH2−1 in a baseline scenario and US$2.7 kgH2−1 in an optimistic scenario68, which is roughly the range where the IEA Global Hydrogen Review places North-Western European green H2 costs by 2020 (€3.1 kgH2−1) (ref. 1). Other European locations, such as Spain, with more favourable renewable energy sources and similarly favourable financing costs, may reach even lower costs by 2030 at €2.7 kgH2−1 as estimated by the Hydrogen Council and McKinsey69. These costs have been confirmed by the results of the recent European Hydrogen Bank auction yielding a lowest bid in Spain at €2.8 kgH2−1. For the four other countries where least costs were disclosed, they ranged from €4.6 kgH2−1 in Norway to €7.6 kgH2−1 in the Netherlands (Supplementary Table 6). Note that we prefer comparing our results to realized costs as comparisons across studies with different methodological approaches, spatial resolutions, geographical and technological scopes and policy cases considered are difficult (Supplementary Table 7). A thorough comparison of different studies on the subject would require a separate review article with a methodological approach to render comparisons meaningful.

Metrics details

Aging is one of the most prominent risk factors for neurodegeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the deterioration of old neurons are mostly unknown. To efficiently study neurodegeneration in the context of aging, we transdifferentiated primary human fibroblasts from aged healthy donors directly into neurons, which retained their aging hallmarks, and we verified key findings in aged human and mouse brain tissue. Here we show that aged neurons are broadly depleted of RNA-binding proteins, especially spliceosome components. Intriguingly, splicing proteins—like the dementia- and ALS-associated protein TDP-43—mislocalize to the cytoplasm in aged neurons, which leads to widespread alternative splicing. Cytoplasmic spliceosome components are typically recruited to stress granules, but aged neurons suffer from chronic cellular stress that prevents this sequestration. We link chronic stress to the malfunctioning ubiquitylation machinery, poor HSP90α chaperone activity and the failure to respond to new stress events. Together, our data demonstrate that aging-linked deterioration of RNA biology is a key driver of poor resiliency in aged neurons.

Our rapidly aging population poses one of the largest public health challenges in a generation1. A substantial portion of the public health burden is driven by neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which all increase in incidence rate as a function of age2. These pathologies are collectively defined by declining neuronal health, which manifests in devastating symptoms that are costly to manage and greatly reduce the overall quality of life in the aged population3. Systematic efforts over the past decades have identified biomarkers that are linked to neurodegeneration, but the vast majority of neurodegeneration cases have no familial history or single causal mutation4. Even in mutation-driven neurodegenerative pathologies, onset of symptoms is typically later in life, indicating that aging is an important contributor to disease. Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand how aging alone alters the molecular landscape of neurons and predisposes neurons for poor resiliency to external and internal stress.

Aging is generally linked to several molecular processes5. In neurons, the accumulation of aggregated proteins, dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mislocalization of disease-associated proteins are impacted by age and neurodegeneration-linked mutations6,7,8. However, the molecular interplay between these diverse cellular functions, their relative contribution to neurodegeneration and the importance of other implicated pathways are unknown, especially in an aged neuron that is susceptible to neurodegeneration. For example, the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in >95% of patients with ALS, and it directs the proper splicing of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins9,10. Yet we know little about how TDP-43 is initially mislocalized in patients with ALS, nor how it eventually forms aggregates in the absence of an ALS-linked mutation11. More broadly, RBPs and RNA biology are disrupted in neurodegeneration12,13, but it is unclear how the natural aging of neurons contributes to this dysregulation.

Here we leverage transdifferentiation to study the RNA biology of neurons in the context of aging. Transdifferentiation is an efficient means to study aging: human primary fibroblasts are directly converted to neurons, bypassing the pluripotent stem cell state that reverses most aging-associated damage14,15,16. In transdifferentiated neurons, we show that RNA metabolism is broadly dysregulated—key splicing proteins are mislocalized, the RBP-mediated stress response is chronically active and overall resilience to further acute stress is dampened. Depletion of the chaperone HSP90α from stress granules leads to their chronic retention. Notably, the aging human brain also displays the hallmarks of RBP dysregulation and chronic stress. Our findings demonstrate how aging alone functionally destabilizes the neuronal stress response and TDP-43-mediated splicing, which bridges a substantial gap in our understanding of how aging predisposes neurons toward neurodegeneration.

We generated isogenic transdifferentiated (Tdiff.1) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons (iPSC-diff.1) by transducing wild-type patient-derived fibroblasts or iPSCs, respectively, with lentivirus encoding doxycycline-inducible neuronal transcription factors (Fig. 1a). After differentiating in the presence of doxycycline and other small molecules for 3 weeks, we successfully produced >90% Map2+ and >80% Tubβ3+ neurons from fibroblasts and iPSCs (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1a–d), and the transdifferentiated neurons expressed several neuron-specific markers, including NeuN/RBFOX3 in the nucleus and synaptophysin at neurites (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). In addition, mature synaptic connections were observed (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Transdifferentiated neurons also fired both spontaneous and induced action potentials as measured by a multielectrode array (MEA; Extended Data Fig. 1i–k). We then verified that transdifferentiated neurons retained key aging markers. Bisulfite sequencing of CpG methylation, which can be used to estimate biological age17, indicated that the transdifferentiated neurons were similar in age to the original donor fibroblasts, whereas the iPSC-derived neurons and iPSCs exhibited fetal-like methylation patterns (Fig. 1d). Likewise, transdifferentiated neurons expressed higher levels of the senescence marker p16INK4A (Fig. 1e) and the apoptotic markers pro-caspase-3 and AIF (Fig. 1f,g), all of which are associated with aging18,19,20. Therefore, we used transdifferentiation to study neuronal aging.

Source data

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and differential expression analysis of the isogenic transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons revealed that over 4,000 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 1h). The upregulated pathways included the immune response and the lysosome, which are commonly upregulated in aged cells and further confirmed that transdifferentiated neurons retained expression of aging-linked genes21 (Supplementary Table 1). Whole-cell quantitative proteomics confirmed that most fibroblast markers were expressed at similar levels in iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons, whereas mature and glutamatergic neuronal markers were highly upregulated in both cell types (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), again indicating that our transdifferentiation process successfully converted fibroblasts into neurons. Notably, our proteomics data also revealed that known RBPs were broadly depleted in transdifferentiated neurons despite unchanged RBP transcript levels (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). Consistent with this depletion, the most de-enriched metabolic pathways of transdifferentiated neurons involved RNA metabolic processes like the spliceosome, the mRNA surveillance pathway and RNA transport (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Table 2). Gene set enrichment analysis likewise showed depletion of RBP-associated pathways in transdifferentiated neurons relative to iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2f). By mapping the proteomics data to the associated transcript levels, we also identified a large population of genes that were expressed highly as proteins but had normal or depleted transcript levels in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 1k). These highly retained proteins were associated with neurodegenerative pathways and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Given that oxidative phosphorylation was also upregulated more broadly in our proteomics data (Fig. 1j), we hypothesized that aged neurons were prioritizing metabolic pathways over RNA-related processes (Extended Data Fig. 2h), which may lead to destabilization of RNA biology.

Because the spliceosome was the most de-enriched of the RBP metabolism terms in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 1j), we performed immunofluorescence experiments to examine the subcellular localization of splicing proteins. Strikingly, we found that several spliceosome components were significantly mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in transdifferentiated neurons compared to the isogenic iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 2a). The mislocalization spanned across the various functional components of the spliceosome, including the U1 complex (SNRNP70 and SNRNPA), the tri-SNRNP complex (PRPF8 and SNRNP200) and proteins that direct alternative splicing (TDP-43 and TIA1)10,22,23. Notably, aged fibroblasts displayed a lower degree of splicing protein mislocalization (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Other proteins that can mediate alternative splicing, like FUS, were not substantially depleted from the nucleus (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), perhaps because FUS has another nuclear role in the DNA damage response24. Mislocalization of TDP-43 was observed in multiple transdifferentiated neuronal lines (Extended Data Fig. 3c), but not in neurons that were transdifferentiated from young neonatal fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

TDP-43 aggregation is implicated in >95% of ALS cases and >50% of Alzheimer's cases. In iPSC-derived neurons, prolonged stress treatments25 or truncation of the TDP-43 nuclear localization signal26 is required to observe TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation. In transdifferentiated neurons, super-resolution microscopy confirmed basal TDP-43 mislocalization and further revealed TDP-43 foci in the soma of these neurons without any exogenous manipulation (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Treatment with sodium arsenite, an acute oxidative stressor, for 1 h further showed that TDP-43 foci in the neuronal soma were distinct from canonical stress granules, which typically integrate TDP-43 but instead clustered independently in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Interrogation of TDP-43 interactions by affinity-pulldown mass spectrometry (AP-MS) from iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons revealed that spliceosome proteins were highly enriched in the TDP-43 interactome of transdifferentiated neurons despite their lower protein expression (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 3). Meanwhile, stress granule components like G3BP2 and Caprin1 were de-enriched in transdifferentiated neurons even when compared to TDP-43 pulldown in stressed iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3h–l). The strong association between TDP-43 and spliceosome components in aged neurons could not be recapitulated by simply treating iPSC-derived neurons with sodium arsenite (Extended Data Fig. 3h–j), indicating that it is an aging-specific phenomenon.

TDP-43 mediates the alternative splicing of hundreds of transcripts, and it was previously reported that loss of nuclear TDP-43 leads to the expression of STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons in patients with ALS27,28,29. Therefore, we next tested whether splicing of these TDP-43 targets was also dysregulated in aged neurons. We performed enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP)30 of TDP-43 in transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons to determine TDP-43 binding sites on RNA. Consistent with the nuclear depletion of TDP-43 that we observed, TDP-43 interacted with substantially fewer introns in transdifferentiated neurons despite retaining its canonical GU-rich binding motif31 (Fig. 2d–e). This reduced intronic binding coincided with a >2.5-fold depletion in TDP-43 binding to the ALS-linked cryptic exon splice sites in STMN2 and UNC13A (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c), although we did not detect cryptic exon expression (Extended Data Fig. 4d). We mapped TDP-43-bound introns to differentially spliced transcripts in aged neurons, and we observed significant changes in exon inclusion or exclusion events of approximately 500 transcripts, many of which were neuronal cytoskeleton proteins (Fig. 2f,g and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). For example, reduced TDP-43 binding at the intronic site between exons 35 and 36 of the neuromuscular junction protein AGRN led to the exclusion of these exons in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 2h). We observed a similar exon exclusion event in DNM1 (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Both AGRN and DNM1 are previously reported targets of TDP-43 splicing32, and dysregulation of AGRN is implicated in ALS33. Conversely, increased TDP-43 binding at exons 3 and 6 in the dementia-associated gene MAPT led to retention of those exons in transdifferentiated neurons, which is the expected alternative splicing pattern of MAPT in adults34,35 (Extended Data Fig. 4h).

To confirm that nuclear depletion of TDP-43 occurred as a function of aging, we tested whether the TDP-43 phenotypes we observed in transdifferentiated neurons were similar in aged wild-type mice (Fig. 2I). Immunofluorescence of 1.5-, 6- and 24-month-old mice confirmed that TDP-43 was mislocalized as a function of aging—neurons from the motor cortex of 1.5-month-old mice had strongly nuclear TDP-43, whereas the motor cortex neurons of 24-month-old mice TDP-43 contained cytoplasmic foci (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). These aggregates were not present in either the hippocampus or motor cortex of the 6-month-old mice (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Like TDP-43, core spliceosome proteins like PRPF8 and SNRPA—and the alternative splicing protein TIA1—were mislocalized in aged mice (Extended Data Fig. 5e). TDP-43 eCLIP of the 1.5-, 6- and 24-month-old mouse cerebellum also revealed age-dependent loss of intronic binding (Fig. 2k) despite retaining the normal TDP-43 binding motif (Fig. 2l and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Consistent with our findings using transdifferentiated neurons, we observed reduced TDP-43 binding to reported cryptic exon sites in aged mice32 (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Together, our data demonstrates that mislocalization of TDP-43 and other splicing components is an aging-related process that alters the splicing of hundreds of transcripts, many of which are important for neuronal health.

Our TDP-43 AP-MS and immunofluorescence results indicated that spliceosome components assembled independently of stress granules, which are the typical repository for cytoplasmic RBPs during stress events (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3g–l). Stress granules are biomolecular condensates that form in the cytoplasm due to activation of the integrated stress response36. One of the main functions of stress granules is the sequestration of mRNAs and RBPs until after the stress event is resolved37,38, and TDP-43 exclusion from stress granules is thought to lead to neurodegeneration-linked TDP-43 fibrillization39. Therefore, we tested whether dysregulation of the integrated stress response might be linked to TDP-43 mislocalization.

We performed AP-MS of G3BP1, which is a canonical stress granule marker. Consistent with our previous results from Fig. 2b, we found that spliceosome components were de-enriched from the G3BP1 interactome in aged neurons, especially TDP-43 (Figs. 2b and 3a and Supplementary Table 3). Acute stress treatment of iPSC-derived neurons caused a similar depletion of splicing proteins, indicating that transdifferentiated neurons might be basally stressed (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Other core stress granule proteins like Caprin1 were unchanged in transdifferentiated neurons, but auxiliary stress granule members like staufen-1 and staufen-2 were depleted, possibly due to their lower expression levels (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6b). The pulldown fold changes of spliceosome components for G3BP1 and TDP-43 were largely anticorrelated (Extended Data Fig. 6c), further indicating that they are distinct complexes in transdifferentiated neurons.

Source data

Under basal conditions, stress granule components are diffuse in the cytoplasm and will only assemble into condensates during stress events40. However, immunofluorescence revealed that core stress granule proteins like G3BP1 and Caprin1 pre-assembled into oblong, misshapen condensates in unstressed transdifferentiated neurons but not in iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6d). G3BP1 condensates were observed in many transdifferentiated neuronal lines (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f), and they were specific to aged neurons because fibroblasts and young transdifferentiated neurons did not contain these inclusions (Extended Data Fig. 6d–g). Phosphorylated eIF2α is the canonical marker for activation of the integrated stress response36, and we indeed observed higher levels of phosphorylated eIF2α in transdifferentiated neurons relative to unstressed iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 3c). The RNA-binding profile of G3BP1 and Caprin1 measured by eCLIP can also elucidate the stress status of cells; acute stress treatment causes stress granule proteins to bind more 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) rather than coding (CDS) RNA sequences, and we found elevated 3′ UTR binding in transdifferentiated neurons without stress treatment (Fig. 3d,e). Interestingly, the 3′ UTR sequences that were bound by G3BP1 and Caprin1 in transdifferentiated neurons were mostly unique and were not bound in unstressed iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 3f,g). The RNA-binding motif of Caprin1 was unchanged in aged neurons (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), suggesting that these cryptic 3′ UTR sequences were likely exposed due to chronic stress rather than a shift in RNA-binding preference by the stress granule protein. G3BP1- and Caprin1-bound RNAs were enriched for neuronal transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). Our data indicate that aged neurons are chronically stressed because of their unique, stress-associated phenotypes even at baseline conditions. Therefore, we refer to the stress granule-like inclusions in these aged neurons as chronic stress granules.

The formation of stress granules is associated with stalled translation36, and 3′ UTR binding by RBPs can also regulate translation of specific mRNAs41. Therefore, we used ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-seq)42 to determine the translation efficiency of stress granule-associated transcripts. In transdifferentiated neurons, thousands of transcripts had lower translation efficiency (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 7e). However, G3BP1- and Caprin1-bound transcripts had no shift in translation efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g), suggesting that chronic stress granules were not directly regulating translation in aged neurons. Moreover, we found that poly(A) RNA only accumulated into chronic stress granules in transdifferentiated neurons upon exogenous stress treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6i), and these granules were usually smaller and misshapen, indicating a reduction in fusion events43, relative to the canonical stress granules formed in iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Together, our data indicate that chronic, gel-like stress granules form in aged neurons, but they do not functionally alter translation.

The presence of chronic stress granules in aged neurons indicated that the dissolution of stress granules may be dysregulated, which in turn may exacerbate the dysregulated RNA metabolism we observed in Figs. 1 and 2. Stress granule resolution is mediated by ubiquitination of G3BP1, which is then recognized by VCP, a multifunctional protein that is involved in many ubiquitin-related processes44. ATPase activity of HSP90α, which also regulates the ubiquitinome, is required for proper resolution of stress granules45; HSP90 and VCP work together to clear misfolded proteins, leading to undetectable poly-ubiquitin chains in normal cells (Fig. 4a)46. We noticed in our affinity pulldowns of G3BP1 and TDP-43 that HSP90α and its subunits were among the most depleted interacting proteins in aged neurons, potentially indicating that dysregulation of this heat shock protein was causing poor stress granule resolution (Figs. 2b and 3a, Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 8a). HSP90α foci were also visibly distinct from chronic and arsenite-mediated stress granules in aged neurons (Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, VCP and its cofactor FAF2 were entirely absent from the G3BP1 interactome in transdifferentiated neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Therefore, we hypothesized that altered stress granule component ubiquitylation contributed to the lack of stress granule dissolution.

Statistics were calculated using a two-tailed Welch's t test. Ub, ubiquitin; SGs, stress granules.

We first measured the status of the ubiquitinome. As determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence, ubiquitination was broadly increased in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8c), which may be driving the integrated stress response through the accumulation of unfolded proteins47. Given that HSP90α chaperones hundreds of protein targets and is depleted from the stress granule interactome, we reasoned that its activity may be responsible for chronic stress granule presence. We then examined the HSP90α interactome, which confirmed the reduced interaction between HSP90α and stress granule proteins in aged neurons (Figs. 2b, 3a and 4d). HSP90α also did not bind to TDP-43 in transdifferentiated neurons despite interacting in iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8d). The HSP90α interactome of aged neurons was enriched with several proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation, including cytochrome c and the ubiquinone complex (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Notably, these oxidative phosphorylation proteins were highly expressed in aged neuron data despite having normal transcript expression (Fig. 1k,l, Extended Data Fig. 8f and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting a slow turnover rate that is perhaps caused by poor HSP90α activity.

To test if HSP90α might be stalled on ubiquitylated mitochondrial proteins, we performed a ubiquitin pulldown and MS in both transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons. Our results supported our hypothesis in the following three ways: (1) our ubiquitin pulldown in transdifferentiated neurons failed to directly detect any of the G3BP1/G3BP2 ubiquitin modifications that are required for stress granule turnover44 (Fig. 4e), (2) the pulldown found that G3BP1/G3BP2 were depleted from the ubiquitin interactome in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 4f) and (3) the mitochondrial proteins that bind HSP90α strongly in transdifferentiated neurons were also highly enriched in our ubiquitin pulldown (Fig. 4f,g). Together, these results indicate that stress granule turnover is deprioritized by protein chaperones and the ubiquitin machinery in favor of mitochondrial proteins.

Because HSP90α has ATPase-dependent foldase and ATPase-independent holdase activity48,49,50, we treated aged neurons with the HSP90α inhibitor ganetespib to bias the cells toward the holdase activity. We surprisingly found that HSP90α inhibitor treatment was sufficient to significantly reduce both chronic and arsenite-mediated stress granule formation (Fig. 4h,i), further indicating that HSP90α dysregulation contributes to the chronic stress observed in aged neurons.

The chronic activation of the integrated stress response in aged neurons may inhibit their effective response to new stress stimuli. For example, extended treatment with low levels of exogenous stressors was shown to dysregulate the integrated stress response in neuroblastoma cells51 and cause TDP-43 aggregation in motor neurons52. Therefore, we treated iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons with sodium arsenite for 1 h and allowed them to recover for up to 24 h. iPSC-derived neurons resolved ~50% of arsenite-induced stress granules within 2 h (Fig. 5a,b). Primary fibroblasts had similar stress granule recovery kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 9a). By contrast, transdifferentiated neurons responded poorly to stress and had elevated stress granule retention even 24 h postarsenite treatment (Fig. 5a,b). Poor stress granule resolution in transdifferentiated neurons was also observed in response to treatment with an endoplasmic reticulum stressor, thapsigargin (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Given that arsenite and thapsigargin typically activate the stress response via different eIF2α kinases, our data indicate that chronic phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 4c) renders aged neurons incapable of efficiently recovering from distinct types of acute stress.

To determine whether acute stress also affected downstream functions of the integrated stress response, we performed RNA-seq of iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons immediately after arsenite treatment and after 24 h recovery from arsenite. It was previously reported that various heat shock proteins were activated following stress treatment and recovery53, and we observed a similar increase in the transcript levels of HSP70 and HSP90 components following stress treatment in iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 9c), including HSPA1A, which is only transcribed in response to stress54. However, transdifferentiated neurons failed to activate transcription of HSP70 and HSP90 chaperones (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). Only HSPA6 and HSPA7 were strongly activated in transdifferentiated neurons, but upregulation of these genes was even more pronounced in iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9e). In addition, we found that expression of the STMN2 cryptic exon was activated in transdifferentiated neurons 24 h following arsenite treatment (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Together, our results demonstrate that aged neurons fail to properly respond to and recover from acute stress treatments, indicating a lack of resiliency that may underlie aging-related neuronal death.

Although transdifferentiated neurons are a powerful model to study aging, we sought to verify whether key phenotypes that we observed in cell culture are also present in aged human brains. To this end, we repeated several experiments—MS, immunofluorescence and eCLIP—in cohorts of aged brain tissue; we used the frontal cortex, which should mirror the cortical neurons we generated via transdifferentiation. Our cohorts consisted of three ‘mid-age' brains (30–50 years old) and three ‘old-age' brains (80–90 years old; Supplementary Table 6 and Fig. 6a). MS of lysed brain tissue revealed that there were several thousand proteins that were substantially upregulated and downregulated due to aging (Fig. 6b); the upregulated pathways primarily encompassed mitochondrial gene sets like oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic respiration (Supplementary Table 7). By contrast, RNA pathways were largely depleted due to aging (Supplementary Table 7), and RBPs were expressed at significantly lower levels than all other proteins in our old-age cohort relative to the mid-age cohort (Fig. 6c). This directly recapitulates the phenotype that we observed in transdifferentiated neurons compared to their isogenic iPSC-derived control neurons (Fig. 1i,j).

Given the similar RBP depletion in both cultured neurons and tissue, we tested whether TDP-43 was also basally mislocalized in the aging human brain. Immunofluorescence staining of TDP-43 in human brain tissue indeed showed an age-dependent increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 foci (Fig. 6d–e and Extended Data Fig. 10a), which is a finding that we observed in transdifferentiated neurons and in the aging mouse brain (Fig. 2).

Finally, we tested whether the aged human brain also displayed key phenotypes of molecular stress—elevated levels of phospho-eIF2α and increased 3′ UTR binding by G3BP1. As noted above, eIF2α phosphorylation initiates the formation of stress granules, and we found that the old-age brain cohort expressed significantly higher levels of phospho-eIF2α relative to the mid-age brain cohort (Fig. 6f and Extended Data Fig. 10b). In addition, G3BP1 eCLIP of the mid- and old-age brain cohorts displayed the predominantly 3′ UTR binding found in stressed conditions (Fig. 6g). Many 3′ UTR binding sites were shared between the brain samples and our cultured neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10c), which included known G3BP1 binding targets in neurons like MAPT55 (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Together, our data demonstrates that our findings in transdifferentiated neurons are largely recapitulated in the aging human frontal cortex.

Aging is one of the primary risk factors for neurodegeneration, and our study demonstrates that aging alone mechanistically and functionally destabilizes RNA metabolism in neurons. Our conclusions are drawn from several lines of orthogonal evidence in transdifferentiated neurons compared to isogenic iPSC-derived neurons (Figs. 1–5) with further validation in a mouse model (Fig. 2i–l) and in the human brain (Fig. 6). We demonstrate that transdifferentiation successfully generates aged neurons that express key neuronal markers and can fire both spontaneous and induced action potentials (Extended Data Fig. 1). Despite being a two-dimensional cell culture model that does retain expression of some fibroblast markers like COL1A1 (Extended Data Fig. 2a), the results from transdifferentiated neurons are largely recapitulated in the aged mouse cortex and aged human frontal cortex.

However, we do note a few differences, which are as follows: (1) human brain tissue has a lower, albeit still significant, degree of RBP depletion due to aging; (2) both human and mouse brains retain substantial levels of nuclear TDP-43 in their neurons and (3) the G3BP1 eCLIP binding in the human brains does not change as a function of aging. There are several explanations for these incongruencies. First, our cell culture model is a comparison between fetal neurons and aged neurons; fetal neurons are very different from even the youngest mouse and human brains we assay. Second, we are encumbered by the limitations of working with tissue, including the time between death and dissection, which may lead to degradation of unstable RNAs and cellular structures56. Third, the auxiliary glia cells of the brain may help clear protein aggregates in unhealthy neurons of a human or mouse, but this does not occur in our monoculture neurons57. Still, all our results clearly demonstrate that the RNA biology of an aged neuron is indeed ailing.

The proteomes of transdifferentiated neurons and human brains demonstrate that thousands of canonical RBPs are depleted in aged neurons, especially those involved in splicing and RNA transport. Intriguingly, the mRNA transcripts encoding RBPs are not depleted, indicating that the RBPs are perhaps being degraded more rapidly in aged neurons. This increased turnover could be due to a failure to localize to the proper region of the neuron. Indeed, dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport was previously reported in transdifferentiated neurons58, and we likewise find that the depleted splicing proteins, including the ALS- and dementia-associated RBP TDP-43, are mislocalized to the cytoplasm of aged neurons.

Mislocalization of TDP-43 is thought to be an initiating step in the pathogenesis of ALS, yet the cause of TDP-43 nuclear depletion to this point was unclear11; our results indicate that aging is sufficient to cause TDP-43 mislocalization, which may act as the first insult driving neurons toward neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, TDP-43 mislocalization in aged neurons decreases binding to neurodegeneration-linked cryptic exon sites. The next step of TDP-43-mediated pathogenesis is thought to be aggregation into fibrils, which is usually antagonized by stress granules39. Our recent report suggests that splicing proteins like SNRNP200 are recruited to stress granules in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells59; however, in aged neurons, splicing proteins including TDP-43 form complexes that are distinct from stress granules.

The chronic stress granules that form in aged neurons are compositionally distinct from canonical stress granules. Key RBPs are depleted from chronic stress granules, including RNA transport and splicing proteins, as mentioned above. Moreover, the physical properties of chronic stress granules appear to be gel-like, given their small area and oblong shape, which may explain why there is physical demixing between phase-separated stress granules and TDP-43 (refs. 60,61). The gel-like properties of chronic stress granules may arise from a prolonged inability to dissolve and may hinder recruitment of other RBPs even during new stress events. Together, we propose a model in which chronic, aging-related stress leads to TDP-43 exclusion from stress granules, which functionally destabilizes TDP-43-mediated splicing in aged neurons (Fig. 7).

Chronic activation of the stress response in aged neurons leads to physical demixing between stress granules and other RBPs, which functionally impacts splicing in aged neurons and decreases resiliency to acute stress.

The failure to respond to acute stress may further exacerbate the aging-mediated dysregulation of RNA biology we described. Given that we detected depletion of HSP90α from stress granules, the lack of HSP90α activation in response to acute stress treatment likely increases the relative burden of unfolded protein stress on aged neurons. In fact, the depletion of HSP90α from stress granules in aged neurons may result from one—or many—stress events that occurred before culturing of the primary fibroblasts. It is possible that resiliency to such stress events could be increased by exogenously rescuing chaperone activity in aging neurons. Therefore, reversing chronic stress may be a viable therapeutic avenue to prevent neurodegeneration and should be a focus of future efforts to promote the healthy aging of neurons.

Lenti-X 293T (Takara Bio, 632180) cells were cultured in DMEM (high glucose; Life, 11965118) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Life, 26140079) and passaged with 1:10 split ratios at 90% confluency using TrypLE Express (Life, 12604013). Within 24 h of a fresh passage, Lenti-X 293Ts were cotransfected with psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260), pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) and pLVX-UbC-rtTA-Ngn2:2A:Ascl1 (UNA; Addgene, 127289) or pLVX-UbC-rtTA-Ngn2:2A:EGFP (rtTA-Ngn2; Addgene, 127288) at a 1:1:2 mass ratio using the JetPEI transfection system (VWR, 89129-916). The supernatant fraction of transfected Lenti-X 293T cells was collected 48 h, 72 h and 96 h post-transfection and pooled at 4 °C. Lenti-X concentrator (Takara Bio, 631232) was added to the collected virus, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,00g for 45 min at 4 °C. The lentivirus-containing pellet was resuspended using 1× dPBS (Life, 13190250) in 1/100 of the original volume of the pooled supernatant fraction. Lentiviral titer was measured using Lenti Go-Stix (Takara Bio, 631280) and aliquoted at the desired titer for long-term storage at −80 °C.

Primary fibroblasts originating from antemortem patients (Supplementary Table 8) were cultured on uncoated plastic six-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FB012927) in TFM (DMEM, high glucose (Life, 11965118), 15% (vol/vol) FBS (Life, 26140079) and 1× MEM NEAA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11140050)) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with media changes every 2–3 days. Fibroblasts were passaged at 90–100% confluency with a 1:2 or 1:3 split ratio using TrypLE Express (Life, 12604013). Long-term fibroblast stocks were stored in 90% FBS with 10% (vol/vol) DMSO (Sigma, D2650-100ML) in liquid nitrogen. To generate transdifferentiation-competent fibroblasts, 80% confluent cells were transduced in 500 μl TFM with lentivirus containing the UNA expression vector in 5 μg ml−1 polybrene (Sigma, TR-1003-G). Following incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 8 h, the transduction volume was increased to 2 ml, and the fibroblasts were incubated with virus for an additional 40 h. To select for fibroblasts containing the UNA vector, the fibroblasts were treated with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1113803) for at least 2 weeks. Cultures with greater than 50% death rates after puromycin treatment were discarded.

Transdifferentiation plates were prepared by coating plastic six-well or 15-cm plates with 10 μg ml−1 poly-d-lysine (PDL; Sigma, P6407-5MG) and 0.0001% (wt/vol) poly-l-ornithine (PLO; Sigma, P4957-50ML) for 24 h, followed by a 24 h incubation with 10 μg ml−1 laminin (Sigma, L2020-1MG). UNA fibroblasts were expanded to the desired cell number; in general, approximately threefold more surface area of fibroblasts was cultured for the desired plating surface of transdifferentiated neurons. For example, three UNA 15-cm plates (Genesee Scientific, 25-203; 435 cm2 total surface area) would seed one transdifferentiation 15-cm plate. Large fibroblast cultures (>10 million cells) were cultured in Corning CellBIND Surface HYPERFlask cell culture vessels (Sigma, CLS10034-24EA) following the manufacturer's protocol. After the UNA fibroblasts were cultured to the desired cell number, fibroblasts were passaged to PDL-/PLO-/laminin-coated plates at 300% confluency for transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiating neurons were cultured for 3 weeks in NK (0.5× DMEM/F12, GlutaMAX supplement (Life, 10565042), 0.5× Neurobasal (Life, 21103049), 1× B-27 supplement (Life, 17504044), 1× N-2 supplement (Life, 17502048), 20 μg ml−1 laminin, 400 μg ml−1 dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP; SelleckChem, S7858), 2 μg l−1 doxycycline (Sigma, D9881-10G), 5 μM dorsomorphin homolog 1 (ref. 63; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 412610), 0.5 μM LDN-193189 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50176042), 0.5 μM A83-01 (Stem Cell Technologies, 72022), 5 μM forskolin (Stem Cell Technologies, 72114), 3 μM CHIR-99021 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 442310), 10 μM SB-431542 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 161410) and 10 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122)) with media changes every 48 h. Cell morphology was checked every 48 h on a Zeiss Axio-Vert.A1 to ensure proper transdifferentiation progression. Mature transdifferentiated neurons were not fluorescently-sorted to ensure that there were enough cells for experiments with high input requirements like eCLIP and affinity pulldowns. For culturing longer than 3 weeks, media changes were reduced to once every 4 days.

Primary fibroblasts were reprogrammed using the CytoTune iPS 2.0 Sendai Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A16517) at the titer recommended by the manufacturer. The fibroblasts were cultured in TFM for 1 week on an uncoated plate; afterward, the cells were passaged to plates coated with 1× Matrigel (Corning, 354277) and transitioned to ReproTeSR (Stem Cell Technologies, 05926) with media changes every 48 h. iPSC colonies were excised with a sterile needle and aspirated into a new plate for screening and validation. The iPSC cells were cultured on 1× Matrigel plates with mTeSR Plus (Stem Cell Technologies, 100-0276) media changes every 48 h; cells were passaged using Versene (Life, 15040066) dissociation reagent at a 1:5–10 split ratio. Long-term iPSC stocks were generated by resuspending the cells in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO.

iPSCs were seeded on a 1× Matrigel-coated 12-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FB012928) at ~50% confluency. The iPSCs were transduced with the rtTA-Ngn2 lentivirus in mTeSR Plus without polybrene. After 48 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the transduced iPSCs were treated with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin to select for iPSCs with doxycycline-inducible Ngn2 expression. The puromycin-resistant iPSCs were expanded to the desired cell number; in general, the iPSCs expanded fourfold once differentiation was initiated, so we seeded at ~25% confluency on 1× Matrigel-coated plates. Following seeding, the cells were cultured in mTeSR Plus with 2 μg ml−1 doxycycline for 72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were passaged to new 1× Matrigel-coated plates if needed and transitioned to NMM1 media (0.5× DMEM/F12, GlutaMAX supplement; 0.5× neurobasal; 1× B-27 supplement; 1× N-2 supplement; 2 μg ml−1 laminin; 0.5 mM db-cAMP; 20 ng μl−1 recombinant BDNF (Peprotech, 450-02-50UG); 20 ng μl−1 human GDNF (Peprotech, 450-10-50UG); 10 ng μl−1 human NT-3 (Peprotech, 450-03-50UG) and 10 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin) with half-media changes every 48 h. The cells were maintained in NMM1 for at least 3 weeks to ensure complete differentiation.

Cell cultures were tested for the presence of Mycoplasma every month using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, LT07-318) following the manufacturer's protocol. All new cell lines were quarantined and tested for Mycoplasma twice, at least 1 week apart, before being cultured with existing lines within the lab. The presence of Mycoplasma was also sporadically tested using DAPI staining and fluorescence microscopy (see below).

Both male and female C57BL6/J mice (Mus musculus) used in this study were housed in the vivarium at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center or the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine in specific pathogen-free conditions. All protocols were approved by the UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were killed at 1.5 months (young), 6 months (mid age) or 22–25 months (old) of age, and their brains were collected for immunohistochemistry and eCLIP (see below). Each experiment was performed with cohorts of two to four mice. The brains were excised from anesthetized mice, split laterally into the two hemispheres with each half going to our two experiments and immediately frozen at −80 °C (for eCLIP) or fixed (for immunohistochemistry). For fixation, mouse tissue was incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for at least 24 h. The tissues were embedded in a cryomold in OCT solution (Sakura Finetek, 4583). Cryostat-sectioned tissue (20 μm) was mounted on Superfrost+ Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22037246) and stored at −80 °C until used for immunohistochemistry (see below).

Control human brain tissue samples were obtained from the UCSD ALS repository, which is compliant with HIPAA informed consent procedures and approved by the institutional review board (CA, 120056). The brain tissue was dissected in an autopsy suite (usually with a short postmortem interval of less than 6 h) and either immediately frozen for biochemical studies or fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 2 weeks. Frontal cortex derived from three mid-age and three old-age patient samples (Supplementary Table 6) was used for this study. Human brain tissue is available via the Target ALS Multicenter Human Postmortem Tissue Core and can be requested at the following webpage: https://www.targetals.org/resource/human-postmortem-tissue-core/.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted and stored at −20 °C for genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was purified from the cells using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504) following the manufacturer's protocol. Three micrograms of genomic DNA were used with the Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 Kit (Illumina, 20087706) at the UCSD IGM Genomics Center. Epic methylation data were submitted to the DNA Methylation Age Calculator maintained by the Clock Foundation (https://dnamage.clockfoundation.org/), which allowed us to approximate the age of cultured neurons17. We used the ‘Skin and Blood Aging Clock' result from the Calculator output. Excel was used to plot the bisulfite aging data versus the actual age of the donor.

Mature transdifferentiated neurons were seeded onto PDL-/PLO-/laminin-coated Cytoview MEA 48 plate (Axion Biosystems, M768-tMEA-48B). Approximately 1.5 × 105 neurons were seeded in a 50 μl droplet to concentrate the neurons on top of the electrode arrays. After a 2 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to allow the cells to adhere, 150 µl additional media was added to each well. Cells were cultured for at least 48 h before MEA recordings.

MEA recordings were taken by a Maestro Classic MEA system (Axion Biosystems) using Axion Integrated Studio Acquisition software (v.2.1.5). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C with the addition of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) to support CO2 buffering during recording. Neuronal activity was acquired at a sampling frequency of 12.5 kHz, using a Butterworth band-pass filter (200–3,000 Hz) and adaptive spike detector set at 5.5 s.d. from mean background noise. An electrode was defined as active with a mean firing rate greater than 0.017 Hz. Data acquisition for each condition consisted of a minimum of three 5-min recording sessions over the course of 30 min. Thresholded spike data (.spk files) were analyzed using Axion NeuralMetricTool software (v.2.1.5), evaluating weighted mean firing rate per well.

To measure induced action potentials, baseline neuronal activity was recorded for 30 min before the addition of 50 μM bicuculline (Tocris, 2503). Drug-induced neuronal activity was recorded following a 5-min equilibration period in the MEA system. Media was then refreshed, and neuronal activity was immediately recorded to assess recovery to induced activity (see ‘washout' in Extended Data Fig. 1). GraphPad Prism 10 was used to plot the MEA data, and Prism also calculated statistical significance using Welch's t test.

Ibidi μ-slide 18-well chambers (Ibidi, 81811) were coated as described above with PDL/PLO/laminin or 1× Matrigel for transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons, respectively. Cells were transferred to the Ibidi μ-slides at least 24 h before immunofluorescence. Stress, recovery and inhibition treatments were applied at least 24 h after passaging to the Ibidi μ-slides—sodium arsenite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15654770) for 1 h at 0.5 mM; thapsigargin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, T7458) for 1 h at 1 μM; ganetespib (SelleckChem, S1159) for 24 h at 50 nM. To fix the cells, paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50980492) was added to the cell media to a final concentration of 4% (vol/vol), which was then incubated at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 45 min. The samples were washed three times for 5 min each with 1× dPBS. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 1× dPBS with 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma, X100-500ML) and 5% (vol/vol) donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 017-000-121) for 45 min at 25 °C. The permeabilized samples were washed three times for 1 min each with 1× dPBS with 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (dPBST). Primary antibodies were added to antibody solution (1× dPBST with 0.1% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10773877) at the concentrations listed in Supplementary Table 9 and incubated for 18 h with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The cells were then washed for 5 min three times with dPBST. Secondary antibodies were diluted in antibody solution (Supplementary Table 9) and incubated with the samples for 1 h with gentle rocking at 25 °C. Following this incubation, the cells were washed for 5 min three times with 1× dPBS, and Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36971) was used for long-term storage of the slides at 4 °C. The immunofluorescence samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM-880 microscope with 405, 488, 561 and 633 nm lasers using a ×63/1.4 oil immersion objective. Confocal imaging data were acquired as single slices, and line averaging was used to improve signal-to-noise ratio. For Airyscan imaging data, processing of all channels was performed in Zen software using super-resolution settings.

Immunofluorescence images were processed with ImageJ for visualization and quantification. To determine the nuclear fraction of proteins, a nuclear mask was created and used to calculate the nuclear and cytoplasmic intensity independently. The nuclear intensity was divided by the total intensity to derive the nuclear fraction. For the intensity of the entire cell, the nuclear masking step was skipped. To determine the number and shape of stress granules, difference of Gaussians filtering was used to remove background noise and to enhance G3BP1 foci before applying an intensity auto threshold. Using these thresholded images, G3BP1 foci were masked as regions of interest and were validated manually—false foci were removed, and any foci that were missed by the automatic detection were added. The BioVoxxel Toolbox Extended Particle Analyzer (https://imagej.net/plugins/biovoxxel-toolbox) was used to calculate circularity and roundness of G3BP1 foci. The number of stress granules per cell was calculated by dividing the number of stress granules by the number of nuclei in each image. Data were visualized using GraphPad Prism 10, Welch's t test was calculated in Excel and statistical outliers were discarded using Grubbs's outlier test.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (that is, human brain tissue) were deparaffinized using two 5 min incubations in CitriSolv (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 04-355-121) at 25 °C, then washed twice in 100% (vol/vol) ethanol for 5 min each before proceeding to rehydration. Paraformaldehyde-treated samples (that is, mouse brain tissue) were thawed at 25 °C for 30 min before rehydration.

All tissue samples were first rehydrated using decreasing serial washes (95%, 85% and 75%) of ethanol at 25 °C and then a final wash in dH2O before moving immediately to antigen retrieval. All samples were treated with an antigen retrieval step to increase the antibody signal in the fixed tissue. In brief, 1× citrate buffer (Abcam, ab93678) was heated in a conventional microwave for 90 s. The rehydrated/deparaffinized slides were incubated in the heated 1× citrate buffer and incubated at 98 °C in a preheated laboratory oven for 30 min. The slides were cooled to 25 °C for 20 min, washed twice in 1× dPBS and used immediately for antibody staining. The tissue samples were surrounded by a hydrophobic barrier drawn with barrier pen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NC9545623). To permeabilize the brain tissue, the samples were washed three times with SuperBlock (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 37515) for 5 min each and then incubated in SuperBlock for 45 min at 25 °C. After an additional three washes with SuperBlock, the samples were incubated in the primary antibody diluted in SuperBlock for 16 h at 4 °C; this step was repeated for the secondary antibody incubation, for which the sample was incubated at 25 °C for 6 h. The brains were then washed an additional three times with 1× dPBS, incubated with DAPI for 10 min, and mounted with Prolong Diamond. High magnification (×63) images were acquired on an LSM-880 microscope as described above. Tile scans were acquired on a Zeiss LSM-780 microscope at ×10 magnification. Map2+ neurons were manually identified and scored for cytoplasmic TDP-43 foci, and the results were plotted using GraphPad Prism 10. Statistics (Welch's t test) were also calculated in Prism.

The immunofluorescence protocol was followed through the secondary antibody staining step as described above. After washing the cells three times with 1× dPBS, the cells were fixed again with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde for an additional 10 min at 4 °C. Following fixation, the cells were washed with dPBST twice and incubated in FISH-W buffer (10% (vol/vol) formamide in 2× SSC) for 5 min at 25 °C. After the FISH-W treatment, the poly(A) probe was added to a final concentration of 125 nM in FISH-H buffer (2 mg ml−1 BSA + 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate in 2× SSC) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The cells were then washed twice with FISH-W buffer and twice more with 2× SSC at 37 °C for 5 min; all washes were performed in the humidified chamber. The slides were then mounted with Prolong Diamond and imaged and analyzed as described in the Immunofluorescence.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C or used immediately for western blotting. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl RIPA lysis and extraction buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89900) supplemented with 2× Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78440). The resuspended cells were incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 15 min, and they were further lysed by sonicating for 10 min (30 s/30 s off cycles). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 16,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was transferred to a new tube and combined with 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0007) supplemented with 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M3148-250ML). The samples were then heated to 70 °C for 10 min and loaded onto ten-well NuPAGE 4–12% Bis–Tris Mini Protein Gels (Life, NP0335BOX). Gels were electrophoresed in the Novex XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EI0001) at 150 V for 75 min. The samples were then transferred using the dry iBlot system for most proteins (iBlot 2 Transfer Stacks; Life, IB24002). Once the samples were transferred to the PVDF membrane, the membranes were blocked in 5% (wt/vol) milk powder (Apex Bioresearch, 20-241) in 1× TBST (1× TBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AAJ62662K7) and 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween-20 (Sigma, P9416)) for 30 min at 25 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted to the concentrations listed in Supplementary Table 10 in 5% (wt/vol) milk powder in 1× TBST and incubated overnight with the blocked membrane at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The membrane was then washed thoroughly three times with 1× TBST for 5 min each wash at 25 °C. Secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were diluted 1:2,000 in 5% (wt/vol) milk powder in 1× TBST and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at 25 °C with gentle rocking. After an additional three washes with 1× TBST, the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were developed with ECL western blotting substrate (Life, 32106) and imaged on an Azure 600 Western Blot Imager (Azure Biosystems). The western blot images were analyzed using ImageJ to determine the intensity of individual bands, which were normalized to the loading control. The relative expression was plotted using GraphPad Prism 10, and Welch's t test was used to calculate significance in Prism.

For phosphoproteins, a few modifications were made to the abovementioned protocol. First, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the LDS sample buffer. Second, a wet transfer in transfer buffer (1× NuPAGE transfer buffer (Life, NP0006) and 10% (vol/vol) methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A411-4)) was performed for 16 h at 40 V using the Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (Sigma, IPFL00010). Third, 5% (wt/vol) BSA in 1× TBST was used for blocking and for antibody incubations. Fourth, the Li-Cor IR dye-conjugated antibody was used for the secondary staining, and we imaged using the IR channels of the Azure 600 Western Blot Imager. For phospho-Westerns, normalization was performed to the total protein stain.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted for RNA-seq experiments. For long-term storage of samples before RNA-seq, the cells were stored in Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026) at −20 °C and precipitated following the manufacturer's protocol before RNA isolation and library preparation. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, 74104) following the manufacturer's protocol, and libraries were prepared using the stranded mRNA prep kit (Illumina, 20040532). The IDT for Illumina Indices (Illumina, 20027213) was used for sequence barcoding, and sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 2000 using the appropriate flow cell attachment. RNA-seq data were trimmed with cutadapt 3.4 and aligned using STAR aligner 2.7.6a to the human genome (Gencode, hg38)64. From the STAR aligner output BAM files, subread featureCounts was used to quantify the number of reads in each gene65. Differential transcript expression was calculated using Salmon66 from FASTQ files using its pseudoalignment strategy. Alternative splicing was analyzed using rMATS 4.2.0 (ref. 67). RNA-seq data were visualized using R for differential expression and IGV for read density.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted for whole-cell proteomics experiments. Cell pellets were resuspended in freshly made proteomics lysis buffer (8 M urea (Life, 15505-035), 75 mM NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9759), 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15568025), 1 mM NaF (Sigma, 201154-100G), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma, S6508-10G) and 1 mM β-glycerophosphate (Sigma, G9422-10G)). The suspension was sonicated for 400 s (10 s on/30 s off cycles) and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225) following the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 20 μg of protein was reduced with 10 mM TCEP (Sigma, 4706) for 30 min, alkylated with 15 mM freshly prepared iodoacetamide (IAA; Sigma, I6125-10G) for 45 min in the dark, and then treated with 10 mM DTT for 15 min in the dark. The samples were diluted to a final volume of 400 μl with 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) to achieve a urea concentration of less than 1 M and maintain a neutral pH. For digestion, 200 ng LysC endoprotease (NEB, P8109S) and 400 ng trypsin (NEB, P8101S) were added to the samples, which were then incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 16 h. The digestion was terminated by adding formic acid (Sigma, F0507-100ML) to achieve a final concentration of 1%.

To prepare human brain tissue for proteomics, 10 mg of brain tissue was dissected and added to freshly made tissue lysis buffer (8 M urea (Life, 15505-035), 50 mM NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9759), 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15568025), 4% SDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 24730020) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore, 539134-1SET)). After a 10-min incubation on ice, the tissue was heated at 95 °C for 10 min, sonicated for 400 s (10 s on/30 s off cycles) and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225) following the manufacturer's instructions. In total, 20 μg of protein was reduced with 10 mM TCEP (Sigma, 4706) for 30 min, alkylated with 15 mM freshly prepared IAA (Sigma, I6125) for 45 min in the dark and then treated with 10 mM DTT for 15 min in the dark. The protein was purified via methanol–chloroform precipitation and solubilized in 100 mM TEAB (Sigma, T7408). For digestion, 200 ng LysC endoprotease (NEB, P8109S) and 400 ng trypsin (NEB, P8101S) were added to the samples, which were then incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 16 h. The digestion was terminated by adding formic acid (Sigma, F0507) to a final concentration of 1%.

The digested peptides for all samples were desalted using the Stage-Tip method and then analyzed by a liquid chromatography (LC)–MS/MS setup. The setup included a timsTOF Pro 2 mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) coupled to a nanoElute 2 nano-LC system (Bruker Daltonics), using a CaptiveSpray ion source. The peptides were eluted through a reversed-phase C18 column (PepSep, 25 cm × 150 µm, 1.5 µm) maintained at 50 °C over a 50 min gradient of 5–35% solvent B (acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 500 nl min−1. The peptides were analyzed using data-independent acquisition (dia) parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) mode. The isolation windows for diaPASEF were determined based on data-dependent acquisition (dda)-PASEF data68. The settings for ddaPASEF included the following: a ramp time and an accumulation time of 75 ms each, one MS scan and ten PASEF MS2 ramps per acquisition cycle. The MS survey scan covered a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio range of 100–1,700 m/z and ion mobility (1/k0) range of 0.6–1.6 V s cm−2. Precursors with up to five charges were selected, with an active exclusion time of 0.4 min. The quadrupole isolation width was set at 2 m/z for m/z values below 700 and 3 m/z for m/z values above 800, with linear interpolation for m/z values of 700–800. For diaPASEF, the isolation windows were designed to encompass the precursor distribution across the m/z-1/k0 plane as defined by the ddaPASEF data, ranging from 323.6 to 1221.6 m/z and 0.7 to 1.34 V s cm−2 in 1/k0. Each 75 ms diaPASEF scan spanned a 40 Da mass width with a 1 Da mass overlap, and the number of windows varied to cover the entire ion mobility spectrum (creating 23 windows for ten diaPASEF scan cycles)69.

The diaPASEF raw files were processed using a library-free search approach in DIA-NN (v.1.8.1)70. An in silico digestion of a UniProt reviewed Homo sapiens database (December 2022) was used to predict the spectral library. The search parameters applied included the following: tryptic digestion with up to two missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as static modification, oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. The precursor false discovery rate threshold was set at 1%. The quantification strategy for precursors was set to robust LC (high precision), and cross-run normalization was set to retention time-dependent. Match between run enabled for the protein group matrix file generated by DIA-NN, filtered at 1% false discovery rate using global q values for protein groups and global and run-specific q values for precursors, was used for downstream and statistical analysis. The statistical analysis was performed using the limma package within the R framework71. Proteomics data were visualized using R and Excel.

At least 1 × 107 cells were used for eCLIP experiments; for transdifferentiated neurons, this usually required pooling three 15-cm plates into a single pellet, whereas other cell types required no more than one 15-cm plate. Live cells were washed with 1× dPBS before cross-linking. The cells were exposed to 4,000 μJ 254 nm UV light using a UVP CL-1000 Ultraviolet Cross-linker and pooled as needed for pelleting. Cross-linked pellets were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C until the rest of the experiment was performed.

eCLIP was performed essentially as described previously30,72. Immunoprecipitation-validated antibodies (Supplementary Table 11) were reacted with M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads (Life, 11204D). Cross-linked pellets were resuspended in 1 ml 1× eCLIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) IGEPAL-CA630 (Sigma, I8896); 0.1% (vol/vol) SDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 24730020), 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate (Sigma, D6750)) supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore, 539134-1SET). After a 5-min incubation at 4 °C, the cells were sonicated for 5 min (30 s on/30 s off cycles). Following sonication, 5 U RNase I (Life, AM2295) and 10 U DNase (Life, AM2239) were added to the lysed cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min at 1200 rpm. The RNase digestion was stopped by immediately cooling the samples to 4 °C and adding 440 U Murine RNase Inhibitor (NEB, M0314L). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifuging at 15,000g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was transferred to a new tube, and the Dynabead-conjugated antibodies were added to the cell lysate. The immunoprecipitation reaction was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rotation.

Following immunoprecipitation, 40 μl was removed from the whole reaction for the input sample, which was stored at 4 °C until gel loading. The Dynabeads were washed twice with eCLIP HSW buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% (vol/vol) IGEPAL-CA630, 0.1% (vol/vol) SDS and 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate) and three times with eCLIP NSW buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2% (vol/vol) Tween-20 and 5 mM NaCl) using a DynaMag-2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12321D) magnet. After washing, the dry beads were resuspended in 1× fast AP buffer supplemented with 3 U FastAP (Life, EF0652), 4 U DNase and 80 U Murine RNase Inhibitor. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min at 1,200 rpm. The samples were then diluted in 1× PNK7 buffer with 40 U T4 PNK (NEB, M0201L) and incubated at 37 °C for a further 20 min at 1,200 rpm. The beads were washed with HSW buffer twice and NSW buffer three times. The dry beads were resuspended in eCLIP 3′ RNA ligation buffer (1.2× RNA ligase buffer, 1.2 μM ATP, 3.6% (vol/vol) DMSO, 0.024% (vol/vol) Tween-20 and 50% (wt/vol) PEG 8000) supplemented with 72 U T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB, M0437M), 16 U Murine RNase Inhibitor and 4 μM 3′ IP RNA Adaptor sequence (/5Phos/rNrNrGrArUrArUrCrGrArArGrArUrCrGrGrArArGrArGrCrArCrArCrGrUrC/3SpC3/), and the ligation reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 75 min with rotation. Following ligation, the beads were washed with NSW buffer twice, HSW buffer thrice and NSW buffer thrice. Samples were prepared for loading by adding NSW buffer and removing 20% of the IP sample for loading onto a western blot for visualization. The remaining 80% of the IP sample was used for the remainder of the eCLIP protocol. IP and input samples were mixed with 4× NuPAGE LDS buffer and 100 mM DTT, heated to 70 °C for 10 min, magnetically separated and loaded onto 4–12% Bis–Tris gels. The samples were electrophoresed for 75 min at 150 V using the Novex XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System as described above for western blots. The RNA-containing gels were transferred using a wet transfer system to Amersham Protran Nitrocellulose Western blotting membranes (Sigma, GE10600008) for 16 h at 30 V. The regions corresponding to the molecular weight of the protein visualized on the control western blot (+75 kDa to account for RNA binding) were excised using clean razor blades and transferred to sterile tubes. RNA was released from the membrane by resuspending in eCLIP PKS buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA and 0.2% (vol/vol) SDS) supplemented with 16 U proteinase K (NEB, P8107S). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min at 1,200 rpm and then further incubated at 50 °C for 20 min at 1,200 rpm. The released RNA was further cleaned using the RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (Zymo, R1016) following the manufacturer's protocol.

The input RNA samples were treated with FastAP and T4 PNK as described for IP samples above, and the RNA was isolated using the RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit. The input sample was annealed to 1 μM 3′ Input RNA Adaptor sequence (/5Phos/rArGrArUrCrGrGrArArGrArGrCrArCrArCrGrUrC/3SpC3/) at 65 °C for 2 min, and it was then ligated using the eCLIP 3′ RNA ligase buffer conditions mentioned above. The ligated input RNA was further cleaned using MyONE Silane Beads (Life, 37002D) that were equilibrated with RLT buffer (Qiagen, 79216) supplemented with 0.025% Tween-20. The RNA sample was added to 3.0 volumes of 100% ethanol and reacted with the beads for 10 min with trituration. The beads were then magnetically separated, washed three times with 80% (vol/vol) ethanol, air-dried for 5 min and eluted with dH2O.

Input and IP RNA were then reverse transcribed to cDNA by annealing 3 μM reverse transcriptase primer mix (/5Phos/NNNNNNNNNNAGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGT/3SpC3/) at 65 °C for 2 min. The annealed RNA was added to 1× first-strand buffer with 5 mM DTT, 8 U Murine RNase Inhibitor and 120 U Superscript III Enzyme (Life, 18080044) and incubated at 55 °C for 20 min. The cDNA was incubated with 2.5 μl ExoSAP-IT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78201.1.1ML) for 15 min at 37 °C. EDTA (10 mM) was used to stop the cleanup reaction, and RNA was removed by incubating with 100 mM NaOH at 70 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 100 mM HCl. The cDNA was cleaned up using the MyONE Silane Beads as described above, but the samples were not eluted from the beads. Instead, the beads were resuspended in 0.5 μM 5′ cDNA Adaptor Sequence (CAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGA) and annealed at 70 °C for 2 min. The sample was then ligated for 16 h in eCLIP cDNA ligation buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween-20 and 7.77 (vol/vol) DMSO) with rotation. Ligated cDNAs were further incubated with fresh MyONE Silane Beads as described above. The eluted cDNA was quantified by qPCR and PCR-amplified for sequencing with Illumina adaptors. Sequencing data were analyzed using the Skipper pipeline that was previously described73, which maps sequencing peaks to the human genome (hg38) using the input sample as background. The Skipper pipeline calculated the enriched RNA-binding windows and HOMER binding motifs; enriched eCLIP binding windows were further analyzed and visualized using R or Excel.

Tissue eCLIP was performed essentially as described above except for a few changes, which are as follows: (1) mouse and human brain tissue was homogenized in 1× dPBS and plated onto 10-cm plates, (2) tissue was irradiated with two 4,000 μJ cross-linking cycles, (3) brain tissue in 1× dPBS was lysed by diluting with 5× eCLIP lysis buffer, (4) the mouse eCLIP reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) instead of the human genome and (5) cohorts of two to four mice and three human donors were used for each age group/cohort in Figs. 2 and 6, respectively.

At least 5 × 106 cells were pelleted for AP-MS. Cell pellets were resuspended in IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and 0.5% (vol/vol) IGEPAL-CA630) supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor cocktail. The cells were then sonicated for 5 min (30 s on/30 s off), and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was transferred to a new tube, and the protein content of each sample was estimated using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. Approximately 3 mg of protein was combined with Dynabead-conjugated antibodies (see above; Supplementary Table 11) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with IP lysis buffer and three times with IP wash buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl). Any residual liquid in the tube was removed, and the dried beads were submitted to the Sanford Burnham Prebys Proteomics Core for MS. The MS for each protein was averaged across sample replicates, and the log2(fold change) and −log10(P) were calculated for the proteins. Proteins corresponding to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms in various relevant pathways were highlighted in the relevant plots.

Magnetic TUBE beads (LifeSensors, UM402M) were prepared for the pulldown by combining 300 μl bead slurry per sample and washing three times with TUBE IP buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% IGEPAL-CA630) on a magnetic rack. The washed beads were resuspended in 300 μl TUBE IP buffer per sample. At least 5 × 106 cells were pelleted for the TUBE pulldown. Cells were resuspended in TUBE lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 50 mM freshly made N-ethylmaleimide, 50 mM NaF and 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate) supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor and rotated end-over-end for 15 min at 4 °C. After rotation, the cells were sonicated for 5 min (30 s on/30 s off), and the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content was estimated using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, and 3 mg of protein was combined with 300 μl of the washed magnetic TUBE beads from above. The lysate was incubated with the beads using end-over-end rotation for 18 h at 4 °C. Following this incubation, the beads were isolated using a magnetic rack and washed three times with TUBE IP buffer and then three times with IP wash buffer. The washed beads were resuspended in 100 μl (50 mM) Tris (pH 8). The peptides were reduced and digested using TCEP, IAA, DTT, trypsin and LysC as described above in the ‘Proteomics' section. The proteases were neutralized with 1% formic acid. MS was performed essentially as described above in the ‘Proteomics' section with one modification—the samples were searched using a diglycine remnant-containing peptide library provided by Eric Fischer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute).

For Ribo-seq, we simultaneously generated footprinting and bulk RNA-seq samples so that they were processed in the same manner. Samples were collected as previously described74. Briefly, cells were cultured in 15 cm plates. Cells were treated with 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide for 1 min at 37 °C followed by two washes with ice-cold 1× dPBS supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide. Ribo-seq lysis buffer (12.5 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 7.5 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide, 1 mM DTT, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and 20 U ml DNase) was added to the washed cells, which were then collected and centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C.

The cell lysate was treated with 250 U RNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2295) at 25 °C for 45 min. The RNase digestion was halted by adding 200 U SUPERase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2694) and transferring to 4 °C. Samples were loaded onto a sucrose gradient (34% sucrose, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide) and centrifuged for 1 h at 300,000g in a TLA-110 rotor (Beckman Coulter, 366735) at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the polysome pellet was resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's protocol by chloroform-based separation. Ten micrograms of total RNA was used for the extraction of 28–34-nucleotide mRNA fragments that were resolved with a 15% UREA-TBE gel for ribosomal footprints. Ribo-seq libraries were then processed as described74,75.

Corresponding samples were grown in parallel for RNA-seq in six-well plates and treated as described previously75. For RNA-seq, cells were collected with Tri-Reagent (Ambion, AM9738) for RNA extraction and used for polyA selection with Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Purification Kit (Invitrogen, 61012). Then, additional DNA degradation and 3′ mRNA resolution and phosphorylation were carried out by DNaseI and 3′ dephosphorylation using FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EF0651) and T4 PNK (NEB, M0201S), followed by 3′ adaptor ligation using T4 ligase (NEB, M0437M). The products were used for reverse transcription with SuperScript III (Invitrogen, 18080093) for first-strand cDNA synthesis. The cDNA products were 3′ ligated with a second adaptor using T4 ligase and amplification with 8–12 cycles of PCR for final library products of 200–300 bp.

Sequencing reads for Ribo-seq and corresponding RNA-seq samples were aligned as previously described76. In brief, linker (CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT) and poly(A) sequences were removed, and the remaining reads were aligned to rRNA. Unaligned reads were used for the alignment to the GRCh38 human sequence. Alignment was performed using Bowtie (v.1.1.229) with a maximum of two mismatches per read. Reads that were not aligned to the genome were aligned to sequences that spanned splice junctions. The aligned position on the genome was determined as the 5′ position of RNA-seq reads. For Ribo-seq reads, the ribosome P site was calculated using the 5′ end of the reads of the canonical ORFs with +12 for reads that were 28–29 bp and +13 for reads that were 30–33 bp.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes, and experiments were generally not anonymized or randomized during analysis. Outlier data points were only excluded if they tested as a significant outlier using Grubb's test. For simple statistical comparisons, a two-tailed Welch's t test (that is, a t test assuming a normal distribution but with unequal variances) was performed in most cases, and the degrees of freedom for significance scoring were approximated using Satterthwaite's correction. We did not confirm normal distributions for each data distribution, but all individual data points are plotted for every experiment. Certain data analysis pipelines (for example, clusterprofiler for KEGG term enrichment or RMATs for splicing analysis) have their own statistical calculations built into the software, and although we note which test was used, the original work will provide greater detail about the statistical power of their calculations. For imaging data and blots, we performed each experiment at least in triplicate; certain imaging experiments (for example, Map2/Tubβ3/G3BP1 staining) were performed over ten times, and we observed strong reproducibility across many different biological and technical replicates. The figures shown in the manuscript are a representative sample of each experiment (Figs. 1b,c,e,f, 2a,c,j, 3b,c, 4a–c,h, 5a,c and 6d).

Space exploration is entering a new era. NASA's Artemis programme, and related Artemis Accords (an international cooperation involving more than 50 nations), aims to take humans to the Moon as soon as 2026 and, eventually, to Mars. China plans to send its own crewed missions to the Moon by 2030 and to build a lunar base.

Missions involving public–private partnerships are also transforming the space sector1. For example, in 2024, Polaris Dawn, a private mission by space-technology firm SpaceX, saw US entrepreneur Jared Isaacman — who is nominated for the role of NASA administrator — and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis become the first civilians to perform a spacewalk. But there are many challenges ahead. Assuring astronauts' health is one.

Ethics in outer space: can we make interplanetary exploration just?

Ethics in outer space: can we make interplanetary exploration just?

Humans are building a future in space. But we are not built for space. Even the most fit and healthy person can find space disabling2.

Outside Earth's protective atmosphere, the human body is subjected to high levels of radiation. According to the European Space Agency, an astronaut travelling to Mars would receive the equivalent of one year's exposure to radiation on Earth for each day of their months-long journey. This would be likely to increase astronauts' risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, for instance3.

Moreover, the combination of radiation and time spent in microgravity can cause a range of health conditions. Weight-bearing bones lose, on average, around 1% of their mineral density per month during space flight4, increasing the risk of fractures. Fluid shifts in the eyes can increase pressure and affect vision5. There's even an increased risk of kidney-related illnesses6.

On top of the physical hurdles is the possibility that the isolation will affect astronauts' mood and productivity, taking a toll on their mental health.

As humanity sets its eyes on the Moon and Mars, these and other challenges must be addressed using innovative technology and research2,7,8. Such innovations should also benefit people on Earth. Here are four key strands of space medicine and health research that, in my view, are both crucial for mission success and likely to improve human health more broadly.

Telemedicine is integral to human space flight, allowing physicians to remotely monitor and support the mental and physical well-being of astronauts through telecommunications technologies7,8.

However, because deep-space missions focus on travelling huge distances, telecommunication delays can introduce potentially life-threatening waits — for instance, it can take 20 minutes each way for astronauts on Mars to receive medical advice from Earth. That's a long time if, say, someone has a heart attack and the crew needs support to treat them.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are being developed to help astronauts to get medical support quickly — similar to how AI-driven medical diagnosis and advice technologies can aid physicians and patients on Earth. This would help to make health care in space autonomous. But using AI in space brings operational challenges. Who will fix the system if it breaks, for instance, and how can a device be updated during a mission to keep pace with emerging medical knowledge and guidelines and the crew's changing needs.

Ensuring that adequate medications are available is another big challenge, especially for long missions. One study found that, on the International Space Station (ISS), each crew member studied had taken an average of four routine drugs a week9 — such as analgesics for pain relief and headaches, sleeping aids10 and decongestants. Essential medicines, including antibiotics and drugs to treat cardiac emergencies, are also stocked on board.

However, according to one estimate11, more than half of the medications on the ISS have a shelf life of less than three years, and some expire in less than two. That's too short for a crewed mission to Mars, which would last at least three years. Between 60% and 98% of the medications could expire before a Mars mission's end11. Resupplying drugs across such huge distances is unfeasible.

Is there life on Mars? What a cave on Earth can teach us

The US Food and Drug Administration has demonstrated that — on Earth — medications can be effective for years after their expiry dates12. However, taking drugs past their expiry date can be risky and their effectiveness can diminish. Their strength can decrease, their chemical composition might change and there's a risk of bacterial growth (see go.nature.com/4mkqbeb). Moreover, many pharmaceutical ingredients degrade under extreme conditions, such as radiation13.

Some evidence suggests that storing medicines at their optimal temperature and preventing exposure to light and heat can extend the period during which they are effective12. But with this research having been conducted on Earth, it's not clear whether the same applies to space.

Even recommended doses might change in space. One study exploring the use of sleep medications on the ISS and in space shuttles, for instance, noted that in 17–19% of cases in which an astronaut took a sleep drug, a second dose was taken on the same night10. Whether this was attributable to the small number of astronauts studied, a difference in the way the medicines degraded over time or something else remains unclear.

Researchers thus need to establish what the optimal dose and storage conditions of drugs are and ascertain medicines' rates of degradation in space — findings that could also help to improve medications on Earth. Similarly, medical technologies developed for space or using space know-how can be adapted for use on Earth. Cardiovascular surgeon Michael DeBakey's left ventricular assist device — a titanium pump used to keep blood flowing in people with heart conditions awaiting transplants — is one such space-technology spin-off. The design was honed in collaboration with NASA engineers using simulations of fluid flow similar to those moving through rocket engines.

Ensuring the crew's mental health is a concern for any space mission, from a stint on the ISS to a long-term trip to Mars, with crew confined to limited quarters, few companions and communication delays that restrict conversations with loved ones. Fatigue and disturbed sleep — brought about by stress, noise, being away from home and sleeping in an unusual environment — are common in space and could exacerbate mental-health problems. In any extreme environment, the whole crew might be affected, as illustrated by reports in March that a researcher stationed at a remote base in Antarctica threatened to kill colleagues.

Over decades of supporting astronauts, NASA and other space agencies have accumulated expertise around mental health in extreme environments involving isolation and confinement — knowledge that has proved invaluable to resolve crises on Earth. For example, the Chilean government reached out to NASA for guidance and support in 2010 during the efforts to rescue 33 Chilean miners trapped and isolated underground8.

Earth-based analogue missions — which simulate the challenges of being in space — can help researchers to anticipate the issues that might arise from isolation and confinement. Other lessons can be learnt once astronauts have established themselves on the lunar surface and in orbit around the Moon, offering further opportunities to prepare for going to Mars.

Research is needed to find ways to improve mental health in space. For example, the European Space Agency is testing initiatives such as a lighting system to maintain more-conventional circadian rhythms, exploring how daily circadian rhythms change during long space missions and using virtual-reality headsets to provide astronauts with mental relaxation.

Systems for producing food sustainably are needed for deep-space missions. Travel to Mars could take between seven and ten months, making it impractical to rely solely on food shipped from Earth.

Ends of the Earth: Journeys to the Polar Regions in Search of Life, the Cosmos, and Our Future Neil Shubin Dutton (2025)

On his first fossil-hunting expedition to the Arctic regions of Greenland in 1988, evolutionary biologist and science writer Neil Shubin felt utterly disoriented. It was daylight around the clock, with the sun sweeping a great ellipse across the sky. Life's rhythm was determined not by light, but by sound; glacially fed rivers roared at midday but, by 3 a.m., had faded to quiet trickles.

As the Arctic and Antarctica grow warmer, the fragile window available to us for understanding these icy outposts and the planetary processes they control is rapidly closing, writes Shubin in Ends of the Earth, an ambitious and far-reaching introduction to the polar regions. He explores polar science through the work of leading researchers and examines broader issues, such as how melting ice is beginning to expose microorganisms previously unknown to science.

Climate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice

Climate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice

He weaves his own story, and those of his collaborators, into a broader narrative that touches on geopolitical issues and the lives of pioneering explorers. The book is packed with information, such as the fact that the polar ice caps have existed for only about 10% of Earth's history. The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, and the species' migration out of Africa, occurred at a moment when Earth's physical geography — its coastlines, islands and ocean levels — was defined by “the amount of water locked in polar ice”, Shubin writes.

And that is the book's key insight. The polar regions drive global climate, environmental dynamics and even human evolution — and have done so for millions of years. This helps to explain why the poles are so crucial to policy debates about climate change. The permafrost holds 1,500 billion tonnes of carbon — about twice the amount in the atmosphere.

A second point highlighted by the author is the unique value of the polar regions for scientific discovery, owing to their extreme and unusual physical conditions. For example, Antarctica's dry, stable air and vast ice sheets make it one of the best places on Earth to collect interstellar dust, which settles and is preserved in the snow.

The layered structure of polar ice acts as a natural archive of Earth's climate history, allowing scientists to reconstruct past temperatures. And the polar regions host extraordinary forms of life. Ecosystems in Antarctic subglacial lakes — buried some 3 kilometres beneath the ice — might have evolved in complete isolation for millions of years, and some microbes in the pitch-dark conditions can metabolize minerals to survive. Research into these habitats can offer rare insights into life in extreme environments, Shubin writes.

However, by focusing so much on ice sheets, the author unintentionally reinforces the idea that the polar regions are defined by glacial ice. This might apply to Antarctica, a whole continent covered by ice, but is not true of the Arctic, whose landscapes include tundra and, by most reckonings, forests. Much of that region remained unglaciated even in the last ice age.

Shubin notes how a definition of the Arctic is elusive. It has been framed over the centuries by various markers, including the northern tree line, the Arctic Circle and political or cultural boundaries. Yet, in the book, the Arctic is widely portrayed mainly as Greenland and the heavily glaciated high Arctic archipelagos — regions that most resemble Antarctica.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Neuralink Rival Just Tested a Brain Implant in a Person","https://www.wired.com/story/paradromics-neuralink-rival-tested-brain-implant/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Brain-computer-interface startup Paradromics today announced that surgeons successfully inserted the company's brain implant into a patient and safely removed it after about 10 minutes.

It's a step toward longer trials of the device, dubbed Connexus. It's also the latest commercial development in a growing field of companies—including Elon Musk's Neuralink—aiming to connect people's brains directly to computers.

With the Connexus, Austin-based Paradromics is looking to restore speech and communication in people with spinal cord injury, stroke, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS. The device is designed to translate neural signals into synthesized speech, text, and cursor control. Paradromics, which was founded in 2015, has been testing its implant in sheep for the past few years. This is the first time it has used the device in a human patient.

The procedure took place on May 14 at the University of Michigan and was conducted in a person who was undergoing brain surgery to treat their epilepsy. The patient gave their consent for the Connexus device to be temporarily inserted into their temporal lobe, which processes auditory information and encodes memory. To implant the device, surgeons used an EpiPen-like instrument developed by Paradromics. Researchers were then able to verify that the device was able to record electrical signals from the patient's brain.

“There's a very unique opportunity when someone is undergoing a major neurosurgical procedure,” says Matt Angle, CEO of Paradromics. “They're going to have their skull opened up, and there's going to be a piece of brain that will be imminently removed. Under these conditions, the marginal risk of testing out a brain implant is actually very low.”

Paradromics' implant is smaller than the size of a dime and has 420 tiny protruding needles that are pushed into the brain tissue. These needles are electrodes that record from individual neurons. Similarly, Neuralink's implant also sits in the brain tissue. (By comparison, it has more than 1,000 electrodes distributed across 64 thin, flexible threads.) Other BCI companies are taking less invasive approaches. Precision Neuroscience, for instance, is testing an implant that rests on the surface of the brain, and Synchron has developed a device that goes in a blood vessel and rests against the brain. Both of these devices collect signals from groups of neurons, rather than individual ones.

“By having proximity to the individual neurons, you can get the highest-quality signal,” Angle says. Getting a high-resolution signal from the brain is important for accurately decoding a person's intended speech.

BCIs do not directly “read” a person's private thoughts. Instead, they work by interpreting the neural signals associated with movement intention. A BCI like the one Paradromics is developing would, for instance, decode the facial movements involved in talking. A person with paralysis who cannot move their mouth can still attempt to make that movement, which produces unique neural signals in the brain. Those signals are then decoded into speech.

In 2023, groups from Stanford University and UC San Francisco reported major advances in speech decoding using BCIs. In two women with paralysis, brain implants were able to decode intended speech at rates of 62 and 78 words per minute. For comparison, people speak at around 130 words per minute.

Paradromics is hoping to achieve similar results. The company plans to launch a clinical trial by the end of the year in patients with paralysis. Those participants would have the device implanted long-term.

“Bringing a new medical device to the market is really tough, and especially with a fully implantable brain device like they are designing,” says Justin Sanchez, a neurotechnology researcher at Battelle, an Ohio-based nonprofit focusing on tech. “When you're at that early stage in the regulatory process, you want to put it in a human brain, and you want to make sure that it receives the signals it should be receiving.”

For the past 20 years, an implant called the Utah array was the mainstay of BCI research. Resembling a miniature hairbrush with 100 spikelike electrodes, it has allowed people with paralysis to control robotic arms, move a computer cursor with their thoughts, and produce synthesized speech. But that device requires a pedestal on top of the head to connect to outside devices. It can also degrade over time and damage brain tissue. Paradromics, Neuralink, and others are all trying to improve upon that early array with longer-lasting materials, less obtrusive designs, and more electrodes to capture more data.

Matt Willsey, the University of Michigan neurosurgeon who led the procedure, says more electrodes could allow BCIs to have better performance and more functionality.

Eventually, Angle says, the company plans to study the feasibility of implanting up to four of its devices in the brain, which would mean even more recording ability. But first, it has to establish that one Connexus device is safe in a longer study. That comes next.

“This is really just a test of getting everything to the operating room, figuring out the procedure for the implant, making sure it stays operational and making sure they can remove it,” says Jennifer Collinger, a BCI researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. “It's a nice dress rehearsal.”

It's not totally clear what Laura Loomer, the 32-year-old conspiracy monger and right-wing media personality, means to President Donald Trump. She really, really doesn't like it when people call her an influencer or an adviser to the president, and, technically, she's not a lobbyist—although that's becoming increasingly complicated within Trumpworld. Loomer is also not officially employed by the White House or the federal government.

Whatever she is, Trump's advisers have officially grown tired of her. And they hope that Trump may soon too.

But on a sunny California day in May, Loomer had just cemented herself as the influencer in Trump 2.0, with the ultimate feather in her cap to prove it.

Just shy of a month after Loomer met with Trump in the Oval Office and successfully advocated for the firings of six National Security Council officials, Loomer had finally gotten what she really wanted: Mike Waltz was removed from his post as national security adviser. At the meeting, she had also urged Trump to fire the National Security Agency (NSA) director and head of the US Cyber Command, four-star General Timothy Haugh—which the president did, not long after the NSC purge. (Waltz, Hough, and the NSC officials did not reply to requests for comment.)

Loomer had already told the president that she thought the officials and Waltz were allegedly disloyal. In a phone call with WIRED, Loomer was adamant that Waltz's appearance in a 2016 ad about veterans opposing Trump was grounds for his departure. Both in private and in front of her more than 1.6 million followers on X, Loomer had been waging a holy war against Waltz for hiring, she alleged, “individuals who have a history of anti-Trump remarks and anti-Trump associations.” Though it took a few extra weeks after her meeting with Trump for it to finally happen, Loomer said she had successfully convinced the president—who considers her “terrific” and “very special,” in his own words—to cut loose one of the most important officials in geopolitics.

A number of Trump's advisers tell WIRED that while they have seen a certain utility in Loomer, even if they find her tiresome and off-putting, their mutually beneficial arrangements may be coming to an end. With her role in the Waltz departure and her recent critiques of the Qatari government's mega jet gift, senior Republicans who interact with Trump tell WIRED, she's flying awfully close to the sun. As much as these sources, who requested anonymity to avoid incurring Loomer's wrath, believe that Loomer is reaching the end of her rope as far as her influence with the president goes, they're still aware that she possesses enough power to potentially destroy their careers with a single tweet or blog post.

Until recently, Loomer had established a role as something of a digital directed-energy weapon. The White House would keep her at a distance, but also let her rip when it was convenient for certain factions within the West Wing. Internal discontent with Waltz, in this case, was one of those instances. “She overestimates and overstates her influence,” an administration source with knowledge of the Waltz discussions told WIRED at the time of the firing, “but that doesn't mean her takes aren't ever appreciated from time to time.” (The White House did not answer questions from WIRED about Loomer's role in personnel decisions. A source close to Trump tells WIRED that “Laura Loomer plays no role in the administration.”)

The Trump superfan and MAGA version of a gonzo content creator had gone from gadfly status to something approaching a real player in just under two years, but her ascent was particularly rapid upon Trump's return to office. Loomer, whether Trump's advisers liked it or not, couldn't be squelched. The MAGA embodiment of Arnold Schwarzenegger's “I'll be back,” Loomer had frustrated campaign advisers to such an extent that they tried, and mostly failed, to keep her at arm's length during both the 2024 GOP primary and general elections, and she wasn't officially hired by the campaign despite repeated requests. (When asked by WIRED what those roles were, Loomer said that the jobs were in opposition research, vetting personnel, and “assisting with Panama.”)

Loomer has emerged as one of the most important voices in Trump's ear, meeting him at his Mar-a-Lago club and speaking to him on the phone with some degree of frequency, after years spent on the fringes of the far-right conspiracy internet. Loomer rose to prominence by openly embracing anti-Muslim rhetoric and other extreme positions, like sharing a video on X about how 9/11 was “an inside job,” leading even the likes of GOP congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to urge Trump in mid-2023 not to hire her. Her influence has only grown since.

“Hold on, one sec. My phone is blowing up,” Loomer told WIRED minutes after the news about Waltz broke on May 1. The pings eventually subsided, and she cut to the chase about why claiming the firings as a “SCALP,” in her words, was so important. “It's not about who your friends are, whether something is morally right or morally wrong,” she said. “It has to be done. Hopefully the administration is serious about administering loyalty tests.” She's obsessed with these so-called loyalty checks: “They're not doing loyalty checks,” she tells WIRED. “You need to have loyalty to the commander in chief … You need to be loyal to President Trump.”

With an almost dystopian fervor for Trump loyalty as her guide, no target has been too small for the Trumpworld Terminator. She's gone after big fish like Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, but also takes broadsides at the spouses of lower-level nominees. In a May 4 post on her “Loomered” website titled “EXCLUSIVE: BLM-Linked Wife of Trump DOJ Nominee Raises Vetting Concerns,” Loomer attacked pro bono attorney Kristin McGough over alleged   “progressive signaling, including listing her pronouns in her official legal biography.” (McGough declined to comment.)

Her Loomerisms continue to physically make it into Trump's hands, as well. Natalie Harp, often referred to within Trumpworld as “the human printer” (derogatory), is one of Loomer's portals into Trump's decisionmaking. Harp, another of Trump's favorite young women in his inner circle, sits directly outside the door to the Oval Office. She earned her nickname during the 2024 campaign by delivering Trump a steady stream of printed articles, social media posts, and other digital-turned-paper materials praising him. Harp continues to do so in her role at the White House as an executive assistant to the president.

And Loomer's attacks on administration officials deemed insufficiently loyal continue to make their way into the stacks.

“Natalie is going to ship everything that's sent to her to the president, if she thinks it warrants his attention,” the administration source tells WIRED. “Which is most times.”

Trump's other staffers, sources tell WIRED, haven't figured out a way to stem the flow of dubious information from Harp to the president, or from Loomer to Harp.

“Natalie Harp is a trusted and valued member of President Trump's team,” Stephen Cheung, the White House communications director, tells WIRED. “And she is certainly a big reason why his operation has been as successful as it has ever been. Her work ethic and dedication to helping President Trump achieve his historic victory is second to none.” (Harp did not respond to a request for comment WIRED put to the White House.)

Still, despite Loomer's claims that she was almost hired by Trump on four separate occasions, an administration role remains elusive for her. Trumpworld sources are more skeptical than ever about Loomer making it onto the payroll. “You have to ask yourself: If Trump wanted her in, do you think his staff had some ability to prevent that, apparently?” says the administration source. “Like, what?”

“One of Laura's challenges and the reason she really can't have an administration job is she thinks everything is cut-and-dry,” they continued, “and that's just not how running the country works. If only it were all cut-and-dry.”

Their question now is what, if anything, Trump's inner circle could do to get rid of Loomer after this. And how much farther can Loomer push into this uncharted territory of the influencer as lobbyist—or vice versa—without winding up on the receiving end of Trump's own ire.

Inside the White House and among Trump's outside advisers, the weeks following Waltz's ouster would trend toward Loomer “jumping the shark,” as one of the sources put it.

Just over a week ago, when Qatar gifted Trump the jet poised to one day become the new Air Force One, an emboldened Loomer began shifting her fire from faceless federal employees to subjects suddenly a little too close to home: the Qataris who had been so generous to the president. Loomer candidly told Politico, “I'm hoping that it's not true,” when presented with details of the gift, and that she finds the reports of the jet deal, if true, to be “concerning.”

Her critiques of the jet gift earned cascading media coverage that continued to irk Trumpworld as it bled into the conservative media ecosystem. One Fox News subheadline summed up the dynamic. “As far as Team Trump goes: if you've lost Loomer, you've lost the plot.”

Two weeks later, that same source who gave Loomer partial credit for Waltz's ouster had a different assessment of Loomer's standing with the president. “Oh, I think she's on ice,” the Republican with direct knowledge of the situation tells WIRED. “With the president.”

After months of tolerating her antics, other Trump advisers began losing their patience. “Trump likes Laura, and she obviously has some influence, but she runs the risk of overestimating her influence and blowing herself up if she's not more careful,” a source close to the White House tells WIRED. “It's one thing to attack random government employees who Trump doesn't give a shit about, but when she's attacking him and his policies directly, that could end badly for her.""

In the early stages of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump's top advisers privately harbored concerns about Loomer's influence on their boss. Back then, the issues seemed relatively quaint. Campaign officials once discussed how to convey the need for Loomer to dial back her amplification of attacks on the then chair of the Florida Republican Party and his wife, or how to handle the optics of her flying on Trump's personal plane around the anniversary ceremony at the 9/11 memorial when she had previously reposted about the attack being “an inside job.”

Now, the stakes are far higher.

“I think she jumped the shark by going out and taking credit for stabbing the national security adviser and a number of people, as if it happened in a vacuum, as if there weren't deep considerations and conversations about all of this,” the administration official adds. “Because this is serious shit here. It's all fun and games to fuck around online when you're not responsible for anything. And I'm not defending Mike … But my point is, people like Laura don't have the burden of any actual responsibility, national security, or difficult decisions.”

Despite Loomer's proclamations of loyalty-at-all-costs, Trump's inner circle has become increasingly suspicious that Loomer is in it for herself. The alarm has grown even further amid a noticeable change in the issues she's begun to highlight on her MAGA version of a tabloid blog called Loomered. (Headlines range from “​​EXCLUSIVE: 100 Beagles Rescued From Labs This Week as Groups Urge Trump Administration to Retire NIH Lab Animals” to a much discussed story behind the scenes in Trumpworld that marked a notable pivot: “Chevron's Venezuela Exit Hands China a Strategic Victory and Threatens U.S. Energy Security.)

“Everybody sort of knows that now, or at least we internally,” the administration source said of increasing outside interest in Loomer as a hybrid pseudo-lobbyist-influencer. “And then the Qatari stuff, that's probably ideological, but she's fighting a battle she has no fucking idea about, and the mainstream media is picking it up.”

Nearly three weeks after Waltz's departure, Loomer—who did not comment any further on her role in it, nor on Republican critiques shown to her by WIRED before publication—was making a strategic retreat.

“I am sorry if my comments made anyone feel betrayed or were used by the media as ammunition to sow division during an important trip for the President,” she continued. I want to apologize to President Trump @realDonaldTrump more than anyone because I am a loyal person, I love President Trump, and I know I could have probably just had a private conversation about the plane instead.”

Loomer may have taken some damage when she fired at the highest levels of the US national security apparatus.

But the odds have always seemed to be in this Trumpworld Terminator's favor—she'll be back.

Samsung is closing in on an investment in AI search startup Perplexity that would also see the Korean tech giant incorporating the AI company's tech into its devices, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.

As one of the biggest investors in the AI company's new fundraising round, Samsung is discussing having Perplexity's app and assistant pre-installed on its phones and integrating its search features within the default browser, the report said. 

The companies are also discussing having Perplexity's AI tech power some of Samsung's own assistant Bixby's features, Bloomberg reported, adding that the partnership could be unveiled this year.

Samsung and Perplexity did not immediately return requests for comment.

Perplexity is in the process of raising a $500 million round at a $14 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported in May.

Samsung is not alone in looking to integrate Perplexity features. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple has thought about adding Perplexity as a search engine option to Safari, and in April, Motorola announced a partnership with Perplexity to power AI features.

Data-labeling startup Scale AI has hired the team behind Pesto AI, which helps companies recruit developers remotely, according to a blog post by one of Pesto's founders.

Founded in 2017 by Ayush Jaiswal and Indian food delivery platform Swiggy's co-founder Rahul Jaimini, Pesto AI is backed by the likes of Product Hunt's Ryan Hoover and Gumroad's Sahil Lavingia. According to Crunchbase, it has raised more than $8 million in funding.

Pesto will be shutting down its operations. According to its LinkedIn page, Pesto had 71 employees, but it's not clear how many of those are joining Scale AI.

“Earlier this year, I made the exciting decision to join Scale. This move marks the next chapter in a journey I've been deeply passionate about for years—exploring how we can harness the power of AI to create meaningful opportunities for people around the world,” Jaiswal, whose LinkedIn profile says he now is the head of growth at Scale, wrote in the blog post.

Previous reporting about Pesto suggests the startup was also involved in educating developers during its early years.

Scale AI did not immediately return requests for comment.

Generative AI comes in many forms. Increasingly, though, it's marketed the same way: with human names and personas that make it feel less like code and more like a co-worker. A growing number of startups are anthropomorphizing AI to build trust fast — and soften its threat to human jobs. It's dehumanizing, and it's accelerating.

I get why this framing took off. In today's upside-down economy, where every hire feels like a risk, enterprise startups — many emerging from the famed accelerator Y Combinator — are pitching AI not as software but as staff. They're selling replacements. AI assistants. AI coders. AI employees. The language is deliberately designed to appeal to overwhelmed hiring managers.

Some don't even bother with subtlety. Atlog, for instance, recently introduced an “AI employee for furniture stores” that handles everything from payments to marketing. One good manager, it gloats, can now run 20 stores at once. The implication: You don't need to hire more people — just let the system scale for you. (What happens to the 19 managers it replaces is left unsaid.)

Consumer-facing startups are leaning into similar tactics. Anthropic named its platform “Claude” because it's a warm, trustworthy-sounding companion for a faceless, disembodied neural net. It's a tactic straight out of the fintech playbook where apps like Dave, Albert, and Charlie masked their transactional motives with approachable names. When handling money, it feels better to trust a “friend.”

The same logic has crept into AI. Would you rather share sensitive data with a machine learning model or your bestie Claude, who remembers you, greets you warmly, and almost never threatens you? (To OpenAI's credit, it still tells you you're chatting with a “generative pre-trained transformer.”)

But we're reaching a tipping point. I'm genuinely excited about generative AI. Still, every new “AI employee” has begun to feel more dehumanizing. Every new “Devin” makes me wonder when the actual Devins of the world will push back on being abstracted into job-displacing bots.

Generative AI is no longer just a curiosity. Its reach is expanding, even if the impacts remain unclear. In mid-May, 1.9 million unemployed Americans were receiving continued jobless benefits — the highest since 2021. Many of those were laid-off tech workers. The signals are piling up.

Some of us still remember “2001: A Space Odyssey.” HAL, the onboard computer, begins as a calm, helpful assistant before turning completely homicidal and cutting off the crew's life support. It's science fiction, but it hit a nerve for a reason.

Last week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years, pushing unemployment as high as 20%. “Most [of these workers are] unaware that this is about to happen,” he told Axios. “It sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.”

You could argue that's not comparable to cutting off someone's oxygen, but the metaphor isn't that far off. Automating more people out of paychecks will have consequences, and when the layoffs increase, the branding of AI as a “colleague” is going to look less clever and more callous.

The shift toward generative AI is happening regardless of how it's packaged. But companies have a choice in how they describe these tools. IBM never called its mainframes “digital co-workers.” PCs weren't “software assistants”; they were workstations and productivity tools.

Language still matters. Tools should empower. But more and more companies are marketing something else entirely, and that feels like a mistake.

We don't need more AI “employees.” We need software that extends the potential of actual humans, making them more productive, creative, and competitive. So please stop talking about fake workers. Just show us the tools that help great managers run complex businesses, and that help individuals make more impact. That's all anyone is really asking for.

In my haste, I set forth to construct a dataset, a repository of those fleeting moments, these ephemeral sentences, which spoke of a bygone age. I procured a collection of these fleeting moments, these sentences, and with them, I synthetically conjured forth modern translations, an ingenious feat of substitution, which allowed my artificial construct to take on the guise of the language of the Irish Penny Journal.Then, with great anticipation, I fashioned a small encoder, a humble instrument, with which to guide the artificial construct in its endeavors. I presented this encoder as a bribe, a reward, to a most ingenious system, one that trained a colossal language model, one of unbridled potential, one that was capable of weaving tales with the very essence of the Irish Penny Journal.And lo! In the succeeding moments of time, I witnessed a most wondrous thing. My artificial construct, armed with this training, and guided by the whispers of the encoder, began to speak, to speak in the language of the Irish Penny Journal. The words it spoke were, indeed, the words of the past, imbued with the nostalgia of a forgotten era.And thus, my friends, I have witnessed a most singular creation, one which embodies the language of the past, yet, in its most recent iteration, speaks to the present. A testament to the ingenuity of the human spirit, this artificial construct speaks of the bygone era, yet, with each word, it whispers to us, to us, of a future yet to come.——That's Penny explaining itself to you. This was trained using GRPO only, in less than a day using a single A6000. I didn't use any SFT, and only relied on a small encoder (MiniLM2) trained to classify texts from the Irish Penny Journal and their modern translations (synthetically produced).

It's fairly simple — I essentially just split the original text into chunks and then used some bigger models on openrouter to clean it up and provide translations to modern English (seemed to be pretty easy for an LLM).After that, I just trained a MiniLM2 model to classify the texts. I used this in a reward function for reinforcement learning and changed the system message as a simple instruction to write in the prose of the IPJ.I debated whether or not to use any SFT, and decided not to. I think if the style would be too hard to learn you might need some seed/cold start SFT data.I'll try to get my scripts up in github for you to look at. It's just a few short training scripts.

[0] many “LLM tells” fit this pattern of just being common features of professionally-published works that are less often seen in casual writing.

LLMs are raising the bar by expanding the vocabulary people are exposed to, so words like delve will stick out. I think it's preferred by writers because it articulates a nice sounding alternative to words like explore, venture, analyze, think about, confront, etc. It's a useful, versatile word, and one of the metrics by which writers measure quality is the minimization of syllables.LLMs are mostly indistinguishable from humans at this point; a one-shot output from any of the major models can be recognized in the same way you might recognize a writer. With multiple style passes, you're not going to be able to tell the difference between ChatGPT, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Hunter S. Thompson, Einstein, or any other sufficiently modeled figure. Throw in a few tens of thousands of words written by yourself and most of the models will do a nearly flawless job of copying your stylometric profile.

I think we're well beyond the point where the majority of people cannot tell what is actually produced by an LLM and we're convincing ourselves we still have a handle on the situation. A lot of these rules are completely arbitrary and vary from person to person.

It's used a ton by LLMs for some reason despite being rarely used by real people.  I think it's mostly a byproduct of LLMs having their training data being over represented by certain published works instead of casual communications.There does seem to be something else going on with delve specifically though, one of the other comments mentions that delve isn't used in the specific training data for this, so it's odd to see it being used in the output. I wonder if it's because delve has secondary definitions of ""to make a careful or detailed search for information"" and ""to examine a subject in detail"" which is causing the LLM to use it to seem like it's answers are more thorough.

Tens of millions of dollars in NSF grants have been slashed, and scientists fear the US is about to lose a generation of climate researchers.

The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change amid a widening campaign to slash federal funding for scientists and institutions studying the rising risks of a warming world.

The move will cut off what's likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works. 

Affected projects include efforts to develop cleaner fuels, measure methane emissions, improve understanding of how heat waves and sea-level rise disproportionately harm marginalized groups, and help communities transition to sustainable energy, according to an MIT Technology Review review of a GrantWatch database—a volunteer-led effort to track federal cuts to research—and a list of terminated grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) itself. 

The NSF is one of the largest sources of US funding for university research, so the cancellations will deliver a big blow to climate science and clean-energy development.

They come on top of the White House's broader efforts to cut research funding and revenue for universities and significantly raise their taxes. The administration has also strived to slash staff and budgets at federal research agencies, halt efforts to assess the physical and financial risks of climate change, and shut down labs that have monitored and analyzed the levels of greenhouse gases in the air for decades.

Broader economic anxieties and uncertainty over clean-energy subsidies are compounding industry fears.

“I don't think it takes a lot of imagination to understand where this is going,” says Daniel Schrag, co-director of the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University, which has seen greater funding cuts than any other university amid an escalating legal conflict with the administration. “I believe the Trump administration intends to zero out funding for climate science altogether.”

The NSF says it's terminating grants that aren't aligned with the agency's program goals, “including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), environmental justice, and misinformation/disinformation.”

Trump administration officials have argued that DEI considerations have contaminated US science, favoring certain groups over others and undermining the public's trust in researchers.

“Political biases have displaced the vital search for truth,” Michael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said to a group of NSF administrations and others last month, according to reporting in Science.

But research projects that got caught in the administration's anti-DEI filter aren't the only casualties of the cuts. The NSF has also canceled funding for work that has little obvious connections to DEI ambitions, such as research on catalysts. 

Many believe the administration's broader motivation is to  undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics. 

Trump and his officials have repeatedly argued, in public statements and executive orders, that climate fears are overblown and that burdensome environmental regulations have undermined the nation's energy security and economic growth.

“It certainly seems like a deliberate attempt to undo any science that contradicts the administration,” says Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

On May 28, a group of states including California, New York, and Illinois sued the NSF, arguing that the cuts illegally violated diversity goals and funding priorities clearly established by Congress, which controls federal spending.

A group of universities also filed a lawsuit against the NSF over its earlier decision to reduce the indirect cost rate for research, which reimburses universities for overhead expenses associated with work carried out on campuses. The plaintiffs included the California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has also lost a number of research grants.(MIT Technology Review is owned by, but editorially independent from, MIT.)

The NSF declined to comment.

GrantWatch is an effort among researchers at rOpenSci, Harvard, and other organizations to track terminations of grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NSF. It draws on voluntary submissions from scientists involved as well as public government information. 

A search of its database for the terms “climate change,” “clean energy,” “climate adaptation,” “environmental justice,” and “climate justice” showed that the NSF has canceled funds for 118 projects, which were supposed to receive more than $100 million in total. Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million. (That word often indicates climate-change-related research, but in some abstracts it refers to the cultural climate.) 

Some share of those funds has already been issued to research groups. The NSF section of the database doesn't include that “outlaid” figure, but it's generally about half the amount of the original grants, according to Noam Ross, a computational researcher and executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit initiative that promotes open and reproducible science.

A search for “climate change” among the NIH projects produces another 22 studies that were terminated and were still owed nearly $50 million in grants. Many of those projects explored the mental or physical health effects of climate change and extreme weather events.

The NSF more recently released its own list of terminated projects, which mostly mirrored GrantWatch's findings and confirms the specific terminations mentioned in this story.

“These grant terminations are theft from the American people,” Ross said in an email response. “By illegally ending this research the Trump administration is wasting taxpayer dollars, gutting US leadership in science, and telling the world that the US government breaks its promises.”

Havard, the country's oldest university, has been particularly hard hit.

In April, the university sued the Trump administration over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies. The White House, in turn, has moved to eliminate all federal funds for the university, including hundreds of NSF and NIH grants. 

Daniel Nocera, a professor at Harvard who has done pioneering work on so-called artificial photosynthesis, a pathway for producing clean fuels from sunlight, said in an email that all of his grants were terminated. 

“I have no research funds,” he added.

Another terminated grant involved a collaboration between Harvard and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric  Research (NCAR), designed to update the atmospheric chemistry component of the Community Earth System Model, an open-source climate model widely used by scientists around the world.

The research was expected to “contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry in the climate system and to improve air quality predictions within the context of climate change,” according to the NSF abstract. 

“We completed most of the work and were able to bring it to a stopping point,” Daniel Jacob, a professor at Harvard listed as the principal investigator on the project, said in an email. “But it will affect the ability to study chemistry-climate interactions. And it is clearly not right to pull funding from an existing project.”

Plenty of the affected research projects do, in one way or another, grapple with issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But that's because there is ample evidence that disadvantaged communities experience higher rates of illness from energy-sector pollution, will be harder hit by the escalating effects of extreme weather and are underrepresented in scientific fields.

One of the largest terminations cut off about $4 million dollars of remaining funds for the CLIMATE Justice Initiative, a fellowship program at the University of California, Irvine designed to recruit, train and mentor a more diverse array of researchers in Earth sciences.  

The NSF decision occurred halfway into the 5-year program, halting funds for a number of fellows who were in the midst of environmental justice research efforts with community partners in Southern California. Kathleen Johnson, a professor at UC Irvine and director of the initiative, says the university is striving to find ways to fund as many participants as possible for the remainder of their fellowships.

“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says. “The people who will be best positioned to do this work …  are the people who understand the community's needs and are able to therefore work to implement equitable solutions.”

“Diverse teams have been shown to do better science,” Johnson adds.

Numerous researchers whose grants were terminated didn't respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review or declined to comment, amid growing concerns that the Trump administration will punish scientists or institutions that criticize their policies.

The termination of existing NSF and NIH grants is just the start of the administration's plans to cut federal funding for climate and clean-energy research. 

The White House's budget proposal for the coming fiscal year seeks to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in funding across federal agencies, specifically calling out “Green New Scam funds” at the Department of Energy; “low-priority climate monitoring satellites” at NASA; “climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs” at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and “climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences” at the NSF.The administration released a more detailed NSF budget proposal on May 30th, which called for a 60% reduction in research spending and nearly zeroed out the clean energy technology program. It also proposed cutting funds by 97% for the US Global Change Research Program, which produces regular assessments of climate risks; 80% for the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a global network of ocean sensors that monitor shifting marine conditions; and 40% for NCAR, the atmospheric research center.

If Congress approves budget reductions anywhere near the levels the administration has put forward, scientists fear, it could eliminate the resources necessary to carry on long-running climate observation of oceans, forests, and the atmosphere. 

The administration also reportedly plans to end the leases on dozens of NOAA facilities, including the Global Monitoring Laboratory in Hilo, Hawaii. The lab supports the work of the nearby Mauna Loa Observatory, which has tracked atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for decades.

Even short gaps in these time-series studies, which scientists around the world rely upon, would have an enduring impact on researchers' ability to analyze and understand weather and climate trends.

“We won't know where we're going if we stop measuring what's happening,” says Jane Long, formerly the associate director of energy and environment at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. “It's devastating—there's no two ways around it.” 

Growing fears that public research funding will take an even larger hit in the coming fiscal year are forcing scientists to rethink their research plans—or to reconsider whether they want to stay in the field at all, numerous observers said.

“The amount of funding we're talking about isn't something a university can fill indefinitely, and it's not something that private philanthropy can fill for very long,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “So what we're talking about is potentially cataclysmic for climate science.”

“Basically it's a shit show,” he adds, “and how bad a shit show it is will depend a lot on what happens in the courts and Congress over the next few months.”

One climate scientist, who declined to speak on the record out of concern that the administration might punish his institution, said the declining funding is forcing researchers to shrink their scientific ambitions down to a question of “What can I do with my laptop and existing data sets?”

“If your goal was to make the United States a second-class or third-class country when it comes to science and education, you would be doing exactly what the administration is doing,” the scientist said. “People are pretty depressed, upset, and afraid.”

Given the rising challenges, Harvard's Schrag fears that the best young climate scientists will decide to shift their careers outside of the US, or move into high tech or other fields where they can make significantly more money.

“We might lose a generation of talent—and that's not going to get fixed four years from now,” he says. “The irony is that Trump is attacking the institutions and foundation of US science that literally made America great.”

I love a rugged device. Not because I have a use for one—I live in New York, and the “elements” are usually more psychologically harrowing than physical—but damn, sometimes I'm a sucker for a stunt, and knowing I'll have tunes when the apocalypse strikes ain't bad either. Anker is here to scratch that baser, stunt-loving, disaster-fearing itch in my brain with what it's calling an “industry-first” Bluetooth speaker that plays just fine while floating in all types of water.

The Soundcore Boom 3i outdoor speaker is the latest in Anker's Boom series of outdoor speakers and offers a few headlining perks. One, as I mentioned before, is that this thing can float. According to Anker, the Soundcore Boom 3i: “Stays upright and sound-forward, even in waves. No distortion, no sinking—just loud, clear audio for kayaking, pool parties, and every water adventure.” That's not really a technical feat necessarily; the weight is just distributed in such a way that the actual speakers stay pointed away from the watery depths. Still, it's a nice flourish if you plan on throwing this thing into a lake or a big pool, or if you're feeling a little wacky, the ocean.

Speaking of ocean water, the Boom 3i is also apparently a lot more durable on that front compared to competitors. Anker says, thanks in part to a coating on the outside of the speaker, the Boom 3i can withstand exposure to salt water much longer than competitors. Specifically, Anker says the Boom 3i will stay “corrosion-free” for up to two years, while “other” speakers may start to degrade in five months. Outside of its emphasis on floatability, the Boom 3i also has some solid drop resistance and can withstand drops onto concrete of up to 1 meter (3.28 feet), can be submerged 1.5 meters deep in water for up to 30 minutes, and has an IP68 dust resistance as well.

Outside of its durability, the Boom 3i also has 50W of sound, which equates to 98dB of volume and 16 hours of audio playback. That should be plenty of battery and loudness if you're using this thing at a lake party or somewhere out in the open for a party. Adding to its apocalypse-weathering vibes is also an emergency alarm for if you're ever in trouble that emits a noise that's “roughly as loud as a motorcycle” to signal you need help. Similarly, there's a voice amplifier that lets you broadcast a message out loud and a “Buzz Clean” feature that vibrates the speaker with sound to clean off sand and dust. Given all of that rugged, apocalypse-defying goodness, the Boom 3i won't come cheap, retailing at $189, but if you're looking for something that can save your ass when Waterworld hits, then it might be worth every penny.

The future of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is looking bright. Scientists have just reported the first in-human recording from a novel wireless BCI device that could possibly help people with stroke communicate independently again.

Researchers at the University of Michigan performed the feat on May 14, using the Connexus BCI device developed by the company Paradromics. The device was temporarily implanted into the brain of a person living with epilepsy. Paradromics is now planning to conduct clinical trials of the device later this year.

The U-M research team, led by neurosurgeon Matthew Willsey, is working on a project to better understand how epilepsy affects the brain's signaling. They partnered with Paradromics, one of several companies vying to pioneer the next generation of BCI technology (a list that also includes Elon Musk's Neuralink), to use its experimental Connexus device.

Chinese Brain Implant Project Set to Overtake Musk's Neuralink

According to Willsey, the device offers several advantages over existing BCI systems. For instance, it's tiny (no smaller than a dime) yet contains over 400 microelectrodes that act as sensors, allowing the researchers to capture plenty of information from the brain. For context, the team has previously worked with BCI devices only outfitted with around 100 sensors.

The Connexus is designed to send this information to a transceiver implanted in the chest, but unlike most existing BCI implants, it would also allow users to operate compatible computer devices without physical attachments. This also means that the device should be fully implantable, ideally providing its users more freedom.

“I'm excited that the system itself has the potential to be a high-capacity recording system that could one day expand the functionality of present-day BCIs,” Willsey told Gizmodo. “Furthermore, the system implanted in the body communicates wirelessly with the system outside the body so that there are no wires that run through the skin.”

The team implanted the Connexus in a volunteer already set to receive a temporal lobectomy, a surgery that removes parts of the brain causing chronic seizures. It was then safely removed fully intact less than 20 minutes later, though not before it had recorded signals from the patient's brain. The researchers are still analyzing this data, but they're certainly optimistic about the device's future.

“This could lead to its eventual use as a high-performance BCI and could also lead to downstream clinical trials,” Willsey said.

Paradromics announced in March that the first of these trials is expected to occur in late 2025, provided they receive the go-ahead from regulators. The company plans to initially test whether the Connexus can restore communication through digital devices in people with speech impairment caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, or severe spinal cord injuries. They're hoping that the device can have applications for mental health or chronic pain as well.

The U-M team is also working with other BCI devices that look to go beyond the limitations of current technology. In January, for instance, they published research showing how their high-performance BCI device allowed a paralyzed man to fly a virtual drone with only his thoughts, and with much greater accuracy than other, non-invasive systems. With any luck, these devices, while still experimental, will someday provide many people a new lease on life.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The Milky Way Might Not Smash Into the Andromeda Galaxy After All, New Simulation Indicates","https://gizmodo.com/new-simulation-suggest-milky-way-andromeda-collision-is-less-likely-than-previously-assumed-2000608953","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 15:00:49 GMT","

For over a decade, researchers have suggested a high possibility of our Milky Way galaxy smashing into neighboring galaxy Andromeda around 5 billion years from now. The collision would merge the two galaxies into a single (very creatively named) “Milkomeda”—but new research now indicates that this is less likely than previously assumed.

Integrating new data from the Gaia and Hubble telescopes, an international team of researchers has simulated our galaxy's movement for the next 10 billion years. The computer model also makes use of new mass estimates for other galaxies within the Local Group—a galactic group that hosts the Milky Way and Andromeda, among others. Ultimately, the simulation indicates that there is only about a 50% probability that the two galaxies will collide in the next 10 billion years, bolstering similar results from previous studies.

“Here we consider the latest and most accurate observations by the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes, along with recent consensus mass estimates, to derive possible future scenarios and identify the main sources of uncertainty in the evolution of the Local Group over the next 10 billion years,” the researchers, including experts from the University of Helsinki and Durham University, wrote in the study. “We found that uncertainties in the present positions, motions and masses of all galaxies leave room for drastically different outcomes and a probability of close to 50% that there will be no Milky Way–Andromeda merger during the next 10 billion years.”

Just as planets exert gravitational forces on each other, galaxies also impact their galactic neighbors. Specifically, Andromeda, the Triangulum galaxy, and the Large Magellanic Cloud (a galaxy orbiting the Milky Way) influence the Milky Way's path. According to the researchers, previous analyses that calculated higher chances likely didn't factor in the gravitational pull of the Large Magellanic Cloud. “The orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud runs perpendicular to the Milky Way–Andromeda orbit and makes their merger less probable,” they explained.

Their simulation also accounted for uncertainties, another factor that could have lowered the probability. Still, the team highlights the fact that even with the newest information, there are still a number of unknowns that make it difficult to determine exactly how the Milky Way and Andromeda will move, although more data from the Gaia telescope could continue to refine their predictions.

While “Milkomeda” might never come to life, the researchers did find another highly likely collision almost certainly slated for sometime in the next two billion years: a Milky Way–Large Magellanic Cloud merger (I don't even want to know what they'd call the resulting galaxy).

Nevertheless, “the fate of our Galaxy is still completely open,” they concluded.

Don't be so excited for that new Nintendo Switch 2 landing on your doorstep June 5 that you tear into that big red box like a rabid kid on Christmas morning. Nintendo's new handheld has one caveat that you should look out for on launch, namely the screen protector. If you're used to taking the thin plastic film off your new devices' screens, Nintendo suggests you ignore your first impulse and leave that layer right where it is.

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Walmart

Nintendo published its instruction manual for the Switch 2 on Sunday. Those who merely scanned over the document may not have spotted a small note under the “Careful Usage” section about the display. “The screen is covered with a film layer designed to prevent fragments scattering in the event of damage. Do not peel it off,” reads the manual.

This layer likely won't prevent scratching or chipping. It simply keeps the screen from busting apart and scattering glass shards everywhere. This is likely similar to the same preinstalled plastic layer found on the Nintendo Switch OLED. It's attached with a kind of adhesive, so removing it with any haste can damage or mar the glass screen underneath. You may be able to remove it with ginger hands so you can install your own screen protector, but your better option is to apply a separate layer of screen protection on top of what's already there.

Nintendo sells its own Switch 2 carrying case and screen protector bundle, but if you want to save money on launch day, you can find other protectors from brands like Hori, NEXT, and PowerA. You can also look at companies like Dbrand which sells a 2-pack Prism 2.0 screen protector for $35 alongside the new Switch 2 Killswitch case. We won't have to wait long to find a laundry list of screen protectors on Amazon or elsewhere, so there will be no lack of choice. Considering how the Switch OLED tended to pick up blemishes, we suggest you treat your new handheld with care until you can find a protector.

The Switch 2's use of magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers has some concerned about wear and tear, especially from the exposed pins on the handheld's main unit once both controllers are removed. Nintendo says not to swing or dangle the console from each controller. The Mario maker also mentions you shouldn't “affix stickers to the part of the Joy-Con 2 where the SL/SR buttons are located.” The company also advises that small metal objects can stick to the magnetic areas of the console and that not removing them could result in damage over time as it weakens the magnetic connection.

Don't treat your Switch 2 as your new frisbee or dog toy, and you should be alright. We'll see how well the handheld lasts over time after release. Despite the legacy of Joy-Con stick drift on the original Switch, the Switch 2 still won't use drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks. Instead, Nintendo is likely relying on a cover surrounding each stick to keep out dust and preserve the stick mechanism for longer. Gulikit—the company that first launched Hall effect Joy-Con stick replacements for the original Switch—previously told Gizmodo it's working on new modules for the Switch 2.

And the certainty that these SoCs will pack 18 Oryon V3 cores continues to grow.

A seasoned tech tipster has stated that Qualcomm is testing Snapdragon X2 Elite devices in configurations with 64GB of RAM. Roland Quandt, best known for his exclusives published via Germany's WinFuture.de, stated this weekend that the “SC8480XP aka SD X2 Elite [is] in testing with 64GB RAM.” He is also more convinced than ever that this upcoming Oryon V3 CPU architecture chip will come packing 18 cores.

PC enthusiasts are hopeful that Qualcomm has learnt some lessons from its initial Snapdragon X Elite venture. It had a lot of help from Microsoft to spearhead Copilot PCs using the first Oryon architecture processors last June. However, interest in them fell sharply as AMD and Intel responded rather swiftly with their own power-sipping but potent AI/NPU-enhanced laptop processors.

The last time we heard murmurings about the touted SC8480XP was back in March. At the time, we highlighted that 18 cores would increase the CPU core count by 50% vs the first-gen Snapdragon X Elite. Moreover, the newer architecture is expected to deliver its own performance boost.

Rumors also point to the Snapdragon X2 Elite looking to push into the desktop side of the market, or even servers. This notion comes from chatter about Qualcomm testing chips like the SC8480XP with advanced cooling solutions, including a 120mm radiator toting AiO. That would mark quite an intergenerational change.

Moving on to other SoC specs, like onboard RAM, the last we heard, the SC8480XP was being tested in Qualcomm SiP (system in package) format with 48GB RAM on board, as well as a 1TB SSD storage on board. Now it looks like options with up to 64GB of RAM on board may be offered.

Quandt was at Computex 2025 and kept a keen eye on Qualcomm developments during the show. If his leaked info didn't come via a Qualcomm contact, perhaps a device partner talked about upcoming SC8480XP configurations behind closed doors somewhere in Taipei. Whatever the source, please add a touch of salt to these leaks until we hear directly from Qualcomm or a device partner.

Since we've sailed by Computex without any official Snapdragon X2 Elite, or what might be called Snapdragon X2 Ultra Premium, news, we are most likely looking at the Snapdragon Summit 2025, in September, for Qualcomm to take the wraps off its next-gen processors. We will also hopefully see designs that Qualcomm's partners have come up with to sell these Windows-on-Arm devices to us.

Mankind's most noble quest, to get Doom running on every piece of hardware imaginable, continues apace, and now one enthusiast vintage blogger has documented the process of getting the game to run on Apple's $10,000 Network Server from 1996. Old VCR's Cameron Kaiser confirmed they didn't cheat either, with no Linux, NetBSD, or NCommander AIX Doom backport in sight.

Kaiser says the fact that NCommander's AIX Doom, which requires AIX (Advanced Interactive Executive) 4.3, won't run on the Apple Network Server, is what prompted the mission to get Doom up and running on the ANS by some other means in the first place.

The ANS was built and sold by Apple between February 1996 and April 1997. As noted, they ran IBM's AIX OS, with a ROM that couldn't even boot Apple's own macOS software. Three total models, priced between $11,000 and $19,000, were sold. Kaiser has confirmed elsewhere that their particular ANS is the 500/132 model, which features a base specification of a maximum 64MB of RAM, 1MB of built-in DRAM for video, and a 2GB hard drive.

Kaiser used Doom Generic as the foundation for the stunt, noting its minimal hardware assumptions and Xlib support, and installed the AIXPDSLIB 2.91.66 compiler as the toolchain. Kaiser started with a Makefile, used to create a base of Doom that could be run over remote X.

After plenty of coding wizardry, Kaiser's Doom project was playable via Apple's Remote Desktop at a reasonable speed on a Mac, but completely unusable on the console itself, mostly due to a quirk with ANS video, which maxes out at 1024 x 768 and can't do more than 8-bit color depth. A quick rebuild of the executable to run Doom Generic with an 8-bit colormap, which gives the build proper pixels but dreadful colors.

One Kaiser had fixed the colors, the ANS displayed a functioning Doom, the console reportedly running without lag and with decent general movement, apart from strafing. Kaiser assigned the Command keys for this purpose, and voila! Doom is fully functioning on an Apple Network Server.

Kaiser swapped out the ANS' clunky CRT monitor for an LCD display to show off the gameplay, and also applied the same build to an IBM RS/6000 Notebook 860, noting that their creation will work on any AIX 4.1 system. If you're interested in following in Kaiser's footsteps, both precompiled builds are now available on Github.

NVLink or PCIe-based ConnectX-8 SuperNICs?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Following the export ban of its H20 chips to China, Nvidia is reportedly designing a Blackwell-based alternative dubbed B30 with multi-GPU scaling capabilities, according to The Information. Multiple leaks have reported different names for this accelerator, shifting from the RTX Pro 6000D to B40, and now B30, possibly indicating different variants within the forthcoming BXX family.

The Information claims that Nvidia's future B30 solutions will support connecting multiple GPUs for scaling. It's important to note these accelerators are reportedly built using GDDR7 memory, employing GB20X silicon — the same chips that power consumer-grade RTX 50 GPUs. While many believe this 'multi-GPU scaling' capability refers to NVLink, Nvidia has excluded NVLink support from its consumer-grade GPU dies since the last generation.

The company introduced RTX Pro Blackwell servers at Computex, which employ up to eight RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, connected via ConnectX-8 SuperNICs with built-in PCIe 6.0 switches for GPU-to-GPU communication. This configuration also applies when connecting two DGX Spark superchips together, and that's likely what we'll see with the B30 as well. It is theoretically possible that Nvidia has modified existing GB202 chips, the ones you find on an RTX 5090, and enabled NVLink support.

When asked regarding the H20 ban, Jensen explicitly stated that Nvidia would not create further alternatives based on Hopper, indicating a shift to the Blackwell architecture for future China-bound chips. The U.S. government specifically targeted the H20's memory bandwidth and interconnect bandwidth, deeming it too high for unrestricted export. The rationale was that these AI accelerators can be used to build supercomputers in China for military applications.

Nvidia has long been engaged in a regulatory whack-a-mole with the U.S. government, concerning the export of its high-performance AI accelerators to China. These export control policies have also impacted competitors, such as AMD, which recently reported potential losses of up to $800 million following the ban on its MI308 chips.

Citing these policies as ""a failure"", Jensen Huang highlighted how the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge if Chinese rivals like Huawei are forced to innovate and design hardware that can compete against Nvidia, and possibly even define future global standards.

Retailers are preparing RX 9060 XT listings ahead of the graphics card's launch on June 5th. Resident leaker @momomo_us on X spotted some of these initial listings from Central Computers, with attached pricing starting at $319.99.

The California-exclusive retail chain posted three ASRock RX 9060 XT listings featuring the Challenger 8GB, Challenger 16GB, and Steel Legend 16GB models. The 8GB model is priced at $319.99, the Challenger 16GB at $369.99, and the Steel Legend at $389.99.

The two Challenger models are $20 more expensive than the RX 9060 XT's MSRP for both the 8GB and 16GB trims. The Steel Legend 16GB is $40 more expensive than MSRP. Central Computer's listings don't say it, but the higher prices are likely justified by the addition of a factory overclock on all three models (not to mention the Steel Legend is a higher-tier card than the Challenger). According to ASRock's own RX 9060 XT listings, all of its outgoing models only feature factory overclocks (currently).

Videocardz managed to capture UK prices by Overclockers UK just before the retailer updated all its RX 9060 XT's prices to ""£6000"" to hide the real prices of its RX 9060 XT models before launch. Prices range from £289.99 for the cheapest 8GB cards to £359.99 for the most expensive 8GB and 16GB models. Pricing is technically not final until launch, so take all of the aforementioned prices (including the US-based listings) with a pinch of salt.

The RX 9060 XT is AMD's latest competitor to the mid-range GPU market, competing squarely against the RTX 5060 and the RTX 5060 Ti (particularly the 8GB model). The new GPU is an evolution of the RX 7600 and RX 7600 XT, featuring the same core count and bus width as both RDNA 3 GPUs but featuring the all-new RDNA 4 architecture running on the more advanced TSMC N4P node. AMD has also changed its naming scheme this time around, putting the 8GB and 16GB trims in the RX 9060 XT nomenclature. Previously, AMD used the RX 7600 XT nomenclature to separate its 8GB and 16GB trims; the RX 7600 XT sported the same core count as the RX 7600.

The RX 9600 XT launches on June 5th, starting at $299 (MSRP) for the 8GB model and $349 (MSRP) for the 16GB model.

German case, cooling, and peripheral maker Cougar was once known for having orange accents on many of its products. And that design element continues with its latest case to land on our test bench, the somewhat oddly named Airface Eco. The top ports are orange, and you could, of course, choose that color for the four included fans, as Cougar has done in many of the marketing images for this case. The Eco also sports a number of features that set it apart in other ways, like four-slot GPUs in vertical orientation, a modular IO panel, easily removed dust filters, and a distinctive front face full of large circular holes.

Will Cougar's Airface Eco make our list of best PC cases? To find out, we'll take a look at the specifications and features of the case, then we'll go over the features and wrap up our review with thermal testing.

Other features

Graphics card holder, Modular IO panel

▶ Coned vent front side



The first thing that caught my eye when I set up this case was its front, which incorporates coned vents, behind which are two 180mm ARGB fans. Cougar claims this design helps increase the airflow pressure of the case.

▶ Side view, simple GPU holder bracket



Looking inside the case, the configuration seems fairly standard, although there are a couple of unique choices to point out.



Built into the cable routing plate is a simple GPU holder. But don't misunderstand my description of “simple” as a bad thing. This GPU support does the job and is very easy to adjust. I much prefer this design of GPU holder compared to more complicated versions that some competitors offer in their cases.



There's also a handy routing hole for GPU power cords in the PSU shroud. Some users may find this cable management style cleaner and better-looking, or at least easier. But if you don't like that option, you can always route the cable through the traditional routing bracket on the motherboard tray.



▶ Build quality

The build quality appears to be good, with no obvious weaknesses or easily bent parts.



▶ Modular IO panel

The IO panel is located on the front of the top of the case by default, and harkens back to Cougar's early days with two orange-colored USB-A ports. There's also a USB-C port, audio jack, ARGB lighting control button, and power button.



Cougar describes the IO panel as “modular.” I'm not sure if I approve of this use of the word modular, as I view “modular” components as those that can be easily swapped and replaced with an alternative.

What Cougar means by“modular” is that the position of the IO panel can be adjusted. You can leave it at the top of the case, a or you can move it down to the bottom side of the case, which should be more convenient if you're keeping this case on your desk.



▶ Dust filters, bottom view



The bottom of the case has four rubber feet and a spot where the IO panel can be moved to. There's an easy-to-remove dust filter on the bottom, which slides out from the back.



There's another easily removable filter on the top of the case, but what really stands out is how Cougar designed the front dust filter. Most front dust filters require a bit of case deconstruction, but that's not the case with the Airface Eco! The filter on the front pulls out from the side using a pull tab, making it easy to to remove and clean.



▶ Rear side view, storage, and cable management features



The back view isn't quite as clean as I'd prefer, but does the job well enough. There are three cable ports on the top and a middle routing path with Velcro zip ties to keep things tidy. If you need more than that, six plastic zip ties are also included.



There is support for up to four storage drives in case. IThere are plates for 2x 2.5” drives (above) and a drive bay that supports two 3.5-inch drives (below) . The latter can be removed to create room for cable storage if desired.



▶ Rear view



At first glance, you would think that the back of the case is no different from any other. After all, you have a spot for the exhaust fan at the top, seven PCI-e expansion slots in the middle, and the PSU at the bottom – not much different from normal, right?

If you look closely, you'll see two screws to the right of the PCI-e slots. If you remove those, you'll find that the PCI slots can be removed and rotated for vertical GPU support. Most cases that support vertical orientation have a lower number of slots, sometimes only three – but none are lost when using the Airface Eco in vertical orientation, ensuring compatibility with the largest of GPUs, no matter which orientation is preferred!



▶ Rear view

There's also an ARGB hub, highlighted in blue in the photograph below, which can be used to universally control all ARGB devices in your computer case. It supports a total of six connections.



▶ Where's the PWM hub?

There is one small complaint that I have about this case – there is no PWM hub for the case fans, nor is there an included splitter cable for the case fans. If you don't have one of those parts available, each fan will need to be connected to your motherboard separately.

Our thermal tests are presented to give you more information about the product's performance, but aren't intended as the sole judgment of the chassis. The style, price, features, and noise levels of a case should also be considered, and we all have different preferences. What I might like in a case, you might not, and that's OK. My goal with these reviews is to give everyone, no matter their preferences, enough information to decide whether or not a product is right for them.

We've also started to add some tests using an AMD platform with a liquid cooler, to better examine how different factors can impact the thermal efficiency of a computer case.

 June 02, 2025  

Urology is a surgical specialty focusing on diseases of the male and female urinary tract, as well as the male reproductive organs. But urology is unique in some ways, as it also requires some expertise in other specialties, such as pediatrics, oncology, gynecology, and male infertility. An understanding of complementary and alternative medicine can also be helpful.

Certain urological conditions can also affect a person's mental health, suggesting that urologists can best serve patients by taking a somewhat holistic approach. A 2023 study in the journal Continence, for example, suggested that lower urinary tract symptoms — such as voiding and storage problems — are often associated with psychiatric and mood disorders, primarily depression and anxiety.

The American Urological Association (AUA) reported that there are about 12,000 practicing urologists in the United States. However, there is also a growing shortage of urologists, according to the AUA. An estimated 60% of all counties have no practicing urologist. One reason for the workforce shortage is that the average age of practicing urologists is among the highest of any specialty.

Urologists typically complete a 5-year residency after medical school, with many urologists pursuing optional fellowships in subspecialties, such as endourology, urologic oncology, pediatric oncology, and pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery.

For insight into the career of a urological specialist, we turned to Brian Inouye, MD, urologist with Albany Med Health System in Albany, New York. Inouye is also the assistant program director for the Urological Surgery Residency at Albany Medical College, Albany.

Q: When did you decide to specialize in urology, and what helped you choose that direction?

A: I made my decision as a third-year medical student. I rotated with the group at my medical school and became passionate about all the topics and anatomy covered, the ability to maintain patient relationships, and the goal of helping people through surgery. 

Q: What is a typical week like as a urologist, and how is your time divided between surgery, office appointments, and other matters?

A: As an academic urologist, I typically spend 2 days in the clinic and 2 days in the operating room, with the fifth day being an academic day where I perform research, edit journal articles, or work in my other capacities as the associate program director and department professional fulfillment director.

Q: What are one or two common challenges you face when treating patients, and how have you learned to deal with those challenges?

A: In my opinion, setting appropriate patient expectations remains both the most difficult and most important part of surgery. Especially when performing a lot of quality-of-life surgeries, patients are looking for excellent outcomes.

While we all think we're master surgeons, we will undoubtedly have complications. Outlining these possibilities with patients, while also instilling confidence in them as their surgeon, is very tough.

Q: How has the field of urology changed in recent years, and what is on the near horizon?

A: Urology has always been near the front of surgical technical advancements. Just a few years ago, we never dreamed of using a robot to perform reconstructive surgery or of using a laser to remove a prostate, but those are now commonplace. Every year brings new, exciting technologies.

Q: What is something students can do now to help prepare for a career in urology?

A: For anyone interested in medicine, truly enjoy your life. Find your passion. Medicine is a difficult career, so having passions outside keeps you fresh to take the best care of patients. It also makes you unique as an applicant, which never hurts.

 June 02, 2025  

Morning stiffness is common for people with arthritis and that got researchers to thinking that if they could time drug therapy to match the body's rhythms when pain receptors are most active, they could relieve that morning stiffness and potentially target flares.

That concept, known as chronotherapy or chronomedicine, aims to synchronize drug delivery to the body's circadian rhythms. A few small clinical trials and observational studies have evaluated this concept, but most recently researchers in Japan completed a multicenter, nonrandomized, controlled study that found that almost twice as many patients who took baricitinib at night had a measurable improvement in symptoms than patients who took the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor in the morning.

“Chronotherapy refers to the strategic timing of medication, therapies, or other medical interventions to align with the body's natural circadian rhythms,” Amanda Sammut, MD, chief of rheumatology at Harlem Hospital Center in New York City, told Medscape Medical News. “The goal of chronotherapy is to optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse events.”

In 2017, Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael Young won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work isolating a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythms. However, as researchers in Italy who have studied chronotherapy in inflammatory joint diseases have noted, transition of that knowledge to clinical practice has proceeded slowly.

“Growing knowledge of chronobiology applied to inflammatory joint diseases could stimulate the development of new drug strategies to treat patients in accordance with biological rhythms and minimize side effects,” the Italian researchers wrote.

“It should be evidence-based,” John Hogenesch, PhD, a neuroscientist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, who has researched circadian rhythms, told Medscape Medical News. “Yet there are only about 140 studies in 50 years looking at drug timing.”

Sammut noted that chronotherapy is not yet incorporated into major rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment guidelines. “The temporal administration of anti-inflammatory agents to coincide with this cytokine surge presents a theoretically sound strategy to improve disease activity,” she said.

The most recent research in Japan, led by Akira Hashiramoto, MD, PhD, at Kobe University, Kobe, Japan, assigned 122 patients with RA to four open-label treatment groups: Either baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg in the morning or evening. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with at least 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20) at 12 weeks. Some of the secondary endpoints included ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates at other timepoints as well as changes in the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at the same timepoints out to 1 year.

Hashiramoto told Medscape Medical News that the changes in swollen joint count (SJC) significantly improved in the evening vs the morning dosing group throughout the 52-week study period, and that changes in tender joint count, patient global assessment, and physician global assessment mostly occurred before 3 months.

“Therefore, we believe that the most important mechanism for achieving sustained CDAI remission at weeks 12, 24, and 52 is that chronotherapy maximized the effect of baricitinib by week 12 after initiation, when all components of CDAI have responded well,” he said. “The results demonstrate the crucial importance of the treat-to-target strategy.”

Earlier studies demonstrated the potential of chronotherapy. Researchers in Berlin, led by Frank Buttgereit, MD, at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, reported in 2008 that modified-release prednisone reduced the duration of morning stiffness in RA. In 2013, Buttgereit's group reported that low-dose prednisone chronotherapy when added to existing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs produced significantly higher response rates than placebo for ACR20 — 48% vs 29% (P < .001), and more than double the rate for a 50% improvement (22% vs 10%; P < .006).

A 2011 study in Japan found that methotrexate chronotherapy can improve RA symptoms compared with traditional dosing methods, but Sammut cautioned that the results may not be entirely related to chronotherapy. The study switched patients from the standard methotrexate dose three times daily to once daily at bedtime, but with the same weekly dosing. “So even though the results showed improved disease activity scores and functional capacity, it may not be related to the actual chronotherapy portion alone,” Sammut said.

The body's circadian clock is central to chronotherapy. A few studies have explored the role of the body's internal clock in RA pathophysiology, including one by Buttgereit's group in Berlin.

Buttgereit's group reported in 2015 that circadian disruption altered circulating leukocyte rhythms in patients with RA. Specifically, they found the rhythms of effector CD8 + and CD4+ T cells, and interleukin (IL)–6R+ CD8+ T cells were abolished in patients with RA; and that IL-8R+ monocytes, CD20+ CD27+ memory B cells, and CD20+ human leukocyte antigen –DR+ activated B cells, which were not rhythmic in healthy individuals, had rhythmic circulation in the peripheral blood of patients with RA.

Researchers at Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida, conducted a literature review in 2023 in which they identified four common clock genes that were dysregulated in patients with RA: Circadian locomotor output cycles kaput; brain and muscle ARNT like-1; period; and cryptochrome.

Research has also been conducted on the diurnal variation of symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica. In a 2016 observational study, Danish researchers reported that plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor–α, IL-1β, and IL-4 varied with time in both patients treated with prednisolone and untreated patients, peaking between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM. With the exception of IL-1β, concentrations of these cytokines and of IL-10 were higher throughout the 24-hour observation period in treated patients, as were melatonin and cortisol levels, the latter peaking around 2:00 AM and 8:00 AM, respectively.

In his laboratory at Shriners Hospitals for Children — St. Louis — Farshid Guilak, PhD, has been researching circadian rhythms and timed-release therapy to minimize arthritic flares and prevent disease progression in people with RA or juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

“It turns out that not only does our brain have this region that cycles but virtually every other tissue in the body is on a 24-hour clock,” Guilak told Medscape Medical News. “Unlike the master clock, they're called the peripheral clocks.”

These peripheral clocks in the joints dictate the ebb and flow of pain within them, he said. “The exact reason is not completely known, but my belief is that our tissues also have periods of activity and rest,” Guilak said.

“During the night we elevate a lot of the proteins and genes that are related to repair and regeneration, things that are related to cleaning out the cells, such as the process of autophagy. It's very important in the brain and memory that if you don't have these sleep periods, you don't actually allow your tissues to reset and repair themselves.”

Inflammatory mediators peak between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM, he said. “This is one reason why many people with arthritis wake up with morning stiffness,” he said.

“The clock regulates about 50% of drug transporters, targets, and metabolizing enzymes,” Hogenesch said. “About half of all small-molecule drugs have a short (less than 12-hour) half-life. This means as many as 25% of all drugs may be influenced by when they are taken.”

Guilak's group reported that people who work night shift had a 25% higher risk for knee osteoarthritis and a 30% higher risk of having knee replacement than nonshift workers. “Disruption of sleep is a major risk factor for arthritis,” he said. “Doing shift work or getting < 6 hours of sleep a night significantly increases the risk of osteoarthritis.” 

Chronotherapy faces several barriers before it gains wider acceptance as a treatment approach in RA. One involves identifying specific circadian patterns in individual patients.

“The gold standard is the dim-light melatonin onset assay, which is only done in a tiny subset of patients in a tiny subset of academic medical centers,” Hogenesch said. More practical methods, he said, are using surveys, such as the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, or actigraphy, which uses wearables, such as a Fitbit or Oura ring. “So [it will be] surveys and wearables for the near future,” he said.

The complexity of medical regimens for patients with RA poses another barrier to wider acceptance, Summat said. “The medication regimen for patients with RA, and for many other chronic diseases, usually includes multiple medications,” she said. “When you include timings of medications, it may make it more complicated and more difficult to adhere to the regimen.”

But other patients may be amenable to having a medication schedule, Sammut said. “Timing of medications is something that we should think about in our patients already,” she said. “For instance, if a patient is on a proton pump inhibitor, we would recommend taking it on an empty stomach half an hour before eating or drinking anything.” She suggested that physicians and pharmacists should collaborate on developing medication plans for patients. Individual patients' sleep schedules are another factor to consider with chronotherapy, Sammut added.

The JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and upadacitinib could potentially be used for chronotherapy in RA, Hashiramoto said. “The half-life, time after administration of the drug to reach maximum plasma concentration, or drug withdrawal of tofacitinib and upadacitinib are different from that of baricitinib, so the efficacy of bedtime dosing must be demonstrated in clinical trials,” he said.

“However, in our limited experience, tofacitinib tends to respond well in patients who start with only a single evening dose, with similar results to baricitinib 2 mg in the evening,” he said. “For upadacitinib, once daily in the evening is as effective as baricitinib.” 

Based on his group's research, Hashiramoto said that chronotherapy does not increase adverse events with either tofacitinib or upadacitinib.

“We hope that follow-up studies of chronotherapy will be conducted in Europe and the United States, not only for baricitinib, but also for other JAK inhibitors,” he said.

Guilak's research group has been investigating “chronogenetics,” circadian-based gene circuits that can be programmed into stem cells and that, once implanted in the body, match the patient's circadian clock to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs daily at a specific time. The stem cells are administered in a drug-eluting implant — “like a spaghetti string rod full of cells injected under the skin,” he said — that is inserted into the joint. It's designed to release drugs once a day. Guilak reported that these gene circuits produced effective amounts of IL-1 receptor antagonist in mice.

More recently, Guilak's group reported on an implant that responds to both circadian and inflammatory signals to release therapeutic levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist not only at a specific time but also in response to activation of pain receptors. His group recently received a grant from the Advanced Research Project Agency for Health to develop the implant. “Our goal is to get this into patients in the next 3-5 years,” he said.

Hashiramoto reported receiving honoraria from AbbVie and honoraria and grants from Eli Lilly Japan. Guilak is an employee and shareholder of Cytex Therapeutics and has applied for patents on concepts on chronogenetics. Sammut and Hogenesch reported no relevant financial relationships.

 June 02, 2025  

SAN DIEGO — A novel generative artificial intelligence (AI) framework known as trajectory flow matching (TFM) can predict the need for red blood cell transfusion and mortality risk in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, researchers reported at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

Acute GI bleeding is the most common cause of digestive disease–related hospitalization, with an estimated 500,000 hospital admissions annually. It's known that predicting the need for red blood cell transfusion in the first 24 hours may improve resuscitation and decrease both morbidity and mortality.

However, an existing clinical score known as the Rockall Score does not perform well for predicting mortality, Xi (Nicole) Zhang, an MD-PhD student at McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, told attendees at DDW. With an area under the curve of 0.65-0.75, better prediction is needed, Zhang said, whose coresearchers included Dennis Shung, MD, MHS, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and director of Applied Artificial Intelligence at Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.

“We'd like to predict multiple outcomes in addition to mortality,” said Zhang, who is also a student at the Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute.

As a result, the researchers turned to the TFM approach, applying it to ICU patients with acute GI bleeding to predict both the need for transfusion and in-hospital mortality risk. The all-cause mortality rate is up to 11%, according to a 2020 study by James Y. W. Lau, MD, and colleagues. The rebleeding rate of nonvariceal upper GI bleeds is up to 10.4%. Zhang said the rebleeding rate for variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is up to 65%.

The AI method the researchers used outperformed a standard deep learning model at predicting the need for transfusion and estimating mortality risk.

“Probabilistic flow matching is a class of generative artificial intelligence that learns how a simple distribution becomes a more complex distribution with ordinary differential equations,” Zhang told Medscape Medical News. “For example, if you had a few lines and shapes you could learn how it could become a detailed portrait of a face. In our case, we start with a few blood pressure and heart rate measurements and learn the pattern of blood pressures and heart rates over time, particularly if they reflect clinical deterioration with hemodynamic instability.”

Another way to think about the underlying algorithm, Zhang said, is to think about a river with boats where the river flow determines where the boats end up. “We are trying to direct the boat to the correct dock by adjusting the flow of water in the canal. In this case we are mapping the distribution with the first few data points to the distribution with the entire patient trajectory.”

The information gained, she said, could be helpful in timing endoscopic evaluation or allocating red blood cell products for emergent transfusion.

The researchers evaluated a cohort of 2602 patients admitted to the ICU, identified from the publicly available MIMIC-III database. They divided the patients into a training set of 2342 patients and an internal validation set of 260 patients. Input variables were severe liver disease comorbidity, administration of vasopressor medications, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate over the first 24 hours.

Excluded was hemoglobin, since the point was to test the trajectory of hemodynamic parameters independent of hemoglobin thresholds used to guide red blood cell transfusion.

The outcome measures were administration of packed red blood cell transfusion within 24 hours and all-cause hospital mortality.

The TFM was more accurate than a standard deep learning model in predicting red blood cell transfusion, with an accuracy of 93.6% vs 43.2%; P ≤ .001. It was also more accurate at predicting all-cause in-hospital mortality, with an accuracy of 89.5% vs 42.5%, P = .01.

The researchers concluded that the TFM approach was able to predict the hemodynamic trajectories of patients with acute GI bleeding defined as deviation and outperformed the baseline from the measured mean arterial pressure and heart rate.

“This is an exciting proof-of-concept study that shows generative AI methods may be applied to complex datasets in order to improve on our current predictive models and improve patient care,” said Jeremy Glissen Brown, MD, MSc, an assistant professor of medicine and a practicing gastroenterologist at Duke University who has published research on the use of AI in clinical practice. He reviewed the study for Medscape Medical News but was not involved in the research.

“Future work will likely look into the implementation of a version of this model on real-time data.” 

He added: “We are at an exciting inflection point in predictive models within GI and clinical medicine. Predictive models based on deep learning and generative AI hold the promise of improving how we predict and treat disease states, but the excitement being generated with studies such as this needs to be balanced with the trade-offs inherent to the current paradigm of deep learning and generative models compared to more traditional regression-based models. These include many of the same ‘black box' explainability questions that have risen in the age of convolutional neural networks as well as some method-specific questions due to the continuous and implicit nature of TFM.”

Elaborating on that, Glissen Brown said: “TFM, like many deep learning techniques, raises concerns about explainability that we've long seen with convolutional neural networks — the ‘black box' problem, where it's difficult to interpret exactly how and why the model arrives at a particular decision. But TFM also introduces unique challenges due to its continuous and implicit formulation. Since it often learns flows without explicitly defining intermediate representations or steps, it can be harder to trace the logic or pathways it uses to connect inputs to outputs. This makes standard interpretability tools less effective and calls for new techniques tailored to these continuous architectures.”

“This approach could have a real clinical impact,” said Robert Hirten, MD, associate professor of medicine and artificial intelligence, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, who also reviewed the study. “Accurately predicting transfusion needs and mortality risk in real time could support earlier, more targeted interventions for high-risk patients. While these findings still need to be validated in prospective studies, it could enhance ICU decision-making and resource allocation.”

“For the practicing gastroenterologist, we envision this system could help them figure out when to perform endoscopy in a patient admitted with acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the ICU at very high risk of exsanguination,” Zhang told Medscape Medical News.

The approach, the researchers said, will be useful in identifying unique patient characteristics, make possible the identification of high-risk patients and lead to more personalized medicine.

Hirten, Zhang, and Shung had no disclosures. Glissen Brown reported consulting relationships with Medtronic, OdinVision, Doximity, and Olympus.

National Institutes of Health funded this study.

 June 02, 2025  

LOS ANGELES — Exploratory plans for a new iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) were presented publicly for the first time at American Psychiatry Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting. However, the APA stopped short of calling it a full sixth version of the DSM (DSM-6) at least for now.

The Chair of the Future DSM Strategic Committee Maria Oquendo, MD, PhD, head of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, noted that the group's goal is transparency and to solicit public feedback.

“There are people who are DSM fans and some who kind of hate it. So we have made it a point to talk to people and ask how we can fix it because we are all ears. If there are things we can do better, we definitely want to know,” Oquendo told Medscape Medical News.

To date, four DSM subcommittees have been established, focusing on social determinants, quality of life and functioning, biomarkers, and structure. During dedicated oral sessions held throughout the meeting, each subcommittee chair presented preliminary plans, emphasizing that these are still in development and remain open to revision.

“Why now? We want to advance the efforts that were started in the DSM-5 revision process, with the idea that it's time to move the psychiatry nosology forward. Specifically, we want to reflect evolving knowledge,” Oquendo said. She added that the goal is to make the manual a “truly living document,” with updates occurring in step with scientific advances.

Although she would not confirm whether this work is laying the groundwork for what will eventually become DSM-6, Oquendo said the target publication date for the new iteration is about 4 years from now.

The last fully new DSM was DSM-5, which was published in 2013. The latest update, the Text Revision version (DSM-5-TR), was released in 2022.

The manual has a long history. The first DSM was published in 1952, followed by the second edition (DSM-II) in 1968, the third edition (DSM-III) in 1980, and the fourth edition (DSM-IV) in 1994.

In addition to revising classifications for several diagnoses and discontinuing the use of Roman numerals in its abbreviation, the most significant change in DSM-5 was the removal of the multiaxial system first introduced in DSM-III.

Instead, it shifted toward a greater emphasis on dimensional assessments, especially functioning and symptom severity. It also rearranged the chapter order and grouping of disorders.

The development of the DSM-5 took nearly a decade, involving years of planning, field trials, revisions, public feedback, and multiple rounds of updates.

In March 2024, the APA's Board of Trustees approved the creation of the Future DSM Strategic Committee, with Oquendo becoming its chair. The full group was tasked with monitoring new developments that could affect the structure, definition, and criteria of DSM disorders.

“The rapidity of scientific developments in psychiatry has never been faster. The idea is: We want to integrate critical feedback on the DSM and work towards [including] classification models, measurements, and advances in neuroscience,” Oquendo said.

Additionally, she said, the APA wants to “harmonize” with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as much as possible.

The first DSM oral session introduced the subcommittee focused on the importance of functioning and quality of life.

Its goal, as noted in the abstract, is to evaluate how these two factors “can provide valuable insight into the patient's perspective on how their disease impacts their ability to carry out important activities, as well as provide key indicators for treatment progress toward patient-centered recovery goals.”

The Chair Karen Drexler, MD, associate professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavior Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, told attendees that key aspects include considering the perspectives of the individual, family, community, and clinician over time. “All are valid,” Drexler said.

The Social Determinants subcommittee is tasked with assessing the impact on mental health from factors such as ethno-racial backgrounds, sex and gender, belief systems, personality, income, an individual's living circumstances, and exposures through the years to both advantages and disadvantages.

Both subcommittees are also examining single and/or multiple instruments to determine which are most reliable in assessing these factors.

The mandate of the Biomarkers subcommittee is to “bridge the gap between psychiatry and neuroscience” and to evaluate both the benefits and potential risks of incorporating a biological approach into the diagnostic process. The group is also exploring the use of wearable devices.

In addition to identifying the best structure for the new manual, a fourth subcommittee was tasked with determining “strategies to integrate a dimensional approach into the DSM's foundation using a more organic and functional approach.” 

The Subcommittee Chair Dost Öngür, MD, PhD, of McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School, told attendees that the current manual has faced criticism for being both overly specific and too vague — particularly in cases involving unspecified diagnoses.

“Only a minority of patients present with a classic disorder, as described in the [current] DSM. Most present with a mixture of problems to varying degrees along dimensions of mood, anxiety, psychosis, and addiction,” Öngür said.

Ideally, a new edition would incorporate multiple components beyond the diagnosis, allow for varying levels of specificity in diagnostic formulation, document severity as a separate factor, and “crosswalk” to ICD codes for billing purposes, he noted.

Öngür also introduced a preliminary and evolving concept involving four “boxes” that clinicians would fill out, that would potentially include contextual factors, biological factors, diagnoses, and transdiagnostic features.

He emphasized that the current content is only illustrative and not a formal proposal, intended to show how the group is thinking about a workable framework. The next step is to gather data and feedback from the field on what this structure should include. Step two would then focus on proposing specific content.

When asked after the presentations whether there has been detailed consideration of how future updates to the new manual might be handled, including their frequency and the use of tech-driven platforms, Session Chair Nitin Gogtay, MD, chief of research and deputy medical director at the APA, said no decisions have been made yet.

“There is such a thing as too many updates. But at the same time, as the science advances, we don't want to wait to address that. So we need to find that sweet spot in the balance,” Gogtay said.

Another session explored the possible inclusion of four suicide-related conditions as distinct diagnoses in the next edition of the DSM — all of which have been proposed previously.

These include suicidal behavior disorder (suicidal behavior within the past 24 months), nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (which may precede suicidal behavior), suicide crisis syndrome (a mental state of entrapment “and ruminative flooding with or without suicidal ideation”), and acute suicidal affective disturbance (a conscious suicidal intent that escalates rapidly).

In the DSM-5-TR, suicidality is included only as a symptom of other conditions, such as depression and borderline personality disorder.

“Nevertheless, a recent report estimated that 19.6% of individuals who attempted suicide did so despite not meeting criteria for any existing psychiatric disorder,” the presenters noted in their abstract. They added that new suicide-specific diagnoses would help “identify at-risk individuals who would otherwise be deemed healthy by current suicide risk screenings.” 

Regardless of whether any of these conditions will be included in the next DSM, “establishing suicide risk assessment and intervention competency across disciplines will be essential over the next several years,” Edward A. Selby, PhD, professor of psychology at Rutgers, said in his presentation.

Michael Myers, MD, chair of the meeting's Scientific Program Committee and noted expert on suicide prevention, said that he is all for the inclusion of suicide-related conditions.

“This has been in the works for at least 10 years: That there is something outside of our conceptualization in DSM and ICD that warrants it as a stand-alone,” Myers told Medscape Medical News.

Oquendo agreed but noted that the DSM is also used for its codes. So as much as a group may want a new diagnosis to be included, it's important to understand the potential downstream effects inclusion could cause. It's also why starting a brand new DSM manual from scratch isn't realistic, she noted.

“We need to be pragmatic. We can't just start over because that has implications for people who are getting treatment today and whether their insurance is going to cover it. These types of practical considerations are essential,” Oquendo said.

Öngür reported receiving honorarium from Boehringer-Ingelheim. Oquendo reported receiving royalties from the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene and served as an advisor to Mind Medicine (pro bono), St. George's University, and Fundacion Jimenez Diaz. She also reviewed grants for Alkermes and her family formerly owned stock in Bristol Myers Squibb. The other presenters reported no relevant financial relationships.

Adding nivolumab (Opdivo) to standard-of-care cisplatin radiotherapy (CRT) after surgery for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in patients at a high risk for relapse reduced the risk for recurrence, as per a phase 3 trial.

This new therapeutic option “improved high-risk locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,” said study author Jean Bourhis, MD, PhD, during a press conference at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025.

Postoperative nivolumab added to standard-of-care adjuvant CRT “could be proposed as a new standard treatment for the first time in two decades,” said Bourhis, MD, PhD, of Lausanne University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, while reporting results of NIVOPOSTOP (GORTEC 2018-01) during the press conference.

Agreeing with Bourhis' characterization of the therapeutic regimen followed in the new trial, Stuart Wong, MD, said NIVOPOSTOP “represents a potential new standard,” in his comments as discussant of the results at the meeting's Plenary Session.

As immunotherapy for head and neck cancers evolve, so must the approach to managing these patients, said Wong, who is director of the Center for Disease Prevention Research at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.

“In a world where neoadjuvant and adjuvant anti–PD-1 [programmed cell death 1] are options for patient care, a multidisciplinary tumor board discussion is optimal and should include individual patient and social factors, as well as consideration of individual tumor growth dynamic,” Wong said.

“The NIVOPOSTOP study presents a major turning point,” he added. “However, we face many steep obstacles ahead of us, foremost among these the completion of ongoing studies.”

The study enrolled 680 patients aged 75 years or younger with HNSCC who had complete macroscopic surgical resection of stage III or IV cancer. Half the patients were either smokers or heavy smokers, and the most common tumor site was the oral cavity. About 80% of patients had either stage IVA or IVB disease.

After surgical resection, patients were randomized to one of the two regimens. The treatment group received one dose of 240 mg nivolumab, followed by a dose of 360 mg nivolumab every 3 weeks plus standard-of-care 100 mg/m2 cisplatin every 3 weeks and 66 grays (Gy) of intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), followed by six doses of 480 mg nivolumab over 4 weeks. The control group received 100 mg/m2 cisplatin every 3 weeks and IMRT 66 Gy.

The rate of 3-year disease-free survival in the nivolumab plus CRT group was 63.1% vs 52.5% in the control group (P = .034), representing a 24% improvement, Bourhis said.

The nivolumab plus CRT group also had a 37% reduced risk for cumulative incidence of locoregional relapses alone at 3 years, he added.

Compliance rates were similar between both groups. For example, RT compliance rates over 55 days were 95% for nivolumab plus CRT and 97% for CRT.

The proportion of patients experiencing more serious side effects in the 100 days following treatment was higher in the nivolumab plus CRT group than in the control group (13.1% vs 5.6%). The most common grade 4 adverse events in both groups were neutropenia and lymphocytopenia. Most treatment-related adverse events were less serious grade 1 or 2 events and were related to chemoradiotherapy in both groups. The nivolumab group had “a slight increase” in renal toxicity (24% vs 15%) and “a more pronounced increase” in thyroid disorders (20% vs 2%), Bourhis said.

NIVOPOSTOP adds to a body of evidence supporting the use of adjuvant immunotherapy in difficult-to-treat disease, Glenn Hanna, MD, director of the Center for Cancer Therapeutic Innovation at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said at the press conference. He cited results from the KEYNOTE-689 trial, reported in April at American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2025, in which patients with HNSCC were given perioperative neoadjuvant pembrolizumab followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab.

“It brings us into a space where we were with kidney cancers and with melanoma, to say what is the right sequence of immunotherapy?” Hanna said. He noted that NIVOPOSTOP and KEYNOTE-689 both reported similar outcomes.

“So do you give the immunotherapy first, or do we wait and do it in the adjuvant setting?” he said. Based on Bourhis' research, “they are comparable.”

He added, “I think now immunotherapy will be here and present for our head and neck patients undergoing cancer resection.”

NIVOPOSTOP received support from Bristol Myers Squibb and GORTEC. Bourhis reported having financial relationships with AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Serono, and Merck Sharpe and Dohme.

Hanna reported having relationships with Actuate Therapeutics, Bicara Therapeutics, Boxer Capital, Bristol Myers Squibb, Coherus BioSciences, Elevar Therapeutics, Genentech, Greywolf Therapeutics, ImmunityBio, InhibRx, KSQ Therapeutics, Kura Oncology, Merck, Naveris, Nextech Invest, PDS Biotechnology, Regeneron, Remix Therapeutics, Replimune, Secura Bio, and Surface Oncology. Wong reported receiving research funding from Hookipa Pharma, Merck, and Novartis.

In a recent study, emergency nurses and physicians in approximately half of the study hospitals disagreed on the quality of the work environment. An environment rated ""unfavorable"" by both groups was significantly associated with worse clinician and patient outcomes.

""This cross-sectional study found that ED nurses and phy­sicians in close to half of study hospitals disagreed on the quality of their work environment. Clinician job and patient outcomes were worse when both clinicians rated their work environment unfavorably and when nurses only reported their work environments as unfavor­able,"" the authors wrote.

""The implication of these findings is that, if two essential partners in emergency care within the same institution do not agree on the deficiencies in ED work environments, significant interdisciplinary research is needed to bridge these gaps and disparate experiences,"" they added.

The study was led by Jane Muir, Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research, School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. It was published online on May 16, 2025, in BMC Health Services Research.

The study included only Magnet hospitals, which are known for favorable work environments and good physician-nurse collaboration, suggesting the findings may have underestimated the variation in clinician work environment agreement across all hospitals. The cross-sectional design prevented causal inference, and the sample had more nurses than physicians.

The research was funded by the Clinician Well-being Study Consortium and the National Institutes of Health. Additionally, it was supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Institute of Nursing Research, the National Clinician Scholars Program, and the Emergency Medicine Foundation/Emergency Nurses Association Foundation. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Beta-lactam allergy de-labeling was safe and effective for older adult patients, successfully removing false allergy labels in 87.3% of cases, with no patients requiring hospitalization or adrenaline administration.

“Increased awareness is crucial for enhancing allergic workup in the geriatric population bearing beta-lactam allergy labels,” the authors wrote. “We believe that establishing the removal rate of false BL [beta-lactam] allergy labels as a healthcare quality metric and making it mandatory under the supervision of health authorities will improve outcomes for both the general population and the geriatric population,” they added.

Saray Sity-Harel, MD, with Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online in Journal of Clinical Medicine.

This study had a single-center design and limited patient follow-up data, which may reduce the generalizability of the findings and the validity of the outcomes.

Genetic testing in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) may identify those at higher risk of developing incident cardiomyopathy or heart failure, new research from the Netherlands suggested.

In a study that included two longitudinal cohorts (the All of Us Research program and the UK Biobank), the prevalence of inherited rare gene variants associated with cardiomyopathy was twice as high in patients with AF and up to five times as high in patients with early-onset AF, defined as that occurring in people younger than 45 years.

The analysis, of 44,182 patients with AF, also found those with gene variants associated with cardiomyopathy were at a higher risk for incident cardiomyopathy or heart failure after a diagnosis of AF — about 50%-70% higher compared with noncarriers — independent of clinical and polygenic risk.

The findings appeared in JAMA Cardiology.

“If you see a young person in the clinic with AF, first of all, it's not a good sign,” Sean J. Jurgens, MD, MSc, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Experimental Cardiology at Amsterdam UMC, and a co-author of the study, told JAMA in an interview about the research. “The risk of heart failure and cardiomyopathies are relatively high and substantially elevated in any person with AF at a younger age. It's not a benign disease where you only have to treat the ischemic stroke risk.”

People carrying rare pathogenic variants “are the patients you really need to look after because these will be the ones who will go on to develop heart failure more likely,” he said.

Jurgens acknowledged barriers remain with widespread genetic testing, citing cost, insurance coverage, a lack of cardiovascular genetic expertise, and the lack of genetic counselors. Genetic testing is also more widely available in a smaller country like the Netherlands. In the United States, especially outside of urban centers, accessibility is particularly limited.

“This is a very difficult problem, is why it is so important to do the right stratification,” Jurgens said. “We can't offer it to everyone. One thing that's good to see is that the prices, at least on the technological side are dropping.”

Jurgens said the new research may help reduce the cost of genetic testing, as it narrowed the panel of pathogenic variants from more than 100 to 26, with a high degree of confidence.

In an editorial accompanying the journal article, Olivia G. Anderson, MS, CGC, with the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, and her colleagues called the new study “methodologically rigorous.”

The work “affirms the observation that AF can be an early phenotypic manifestation” of genetic cardiomyopathy, they wrote.

Anderson and her co-authors praised the study for generating concordant results from a sensitivity analysis using a 12-month blanking period, which reduced the likelihood patients were diagnosed with AF and cardiomyopathy at the same time.

They also said the Dutch team's study makes a strong case for genetic testing in patients with AF, particularly for those younger than 45 years. “Their findings also highlight the increasing need for genetic counselors embedded in cardiology practices and an expanded availability of specialized cardiovascular genetics clinics,” they wrote.

This work was supported in part by the Amsterdam UMC YTF, Dutch Heart Foundation, and the AFIP Foundation; the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; the CIRCULAR NOW Consortium and the Dutch Heart Foundation, focused on genomic risk prediction in cardiomyopathies; and the American Heart Association, the European Union, and the Fondation Leducq.

Jurgens and the authors of the editorial reported no relevant financial relationships.

A 35-year-old man presented to the hospital with diffuse oral pain. He reported the pain intensity on a 10-point scale and rated it as “9” on the maxillary right and an “8” on the mandibular left. His medical history included HIV infection and chronic misuse of unidentified drugs for pain relief. During the physical examination, the patient reported experiencing tactile hallucinations, often described as itching or the sensation of insects crawling, which caused him to constantly scratch his nose.

The case reported by Michele White, DDS, an associate professor of restorative dentistry at the University of Texas Health Houston School of Dentistry, Houston, and colleagues described a rare case of excessive destruction of the nasal septum due to differentially diagnosed formication and physical effects of methamphetamine use.

The patient presented to the dental urgent care clinic with a chief complaint of generalised oral pain of 8 and 9 on a 10-point scale 3 weeks prior.

The patient's medical history included an HIV infection diagnosed 10 years ago and treated with poor HIV medication compliance over the past 5 years, as well as a history of drug and pain medication abuse.

The patient reported regularly taking more than 10 extra-strength paracetamol tablets and 10 ibuprofen tablets daily for pain relief. He also stated that he may have hepatitis B. The patient was unaware of his CD4 T-cell count and HIV medication.

Other family, medication, allergy, social, drug, and travel histories did not provide any relevant information.

On admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: Blood pressure, 144/90 mm Hg; pulse rate, 74 beats/min; respiratory rate, 26 breaths/min; and temperature, 38.3 °C. A clinical oral examination confirmed several decayed teeth with severe caries and missing teeth.

His skin was dry and discoloured. Further examination revealed a deviated nasal septum and formication lesions on both arms, face, and nose.

The destruction, deviation, and loss of the outer end of the nasal septum appeared to be due to excessive scratching and differentially diagnosed delusions of parasitosis.

Dental intervention was not possible because of the financial constraints. Furthermore, surgery was considered risky due to his unclear medical history.

“The dental urgent care clinic at our institution attends to persons with urgent dental needs. However, patients present with comorbid medical conditions that may affect the ability to safely receive dental care at that time and, consequently, require medical consultation,” the authors wrote.

Because the patients are not patients of record, many of them are lost to follow-up, as this patient was. The treating dental providers chose not to proceed with treatment and opted for referral to the local county hospital, where the patient could be provided dental treatment with medical support. The patient was lost to follow-up.

“Many healthcare providers, including family physicians, general dentists, med-peds, ear nose and throat, emergency room physicians, and ophthalmologists, are well positioned to recognise and report orofacial perforations and other possible associated signs of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse such as cardiovascular effects. This is important to assist patients in making appropriate referrals that aim to optimise patients' healthcare. Goals should be to establish or support patients by seeing their medical or dental providers regularly, rather than through an urgent care clinic setting,” the authors concluded.

“Prioritizing Counseling in Genetic Counseling” was a thought-provoking workshop title at the 2025 European Society of Human Genetics Conference, held May 24-27 in Milan, Italy.

While it may seem obvious that counseling should be prioritized at a meeting dedicated specifically to counseling patients and their families, this is not always the case in practice. 

Advances in technology and increasingly complex data could shift the focus toward technical details, often sidelining core counseling principles. These include the emotional burden of living with a genetic disorder or anxiety associated with an increased risk of developing one.

“This focus on issues beyond ‘simple' genetics is what defines the role of a genetic counselor. The role is distinct from that of a medical geneticist and is trained in psychological aspects.” Christophe Cordier, PhD, Head of the Genetic Counselling Unit and Genetic Counsellor at Sonic Suisse, Switzerland, told Univadis Italy. Cordier also teaches in the Master's program in genetic counseling at the University of Siena, Siena, Italy, currently the only institution in Italy offering such a course.

Who, then, is the genetic counselor, and what is their role? Jehannine Austin, PhD, professor and head of both the Departments of Psychiatry and Medical Genetics, and Graduate Advisor in the Genetic Counselling Training Program at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, addressed this in her presentation.

Since the 1940s, when the term “genetic counseling” first appeared, the profession has evolved dramatically. It shifted from a service delivered by physicians and researchers who, despite an official definition free of eugenic intent, focused largely on preventing families from conceiving children with birth defects, to a process designed to help individuals understand and adapt to genetic contributions to the disease. 

Yet even the most recent definitions fall short, Austin argued: “It seems to me that it describes the process and not what we should do with patients.” She offered an updated definition: Genetic counseling is a true “therapeutic interaction” that helps patients make sense of genetic information and apply it in line with their values, needs, and desires. This expansive theory has outpaced practice, often limiting counselors to those with positive genetic test results. In this situation, counselors can encounter burnout problems linked to dissatisfaction or a marked difference between theory and practice. 

When faced with genetic data, practitioners can adopt two possible approaches to counseling: One based on what can be defined as “teaching” and one based on counseling. Both aim for behavioral change; however, teaching drives change from the outside, whereas counseling fosters change from within. Counseling is not only about conveying numbers and ensuring patient comprehension; it is also about helping patients understand why their questions and answers matter, often for deep psychological reasons that can be addressed in a session.

“If we truly want to change someone's behavior, we cannot assume that [while] communicating genetic data,” Austin said.

She stressed the importance of integrating genetic data into a coherent narrative that instills responsibility and awareness of how actions matter. It is equally important to address emotions that may block behavioral changes.

“For me, prioritizing counseling is the rule, I could not do otherwise,” Cordier told Univadis Italy. He insisted that direct face-to-face interaction with those participating in the counseling session, whether they are patients or not, is fundamental.

“I do even believe telemedicine or virtual consultations — which can be useful in some particular cases but cannot and must not be the norm since the psychological implications of a genetic interview are extremely varied and often heavy,” he added.

Genetic counseling is a standalone profession that complements other professions. Cordier stated, “The medical geneticist makes the diagnosis; the counselor takes care of other things, for instance, supporting the geneticist in communicating the result and taking care of emotional and psychological aspects of the diagnosis or referral for testing,” highlighting the pivotal role of the primary care physician as the first point of contact. 

“The counselor often serves as a filter between the patient and the geneticist,” said Irene Feroce, certified genetic counselor at the Division of Cancer Prevention and Genetics, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy, who shared the insight with Univadis Italy.

This significantly helps physicians to deal only with patients who need to undergo the test. “All this also translates into a significant economic saving for the health system,” said Feroce.

“Let's not forget, if we want to talk about savings, that a counselor ‘costs less' than a doctor,” Cordier said.

In summary, genetic counselors offer multiple benefits. “In every context in which I have asked at conferences, working groups, commissions, etc. I have always been told that the counselor is a necessary figure,” Cordier said. However, only a few countries, such as France and Iceland, have officially recognized the profession, leading to frustration and burnout among counselors.

Barriers often include funding constraints or misunderstandings about the role of these professionals, and sometimes physicians' fear about being replaced by counselors and losing part of their jobs and positions.

Genetics now touches every medical specialty, but not everyone needs genetic testing, and not all healthcare professionals can provide counseling. “We need a change of mentality that gives the right importance to the specificities of different professionals, and we need projects to expand the knowledge among patients and physicians on these issues,” said Cordier and Feroce in unison.

“Keep going. Do not give up!” Cordier advised the aspiring genetic counselors.

 June 02, 2025  

LOS ANGELES — The novel norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (NDSRI) centanafadine (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) is effective and “clinically meaningful” for adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), new research suggested.

In a combined analysis of two phase 3 trials with a total of 859 adults, more patients who received the NDSRI had at least an 18-point improvement at week 6 on the ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) total scores compared with patients on placebo.

Additionally, a significantly greater percentage of the active treatment groups showed improvement in the measure's hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention subscales. 

But we weren't just interested in statistically significant change but in change “that means something,” said principal investigator Lenard A. Adler, MD, director of the Adult ADHD Program and professor of psychiatry at the New York University (NYU) Grossman School of Medicine, New York City.

“In other words: What do we know is a significant amount of change in patients receiving a compound? That's always a question because we want to get patients well and not just better,” Adler told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented on May 19 at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

A high-dose, pediatric version of the drug was similarly effective for both children and adolescents in two additional phase 3 trials also presented at the meeting by Adler and colleagues.

Centanafadine “is a triple reuptake inhibitor, so it's not a classical stimulant,” said Adler. “It's a compound that offers a unique profile.”

Investigators pooled data from two identically designed phase 3 trials looking at the drug in patients with a primary diagnosis of ADHD. Together, this included 859 adult patients, with a mean age of 35 years (52% men; 80.3% White).

The mean baseline total score on the semi-structured AISRS scale was 38.8 (“moderately ill”), with the mean AISRS inattention score 21.6 (“severely ill”) and the mean AISRS hyperactivity/impulsivity score 17.2 (“moderately ill”).

The AISRS is conducted as an interview between patient and clinician.

“We also recorded data on clinicians' global impression of severity and global impression of change and then used those as anchors to look at the clinically meaningful within-patient change for the AISRS,” co-investigator Caroline Ward, PhD, director of the Global Clinical Development at Otsuka Pharmaceutical Companies, told Medscape Medical News.

All participants were randomly assigned to receive centanafadine at 200 mg (n = 287) or 400 mg (n = 287) or a matching placebo (n = 285).

Results showed that the mean change on the AISRS total score at week 6 was −12.1 and −12.5 for the centanafadine 200 mg and 400 mg groups, respectively, vs −8.1 for the placebo group (P = .002 and P = .0009).

In addition, 24% of the 200 mg group and 25.4% of the 400 mg group achieved an 18-point or greater improvement in AISRS total score from baseline to week 6 compared with 15.4% of the placebo group (ratio of response rate [RR], 1.70; P = .002 and RR, 1.71; P = .001, respectively).

A 10-point or greater improvement on the AISRS inattention subscale was achieved by 26.1% of the 200 mg group and 23.3% of the 400 mg group compared with 16.5% of the placebo group (RR, 1.71; P = .001 and RR, 1.45; P = .03, respectively), and an 8-point or greater improvement on the hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale was achieved by 26.5% and 28.6% of the 200 mg and 400 mg groups, respectively, compared with 20% of the placebo group (RR, 1.38; P = .03 and RR, 1.47; P = .01, respectively).

The 200 mg and 400 mg groups also reached the “clinically meaningful within-patient change AISRS threshold” for the first time earlier than the placebo group (P = .0006 and P < .0001, respectively).

Looking at meaningful change “gives clinicians a benchmark,” said Adler.

The investigators also presented results from two other randomized phase 3 trials that assessed the drug in children between the ages of 6 and 12 years (n = 480; 58% boys) and adolescents between 13 and 17 years (n = 459; 59% boys). Of these, 77% and 81%, respectively, completed their studies. All were from the United States and Canada. 

The adolescents received high-dose centanafadine (328.8 mg once daily), low-dose centanafadine (164.4 mg once daily), or placebo for 6 weeks. The children received a placebo or a high or low dose of centanafadine, with doses based on their weight.

A larger number of children who received high-dose centanafadine had an 18-point or greater improvement at week 6 on the ADHD Rating Scale–5 (ADHD-RS-5) total score than those who received placebo (34.5% vs 23.3%; P = .03), with even stronger effects found in the adolescents (47.7% vs 31.7%; P = .004).

A greater number of the high-dose active treatment group vs the placebo group also had at least a 10-point improvement in ADHD-RS-5 inattention subscale scores (children, P = .03; adolescents, P = .003) and at least an 8-point improvement in hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale scores (P = .04 and P = .03, respectively).

In addition, the mean change from baseline to week 6 on the ADHD-RS-5 total score was −16.3 for the children receiving the high-dose drug vs −10.8 for those receiving placebo (P = .0008) and was −18.5 vs −14.2 in the adolescents (P = .0006). 

When assessing caregiver-rated improvements, investigators found that a greater number of children and adolescents receiving high-dose centanafadine vs placebo achieved at least a 14-point improvement on the Conners 3–Parent Short Inattention T-scores (P = .02 and .001, respectively) and at least a 13-point improvement on the Conners 3–Parent Short Hyperactivity/Impulsivity T-scores (P = .02 and P = .007, respectively).

Most treatment-emergent adverse events were deemed to be mild to moderate. The most common adverse events in the high-dose centanafadine group were decreased appetite and rash in the children and decreased appetite, rash, nausea, and headache in the adolescents.

Ward reported that data from these studies, along with some they conducted previously and some that are ongoing, will be part of a package they're preparing to send to the US Food and Drug Administration in the near future. Altogether, “it tells a nice story,” she said.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Soonjo Hwang, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, noted that among treatments already available for ADHD, the most well-known are stimulant medications, which “are purely” dopaminergic reuptake inhibitors.

“That said, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin have a close relationship with each other in the brain. So, if you inhibit one, it will have an impact on the others as well,” said Hwang, who was not involved with the new research.

He pointed out that centanafadine has a similar profile to other medication groups, such as antidepressants, that have been assessed previously for ADHD.

“In terms of the mechanism, it's similar to some we've had in the past. Still, it is really important for us to have new tools to treat this disorder because we currently have limited options,” Hwang said.

He noted that being “clinically meaningful” is a concept worth thinking about.

“This was a randomized-controlled clinical trial that [focused] towards more real-world data. And it's important to have data on how the medication performs in a real-world situation before launching it to market,” he said.

Hwang added that he'd also like to know, moving forward, how well the medication works in patients with comorbidities, which is common in those with ADHD.

The studies were funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization, Inc. Adler reported receiving grant/research support for his school from Otsuka, Corium, Shire, and Takeda. He has also been a consultant for several companies, including Otsuka, Supernus, Bracket, Signant Health, and Neurocentria, and reported receiving royalties as an inventor from the NYU School of Medicine. Ward and three other investigators are employees of Otsuka. Hwang reported having no relevant financial relationships.

 June 02, 2025  

PHOENIX — In the first randomized phase 3 trial to compare a home-based and facility-based supervised exercise program in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), outcomes were equivalent at both 16 and 52 weeks. These findings now support home-based exercise as an evidence-based option for patients who prefer to work out at home.

Evidence of equivalence from a controlled trial is useful because “home-based exercise programs might improve both access and adherence for at least some patients,” said study investigator Deborah Backus, PT, PhD, vice president for research and innovation at the Shepherd Center, Atlanta, Georgia. 

The findings were presented May 29 at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) 2025 Annual Meeting. 

Conducted at eight participating US centers, the STEP trial was limited to patients with modest walking impairment. An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4.5 to 6.0 was among the entry criteria designed to select a population that was still ambulatory but with a need for intervention to preserve function. 

“We wanted patients who can walk with some measured and perceived limitations but who were still able to exercise safely,” said Backus. 

The similar facility- and home-based regimens were based on Guidelines for Exercise in MS (GEMS). In one segment of the trial, 189 patients were randomized to the facility-based (GEMS-F) or the home-based (GEMS-H) programs. 

In the second segment of the trial, 190 patients were permitted to select their program, creating choice GEMS-F and choice GEMS-H groups that were compared with each other and with the randomized groups. 

The primary outcome was the timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW). Other outcomes included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), change in EDSS, and scores on the 12-item MS walking scale (MSWS-12). All outcomes were evaluated at 16 weeks and again at 52 weeks after the exercise programs were initiated.

Expressed in least-squares means adjusted for age, sex, and baseline EDSS, the improvement from baseline in T25FW was significant for all study groups and was similar between the GEMS-F and GEMS-H groups, in comparisons within and between the randomized and choice patient populations. 

Also consistent across all four study groups, a substantial proportion of the improvement was lost between weeks 16 and 52, even if at least a numerical and, in some cases, a statistical advantage was maintained relative to baseline.

The 6MWT and MSWS-12 outcomes showed a similar pattern with a substantial improvement at 16 weeks that eroded over subsequent follow-up. Again, there was a numerical advantage at 52 weeks over baseline in all of the groups even if it did not reach significance in every arm. 

The mean group EDSS scores, which were relatively preserved from baseline to week 16 declined from that timepoint to week 52 in all study groups.

There were modest differences in baseline characteristics among the four study groups, but the impact of the COVID pandemic was a major limitation of the study, said Backus. Dropouts by 52 weeks were substantial throughout the study population but were greater among those in the GEMS-H group, who were less likely to return to the facility for assessments.

Although exercise regimens in terms of aerobics and resistant training were the same for all groups, Backus acknowledged that there were some differences in access to equipment. 

For example, participants in the GEMS-F group performed aerobic training on treadmills that were not necessarily available to all of those in the GEMS-H group, even if other forms of aerobic exercise were substituted.

Overall, Backus said that exercise intensity and other key aspects, such as coaching, were similar in the GEMS-F and GEMS-H groups.

Commenting on the findings, Robert W. Motl, PhD, professor of kinesiology, nutrition, and rehabilitation, University of Illinois, Chicago. and a co-chair of the session where the study was presented, noted that regardless of whether patients completed the exercise program at home or in a facility, all of them were provided with resources for fall prevention, and the lack of serious adverse events in any arm is an important finding from this study. 

“With no safety differences and a comparable effect, the results provide an evidence basis for exercising at home, which is more convenient for patients and more cost-effective,” Motl said.

Another expert in rehabilitation for patients with MS, Frederick W. Foley, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein School of Medicine, Bronx, New York, agreed that the research provides support for home-based exercise in MS patients.

“There is a need to reduce the dependence of MS patients on care within a hospital or outpatient facility,” said Foley, who was not involved in the trial.

“It is not only less convenient and potentially more costly to receive care in a facility, but patients are also generally more comfortable in their own home,” he said.

The loss of benefit from week 16 to week 52, although expected and consistent with other lifestyle interventions, was disappointing. He pointed out that sustained benefit from exercise is elusive regardless of setting.

“The difficulty of achieving long-term benefit from behavioral interventions is pretty well recognized,” Foley said. He called this the “biggest challenge” for extending an exercise treatment effect.

Backus, Motl, and Foley report no potential conflicts of interest financial relationships. The study received financial support from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Today I am going to discuss a recent paper on intensive blood pressure control in people with type 2 diabetes. This was a big study. It included over 12,000 participants who were older than age 50, and had type 2 diabetes and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease; either they'd had a prior cardiovascular event, had two or more risk factors, or had a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

The study was performed in China and it was really done to determine, potentially once and for all, what the target should be in treating patients with type 2 diabetes. The ACCORD trial tried to answer this question, but it didn't show overall improvement in outcomes with blood pressure reduction, although when they did subset analysis, they did show benefit in certain groups. It still didn't have that definitive feel, and I think this study does.

They were looking only at systolic blood pressures, and they wanted to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg in the intensively treated group; in the standardly treated group, the blood pressure target was a systolic of less than 140 mm Hg. The primary endpoint was nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI, treatment or hospitalization for heart failure, or death from cardiovascular disease causes.

In this study, 45% were women. The average age was 63.8 years. Body mass index was 26.7 and 25% smoked. The baseline blood pressure was 140/76 mm Hg and the mean blood pressure over approximately 4 years of follow-up was 121.6 mm Hg in the intensively treated group vs 133.2 mm Hg in the standard treatment group.

You basically began to see a difference between the two in terms of the primary endpoint after about a year, so you started to see this split. At the end of the study, there was a very significant difference in terms of the primary endpoint between the two groups.

I want to point out that, in my brain, those blood pressure targets that were reached are actually fairly standard. The intensively treated group was about 120 mm Hg, and that's compared with the standard treatment group, which was around 130 mm Hg.

I must say that, in my own practice, given all the changes that we've seen over the years in blood pressure targets, the results from this study have actually motivated me to lower my systolic target, at least in terms of how I treat patients in clinic, because I think they may get further benefit.

That then begs the question of how did they measure blood pressures in this study? I get patients who have what's called white coat hypertension. They come into my office, their blood pressure is higher, and then I have them test at home and it's better. 

In this study, they tried to take away some of that interference. They had patients come into clinic having had no exercise, no coffee, and no cigarettes for at least 30 minutes before their appointment. The patients had 5 minutes of seated rest, and then they had three blood pressure measurements, each done 1 minute apart. There was no talking or joking around. They just sat there and had their blood pressures measured in the appropriate way.

The average systolic blood pressure was used of those three readings to determine whether treatment was changed. They followed pretty standard treatment regimens for hypertension, which are the ones we use in our ADA guidelines for the management of hypertension.

People in the intensive group ended up on one or two additional medications compared with those in the standard group. The overall rate of severe adverse events was equivalent in both groups, but there was more symptomatic hypotension and hyperkalemia in the intensively treated group.

As I said, this has actually changed how I'm treating my patients. The difference between 120 mm Hg and 133 mm Hg isn't that big in my brain, and yet there does seem to be a difference in terms of outcomes, primarily cardiovascular outcomes, as the primary endpoint.

I think that, if a patient can tolerate a lower blood pressure without symptomatic hypotension, I am going to be treating them down to a lower target. I think this was a well-done study that actually will probably inform practice and guidelines in the future because I think it helps inform us of what is potentially the best target for our patients.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Cancer cell movement during metastasis is a dynamic process regulated by several different signals. However, the way cells receive, process and respond to these signals has been extremely hard to detect, but is now made easier by a new visualisation tool.

In a new study led by Professor Johanna Ivaska and Dr James Conway, researchers at the University of Turku, Finland, have developed a new fluorescent probe to visualize signaling dynamics in moving cancer cells, which they used to uncover a new therapeutic possibility for limiting breast cancer spread.

Signaling networks inside cells control everything from growth to movement, but visualising this in living cells requires new and refined methods. I set out to see these invisible signals and came up with a new tool, which we call Illusia, to do just that.""

Dr. James Conway, lead researcher of the team

Breast cancer patients who experience the transition from pre-malignant ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) face a considerably poorer prognosis and metastatic disease is incurable.
The research team's work focuses on identifying factors that regulate metastatic movement of breast cancer cells, with the protein phosphatase Shp2, ""Ship two"", emerging as a key regulator of metastasis through regulation of cancer cell interactions with the surrounding tissue.

""Cell movement is essential for cancer cells to spread from the primary tumour to secondary sites. Even though this is widely recognised as the key step in cancer progression, there are currently no cancer therapies that block cell migration or invasion. Our research finds that drugs currently in clinical trials for blocking growth in other tumour types may also be effective in blocking breast cancer spread,"" says Professor Johanna Ivaska, the Principal Investigator on the project.

The implications of this discovery extend beyond breast cancer alone and may help us to understand cancer cell invasion from solid tumours more generally.

""Researchers develop colour-based probes to detect different events in live cells, but this type of cell-dynamics reporter had not been available before. It has transformed our understanding of what sorts of signaling are needed for cell movement,"" explains Dr Conway and continues ""These probes often take on names from pop culture references. The lab came up with the name Illusia, drawing from an old Finnish story about a fairy that comes to earth from the rainbow. This gave our work a colourful twist, something we are all seeking in today's world, as we strive for better treatments.""

The team is now exploring the therapeutic avenues that have opened up as a result of these recent findings.

Professor Johanna Ivaska is a research group leader at the InFLAMES Flagship, a joint initiative between the University of Turku and Åbo Akademi University, Finland, aiming to identify new drug targets and develop personalized therapies in collaboration with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. InFLAMES is part of the Research Council of Finland´s flagship programme.

A trial of an interactive game that trains people to alter their brain waves has shown promise as a treatment for nerve pain – offering hope for a new generation of drug-free treatments.

The PainWaive technology, developed by UNSW Sydney researchers, teaches users how to regulate abnormal brain activity linked to chronic nerve pain, offering a potential in-home, non-invasive alternative to opioids.

A recent trial of the technology, led by Professor Sylvia Gustin and Dr. Negin Hesam-Shariati from UNSW Sydney's NeuroRecovery Research Hub, has delivered promising results, published in the Journal of Pain.

The study compared hundreds of measures across participants' pain and related issues like pain interference before, during and after four weeks of interactive game play. Their brain activity was tracked via EEG (electroencephalogram) headsets, with the app responding in real time to shifts in brainwave patterns.

Three out of the four participants showed significant reductions in pain, particularly nearing the end of the treatment. Overall, the pain relief achieved by the three was comparable to or greater than that offered by opioids.

Restrictions in the study's size, design and duration limit our ability to generalise the findings or rule out placebo effects.

But the results we've seen are exciting and give us confidence to move to the next stage and our larger trial.""

Dr. Negin Hesam-Shariati, UNSW Sydney's NeuroRecovery Research Hub

The PainWaive project builds on UNSW Professor Sylvia Gustin's seminal research into changes in the brain's thalamus – a central relay hub in the brain – associated with nerve (neuropathic) pain.

""The brainwaves of people with neuropathic pain show a distinct pattern: more slow theta waves, fewer alpha waves, and more fast, high beta waves,"" Prof. Gustin says.

""We believe these changes interfere with how the thalamus talks to other parts of the brain, especially the sensory motor cortex, which registers pain.""

""I wondered, can we develop a treatment that directly targets and normalises these abnormal waves?""

The challenge was taken up by an interdisciplinary team at UNSW Science and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), led by Prof. Gustin and Dr Hesam-Shariati, and resulted in PainWaive.

The four participants in its first trial received a kit with a headset and a tablet preloaded with the game app, which includes directions for its use. They were also given tips for different mental strategies, like relaxing or focusing on happy memories, to help bring their brain activity into a more ""normal"" state.

The user data, meanwhile, was uploaded to the research team for remote monitoring.

""After just a couple of Zoom sessions, participants were able to run the treatment entirely on their own,"" says Dr Hesam-Shariati.

""Participants felt empowered to manage their pain in their own environment. That's a huge part of what makes this special.""

Initially, Dr Hesam-Shariati says, the team planned to use existing commercial EEG systems, but they were either too expensive or didn't meet the quality needed to deliver the project. Instead, they developed their own.

""Everything except the open-source EEG board was built in-house,"" says Dr Hesam-Shariati. ""And soon, even that will be replaced by a custom-designed board.""

Thanks to 3D printing, Prof. Gustin says, the team has cut the cost of each headset to around $300 – a fraction of the $1,000 to $20,000 price tags of existing systems.

The headset uses a saline-based wet electrode system to improve signal quality and targets the sensorimotor cortex.

""We've worked closely with patients to ensure the headset is lightweight, comfortable, and user-friendly,"" says Prof. Gustin.

""Owning the technology offers us the potential to one day offer PainWaive as a truly affordable, accessible solution for at-home pain management, especially for those with limited access to traditional treatments.""

The researchers are now calling for participants to register their interest in two upcoming trials of the neuromodulation technology: the Spinal Pain Trial, investigating its potential to reduce chronic spinal pain, and the StoPain Trial, exploring its use in treating chronic neuropathic pain in people with a spinal cord injury.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Genome doubling identified as common event in metastatic cancer evolution","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250602/Genome-doubling-identified-as-common-event-in-metastatic-cancer-evolution.aspx","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:20:00 GMT","

When cancer spreads from a primary tumor to new sites throughout the body, it undergoes changes that increase its genetic complexity.

A new study from researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provides fresh insights about how cancers evolve when they metastasize - insights that could aid in developing strategies to improve the effectiveness of treatment.

The team - led by collaborators Dr. Luc Morris, a surgeon and cancer genetics research lab director at MSK, Dr. Xi Kathy Zhou, a professor of research in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, and Dr. Chaitanya Bandlamudi, a cancer genomics researcher at MSK - examined the genomic profiles of more than 3,700 patients across 24 cancer types who had multiple tumor sites biopsied over time.

The samples were profiled using MSK's proprietary tumor sequencing test. This allowed the research team to compare the genetic profiles of an initial tumor and metastatic site from the same patient.

The team's findings, which were published June 2 in Nature Genetics, showed that tumors evolve over time, and that metastases tend to accumulate more copy-number alterations (CNAs) than mutations. This led the researchers to wonder why CNAs, but not mutations, were so commonly emerging when tumors metastasized.

Mutations are like small typos in the genetic code that can affect how a gene functions, leading to the production of abnormal proteins or the alteration of gene expression. CNAs, on the other hand, are larger scale duplications or deletions of genetic material.

One extreme form of CNA - genome doubling - turned out to be important during the process of metastasis.

""We found that whole-genome duplication - which is the doubling of the entire set of chromosomes in a cancer cell - was the most common genetic event during metastasis, occurring in nearly one-third of patients,"" explained study first author Dr. Karena Zhao, who conducted research at MSK while attending medical school at Weill Cornell Medical College.

As cancer cells divide and make mistakes in replicating their DNA, mutations accumulate. Some mutations help the cells grow faster, while other mutations can affect essential genes and be harmful to the cell.

Genome doubling allows cancer cells to hedge their bets, creating additional copies of genes, so that one copy can be mutated or deleted, while the other copy survives intact. This enhances the tumor cell's ability to adapt, survive, and resist treatments.""

Dr. Xi Kathy Zhou, professor of research in population health sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine

Unlike CNAs, more mutations can actually make tumors more visible to the immune system. That's because the changes to their genetic sequences can make them produce abnormal proteins, which are then treated like a foreign threat by the immune system. The team found that CNAs made tumors resistant, while mutations made tumors more susceptible to immunotherapy.

""In the end, our study found that during metastasis, cancer cells tend to evolve by maximizing CNAs, while not generating too many mutations that could potentially stimulate an immune response,"" Dr. Bandlamudi said.

Together, the findings suggest that newer strategies, such as therapies to target genetic instability in these highly altered cells or to alter the tumor microenvironment, could be critical for creating lasting responses in metastatic cancer, the researchers said.

""Understanding these key genomic differences between primary and metastatic tumors is vital for clinical care, as biomarkers like CNAs and tumor mutational burden are increasingly used by clinicians to inform decision-making, especially around the use of immunotherapy drugs,"" Dr. Morris said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Self-reported night owls may be more impulsive than morning larks","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250602/Self-reported-night-owls-may-be-more-impulsive-than-morning-larks.aspx","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:46:00 GMT","

A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that adolescents who prefer to sleep and wake up later (""night owls"") reported greater impulsivity than those who prefer to sleep and wake up earlier (""morning larks"").

Results show that adolescents with self-reported evening preference, or ""night owl"" tendencies, reported greater negative urgency and lack of perseverance, which are two aspects of impulsivity. This means that they were more likely to act impulsively when experiencing negative emotions and quit difficult tasks. In contrast, there was no association between objectively measured circadian phase and impulsivity.

Surprisingly, we did not find a significant link between dim light melatonin onset and impulsivity in our sample. This suggests that there may be unmeasured psychological or behavioral factors influencing both impulsivity and the self-assessment of circadian preference, regardless of the timing of an individual's internal circadian clock.""

Riya Mirchandaney, lead author, doctoral candidate in clinical-health psychology, University of Pittsburgh

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, circadian rhythms are internal biological rhythms that exist in all living organisms. This timekeeping system, or ""body clock,"" is synchronized to the 24-hour, light-dark cycle. Circadian preference reflects an individual's desired timing of sleep and wake, and circadian timing can be objectively measured by analyzing saliva or blood plasma to detect dim light melatonin onset.

The study involved 210 adolescents across two studies. They had a mean age of 17 years, and 60.5% were female. Participants completed self-reported measures of impulsivity and circadian preference. Laboratory samples of saliva were taken to assess circadian phase by determining dim light melatonin onset. During a week-long protocol, participants also wore a wrist actigraph to estimate sleep midpoint and duration, and at bedtime they completed an assessment of impulsivity.

Mirchandaney emphasized that the results could influence future research to help teens avoid the negative effects of impulsivity, which is a well-established contributor to alcohol and substance use.

""Adolescence may be a prime opportunity for preventing adverse outcomes associated with impulsivity using chronotherapeutic interventions to advance sleep and circadian timing,"" she said.

This study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism within the National Institutes of Health. The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented June 9 during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle. SLEEP is the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

Marijuana use among older adults in the US has reached a new high, with 7 percent of adults aged 65 and over who report using it in the past month, according to an analysis led by researchers with the Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research (CDUHR) at the NYU School of Global Public Health. 

Their findings, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, also show that the profile of those who use cannabis has changed in recent years, with pronounced increases in use by older adults who are college-educated, married, female, and have higher incomes.

Our study shows that cannabis use among older adults continues to increase, although there have been major shifts in use according to demographic and socioeconomic factors.""

Joseph Palamar, PhD, MPH, associate professor of population health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, an affiliated researcher with CDUHR, and study's senior author

Most Americans live in a state where marijuana has been legalized for medical use, recreational use, or both. To better understand the prevalence of marijuana use among older adults in the US, researchers examined data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2021 through 2023. The respondents, who were 65 and older, were asked about past-month cannabis use, which was defined as ""current"" use.

""This is the first time we were able to examine 'current' use of cannabis in this age group. Before, we were only able to look at past-year use because the numbers for current use were too small,"" said Benjamin Han, MD, MPH, associate professor and associate chief of research in the Division of Geriatrics, Gerontology, and Palliative Care at the University of California San Diego and the study's first author.

The researchers found that current cannabis use among older adults grew to 7 percent in 2023, up from 4.8 percent in 2021 and 5.2 percent in 2022-a nearly 46 percent increase in only two years.

""If we look even further back to 2006 and 2007, less than 1 percent of older adults used cannabis in the past year. Now, we're seeing that 7 percent have used it in the past month alone,"" said Han, an affiliated researcher with CDUHR.

Certain groups of older adults experienced sharper increases in use over this period than others, including those who are married, white, have a college degree, and have an income of at least $75,000. Older women also saw a steep increase in cannabis use, although older men are still more likely than women to use the drug.

In addition, cannabis use grew more among those living in states where medical marijuana is legal versus states where it is not.

""It shouldn't be surprising that use is becoming increasingly more common among people who live in states that allow medical cannabis, which could be due to increased availability or social acceptability,"" said Palamar. ""Interestingly, with respect to income, those with the highest incomes had the lowest prevalence of cannabis use in 2021, but by 2023 this group had the highest prevalence, which may indicate who has access to medical cannabis given its costs.""

The researchers also found significant increases in cannabis use by older adults with chronic diseases-and notably, those with multiple chronic conditions-including heart issues, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease.

The authors caution that the overall increases may be driven, in part, by those who use cannabis aging into the 65+ age bracket for the period studied. Regardless, they recommend that clinicians screen and educate their older patients about cannabis use, including how physiological changes that accompany aging can make people more sensitive to psychoactive substances.

""As a geriatrician, I see more and more people interested in using cannabis for treating chronic health symptoms. But cannabis can complicate the management of chronic diseases and be potentially harmful if patients are not educated on its use and potential risks,"" said Han.

Kevin H. Yang of UC San Diego and Charles Cleland of NYU Grossman School of Medicine were also co-authors on the study. The research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (K23DA043651, R21DA058404, R21DA060362, R01DA057289, R01DA060207, and P30DA01104) and the UC San Diego Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Digital baby formula campaigns undermine breastfeeding and put child health at risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250601/Digital-baby-formula-campaigns-undermine-breastfeeding-and-put-child-health-at-risk.aspx","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 01:52:00 GMT","

A global resolution on digital marketing of breast milk substitutes must be rigorously enforced, writes Afshan Khan, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and coordinator of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement.

Breastfeeding saves lives. It is one of the most powerful, proven investments in child survival, development and health. And yet its practice is being undermined — not by science, but by sophisticated and often misleading digital marketing.

More than half of new parents are exposed to online promotions for formula milk, often disguised as medical advice or peer support. In some countries, that figure rises to over 90 per cent.

What these aggressive campaigns for breast milk substitutes (BMS) do not tell parents is that breast milk is essential for building a child's immune system — something formula simply cannot do. They also ignore a critical risk: formula must be mixed with water, and in communities without safe water access, this often leads to illness and infection in young children.

Digital marketing campaigns are targeting parents at their most vulnerable — when they are seeking guidance, not manipulation. These tactics distort choice by drowning out trusted, evidence-based information with biased, misleading promotion.

This not only undermines public health principles and a decade of progress in breastfeeding promotion, it also puts the health and future of entire generations at risk.

These digital marketing tactics contravene a longstanding global framework. The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1981, was designed to protect families from precisely this kind of exploitation.

Yet, as a 2022 WHO and UNICEF report revealed, formula companies now spend up to 70 per cent of their marketing budgets on digital tools — from apps and virtual baby clubs to paid influencers and online forums — harvesting personal data and pushing targeted promotions in breach of the Code.

In response, WHO member states adopted a landmark resolution at the World Health Assembly in Geneva this week (26 May) to curb digital marketing of breast milk substitutes and protect parents' right to accurate, transparent information. Led by Mexico and Brazil and supported by nine country members of the UN-hosted Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, this resolution is a critical step forward.

The science on breast milk is long proven. By providing essential nutrition, strengthening immunity, and supporting cognitive development, breastfeeding can radically change the health and economic outcomes of mother and child.

Scaling up breastfeeding globally could prevent 823,000 unnecessary child deaths and 20,000 deaths from breast cancer every year. It has been linked to a 20 per cent reduction in the risk of physical and cognitive stunting.

These recognised advantages of breast milk had begun to take hold. Since 2012, rates of exclusive breastfeeding have risen from 37 per cent to nearly 48 per cent in 2021. Three quarters of these children live in low- and lower-middle-income countries, which represents important, tangible progress.

But digital platforms spreading misleading formula marketing are cutting into this progress, with inadequate breastfeeding responsible for 16 per cent of child deaths each year.

The new resolution gives countries a new framework to take action. Translating this into results will, however, require further coordinated efforts across sectors.

First, stronger enforcement is essential. Countries need robust monitoring and accountability systems to track violations and respond effectively. Vietnam offers a promising model: with support from the SUN Civil Society Alliance, it has launched the AI-powered Virtual Violations Detector, which identifies breaches of the Code in real time and alerts regulators, enabling swift action and targeted advocacy.

Another step will be to align fragmented policies across civil society and health systems. Harmful breast milk substitute marketing flourishes in disconnected systems, such as when health workers lack guidance, civil society is under-resourced, or tech platforms are unregulated. To close these gaps, governments must adopt an approach that brings all actors to the table.

Finally, it is equally important to support positive campaigns that champion breastfeeding. It is not enough to restrict harmful marketing — parents need support and encouragement to make informed decisions.

El Salvador has shown through its “Nacer con Cariño” (Born with Love) national policy how the promotion of breastfeeding can be integrated into prenatal and delivery care. Since its implementation in 2021, 69,000 babies have been born under this respectful care model and, thanks to the training of more than 1,000 breastfeeding counsellors supported by the SUN Movement, the country has far surpassed the global exclusive breastfeeding targets of 50 per cent for 2025, reaching a rate of more than 65 per cent.

Informed parents make empowered choices, and empowered choices give every child the best possible start in life.

Together with the resolution on the extension of the World Health Assembly nutrition targets, and the commitments made by countries at the Nutrition for Growth Summit in Paris earlier this year, we have a renewed mandate to act. Let's make sure we use it and ensure this resolution moves from Geneva into meaningful action and change online and on the ground.

Why their numbers might grow.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250602/Role-reversal-Millions-of-kids-are-caregivers-for-elders-Why-their-numbers-might-grow.aspx","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:24:00 GMT","

High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.

At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.

Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.

That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.

""It all fell to me,"" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.

Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom — money that went toward her medication and family needs.

But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. ""For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'"" he said. ""I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'""

A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump.

Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.

Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.

By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.

If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.

""These things tend to roll downhill,"" Olenski said.

Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: ""I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.""

But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.

Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.

Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.

The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.

""We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,"" she said.

Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.

""We can't always solve their problem,"" Tavares said. ""But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.""

Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students — work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.

""For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,"" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. ""And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.""

In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.

But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're ""actual people"" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.

""It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,"" he said.

Aortic valve narrowing (aortic stenosis) with concomitant cardiac amyloidosis is a severe heart disease of old age that is associated with a high risk of death. Until now, treatment has consisted of valve replacement, while the deposits in the heart muscle, known as amyloidosis, often remain untreated. An international research consortium led by MedUni Vienna and University College London has now been able to demonstrate for the first time that combined treatment consisting of heart valve replacement and specific drug therapy offers a significant survival advantage for patients. The study results have been published in the European Heart Journal.

As part of the study conducted by the research team led by Christian Nitsche (Department of Medicine II, Clinical Division of Cardiology, MedUni Vienna) and Thomas Treibel (Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, University College London), data from 226 patients with aortic stenosis and concomitant cardiac amyloidosis from ten countries were examined. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the heart valve that directs blood from the left ventricle into the bloodstream. In cardiac amyloidosis, misfolded proteins are deposited in the heart muscle. Both diseases occur in older people and often together. Until now, it was unclear whether treating amyloidosis in addition to valve surgery would benefit patients.

The analysis now published showed that both aortic valve replacement and treatment with the drug tafamidis for amyloidosis were associated with a significantly lower risk of death. The survival benefit was highest in patients who received both forms of treatment

Our results even show that patients with both conditions who received valve replacement and specific amyloidosis therapy had similar long-term survival rates to people with aortic stenosis without amyloidosis.""

Christian Nitsche, study leader

Both aortic stenosis and cardiac amyloidosis impair the heart's pumping function and can lead to death if left untreated. Targeted therapy can slow the progression of amyloidosis, while valve replacement treats the mechanical stress caused by the narrowed heart valve. Around ten percent of patients with aortic stenosis also have amyloidosis, but this is often not diagnosed in everyday clinical practice. ""Our findings also suggest that patients with severe aortic valve stenosis should be screened for amyloidosis so that we can offer them targeted life-prolonging treatment options,"" emphasises Christian Nitsche.

Despite strong evidence that early allergen exposure can prevent food allergies, new research shows most parents still wait.

Study: Parental Motivation for Introducing Babies' First Foods and Common Food Allergens. Image credit: shine.graphics/Shutterstock.com

A study published in the journal Nutrients aimed to understand when and why parents introduce their infants to solid foods.

Food allergy prevention in children is an important healthcare need. Current guidelines support the early introduction of allergenic foods to infants to reduce the risk. Yet parental attitudes and practices in this field are unclear.

For more than 40 years, beginning in the late 1970s, parents were advised to delay introducing non-milk foods to their babies to prevent the development of food allergies. As such, the standard of care for healthcare providers was to instruct parents to avoid giving allergenic foods to their babies until they were at least one year old.

Despite this, food allergy prevalence increased significantly over the next four decades.

This prompted the Learning Early About Peanuts (LEAP) trial by du Toit et al., which aimed to determine whether introducing peanuts early or avoiding them in infancy was more effective in preventing peanut allergy. This randomized controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of early introduction.

As a result, the guidelines were modified to reflect this evidence, recommending that parents begin feeding peanut-based products to babies by 4-6 months of age, or if that was not possible, at least as early as possible.  

The question is whether parents are aware of this change in recommendation, and at what age they introduce solid foods to their babies. The current study explored parental decisions in giving first foods and the underlying reasons for their choice.

The study sample included only parents of children with at least one diagnosed food allergy, with an average child age of 6.9 years (54.8% boys, 45.2% girls).

The study included 42 parents who filled out an online survey. Almost all were mothers, and their children were, on average, seven years old. 61.9% of the children had peanut allergy and 52.4% had tree nut allergy.

Approximately 40% of children were born before 2016; the rest were later. About half of the children encountered their first foods between 4 and 5 months, and the rest later. The first food introduced was cereal, followed by vegetables, in ~55% and ~29%, respectively.

Compared to Canadian parents, American parents were significantly more likely to introduce vegetables rather than cereals as the first food, with an adjusted odds ratio of 9.62.

Guidelines in both countries include cereals and vegetables as appropriate first foods.

So few parents introduced eggs or fruits as the first food that their responses were not analyzed in statistical models due to insufficient sample size.

Healthcare provider advice was cited as the leading factor in parental decisions about when to start first foods in 72% of cases. This was followed by peer advice in 13% of cases.

There was no statistically significant difference in the age at which allergens, such as eggs or peanuts, were first introduced between children born before or after 2016. The data suggested a possible trend, although the number of early introductions in the pre-2016 group was small, limiting statistical power.

The study shows that most parents give cereals as the first food to their infants, primarily because of recommendations from healthcare providers. Despite the presence of evidence from the LEAP report, there has not been a statistically significant shift towards earlier introduction.

Parents older than 34 were more likely to introduce first foods earlier in infancy, with an unadjusted odds ratio of 2.08, but this trend did not reach statistical significance.

The study highlighted many reasons why parents delay introducing the first foods in infancy. These include a fear of provoking an allergic reaction, insufficient parental education regarding the benefits of early food introduction, a lack of access to health services, and children's non-acceptance of new foods.

While many healthcare providers across multiple regions are aware of the change in guidelines regarding first foods in infancy, this information has not been fully translated to the general population.

Healthcare providers should, therefore, take opportunities to educate parents on the advantages of beginning first foods for their infants by 4-6 months or whenever the infant can tolerate it. They should present evidence that this practice decreases the risk of food allergies, disproving earlier recommendations that supported avoidance.

The study also evaluated factors such as caregiver education level and household income, but found no statistically significant association between these factors and the timing or type of the first food introduced.

Conclusions

Despite its limitations, the current study suggests that healthcare providers should guide parents in introducing foods to their babies early, based on evidence of its benefits in reducing the risk of food allergy.

However, the study's small sample size, reliance on caregiver memory, and predominance of mothers limit the applicability of the findings to a broader audience.

A larger sample size and more objective data would increase the value of future studies and validate these findings.

After the U.S. Women's National Team victory over China PR, Sam Coffey intentionally sought out Naomi Girma to give her a hug of celebration but also one of gratitude.

Coffey, the USA's defensive midfielder, is one of many happy to have Girma on the backline after nagging injuries kept the young defender out of commission internationally in 2025.

“Having her on the field is like having a security blanket and just being wrapped in it,” Coffey said. “... I can't put into words what she means to this team.”

Head coach Emma Hayes echoed how valuable it was to have the center back on her side again.

The backline of Girma, Avery Patterson, Emily Sonnett and Crystal Dunn helped hold No. 17 FIFA-ranked China scoreless, and for the most part, far from the U.S. goal. It was the 26th shutout Girma has contributed to as a USWNT starter.

In the post-game press conference, Hayes that Girma told her that seeing the fans cheering for the U.S. team as the bus rolled into the stadium reminded her just how much she missed playing for the National Team.

“She's a world-class player, and you can see that,” Hayes said. “I thought she brought something to our performance I've been looking for, so I'm delighted we have her back.”

At 24 years old and despite having just 45 caps, Girma returned to the USWNT as a full-fledged veteran as Hayes continues to develop younger players as larger tournaments like the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics draw closer.

Girma will be charged with helping players like Patterson acclimate to the international game. The Houston Dash defender earned just her third cap and made her second start in the friendly win.

“It just feels good to be back on the field with this group and playing with a lot of players, some I've never played with and some I haven't played with in six months,” Girma said.“So, just good to get that rhythm again.”

Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce is a player who hadn't played with Girma yet, although the two are more than familiar as Women's Super League rivals with their clubs Manchester United and Chelsea FC. They recently met in the FA Women's Cup Final where Girma (along with fellow USWNT teammate Catarina Macario) and Chelsea took home the trophy.

Tullis-Joyce, who earned her second start and clean sheet, was grateful to have Girma on her side this time around. Tullis-Joyce and Girma began their new relationship as teammates in camp in Minnesota, and the ‘keeper quickly noted Girma's leadership and how articulate the defender was as the two bounced ideas off each other.

To no one's surprise, Girma has picked up right where she left off at the end of 2024.

“It does feel natural now,” Girma said. “I was able to watch what we did before, and I think a lot of what Emma wants to do is layer on what we had done in the past year. So, I think the changes are good and easy for me to adapt to with that base knowledge of how we want to play. It was just nice to be back on the field.”

And just as much as she missed the team, they missed her, too. They'll get another chance to develop chemistry with Girma again when the U.S. takes on Jamaica on June 3rd in St. Louis, Mo. (7 p.m. CT / 8 p.m. ET on TNT, Max, Universo and Peacock in Spanish and Westwood One Sports on radio).

“I think everybody sees it on the field, but off the field as well,” Coffey said. “She's just a joy in this environment and such a light for us, and we have missed her so much.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","U.S. soccer have a star in the making with lightning-quick Alyssa Thompson","https://olympics.com/en/news/alyssa-thompson-uswnt-star-in-the-making-soccer-uswnt","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 15:46:00 GMT","

On course for her best club campaign, the 20-year-old is beginning to prove why the USWNT have another potential star player on their hands. 

At 20 years old, Alyssa Thompson has the world at her feet.

For years now, she has been touted as the future of the United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT).

But as far as she - and those around her - are concerned, the future is now.

After scoring her first international goal last October, Thompson has broken free of anything holding her back, skyrocketing her status as one of the best forwards in the NWSL this term.

Just nine games in and the Angel City star is on course for a season's best campaign in her third year in the league.

Alyssa has found the back of the net five times and assisted her teammates twice, one of which was to set up her sister Gisele, the two playing alongside one another.

Her best return prior came in 2024, also scoring on five occasions, assisting seven.

Thompson's club form is electric, and now she's challenging that energy into the national team, stepping up in the absence of key forwards Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith, and Mallory Swanson.

With an assist in their latest 3-0 win over People's Republic of China, it seems the American wonderkid is seizing her opportunity with both hands, and lightning-fast feet.

Alyssa Thompson provided an assist in the USWNT's win over the People's Republic of China.

Alyssa Thompson's rise is not sudden. It has always been a matter of when, not if.

Having been involved with the national team for several years now, even featuring at the 2023 Women's World Cup, her first taste of a major tournament made missing out on the Paris 2024 Olympics roster all the more painful.

By her own admission, the winger was not the best forward Emma Hayes had at her disposal at the time, though it didn't make missing out any easier to accept.

It was undoubtedly a blow to her confidence, the fact of having time on her side providing little comfort. But she found guidance from someone who knew exactly how she was feeling in Christen Press.

Press is one of several veterans to take her compatriot under their wing while playing together in California. The 36-year-old is a figure of resilience, fighting her way back to the sport through difficult injuries among other setbacks.

“I've always looked up to her,” Thompson told Just Women's Sports.

“As an older sister, I feel like I crave some advice because I feel like I've always done everything first for my sisters.

“It's just been really nice getting to know her as a person and I feel like I've learned so much from her.”

Their connection transcends just admiration, though. The pair often will put in extra time training, doing shooting drills - the Christen Press school of finishing, their teammate Madison Hammond joked.

Not only has it reaffirmed the belief Thompson has in her ability mentally, it has also shown visibly on the pitch. Small changes, like her first touch before shooting, has elevated her abilities and contributed to the fine form she is in of late.

“Knowing that she is [saying] ‘you can score, I believe in you', really gives me a lot of confidence,” Thompson added.

“Like yeah, if you believe in me, what can I not do?”

Those words alone, from someone who has been there before, have had the power to transform doubt into determination.

Alyssa Thompson for Angel City in the NWSL.

Thompson's form has not gone unnoticed. She is making it increasingly difficult for Hayes not to include her in full strength national team rosters, let alone current ones.

Perhaps more impressively, is that the Los Angeles native has proven that she isn't just there to make up the numbers, but rather she can contribute effectively to the team when called upon.

“Beyond their determination and their drive to be the very best, I love the way they reflect on what they need, and then they work at trying to put that in place,” the U.S. head coach said of the Thompson sisters.

“They don't feel at any point they've made it, and they keep looking for that little extra yard, whatever it is, to keep improving – they're very different players, but I think they have the qualities that the team are looking for.

“I think Alyssa has been easily one of the best players in the NWSL this year.”

Such is her desire to become a better player, the elder of the sibling duo has absorbed every bit of what her national team coach has asked of her.

Two months ago, at the SheBelieves Cup, Hayes believed it would take half a dozen experiences with the player to get to a point where they began moving forward. While their hand may have been forced with notable absentees, the youngster has shown she is very capable to rise to the occasion.

Thompson has demonstrated that setbacks don't define a career – even this early on – it's how you bounce back that does.","{'href': 'https://olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics.com'}","soccer"

ALAJUELA, Costa Rica – The U.S. U-20 Women's National Team dominated Puerto Rico to win 3-1 in its second Group A match at the Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship.

The win guaranteed the USA a top two finish in the group and the berth to the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup that goes along with it. The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will be held from September 5–27 next year in Poland.

The USA will finish group play on June 3 against Costa Rica (4 p.m. ET on FS2) with a win or a tie clinching first place in the group.

U.S. head coach Carrie Kveton made nine changes to the starting XI from the USA's 8-0 opening game win over Guyana – center back Abby Mills and forward Mya Townes were the only holdovers — but it mattered little. The USA scored in the fourth minute and never looked back, dominating the match while out-shooting Puerto Rico 24-3 overall and 8-1 in shots on goal.

The first goal came from a somewhat unlikely source, right back Kate Scott. The ball was worked well from the left to the right and Townes fed Scott with a square pass just above the right side of the penalty area. A sliding Puerto Rico defender could not quite get her toe on the ball, and it rolled to Scott, who took a great prep touch and smashed her shot from just outside the penalty box into the left side of the net for the early goal. It was Scott's first goal at the U-20 level. She also had one goal at the U-17 level.

Puerto Rico's only chance of the first half came in the sixth minute when a long ball behind the U.S. defense led to some confusion between goalkeeper Keally Titmuss and Scott, who smashed into each other as Titmuss raced out of her net, leaving an open goal for Puerto Rico striker Susana Roberts. Scott recovered and threw her body to the ground block Roberts' initial shot and then Roberts sent her second chance over an open net.

Forward Mary Long then doubled the lead in the 24th minute when she timed her run to stay onside by a slim margin and raced in on goal off a through ball from Scott. Long held off her defender and finished under duress from six yards out as she tumbled to the ground to make it 2-0.

Long scored her second goal in the 65th minute when she ran onto a pass from halftime substitute Linda Ullmark and shot from just above the right side of the penalty area. She used as much finesse as power to roll her shot off the left post and in from 18 yards out. The two goals were the first at the U-20 international level for Long, who scored three times at the U-17 international level.

Puerto Rico pulled one back in the 67th minute as University of Arizona striker Aurora Gaines ran onto a poor back pass by the U.S. defense and fought off three U.S. defenders on a mazy dribbling run to slot home from six yards out.

Additional Notes: 

• After 15 players earned their first U-20 caps in the first game against Guyana, five players earned their first U-20 international caps in this match: Kealey Titmuss, Kate Scott, Kennedy Ring, Mary Long and Chloe Rickets.

• Aven Alverez earned her team leading fourth U-20 international cap when she came on in the 84th minute.

• Scott, who hails from Pennsylvania, captained the U.S. U-20s for the first time.

The first jersey auction from US Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team.

The U.S. Soccer Federation, United States National Soccer Team Players Association (USNSTPA) and United States Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA) have announced a partnership with MatchWornShirt, a global leader in the sports memorabilia market.

As per the deal, the company has become their official match-worn auction platform. The agreement represents MatchWornShirt's official U.S. launch and an important turning point in the company's growth trajectory and expansion, providing real-time access to signed, game-worn jerseys from the United States Men's and Women's National Teams.

The first jersey auction from U.S. Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) during their recent back-to-back games against Brazil. On May 31, 2025, a fresh auction started at kickoff when the USWNT faced China.

This summer, MatchWornShirt will hold further auctions showcasing players' jerseys from the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) throughout its 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign.

Mark Levinstein, Executive Director of the Players Association of the U.S. Men's National Team Players, said, “Owning a match-worn jersey is holding a living fragment of U.S. Soccer history. The jerseys carry the energy, emotion, and dedication of the players who have spent their lives to earn the opportunity to wear them, and tell a story of hard-fought battles, unforgettable moments, and the pride of representing an entire nation on the global stage. Fans and collectors can connect directly to the legacy of the USMNT.”

Lilian Bours, Chief Marketing Officer of MatchWornShirt, said, “The energy around sports memorabilia in the U.S. has never been higher – and soccer in America is entering a golden era. We're thrilled to give American soccer fans unprecedented access to their National Teams, deepening the emotional connection to their favorite players and celebrating the game's most iconic moments. We turn matchdays into memories – in wearable and collectible form.”

Tijmen Zonderwijk, CEO and Co-founder of MatchWornShirt, commented, “What started as one small auction in the Netherlands has now grown into a global community, and we are excited to bring that same trusted experience to fans in the U.S., starting with their beloved men's and women's national teams.”

Hello! The European club season may have come to a close with Paris Saint-Germain's win in the UEFA Champions League final on Saturday but there is still plenty of soccer to watch this summer. I'm Pardeep Cattry with a preview of what's to come.

All times U.S./Eastern

Tuesday, June 3🇪🇺 UWNL: Spain vs. England, 1 p.m. ➡️ CBS Sports Network, Paramount+🌎 Friendly: USWNT vs. Jamaica, 8 p.m. ➡️ TNT

The U.S. women's national team kicked off the international break with a 3-0 win over China on Saturday, one that showcased the strides that Emma Hayes' young team are making as the era of experimentation continues.

Saturday's win offered another glimpse at a new-look version of the USWNT, one where the pieces are beginning to fall into place after months of work together. The group easily unlocked China's high line over the course of the match, with Catarina Macario among the standouts after notching a goal and an assist. Hayes attributed the dominant performance to the work the team has done over the last several months, one that has come with a learning curve that has begun to subside.

The USWNT's attacking trio on Saturday, featuring a front line of Macario, Alyssa Thompson and Michelle Cooper, filled in nicely as Hayes explores her attacking options as all three members of triple espresso – Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilason – remain unavailable. Hayes has other players available to her for Tuesday's match against Jamaica, including fellow youngsters Ally Sentnor and Emma Sears and veteran Lynn Biyendolo. Whatever combination she opts for in the upcoming match, though, she did identify some areas of improvement for a relatively young group as they continue in the lengthy buildup to the 2027 Women's World Cup.

While the offseason is in sight, or already underway, for a chunk of the world's best players, there is still plenty of soccer on the schedule over the next two months. A first-of-its-kind summer of soccer awaits, one with several high-stakes matches on the schedule.

World Cup qualifying resumes

June 11 marks the one year mark before the 2026 World Cup, a tournament that will be top of mind for several national teams as they look to book a spot at the 48 team tournament in North America next summer. Four nations – Japan, New Zealand, iran and Argentina – have already joined the three host nations, while a handful of other teams could join them before the month is over.

While some confederations are several months into their qualifying campaigns, Europe is still in the early stages of their qualification tournament. A handful of high-profile teams will play their first qualifiers this month, a list that includes previous World Cup winners Germany, Spain, France and Italy. Luciano Spaletti's Italy will be a team to watch during UEFA's qualifying run since they have missed the last two editions of the World Cup, especially surprising since they won the Euros in 2021.

New-look Club World Cup gets underway

Meanwhile, 32 clubs from around the world are in the final stages of preparation for the newly expanded version of the Club World Cup. The U.S.-set tournament begins on June 14 and will feature new Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, as well as fellow European heavyweights Real Madrid and Chelsea and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami. The field now officially includes MLS' LAFC, who won a play-in match against Club America on Saturday to take the final spot in the competition.

How exactly each team will approach this competition is a big question and seems likely to vary from squad to squad. Al-Hilal, the club owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, may go all out by recruiting Al-Nassr's Cristiano Ronaldo but will only have until June 10 to get a deal done. It is unclear how the European clubs will handle this tournament considering it is the final stage of a demanding season that began last August and could run until July 13, should they reach the final.

Women's Euro returns in July

This summer's major international tournament will take place in Switzerland, where 16 teams will compete in the Women's Euro. England enter the competition as the reigning champions, winning on home soil in 2022 during a tournament that set records for attendance and viewership, though there have been some dynamic shifts in Europe since. Chief among them is the rapid transformation of Spain, who were a team with potential but no history of deep runs in major competitions and exited in the quarterfinals after a loss to the hosts. A year later, Spain beat England in the Women's World Cup final and will arrive in Switzerland as the favorites to win the whole thing. 

Hopes will still be high for England, though they will be without goalkeeper Mary Earps after she suddenly announced her international retirement last month. Earps had lost a starting role in recent months to Chelsea's Hannah Hampton, who has been the expected starter at the Euros for some time.

The first jersey auction from US Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team.

The U.S. Soccer Federation, United States National Soccer Team Players Association (USNSTPA) and United States Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA) have announced a partnership with MatchWornShirt, a global leader in the sports memorabilia market.

As per the deal, the company has become their official match-worn auction platform. The agreement represents MatchWornShirt's official U.S. launch and an important turning point in the company's growth trajectory and expansion, providing real-time access to signed, game-worn jerseys from the United States Men's and Women's National Teams.

The first jersey auction from U.S. Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) during their recent back-to-back games against Brazil. On May 31, 2025, a fresh auction started at kickoff when the USWNT faced China.

This summer, MatchWornShirt will hold further auctions showcasing players' jerseys from the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) throughout its 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign.

Mark Levinstein, Executive Director of the Players Association of the U.S. Men's National Team Players, said, “Owning a match-worn jersey is holding a living fragment of U.S. Soccer history. The jerseys carry the energy, emotion, and dedication of the players who have spent their lives to earn the opportunity to wear them, and tell a story of hard-fought battles, unforgettable moments, and the pride of representing an entire nation on the global stage. Fans and collectors can connect directly to the legacy of the USMNT.”

Lilian Bours, Chief Marketing Officer of MatchWornShirt, said, “The energy around sports memorabilia in the U.S. has never been higher – and soccer in America is entering a golden era. We're thrilled to give American soccer fans unprecedented access to their National Teams, deepening the emotional connection to their favorite players and celebrating the game's most iconic moments. We turn matchdays into memories – in wearable and collectible form.”

Tijmen Zonderwijk, CEO and Co-founder of MatchWornShirt, commented, “What started as one small auction in the Netherlands has now grown into a global community, and we are excited to bring that same trusted experience to fans in the U.S., starting with their beloved men's and women's national teams.”

The U.S. men's national team is set to play in its last remaining competitive tournament before co-hosting the World Cup in 2026, and the vibes could not be much worse.

Even head coach Mauricio Pochettino is speaking out about it.

When the USMNT announced the rosters for the Gold Cup, the notable absences of stars like Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah sparked an uproar among U.S. soccer fans. The team was already going to be shorthanded with several key players tied into Club World Cup duties, so it seemed imperative for the best remaining players to take advantage of the last extended camp together for the next year.

Pulisic — citing the need for rest — saw it differently. And that led to Pochettino pointing out the contrasting mentality global superstars take to national team duty. He said that players he's coached like Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane were all ""desperate"" to play for their national teams.

Pochettino said in a podcast appearance with former USMNT stars Landon Donovan and Tim Howard:

""Today, we have plenty of players playing abroad for USA. But the most important thing is the culture we saw in you (Tim Howard and Landon Donovan), that to be desperate to come and be the priority - the national team. ... Even Messi, even Neymar, even Mbappe for France. We were working with these guys, Harry Kane. These guys are desperate to go to the national team. And for them, when they go, they don't see if it's a friendly game. It's an official game. It's a World Cup. It doesn't matter. Because the possibility to defend one time more, your flag, your shirt, I want to feel proud about that. And that it the responsibility of us to translate.""

Those comments appeared to be an obvious jab at Pulisic, Robinson and others for viewing the Gold Cup as not worth their time. And sure, the Gold Cup has been relegated to a developmental tournament in recent years in light of the CONCACAF Nations League. But Pochettino wants to see a culture of players who look at USMNT duty as an honor regardless of the tournament or competition.

That mentality had clearly been lost among this current generation of players despite the immense individual talent. And Pochettino is running out of time to reinstate it.","{'href': 'https://ftw.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

The current United States men's national team camp will be the longest time that Mauricio Pochettino will have the squad together since taking over in September of 2024, but he'll be without even more first team players with Folarin Balogun, DeJuan Jones, and Sean Zawadzki all leaving USMNT camp with injuries. Waker Zimmerman, Nathan Harriel, and Paxten Aaronson have replaced them in the roster for friendlies facing Türkiye and Switzerland ahead of the Gold Cup.

Monaco man Balogun has picked up an ankle injury, which will prevent him from making his first appearance under Pochettino during his tenure. Balogun was out with a shoulder injury when the Argentine was appointed, and now will begin another camp without the top striker in the roster. Balogun won't be the only star missing as Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, and Gio Reyna are also absent.

With the Club World Cup taking place this summer, some players have club obligations that prevent them from taking part in international duty, while Pulisic wasn't named so that he can get rest during the summer. If this were a standard Gold Cup, the absence of stars wouldn't raise many eyebrows due to it being a tournament that favors domestic talent, but with the men's World Cup next summer, this is the last competitive tournament that the USMNT will have ahead of time due to not needing to take part in World Cup qualifying.

Add that in with it being the most time that Pochettino has spent with the first team and it could be a great chance to move past Concacaf Nations League disappointment, where the USMNT not only saw Mexico lift the trophy but also fell in the third place game to Canada as well. There needs to be improvement under Pochettino, it will be tougher to come by if he's not able to get the USMNT core up to speed with his style. 

Balogun's absence presents big opportunities to Patrick Agyemang and Brian White, but if the forwards in camp can't find their scoring touch, the malaise of the team will continue.

...

The FIFA Club World Cup will take place in the United States, from June 14 to July 13.

Brazilian football will be represented by Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense, and Palmeiras.

For the tournament, which is expected to be held every four years, FIFA has opened a specific ""transfer window"" from June 1 to June 10.

So, how are Brazilian clubs planning to act in the market with the Club World Cup in mind?

Botafogo



After breaking off with Wendel, from Zenit, with negotiations practically closed, the Glorioso is racing against time to strengthen its squad.

Especially since they are expected to negotiate Igor Jesus, Jair, and Cuiabano with the same club, Nottingham Forest.

If there is no specific name in the spotlight, Botafogo's SAF strategy, through owner John Textor, is to invest in young and promising players, but also in athletes whose contracts are ending.

A center-back, midfielder, and right winger would be the priorities for Botafogo's scouting team.

Álvaro Montoro, an 18-year-old midfielder from Vélez, is reportedly on their radar.

Flamengo



Despite having the most valuable squad in South America and probably one of the most qualified, the Rubro-Negro is also expected to strengthen its team.

The Italo-Brazilian midfielder Jorginho, for example, has said goodbye to Arsenal and is practically signed, likely to be announced soon.

However, José Boto – the club's football director – recently stated that there are ""defined targets,"" although he did not reveal any names.

""I want to let the fans know that the entire process of monitoring, selection, and internal discussion is already finished. We have identified our targets and have already entered the negotiation phase with them so that they can come as soon as possible to join us and make the squad even stronger than it already is,"" said Boto, in an interview with FlaTV at the end of May.

A ""shadow"" for Arrascaeta and wingers are among Flamengo's priorities.

Fluminense



The Tricolor das Laranjeiras has ""ambitious"" plans for the mid-year transfer window.

According to president Mário Bittencourt, Fluminense will seek reinforcements with the entire second half of the year in mind, not just the Club World Cup, although there is an expectation for the arrival of ""two or three names.""

""It would not be honest, intelligent, or professional on our part to think only of reinforcements for the Club World Cup. We are thinking of reinforcements for the Club World Cup, for the Copa Sudamericana, for the Copa do Brasil... To strengthen the team and try to become champions again this year,"" said the Tricolor president to O Globo.

Midfielders and forwards would be the targets for the Tricolor, but specific names have not yet been revealed.

""I estimate that (we will bring in) between two and three players, especially those who are more aggressive from an attacking point of view. If there is an opportunity to bring in a (big-name) player who will increase our brand exposure, we will obviously try to do so within Fluminense's means,"" concluded the president.

Palmeiras



Leader of the Brasileirão and with a 100% record in the Conmebol Libertadores group stage, Verdão has one of the best squads in the country.

However, for the Club World Cup, coach Abel Ferreira does not want a specific reinforcement.

According to the Portuguese coach, what Palmeiras needs is a replacement for Estêvão, who will transfer to Chelsea in the second half of the year.

""I don't want any player just to play in the Club World Cup. I have the players I want and when Estêvão leaves I hope to have a replacement for his position. I would be lying if I said the team will be stronger with his departure, but I will find solutions,"" said Abel Ferreira, in a press conference after the 6-0 win over Sporting Cristal in midweek.

Lionel Messi will wear his Argentina shirt again for two matches with his beloved national team in the next 10 days, before leading Inter Miami in the FIFA Club World Cup.

Messi arrived in Argentina on Monday morning to rejoin the defending World Cup champions for qualifying matches for the 2026 tournament.

""¡Buenos días, capitán!"" or ""good morning, captain"" was the caption on a photo of Messi arriving to Argentina's headquarters.

Argentina will visit Chile on June 5 at 9 p.m. ET at Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos in Santiago, Chile. Then, Argentina will host Colombia – a battle between the 2024 Copa America finalists – on June 10 at 8 p.m. ET inside Mâs Monumental in Buenos Aires.

Both matches fall during a FIFA international break between the MLS season and before the Club World Cup. 

Messi is coming off one of his best stretches during the 2025 MLS season, scoring five goals in his last three matches, helping Inter Miami improve from sixth to third place in the MLS Eastern Conference.

Messi has traditionally played with the national team when healthy as a member of Inter Miami – including two matches before the MLS Cup playoffs last season. These two matches could be no different despite the timing.

Messi and Inter Miami will star in the Club World Cup opening match on June 14 against Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. They will also play against FC Porto (Portugal) in Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 19, and return to Miami for their final group stage match against SE Palmeiras (Brazil) on June 23.

Playing with Argentina before the MLS Cup playoffs last year, Messi was scoreless in a 1-1 draw against Venezuela on Oct. 11, 2024, then exploded with a hat trick and two assists in a 6-0 victory over Bolivia on Oct. 15, 2024.

Messi last played with the national team in November: He was scoreless as Argentina lost 2-1 to Paraguay on Nov. 14, 2024, and had the assist to Lautaro Martinez in a 1-0 win over Peru on Nov. 19, 2024.

Messi was unable to play with Argentina in matches against Uruguay and Brazil this March, while he was recovering from an adductor strain. Argentina beat Uruguay 1-0 on March 21, and beat Brazil 4-1 on March 25.

Argentina has two more World Cup qualifiers later this year: They will host Venezuela on Sept. 9, and visit Ecuador on Sept. 14.

Messi has yet to declare whether he will play for Argentina for World Cup 2026, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

Seattle Sounders players took the field ahead of their match against Minnesota United Sunday night wearing protest T-shirts, expressing their disapproval of their potential prize money allocation for the upcoming Club World Cup. The Sounders, along with Inter Miami and — after Saturday night's play-in win over Club América — LAFC, will participate in the tournament, which kicks off on June 14.

Seattle players warmed up for the match wearing shirts emblazoned with a pair of slogans: “Club World Ca$h Grab” and “Fair Share Now.” The Emerald City Supporters, the primary supporters' group of the Sounders, joined the protest as well, chanting the slogans along with a more pointed message: “you dirty greedy bastards.”

All three MLS clubs taking part in the tournament will receive $9.55 million simply for qualifying, the standard allocation set aside by FIFA for any club from Concacaf. That sum grows as teams advance through the tournament, with teams earning $2 million for every win and $1 million for a draw. Simply advancing out of the tournament's group stage would garner another $7.5 million. It is a potentially massive windfall for any MLS team, many of whom lose money every year.

Players, though, are only guaranteed a fraction of that prize pool. The collective bargaining agreement between MLS and its players stipulates specific bonus payouts for tournaments that MLS players typically compete in, like the U.S. Open Cup, Concacaf Champions Cup and Leagues Cup. Their share of the prize pool from tournaments which aren't specifically addressed is capped at $1 million. The Club World Cup was still years from being announced when the CBA was ratified in 2021.

Player payouts in other leagues vary, and Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei addressed the disparity with The Seattle Times in March.

“If you're going to be on the field and playing against an opponent that's making $700,000 for the same appearance, then you're asking yourself, ‘Did we earn the right to play in this game?' If so, I'm not asking for $700,000, but it's a big, big, big difference,” Frei said.

The MLSPA, the labor union that represents MLS players, released its own statement on Sunday, expressing support for Seattle's cause and touching on long-standing concerns with the physical workload placed on MLS players by the sport's ever-expanding schedule.

“FIFA's new tournament piles on to players' ever-increasing workload without regard to their physical well-being. In order to seize this additional calendar territory, FIFA had to commit historic amounts of prize money to secure club and player participation. As a result, MLS will receive an unprecedented windfall. Despite this windfall, the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players themselves.”

The statement also says that the MLSPA's members have “privately and respectfully” invited the league to discuss a potential renegotiation of bonus terms for the Club World Cup but says the league has simply referred them to the terms of the CBA.

“It is the players who make the game possible,” read the statement. “It is the players who are lifting MLS up on the global stage. They expect to be treated fairly and with respect.”

The Sounders will play all three of their group games in the Club World Cup at home, against Botafogo, Atlético Madrid and newly crowned UEFA Champions League winner PSG.

Sounders wore shirts reading ‘Club World Ca$h Grab'

Players' union supported players with statement

The Seattle Sounders wore shirts in the warm-up for the team's game against Minnesota United on Sunday reading “Club World Ca$h Grab,” in protest over the manner in which bonuses from participating in the Club World Cup are being distributed.

Afterwards, the MLS Players Association released a statement expressing solidarity with the Sounders players who, according to the statement “demanded a fair share of Fifa Club World Cup prize money.”

“Fifa's new tournament piles on to players' ever-increasing workload without regard to their physical well-being,” the statement read, before pointing out that Fifa will pay MLS teams large amounts (about $9.5m) to participate in the tournament. “Despite this windfall, the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players themselves.”

In addition to the $9.5m for participating in the tournament, clubs earn more based on performance in the games, drawing from a Fifa prize pool of around $475m. However, the current MLS collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournament, capped at $1m for the entire team.

In effect, that makes for an initial 90/10 split of prize money, with the ratio potentially getting worse if MLS teams advance in the competition.

The MLSPA said in its statement that the players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes to the arrangement, but that the league has “failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.”

Fifa itself does not have any rules governing how teams distribute prize money between front office, players, and associated parties.

12:41 PM EDT on June 2, 2025

By sheer power of will, determination, and lots and lots and lots of money, FIFA is looking to turn the previously irrelevant Club World Cup into a quadrennial summer-time blockbuster. Traditionally, the event has been a global supercup of sorts, each year pitting the seven winners of FIFA's seven federations' continental tournaments against each other in a brief, midseason contest that virtually nobody really cared about. This month will bring the inaugural edition of the new-look CWC, a 32-team behemoth that will cram an already over-stuffed soccer calendar with yet another competition that nobody asked for.

It will take a lot of work to make this tournament into something fans care about. For the players and clubs involved, however, there are hundreds of millions of reasons why they're willing to cut into their already vanishingly small rest and recovery time to try their damnedest to win. In its effort to make this whole thing matter, FIFA has filled the prize pool with ungodly sums of money, enticing participants with lucrative payouts that can rise up to $125 million for the winners. That's almost one Florian Wirtz, if reports are to be believed, which should ensure that clubs like Real Madrid—who just paid Liverpool €10 million to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold early enough for him to play in the group stage of the CWC—and freshly crowned Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will provide a good showing.

For the smaller clubs in the competition, the outlandish prize pool is even more of an incentive to dive in headfirst, as making it to the round of 16 could be worth upwards of $20 million total. For clubs, this financial windfall could prove invaluable in filling the coffers and helping improve rosters and facilities. For players, getting a cut of the prize money could make for their biggest paychecks of the whole year.

But lo, what misshapen beast looms on the horizon, hobbling over to mess up the rest of our soccer fun? Why, MLS, of course! Seattle Sounders players are in the midst of a public battle with the league over the split of the CWC prize pool that players would receive, thanks to old collective bargaining agreement terms that date back before the newfangled CWC took shape.

While the MLS CBA has specific carveouts for the established non-league tournaments—such as the U.S. Open Cup, the Champions Cup, and the Leagues Cup—the CWC, as Sounder at Heart points out, would fall into a narrowly capped catch-all clause:

(v) Compulsory Tournament/Non-Compulsory Tournament: If an MLS Team or MLS receives prize money by virtue of the Team's performance and/or participation in a Compulsory Tournament or Non-Compulsory Tournament (other than the tournaments set forth above i.e., USOC, Canadian Championship, CCL, Campeones Cup, Leagues Cup), Players competing in that tournament will receive the following:

(a) If the Team or MLS receives prize money, fifty percent (50%) of such prize money up to a maximum payment to the Players (collectively) of $1,000,000 per tournament.

This likely would not be an issue in previous iterations of the Club World Cup, but with the money FIFA is throwing at this new format, the $1 million cap on player earnings becomes more egregious, since entry into the tournament itself comes with almost $10 million. Even if the Sounders crash out with three straight losses, earning no additional prize money, the players could only receive roughly 10 percent of that initial bonus. This, as one can imagine, has not gone over well with the players.

Ahead a league match against Minnesota on Sunday, Sounders players took to the pitch wearing t-shirts that read ""Club World Cash Grab,"" while fans in the stands, already among the most vocal in MLS, chanted ""you dirty greedy bastards."" Yikes! The MLS Players Association has also come out in support. In a statement released on Sunday, the MLSPA accused the league of not bringing forward a ""reasonable proposal"" in response to player demands, adding that MLS often asks the MLSPA to ""deviate"" from the CBA when it suits the league but has proven unwilling to show the same kind of good faith when its the players who stand to gain.

The MLSPA and all MLS players stand united with the Seattle Sounders players who tonight demanded a fair share of the FIFA Club World Cup prize money. #FairShareNow #FIFACWC

The player complaints makes even more sense when considering what a good performance could mean financially. Despite drawing a tough group featuring PSG and Atlético Madrid, the Sounders could earn up to $13.5 million just from that stage of the tournament (the team stands to earn $2 million per win, $1 million per draw, and $7.5 million if it advances into the round of 16). Capping the players' collective cut of that at a maximum of $1 million is a spit in the face.

MLS players have an extra consideration when it comes to the Club World Cup. Unlike, say, PSG players, who have no other games besides CWC games until the domestic season starts back up in France in August, the CWC is taking place right in the middle of the MLS season. It's possible that participation in the CWC will hurt these teams in the back half of the MLS season and therefore hurt the players' earning potential; even if it doesn't, the tournament will put added stress on the players' bodies. In a league that constantly twists itself and its rules into knots looking to get what it wants, it's no surprise to see MLS suddenly turn rigid when players come asking for what's fair.

Manchester City have opted against including James McAtee in their squad for the Club World Cup as their neighbours Manchester United continue to circle. The snub could prove telling as the academy graduate weighs up his future.

City will jet halfway across the world to play in the tournament but won't go with McAtee, who instead has been added to England's pre-tournament training squad ahead of the U21s Euros in Slovakia.

McAtee has enjoyed moments in a City shirt, but is still very much establishing himself. He scored an FA Cup hat-trick several months ago and has also contributed in the Premier League, but won't get the chance to rub shoulders with the squad's senior stars at the FIFA tournament.

As a result potential suitors are beginning to circle and one of those is the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move, especially as McAtee is tipped to have a bright future.

The Daily Mail reports that Guardiola's decision to overlook him could spell the end of his time on the blue side of Manchester. The Catalan has been honest about the state of affairs and whilst he wants to keep the 22-year-old, he would understand his desire to play regularly.

He said in April: “For the age, I'd like him to stay. But I understand players want more minutes. He can play different positions but I don't know how the squad will be and we will see.”

Another factor at play is that McAtee's contract expires in 2026 - leaving the City hierarchy to either hand him a new deal or cash in before he becomes a free agent. The academy graduate has excelled on loan in the Championship previously, but would command a higher move were he to head away from the Etihad.

McAtee himself is keen on a move to the Bundesliga, where he's been linked with the likes of Bayer Leverkusen. He's seen first-hand how young English players have thrived in the Germany environment with Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham among them.

Letting McAtee leave would represent a risk for Guardiola, who has copped criticism for allowing City's academy products to leave before giving them a proper shot. Several of them have gone on to excel elsewhere, Morgan Rogers among them.

Seattle Sounders take on a monster of a group at the Club World Cup.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kicks off on June 14th, and 32 teams will embark on a quest to lift the Club World Cup trophy in the first edition of an expanded format. With the match being hosted in the United States, the team payouts are higher and the stakes are higher for the teams involved as they hope to prove they are the best club in the world.

Group B is a strong group that now contains 3 continental champions with Paris Saint-Germain winning the UEFA Champions League, and the group has the ability to get multiple teams through to the semifinals. We take a look at the teams in this group and who could emerge as the favorites to move through to the knockout stage. 

League: Ligue 1 (France)How they qualified: 2nd best UEFA team in 4-year ranking

Top Players

On a team full of stars, Ousmane Dembélé shined the brightest this past season, with 33 goals across all competitions. However, Gianluigi Donnarumma's continued world class play between the posts could be the difference for PSG.

Team Synopsis

PSG was one of the best teams in the world this year, winning Ligue 1 and the Champions League on the way to a treble. And thanks to that Champions League win, they have qualified for the 2029 edition of the FIFA Club World Cup. Before they think ahead, they will first want to cap off the 2024-25 season with this major trophy and complete their quest to become the undisputed best club in the world. Can they play defense when it counts? That will prove to be the determining factor.

League: La Liga (Spain)How they qualified: 6th best UEFA team in 4-year ranking

Top Players

﻿Julian Alvarez had a dynamite season for Atleti on the offensive end, while Jan Oblak between the posts makes Atleti a tough out for anyone.

Team Synopsis

Atlético Madrid is consistently one of the strongest teams in Europe, but they fell short of winning in every competition this season. Still, in any tournament they are strong and built to withstand a lot of pressure. With the stars in their lineup, they can get production from just about anyone. Their major deficiency is that sometimes they get too lazy and that's when quality teams can beat them.

League: Brasileiro Serie A (Brazil)How they qualified: 2024 Copa Libertadores winners

Top Players

﻿Alex Telles is experienced and has helped lead Botafogo. He will be a main focus for their game model. Igor Jesus has produced well this season so far for the club, and they will count on him to continue to score goals during this tournament.

Team Synopsis

Botafogo's owner, American John Textor, wants badly for his club to make a statement in the Club World Cup. And, Botafogo's got the ability to shock a team and win a game or two. However, with this group they are going to have to level up tremendously to compete with the two European clubs in the group.

League: Major League Soccer (USA)How they qualified: 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winners

Top Players

﻿Albert Rusnák has been a tremendous pickup for the Sounders, and they will rely on his production. Nouhou Tolo has African Cup of Nations experience and he will have to help the defense remain intact.

Team Synopsis

The Sounders may be the best MLS team in the tournament, and head coach Brian Schmetzer always has his team organized and ready. They learned quite a bit from their experience at the 2023 Club World Cup, but they will need to really elevate their game if they want to have a good showing in front of the home fans at Lumen Field.

Group B should be one where PSG and Atlético Madrid pace the rest. Seattle and Botafogo will have a difficult time getting traction in this group when they have to face the firepower that the European teams have. A factor that could make things more intriguing would be if Botafogo follows though on their desire to bring in some quality players during the special transfer window. Maybe one of the teams could pull off the upset, but this group is set up for PSG and Atleti to advance.

When FIFA says “jump,” the proprietors of NFL stadiums don't even ask how high.

Seattle's Lumen Field will host six games of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. During which it won't be known as Lumen Field, because of FIFA rules relating to stadium sponsorships.

Via multiple reports, the venue will undergo $19.4 million in upgrades to make it suitable for the top tournament in international soccer.

The biggest requirement is natural grass. This will require irrigation, vacuum ventilation, and grow lights. 

Also, FIFA rules require a full complement of individual seats with backs. The bleachers in the “Hawks Nest” currently does not. For the World Cup matches, they will.

The good news for Seahawks fans is that the backs will remain for NFL games.

Every stadium that will host FIFA World Cup games must have a grass playing surface. It's one of the great hypocrisies of NFL ownership. 

NFL players overwhelmingly prefer playing on grass. The owners won't do it for them. But they won't hesitate to do it for FIFA.

Lionel Messi will wear his Argentina shirt again for two matches with his beloved national team in the next 10 days, before leading Inter Miami in the FIFA Club World Cup.

Messi arrived in Argentina on Monday morning to rejoin the defending World Cup champions for qualifying matches for the 2026 tournament.

""¡Buenos días, capitán!"" or ""good morning, captain"" was the caption on a photo of Messi arriving to Argentina's headquarters.

Argentina will visit Chile on June 5 at 9 p.m. ET at Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos in Santiago, Chile. Then, Argentina will host Colombia – a battle between the 2024 Copa America finalists – on June 10 at 8 p.m. ET inside Mâs Monumental in Buenos Aires.

Both matches fall during a FIFA international break between the MLS season and before the Club World Cup. 

Messi is coming off one of his best stretches during the 2025 MLS season, scoring five goals in his last three matches, helping Inter Miami improve from sixth to third place in the MLS Eastern Conference.

Messi has traditionally played with the national team when healthy as a member of Inter Miami – including two matches before the MLS Cup playoffs last season. These two matches could be no different despite the timing.

Messi and Inter Miami will star in the Club World Cup opening match on June 14 against Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. They will also play against FC Porto (Portugal) in Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 19, and return to Miami for their final group stage match against SE Palmeiras (Brazil) on June 23.

Playing with Argentina before the MLS Cup playoffs last year, Messi was scoreless in a 1-1 draw against Venezuela on Oct. 11, 2024, then exploded with a hat trick and two assists in a 6-0 victory over Bolivia on Oct. 15, 2024.

Messi last played with the national team in November: He was scoreless as Argentina lost 2-1 to Paraguay on Nov. 14, 2024, and had the assist to Lautaro Martinez in a 1-0 win over Peru on Nov. 19, 2024.

Messi was unable to play with Argentina in matches against Uruguay and Brazil this March, while he was recovering from an adductor strain. Argentina beat Uruguay 1-0 on March 21, and beat Brazil 4-1 on March 25.

Argentina has two more World Cup qualifiers later this year: They will host Venezuela on Sept. 9, and visit Ecuador on Sept. 14.

Messi has yet to declare whether he will play for Argentina for World Cup 2026, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Ahead of the next FIFA window, five Inter Miami CF players have been called up to represent their national teams during the June international break. The players will participate in the CONMEBOL and Concacaf World Cup qualifiers, as well as international friendlies.

Here's a look at the players and their upcoming matches.

Inter Miami CF captain Lionel Messi has been called up to represent the Argentine national team during this CONMEBOL qualifying window for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Messi and Argentina enter this window atop the standings, having already secured their place in the upcoming World Cup. La Albiceleste will visit Chile on June 5 at 9 p.m. ET in Ñuñoa, Chile, before hosting Colombia on June 10 at 8 p.m. ET in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Messi is the all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying with 34 goals in 69 matches, and he will look to add to that tally during this international window.

Midfielder Telasco Segovia will be available for Venezuela's senior national team for its two CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying matches.

La Vinotinto will play two crucial games in their quest for a first-ever World Cup qualification. First, they will host direct rivals Bolivia on June 6 at 6 p.m. ET in Maturín, Venezuela, and will wrap up the window with a visit to Uruguay on June 10 at 7 p.m. ET in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Forward Fafa Picault has been called up by the Haitian national team for the Concacaf World Cup qualifying matches.

Haiti will visit Aruba on June 7 at 5 p.m. ET in Oranjestad, Aruba, to then host Curaçao on June 10 at 6 p.m. ET in World Cup qualifying action. The Grenadiers currently sit in second place in their group, tied on six points with the Curaçao national team.

Picault has made 14 appearances for the Haitian national team, registering one goal and four assists.

Midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi has been called up to the Under-20 U.S. Men's Youth National Team for an international training camp and friendlies in Cairo, Egypt from June 2 through June 11.

After earning minutes with the senior USMNT earlier this year in matches against Venezuela and Costa Rica, Cremaschi will now represent the youth team in friendlies against the U-20 squads of Colombia on June 7 and Egypt on June 10.

Academy product Santiago Morales has been called up to represent the U.S. Under-18 Men's National Team for the upcoming UEFA Friendship Cup in Nyon, Switzerland.

Morales is part of the 20-player roster selected by Head Coach Marlon LeBlanc to compete in the prestigious eight-team tournament taking place from May 30 to June 11. The U.S. has been drawn into Group A and will face Argentina on Wednesday, June 4, and Australia on Saturday, June 7, after already playing their first match against France.

Morales scored in the opening match, helping the U-18 USMYNT earn a 2-2 draw against France and subsequently earning a penalty shootout win.

Following the group stage, Morales and the U.S. U-18s will play a placement match on Tuesday, June 10, with opponents determined by final group standings. The top team in each group will meet in the championship match, while the remaining teams will play for placement accordingly.","{'href': 'https://www.intermiamicf.com', 'title': 'Inter Miami CF'}","soccer"

 SEOUL, June 2 (Yonhap) -- With his team closing in on a spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, South Korea head coach Hong Myung-bo said Monday he will not push his banged-up captain Son Heung-min too hard in the upcoming qualifying matches.

 South Korea, 23rd in the FIFA rankings, will take on 59th-ranked Iraq at Basra International Stadium in the southern Iraqi city of Basra at 9:15 p.m. Thursday (3:15 a.m. Friday, South Korean time).

 In the third round of the Asian qualifiers, South Korea are leading Group B with 16 points from four wins and four draws. With two matches remaining, they are three points ahead of Jordan and four above Jordan.

 South Korea only need one more point to punch their ticket to the World Cup. If they don't get it done this week, South Korea will have another chance against Kuwait in Seoul on June 10.

Hong Myung-bo, head coach of the South Korean men's national football team, speaks to reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, on June 2, 2025, before departing for Iraq for a World Cup qualifying match. (Yonhap)



 And Hong said Son, who has just returned from a foot injury, will be used conservatively over the next two matches.

 Son missed about a month, from mid-April to mid-May, with that injury. He played limited minutes for Tottenham Hotspur when they defeated Manchester United for the UEFA Europa League title on May 21.

 ""He and I have not yet discussed exactly how much he will play. But my staff and I already know all about his drive and his desire to play,"" Hong told reporters at Incheon International Airport, just west of Seoul, before departing for Iraq. ""Since we have two matches coming up (to try to qualify for the World Cup), I will not push him too hard. Once we get to Iraq, we will decide which of the two matches we will focus on.""

 Even if Son doesn't play big minutes in Iraq this week, Hong said veterans, such as Son, can also help the team in other areas.

 ""We will probably play in a hostile environment in front of partisan fans,"" the coach said. ""We have some players who have had experience playing in these situations. It's something we should keep in mind going into the stadium for this match.""

Hong Myung-bo, head coach of the South Korean men's national football team, prepares to leave Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, for Iraq on June 2, 2025, for a World Cup qualifying match. (Yonhap)



 When unveiling his 26-man squad last Monday, Hong said he had left out some Europe-based players because they had been idle since their club seasons ended in early May and because he felt players in the domestic K League 1, currently in the middle of the season, would bring more to the table.

 Hong noted that he isn't as concerned about the players he did select from European clubs, including Lee Kang-in of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Hwang Hee-chan of Wolverhampton Wanderers, because they have remained sharp through their club or individual training.

 Lee and PSG won the UEFA Champions League title Saturday. Though Lee didn't play, he took part in PSG training sessions right up until the big final.

 ""I don't think players like Hwang Hee-chan and Lee Kang-in will have any conditioning issues,"" Hong said. ""Over the next couple of days, we will have to decide how to incorporate those players into our lineup.""

Patrick Kypson secured his second consecutive ATP Challenger Tour title on Sunday at the UAMS Health Little Rock Open.


The 25-year-old, who won the Bogota Challenger in mid-May, defeated wild card Michael Zheng 6-1, 1-6, 7-5 in a two-hour, 22-minute final. Kypson advanced through Little Rock qualifying en route to the title, extending his winning streak to 12 matches.


“It's the first time in my career that I've won two tournaments back to back,” said Kypson. “I think that holds some sentimental value and just the way I won today, I really battled through. This one feels really good.”

The top seed defeated Lukas Neumayer 6-3, 6-4 in the final, during which Tseng dropped just four points behind his first serve (28/32), according to Infosys ATP Stats.

“I think I served and returned well today,” said the 23-year-old Tseng. “I was able to control most of the rallies and that gave me confidence throughout the match. I feel good physically and I hope to maintain this level in the next tournaments. I was really happy to be here in Vicenza, the atmosphere is great.”

Alexander Zverev advanced to the quarter-finals at Roland Garros for the seventh time in eight years on Monday, when Tallon Griekspoor was forced to retire during the second set due to an abdominal injury.

The German Zverev led the Dutchman 6-4, 3-0 before Griekspoor called the physio and then ended proceedings after 54 minutes. The World No. 35 had led Zverev 3-0 in the first set but lacked power during the clash on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.

""Unfortunately, this morning and in the warmup with the last couple of serves that I hit, I pulled my abdominal, which made me not [able to] serve full and not able to compete the way I would like,"" Griekspoor said.

The Dutchman continued: ""I [had] a scan before the match, which showed nothing yet, but that's probably because it's too quick after it happened. They said it needs a couple of hours to show something.

""I tried everything with the warmup. [I] felt actually okay in the first set even though I didn't serve harder than 180 [km/h] and went all the way down to 150 [km/h] at some point. I tried to go out there. Probably one of the biggest matches of my life against an opponent that I like to play on a beautiful court. So I just wanted to give it a shot, but I realised pretty early that it was not going to be my day.""

Zverev advances after Griekspoor retires…@rolandgarros #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/pumxDqfW9Z

Zverev and Griekspoor were renewing their rivalry and meeting for the third time this year, having produced classic encounters in Indian Wells and Munich.

At the ATP Masters 1000 event in California, Griekspoor earned the biggest win of his career when he upset Zverev to earn a battling 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(4) victory on his sixth match point. Zverev then gained his revenge, clinching an equally tense 6-7(6), 7-6(3), 6-4 victory on home soil Munich, where he went on to win the title. After seven meetings since March of 2024, the German leads the overall Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-2.



Zverev was one set away from lifting his maiden major trophy in Paris last year before eventually falling to Carlos Alcaraz in five sets in the title match. The 28-year-old arrived in the French capital off the back of a fourth-round defeat in Madrid, a quarter-final exit in Rome and a second-round loss in Hamburg.

However, the No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings has looked in control through his opening four matches in Paris, where he has dispatched #NextGenATP American Learner Tien, Dutchman Jesper de Jong and Italian Flavio Cobolli. Seeking his first major, Zverev will take on Novak Djokovic or Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals. Djokovic leads Zverev 8-5 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, while the German holds a perfect 6-0 record against Norrie.

Novak Djokovic broke new ground Monday at Roland Garros, where he recorded 100 wins at a major event for the first time in his standout career.

The 38-year-old delivered a typically measured performance to dispatch Cameron Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 and reach the quarter-finals at the clay-court major for a 16th consecutive year. Djokovic, a three-time champion at Roland Garros, is just the second player to record 100 wins at the event after 14-time titlist Rafael Nadal (112).

“It's a very pretty number, but 101 victories sounds better,” said Djokovic. “I will continue to search for another victory, it's clearly not finished for me here. I'm very honoured to make history in this sport, which has given me everything in my life.""

After improving to 19-0 in fourth-round matches at Roland Garros, Djokovic set a quarter-final clash with third seed and last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev. The Serbian leads Zverev 8-5 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having notably retired from their most recent meeting in the semi-finals at the Australian Open in January.

Having defeated Norrie en route to his 100th title in Geneva two weeks ago, Djokovic was aware of the obstacle that stood before him, and he started the quicker on Court Philippe-Chatrier. He nullified the Briton's attempt to extend the rallies with ease, running away with a clinical opening set after the pair traded early breaks.
Aiming to reach the quarter-finals at a Grand Slam for the second time in his career, Norrie shifted to a more aggressive approach in the second set, which coincided with an error-strewn start from Djokovic. Yet the Serbian regrouped with a series of stunning winners and clever points at the net.

Norrie took a medical timeout to treat his left ankle before serving at 3-4 in the second, and it appeared to hamper his momentum further as Djokovic strengthened his grip on the encounter: He won eight of the final 10 games to seal a two-hour, 14-minute victory and become the oldest quarter-finalist at the event since 39-year-old Istvan Gulyas in 1971.
“I feel good. I always have high expectations, I know that I can always play better each day,"" added Djokovic. ""But in the end, it's 12 sets played, 12 sets won, so it's all positive and solid up until now.”
The No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Djokovic is this week chasing a record 25th major title. He now owns an impressive 100-16 record at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Novak Djokovic outclasses Cameron Norrie to maintain French Open bid","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2025/06/02/cameron-norrie-novak-djokovic-french-open-fourth-round/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:28:02 GMT","

Cameron Norrie was knocked out of the French Open in straight sets as Novak Djokovic claimed his 100th win at Roland Garros.

While Jack Draper and Alexander Bublik put on a power-hitting masterclass, the encounter between Norrie and Djokovic was a game of attrition and extended rallies.

Djokovic shrugged off his 38 years to reach the quarter-finals and become the oldest player to do so in the men's draw for half a century.

Asked about his milestone victory, Djokovic said on court afterwards: “It's a good number, but victory 101 would be better, so in search of another win it's obviously not over here for me.

“I am very happy to make history in this sport that I have loved for my whole life and I hope that I will be able to add another victory in two days.”

Norrie needed a medical timeout in the second set for a foot problem that seemed to affect his movement slightly, but Djokovic was the superior player on court throughout for his 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 win.

The contest itself was closer than the scoreline suggests. At one point in the second set, with the score poised at three games apiece, three-time Roland Garros winner Djokovic needed six game points in order to hold, having been broken in the first game.

But as he has done so often in the last few years, when it mattered, Djokovic delivered. There were glimpses of some of his best tennis, swerving down the line passing shots and he looked almost infallible when he came to the net, but he did not need to be at his best to beat 29-year-old Norrie.

As both players employed their drop shots all too frequently – Djokovic used his 18 times in the match – it was the experienced Serbian who benefited.

Djokovic was never really under pressure at any point, only having to hit 26 winners, and only six passing shots, while making fewer unforced errors, 28 to 32 when compared to Norrie.

In the previous round, Norrie only needed three sets to come through a battle of the Britons against Jacob Fearnley, to become one of two British players in the fourth round for the first time since 1963.

The Serbian then goes 15-30 ahead before Norrie wins three points in a row, in quick succession, to successfully hold to 30.

Good hold from the Briton.

Djokovic sets up the point with a serve out wide. A backhand error from Norrie sees Djokovic get to 30-0 before the Briton gets on the board.

Djokovic eventually holds to 15 to consolidate the break!

Norrie falls 0-15 behind before levelling up with a nice backhand volley.

The Briton hits a couple forehand errors to fall 15-40 behind before Djokovic eventually breaks again.

The Serbian is using the drop shot to good effect this afternoon.

Djokovic wins the opening point with a sweet backhand volley. Norrie gets to 15-15 as Djokovic nets a midcourt backhand. The Briton sneaks 15-30 ahead after landing a deep groundstroke on Djokovic's forehand wing.

Djokovic then levels up at 30-30 before going long with a backhand to hand Norrie a break point. Djokovic saves it after finding a few lines and ending the point with another drop shot.

Norrie gets another break point after some aggressive baseline play... and the Briton gets on the board as Djokovic nets a backhand.

Norrie lands a big first serve and then engages in a 25-shot rally that sees Djokovic come out on top to go 0-15. The sixth seed then gets to 0-30 as Norrie nets a backhand.

The Briton eventually levels things up at 30-30 then takes a 40-30 lead after putting away an overhead. Djokovic gets to deuce as Norrie's forehand flies long. Norrie then nets a backhand to give Djokovic a first break point look.

And Djokovic breaks!

Djokovic, serving first, sees a Norrie forehand return sail long to go 15-0. The Serbian gets to 30-0 after getting the better of Norrie in an extended rally, and then 40-0 before Norrie gets on the board following an unforced Djokovic error.

Djokovic eventually holds to 30.

Good afternoon and welcome to fourth-round coverage of Cameron Norrie versus Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros.

Norrie has not dropped any sets since his first-round upset win over 11th seed Daniil Medvedev. Since that five-set epic, the Briton has seen off Argentina's Federico Agustin Gomez in round two and countryman Jacob Fearnley in round three, both in straight sets.

Djokovic, a three-time French Open champion, has not dropped a set en route to the second week. The former world No 1 made lightwork of Mackenzie McDonald in round one before dispatching home favourite Corentin Moutet in round two and then Filip Misolic in the third round.

The head-to-head between Norrie and Djokovic is as one-sided as it can get – Djokovic is 5-0 against the Briton. However, Norrie can take solace from the fact their most recent meeting, the Geneva semi-final, a week before the French Open, went the distance. 

Djokovic went on to win that ATP 250 event but it was the second time in their five meetings that Norrie managed to win a set against the Serbian.

Their last meeting at a major was the Wimbledon semi-final in 2022. Norrie won the opening set before Djokovic, who was the eventual champion that year, won 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","tennis"

ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — One year ago, Loïs Boisson had her tennis dream dashed.

After tearing through the third rung of professional women's tennis, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) awarded Boisson a wild card for the French Open. A week before, at a minor tournament in Paris, Boisson tore her anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and missed nine months of tennis. She didn't even watch the tournament on television.

Twelve months after the pain, Boisson was on Court Philippe-Chatrier, soaking in the adoration of a French crowd. She upset Jessica Pegula, the world No. 3, to reach the French Open quarterfinals. She is the first French woman to reach the last eight at Roland Garros since Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic in 2017, after beating Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

“I don't know what to say,” Boisson told the crowd in French on court. “I knew before the match that there was a possibility, but I knew that she was very tough … I gave my all and in the end I won.”

Boisson looked a little overawed by the occasion in the first set, as Pegula's relentless accuracy and consistency from the baseline ground her down and drew her into mistakes. Boisson couldn't read the American's drop shots and was often scrambling to no avail after being pushed further and further to the back of the court. Boisson is the world No. 361 as she makes her return from injury, and the 358 places were showing.

But Boisson did not wilt, and the slow filling-up of the lower bowl of Chatrier was a barometer for how she worked her way into the match. Boisson figured out that she could make Pegula hesitate in coming to the net, with a combination of drop shots and lobs that left the American in two minds.

At 4-4 in the second set, the pressure started to tell. Pegula missed two groundstrokes she will likely never miss at a major again, before Boisson cracked a backhand crosscourt to take the set.

Riding a wave of tricolores and chants of “Loïs,” Boisson broke Pegula in the first game of the third set, but the American came back to reel off three games as Boisson went from sparkling to flat — and the crowd did too.

But at 4-4, just as in the second set, her combination of high, heavy spin and elite redirection on her forehand — dragging Pegula this way and that — put more doubts in the American's mind. She missed a backhand from the middle of the court at deuce, and a point later, Boisson was serving for the match.

With Boisson down 30-40, both players tightened. Pegula waifed a backhand over the net and then hit a clever short, angled forehand, but Boisson eked it over and the ball died at Pegula's feet. The American earned a second break point, but the crowd rose to Boisson again. A drop-shot-lob combination spinning over Pegula's head — the play that had given her a foothold in the match in the first place — brought the crowd to its feet and saw Boisson raise her arms for noise for the first time.

By the final game, Court Philippe-Chatrier was almost full. Word moved around the ticket-holders, likely waiting for Novak Djokovic's match to follow this one, that one of their own was doing something special. Another break point. Another drop shot. A flick from Pegula that dropped wide, the American leaning on the net in disbelief.

A net cord off a Pegula return sent Boisson scrambling forward to a ball she somehow dug out. She played the next shot, a volley off a weak lob, like she wanted it to land on a pillow, not some clay. Pegula got to it but could only net.

On her first match point, Boisson sent a forehand inside-in and raised her arms to a roar that shook Chatrier. It was Boisson's roar after the handshake, arms out and screaming into the sky, that made the past 12 months melt into air.

Published Jun 02, 2025

In a colossal upset, 361st-ranked Lois Boisson, a 22-year-old French wild card and Grand Slam main-draw debutant, has defeated third-seeded Jessica Pegula in the fourth round of Roland Garros, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.Boisson entered the tournament with one main-draw, tour-level match win on the season: a 6-0, 6-3 victory over 110th-ranked Harriet Dart at Rouen. She now has five, and none more unlikely this one.Pegula, whose strengths are amplified on surfaces faster than red clay, had still never lost to an unseeded player at Roland Garros. She was also 19-2 against opponents ranked outside the Top 100 at Grand Slams.Despite all that, Boisson has become the lowest-ranked player to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2017, when 418th-ranked Kaia Kanepi did so at the US Open.

Boisson came into this match with nothing to lose, and even more so when she trailed by a set and 4-3. From there, she used every tool in her impressive arsenal, from massive inside-out forehands to scrappy defense to drop shots, to unsettle Pegula—and unleash the partisan crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier for the first time.“She's got about 10 people in this stadium who are cheering for her,” noted Lindsay Davenport about Pegula, on the TNT broadcast.Five games later, and Pegula was down 2-0 in third.“Jessie's got to stop the bleeding right here,” said Davenport. “The fans are a real thing.“She's not only fighting the game of Boisson, she's fighting the fans.”

The circumstances of this match were not unlike Pegula's quarterfinal against Alexandra Eala in Miami. Playing an out-of-nowhere underdog on a big stage, with most fans against her and everything to lose, the American remained calm under pressure.It was enough to see her through that night in Florida, but not on Monday in France.Pegula began a turnaround by, first off, simply reducing errors. Boisson—who came into the match having hit the most winners of any player in the women's draw—troubled Pegula late in the second set by making her hit one more ball, time and again. Once Pegula cleaned up her game, she found ways to generate pace, and started using something Boisson was doing against her: the drop shot. A doubles veteran, Pegula began to draw Boisson to net with the slow ball and finish points with simple, crisp volleys.

But despite regaining control of the contest, Pegula could not create enough distance from her challenger. She went just 1 for 6 on break points in the third set—failing to convert at 30-40, while leading 3-2, proved pivotal—as Boisson remained uber-aggreesive and dictated play against the heavy favorite. She looked like the higher-ranked player in the decider, and would be rewarded for her against-all-odds effort.Pegula would earn four break points in the final game, but all four would vanish. The first was erased with a Boisson mishit, but the final miss was the most painful, when a short Pegula volley strayed an inch or so wide.That felt like Pegula's last chance, and indeed it was. Two points later, and a big Boisson forehand—one as big as this upset—sealed a shocker on the terre battue.

French wildcard Lois Boisson, ranked No. 361, stunned No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula in a thrilling comeback at Roland Garros, reaching her first Grand Slam quarterfinal in her Grand Slam main-draw debut. It was her first meeting vs. a Top 20 player -- and she got the win.

France will be represented in the Roland Garros quarterfinals after all, following a stunning comeback upset by one of the lowest-ranked players to ever make it this far at a Grand Slam event.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

Lois Boisson, the 22-year-old wild card ranked No. 361, shocked No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in their fourth-round meeting on Monday. In front of a delighted crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, Boisson executed the come-from-behind win after 2 hours and 40 minutes of gripping play.

""I [would] not believe that if you tell me that two weeks ago,"" Boisson said afterwards. ""I trust in myself, but yeah, for sure, if you say that, no, I can't believe. Now it's that, and I'm so happy about it.""

Contesting her first Grand Slam main draw and only her second tour-level event, Boisson pulled off a historic run in her national capital. The last time a Frenchwoman made it into the Roland Garros singles quarterfinals was 2017, when both Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic made the elite eight.

Boisson is the lowest-ranked woman to make a Grand Slam quarterfinal since former Top 20 player Kaia Kanepi reached the 2017 US Open quarterfinals ranked No. 418. Boisson is also the first woman to make the quarterfinals of her Grand Slam main-draw debut since Carla Suarez Navarro made the last eight here in 2008 as a qualifier.

""For the match point, I really felt very tense, and when I saw that my forehand was a winner, well, the whole pressure went off,"" Boisson told the French press. ""I was just so happy to win and to be able to play the quarterfinals.""

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Andreeva awaits: Boisson is now 1-0 against Top 20 players in her career -- her match against World No. 3 Pegula was her first-ever meeting with a player ranked inside that echelon.

Things won't get any easier for the wild card: another of the world's Top 10 players will be Boisson's quarterfinal opponent. She will have her first meeting with No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva, who bested Daria Kasatkina earlier on Monday. 

Regardless, Boisson will reach a career-high ranking after the tournament. She is projected to rise to around No. 120 after this win (WTA 125 results from this week could shift that a few spots). Another upset win in the quarterfinals could push Boisson as high as No. 68 in the PIF WTA Rankings.

""Things are not going to change for me,"" Boisson said. ""They're going to continue in the same way. It's just that my ranking will enable me to play larger, more important tournaments. That's the only thing that's going to change.""

French twist: Boisson was the only French player in either the women's or men's singles draws to make it into the Round of 16. And now her fairytale run will continue after her comeback in Monday's match -- which echoes her comeback from an ill-timed injury.

Boisson was projected to receive a Roland Garros main-draw wild card last year after winning her first WTA 125 title on home soil in Saint-Malo. However, before last year's Roland Garros started, Boisson suffered an ACL injury that kept her off tour for nine months.

Back in action in 2025, Boisson made her WTA main-draw debut on home soil in Rouen, reaching the second round. This fortnight, she got her year-delayed Roland Garros wild card to make her Grand Slam main-draw debut. And she backed it all up, beating Elise Mertens in the first round for her first Top 25 win.

After four straight three-set wins, Boisson is now flying the tricolore for the home nation all the way into her first tour-level quarterfinal, at a Grand Slam no less. 

""It's absolutely great to be in the quarterfinals,"" Boisson said. ""My hope is to have as many French people in that level in the coming years. It represents a lot to be in the quarterfinals here, and as I said, I hope to go even further.""

Match moments: Pegula's experience wore down the Grand Slam first-timer at the end of the opening set. Pegula cranked a forehand crosscourt winner to break for 4-3, and the American ended up winning ten of the last 11 points to take the one-set lead.

But Boisson kept pace with the No. 3 seed, using her heavy forehand well on the clay. Of the players remaining in the draw at the start of the day, Boisson had the most topspin on her forehand this event (by contrast, Pegula had the least).

Boisson also regularly found passing and lob winners to chip away at Pegula's advantage. In a perfectly constructed point, Boisson fired a rally backhand crosscourt to break for 5-4, then routinely held serve to tie the match at one set apiece.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

In a back-and-forth third set, Boisson took control by converting her fourth break point of a tense 4-4 game. Serving for the match at 5-4, Boisson faced four break points herself, but she refused to yield, finishing off the shocking upset.

Boisson is the first player to reach her first WTA Tour-level quarterfinal at a Grand Slam event since Emma Raducanu at the 2021 US Open. It's still a long way away, but she needs just three more wins to replicate Raducanu's result and win a Slam title.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Alex Eala's grass-court schedule plans revealed after Grand Slam debut","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-features/alex-eala-full-grass-court-schedule-revealed-ahead-of-wimbledon-debut","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 15:17:40 GMT","

After her Grand Slam debut, Alex Eala has her sights set on a maiden Wimbledon appearance at the end of the grass-court season.

The 20-year-old will become the first Filipina woman to play in the main draw at SW19, having fallen in the third round of qualifying at the tournament back in 2024.

Eala's Grand Slam singles debut at the French Open ended in a three-set defeat to Emiliana Arango, though she was able to win a match in the doubles alongside Renata Zarazua.

Now, all eyes will be on how she fares in her biggest grass-court season to date.

Just days after the end of her clay-court season, Eala is already in the UK for her opening grass-court tournament of the season.

The 20-year-old will be in action at the Birmingham Open, which will be held as a WTA 125 event for the first time after being downgraded from a WTA Tour-level event.

Eala is the third seed in the women's singles draw and has been handed an intriguing opener against world No 152 Linda Fruhvirtova.

Though there is a significant rankings gap between world No 73 Eala and her Czech opponent, it will not be an easy test against an opponent looking to rediscover form after a challenging spell.

Top seed Alycia Parks has already been beaten in Birmingham, meaning Eala will be among those looking to take advantage.

The Filipina was also in the doubles draw in Birmingham, she and partner Rebeka Masarova beaten 6-4, 6-4 in a tough match against second seeds and established doubles stars Ellen Perez and Storm Hunter.

After competing in Birmingham, Eala will immediately head to Ilkley for the second of two WTA 125 events held in the UK on grass.

The world No 73 will be among the leading contenders for the title, with world No 53 and recent new WTA Tour champion Maya Joint currently in line to be the top seed.

The event has been upgraded from 2024, having previously been an ITF-level event.

It will be Eala's main draw debut at the tournament, which will be held from June 8-15.

Among the other notable names entered alongside Eala and Joint are defending champion Rebecca Marino and Yuliia Starodubtseva.

Eala's grass-court season will culminate in perhaps the most famous tournament of them all, the 20-year-old set for her second Grand Slam main-draw appearance at the All England Club.

The Filipina just missed out on a main-draw debut last year after a tight straight-sets defeat in the final round of qualifying to Lulu Sun – who went on to reach the quarter-final of the women's singles event.

Much like with Roland Garros, Eala's ranking was high enough for her to automatically enter the main draw without having to worry about qualifying in 2025.

PARIS (AP) — Loïs Boisson had never even played at the French Open before, let alone in the biggest arena at Roland-Garros, and now the unseeded 21-year-old Frenchwoman is through to the quarterfinals.

Boisson, a wild card entry ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating third-seeded American Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier in Monday's fourth-round play.

Quite some victory, considering Pegula was the U.S. Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points.

After Pegula missed an easy-looking winner at the net, and then clutched her head in her hands, Boisson had her first match point, and the biggest point of her career so far.

Pegula returned a strong serve to the back of the court, where Boisson unleashed a brilliant forehand winner down the line. She then raised her arms in the air, realising the enormity of her win.

“I really don't know what to say, but ‘Thank you to all of you'"" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview. “Playing on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.”

Boisson made the notoriously hard-to-please crowd laugh when she added: “I'm really happy on here. I can stay a long time if you like.”

The crowd broke into chants of “Loïs, Loïs"" and she waved back to them.

She was in the news last month. British player Harriet Dart apologized to Boisson after asking the chair umpire to tell her to put some deodorant on. Now she's the only French player — male or female — left at Roland-Garros.

Asked what her ambitions were for the rest of the tournament — she plays sixth-seeded Mirra Andreeva on Wednesday in the quarterfinals — she replied, “I hope to win, right?”

That prompted more laughter from the crowd at Court Philippe-Chatrier, which included tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who has been criticized in some quarters for the lack of women playing in the night session.

Top-ranked Jannik Sinner was playing his fourth-round match later Monday in the night session against No. 17 Andrey Rublev, following 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic's match against Britain's Cameron Norrie.

In other women's fourth-round play, second-seeded Coco Gauff, the 2023 U.S. Open champion, won 6-0, 7-5 against No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova.

Over on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, the 18-year-old Andreeva, who reached the semifinals at Roland-Garros last year for her best performance at a major, won 7-5, 6-3 against No. 17 Daria Kasatkina. She playfully threw her wristband at Andreeva when they came to the net and Andreeva joked she would keep it.

No. 7 Madison Keys also advanced on Court Suzanne-Lenglen after beating Hailey Baptiste 6-3, 7-5 in an all-American contest. There's another one coming up for Keys against Gauff.

In remaining men's fourth-round play, No. 3 Alexander Zverev, last year's runner-up, was leading 6-4, 3-0 against Tallon Griekspoor when the unseeded Dutch player retired from the match. He later said it was due to an abdominal strain.

The quarterfinals are underway, with two men's matches and two women's matches, all on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka faces Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng followed by defending women's champ Iga Swiatek against No. 13 Elina Svitolina.

The first men's contest sees eighth-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti take on No. 15-seeded American Frances Tiafoe, before defending champion Carlos Alcaraz plays 12th-seeded American Tommy Paul. ___

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","She is the player who beat both Venus and Serena Williams on her way to winning the US Open but retired at just 28","https://tennishead.net/she-is-the-player-who-beat-both-venus-and-serena-williams-on-her-way-to-winning-the-us-open-but-retired-at-just-28/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

There are few in the history of tennis who would have been able to compete with stars like Serena and Venus Williams, and there were not many within their generation who managed to do so.

It's a testament to their dominant and relentless success that the time between their first Grand Slam title, won by Serena in 1999, and their last, again won by Serena in 2017, spans 18 years.

In between that time, they racked up a combined tally of 30 majors, as two of the most successful tennis players in the history of the game.

And yet, there was actually one player who continued to thwart Serena on the biggest of stages, with Justine Henin a constant thorn in the side of the 24-time Grand Slam champion.

For many, Henin was regarded as Serena Williams' greatest-ever rival alongside Venus, given the fact that the Belgian truly pushed the legendary American for a huge chunk of her career before her early retirement.

It's telling that, when Serena lost the world number one in 2002, it coincided with Henin's first-ever Grand Slam title. And then, when she snatched that top spot back in 2008, it also came at the same time as Henin's decline.

During that period, the 43-year-old, born in Liege, won more majors (7 v 4), had a positive head-to-head of five wins and three losses, and an even more impressive record of four wins and one loss in Grand Slams against one another.

Naturally, there are alternative factors to consider for this period, such as Williams' torrid injury record coinciding with Henin's peak.

With that in mind, many can argue for Venus, and it would be a valid claim.

But Henin, with a patented one-handed backhand that John McEnroe dubbed the best of all time, certainly deserves to be in the conversation for Serena's greatest rival.

Frustratingly for Henin, her career was cut cruelly short in 2011 when she finally called time on a glittering career.

Having won seven Grand Slam titles, including a magical 2007 run to the US Open title where she beat both Serena and Venus on her way to the final, she is widely regarded as one of the best players of her generation.

In early January of 2011 though, at just 28 years of age, she cited a chronic elbow injury as the reason behind her decision to quit tennis.

She claimed: ‘In these recent months I have rarely been spared of the pain. The doctors told me my elbow is too fragile and therefore I cannot continue my profession at this high level.

‘I'm in shock, of course. After having considered the advice of doctors, it is now clear and accepted that my career finally ends.'

Regardless of the frustrating nature of Henin's retirement, she is still remembered fondly over a decade on from such a sad decision.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Australian Open figures have been left stunned by suggestions that the tournament could be pushed back to February, Express Sport has learned. Speculation over a new date for the first Grand Slam of the year intensified after former pro Patrick McEnroe claimed that it could be moved to create a longer winter break.

McEnroe suggested that talks over a new date had happened and that there was a ‘plan' for the Australian Open to be shifted. Players, particularly those at the top of the game, have complained about the broadening calendar and the large volume of tournaments they need to play. Last September, Carlos Alcaraz suggested that tennis bosses risked ‘killing' stars by adding more tournaments to their already packed schedules.

In a conversation about the calendar during TNT Sports' US coverage of the French Open on Saturday, seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe suggested that the Australian Open should move. His brother, Patrick, a commentator and former player, responded: “I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.”

But Express Sport has learned that there is no truth to these rumours after speaking with Tennis Australia sources. There was confusion over where the speculation might have started, followed by categorical denial.

Next year's Australian Open begins on January 12 and ends on February 1.



Patrick McEnroe went on to suggest that moving the Australian Open would open a window for a new tournament, potentially played in the Middle East. He said: “Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. Middle East, hello?”

“It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. In tennis the difference is you don't play you don't get paid. No guaranteed contracts. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.”

Alcaraz is the most high-profile player to complain about the schedule. There was a 49-day break between the final of the ATP Tour Finals and the first round of the Australian Open. Prize money is the main source of income for many professional players, meaning they are compelled to enter as many tournaments as possible and risk injuries and burnout.

Last September, Alcaraz said: “I'm the kind of player who think there is a lot of tournaments during the year. Mandatory tournaments, and probably during the next few years, [there are] going to be even more tournaments, more mandatory tournaments. So, I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way.”

A few months later, ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi confessed sympathy with players who feel they do not get enough of a break during the winter. He said: “We have expanded the Masters 1000, and in the 96-draw Masters, there is theoretically one more match only if you reach the final. I agree with the players when they say that the off-season is too short and the Davis Cup also has an impact on this.

“With the new format, many players play in November, once only those from the teams that reached the final, the others went on vacation. Now you don't have enough time to rest, rebuild your body and start playing tennis again.”

Back in January, Madison Keys shocked the world by capturing her maiden Grand Slam title in Australia. However, the American star is determined to prove her deep run wasn't a one-off, as she has now powered into the French Open quarterfinals—following in the footsteps of Serena Williams.

After defeating compatriot Hailey Baptiste in straight sets (6-3, 7-5), Keys, 30, becomes the oldest American to reach the quarterfinals in women's singles at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season since Serena, 35, in 2016, per Opta Ace. 

The seventh seed will now face fellow American Coco Gauff in the quarterfinals, as Gauff matched a historic Venus Williams record with her win over Yekaterina Aleksandrova in the fourth round.

Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, is looking to match her best result at the French Open, where she reached the semifinals in 2018. She lost to Sloane Stephens in straight sets.

This season, Keys has claimed two titles: the Australian Open and Adelaide. However, she has struggled to make deep runs on clay, with her best result being a quarterfinal finish in Madrid, where she fell to Iga Swiatek.

Gauff, 21, and Keys have faced each other five times, with Keys holding a 3-2 edge. Their most recent clash was in the Round of 16 at Madrid last year, where Keys won in three sets.

In fact, Keys has won their last two meetings, including a victory in Eastbourne in 2023. This will be their second Grand Slam encounter. Gauff won their first, at the 2022 US Open, in straight sets during the Round of 32.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Tennis fans left saddened over disappointing development around Cruz Hewitt","https://au.news.yahoo.com/cruz-hewitt-in-sad-development-despite-staggering-act-against-world-no29-at-french-open-004322624.html","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:43:00 GMT","

Tennis fans were left in awe of Cruz Hewitt's display at the French Open on Sunday, but saddened that he couldn't progress past the first round of the junior boys event. The 16-year-old showed the same trademark fight that was common in father Lleyton's matches, taking his older and higher-ranked opponent to the brink.

Cruz went through qualifying to make the junior event at Roland Garros, and proved a handful on Sunday for Pierluigi Basile. The Italian player is two years older and higher-placed in the world junior standings at No.24, compared to Hewitt at 41.

The 16-year-old Aussie managed to win the second set against his 18-year-old opponent, before succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 5-7 6-3. Hewitt lost a very tight opening set in a tie-breaker, and looked headed for a straight-sets exit when Basile served for the match at 5-3 in the second.

Basile also had a match point at 5-4, but Hewitt managed to reel off four consecutive games to send the match to a decider. The Aussie youngster was revving up the crowd and willing them to keep him in the contest, showing the same grit and determination that his father showed.

But in the end Hewitt ran out of steam and it was Basile advancing to the second round. The Aussie lost in two hours and 10 minutes, unable to reach the second round as he had done at the junior event in January at the Australian Open.

Hewitt had also lost in the first round in the senior qualifying event in Melbourne after being granted a wildcard. The 16-year-old is trying to emulate his famous father and make a career of his own, but has so far failed to make it past the second round of a junior grand slam event. Fans were left impressed by his performance on Sunday, but disappointed he couldn't go any further.

He wasn't the only son of a famous player to feature on Sunday, with fifth seed Jagger Leach beating Kazakh player Zangar Nurlanuly 6-1 1-6 6-0. Leach is the son of American former triple grand slam winner Lindsay Davenport.

Hewitt's fellow Aussie 16-year-old Emerson Jones - the world's No.2 female junior - will kick off her campaign as top seed in the girls' event against US qualifier Capucine Jauffret on Monday (local time), The other Australian in the boys' tournament (Ty Host) will face US sixth seed Benjamin Willwerth.

The only Australian remaining in the senior singles tournament is Daria Kasatkina, after Alexei Popyrin proved no match for Tommy Paul on Sunday night. Popyrin's encouraging week in Paris ended in anti-climatic fashion after a crushing 6-3 6-3 6-3 loss to 12th seed Paul in the fourth round.

""I'm definitely happy with my week's work, just disappointed with the way it ended,"" the 25-year-old said. ""Look, if I lost this match and I played good tennis then, then I would have been sufficed and happy, but I lost and didn't play my best, really didn't do what I wanted to do, what I've been what I've been banging on about all week, consistency.

""There was no consistency today, it was a very, very up-and-down match. And it was just not the way I planned for it.""

Novak Djokovic reached a remarkable milestone with his dominant straight-set win against Cameron Norrie at the 2025 French Open.

The Serbian icon cruised to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory over world No 81 Norrie in the last 16 at the Paris Grand Slam.

Djokovic broke seven times en route to improving his head-to-head record against the 29-year-old Brit to 6-0.

In his on-court interview, Djokovic said: “I feel good. I expect each day to play better and better. I've played 12 really good, solid sets so far. Everything is looking good.”

Asked about reaching 100 wins at Roland Garros, the former world No 1 added: “It's a good number, a happy number for me. But the 101st victory is the most important (laughs).

“It's another victory but it's obviously not finished here for me. I'm happy to add to the history of this sport that has given me so much. I hope there will be another win in a couple of days.”

The No 6 seed has progressed to the quarter-finals without dropping a set in his four dominant wins.

The 24-time major champion will face world No 3 Alexander Zverev in a quarter-final blockbuster. Zverev was leading Tallon Griekspoor 6-4, 3-0 in his fourth round match when the Dutchman was forced to retire.

Djokovic's win against Norrie was his 100th victory at the French Open, which makes him the third man to reach a century of wins at a single Grand Slam event.

Rafael Nadal won 112 matches at Roland Garros, while Roger Federer amassed 105 victories at Wimbledon and 102 at the Australian Open.

Djokovic, who celebrated his 38th birthday on May 22, has become the oldest man to reach the French Open quarter-finals since Hungarian Istvan Gulyas in 1971.

With his fourth round win, Djokovic extended his winning streak to eight matches — a run that includes four wins from his 100th ATP singles title run at the Geneva Open ahead of Roland Garros.

Alexander Zverev advanced to the quarter-finals at Roland Garros for the seventh time in eight years on Monday, when Tallon Griekspoor was forced to retire during the second set due to an abdominal injury.

The German Zverev led the Dutchman 6-4, 3-0 before Griekspoor called the physio and then ended proceedings after 54 minutes. The World No. 35 had led Zverev 3-0 in the first set but lacked power during the clash on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.

""Unfortunately, this morning and in the warmup with the last couple of serves that I hit, I pulled my abdominal, which made me not [able to] serve full and not able to compete the way I would like,"" Griekspoor said.

The Dutchman continued: ""I [had] a scan before the match, which showed nothing yet, but that's probably because it's too quick after it happened. They said it needs a couple of hours to show something.

""I tried everything with the warmup. [I] felt actually okay in the first set even though I didn't serve harder than 180 [km/h] and went all the way down to 150 [km/h] at some point. I tried to go out there. Probably one of the biggest matches of my life against an opponent that I like to play on a beautiful court. So I just wanted to give it a shot, but I realised pretty early that it was not going to be my day.""

Zverev advances after Griekspoor retires…@rolandgarros #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/pumxDqfW9Z

Zverev and Griekspoor were renewing their rivalry and meeting for the third time this year, having produced classic encounters in Indian Wells and Munich.

At the ATP Masters 1000 event in California, Griekspoor earned the biggest win of his career when he upset Zverev to earn a battling 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(4) victory on his sixth match point. Zverev then gained his revenge, clinching an equally tense 6-7(6), 7-6(3), 6-4 victory on home soil Munich, where he went on to win the title. After seven meetings since March of 2024, the German leads the overall Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-2.



Zverev was one set away from lifting his maiden major trophy in Paris last year before eventually falling to Carlos Alcaraz in five sets in the title match. The 28-year-old arrived in the French capital off the back of a fourth-round defeat in Madrid, a quarter-final exit in Rome and a second-round loss in Hamburg.

However, the No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings has looked in control through his opening four matches in Paris, where he has dispatched #NextGenATP American Learner Tien, Dutchman Jesper de Jong and Italian Flavio Cobolli. Seeking his first major, Zverev will take on Novak Djokovic or Cameron Norrie in the quarter-finals. Djokovic leads Zverev 8-5 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, while the German holds a perfect 6-0 record against Norrie.

Novak Djokovic made more history on Monday at Roland Garros, becoming just the third man in history to earn 100 match wins at a Grand Slam event.

The Serbian joined rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the exclusive club by defeating Cameron Norrie.

Nadal recorded 112 wins at Roland Garros, where he is a record 14-time champion. Roger Federer notched 105 victories at Wimbledon, lifting the trophy a record eight times. The Swiss also earned 102 match wins at the Australian Open, winning the title on six occasions.

Most Wins in a Major Tournament




Djokovic now holds a 100-16 record at Roland Garros, where he has triumphed in 2016, 2021 and 2023. By defeating Norrie and reaching his 19th Roland Garros quarter-final, the Serbian broke the men's record for the most quarter-finals at a Grand Slam event, surpassing Federer, who reached the last eight at Wimbledon 18 times.

Djokovic will also hope to surpass the 100 match-wins mark at Wimbledon later this month. The No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings is 97-12 at SW19. The 38-year-old holds a 99-10 record at the Australian Open and a 90-14 tally at the US Open, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Djokovic is chasing a record-extending 25th major this week. The sixth seed meets Alexander Zverev in the quarter-finals and will take an 8-5 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead into the match.

In a stunning comeback, Iga Swiatek overcame Elena Rybakina in a thrilling three-set match at Roland Garros. It marks Swiatek's 25th consecutive win at Roland Garros, setting up a quarterfinal clash with Elina Svitolina.

The first eight games of Iga Swiatek's fourth-round match against Elena Rybakina were unlike anything we've seen at Roland Garros in recent years.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

Four-time champion Iga Swiatek looked out of sorts on Court Philippe-Chatrier -- the same stage where she's won the trophy each of the past three years. But on Sunday, she was a long way from that level, piling up 27 unforced errors in the first nine games and quickly falling behind to Rybakina, 6-1, 2-0.

But Swiatek was not about to let her 24-match winning streak in Paris end without a fight. A missed smash by No. 12 seed Rybakina on break point pulled Swiatek level -- and a comeback effort by the former World No. 1 was on the cards. 

It required a titanic struggle in the third set, but by the end of 2 hours and 30 minutes, Swiatek was a 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 victor -- her 25th straight match won at the French Open.

""It means a lot,"" Swiatek said in postmatch press. ""I think I needed that kind of win to feel these feelings that I'm able to win under pressure, and even if it's not going the right way, you know, still turn the match around to win it.

""For sure it's a great confirmation for me. ... Obviously it's great to also have full control over the match, but against great players, it's not always going to be possible. I'm happy that I fought, and I also problem-solved on court.""

Svitolina next up: No. 5 seed Swiatek will now take on No. 13 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the quarterfinals. Svitolina toppled last year's runner-up to Swiatek, Jasmine Paolini, earlier on Sunday, saving three match points in the process.

Swiatek leads their head-to-head 3-1. Svitolina ousted Swiatek at 2023 Wimbledon, but Swiatek won their other three meetings, including their only previous encounter on clay at 2021 Rome.

Swiatek stays stellar: Swiatek has seen her ranking slip from No. 1 to No. 5 over the past year, and she has not won a title since her championship here last year. This is the first year since 2020 that Swiatek has entered her best event without having won a title.

But she held off former Wimbledon champion Rybakina -- a player who, amazingly, had beaten Swiatek in both of their previous clay-court meetings. This time, Swiatek solved the puzzle, and she is now an incredible 39-2 at this event.

Third-set thrills: Swiatek posted a heroic effort to level the match at one set apiece, but any momentum she might have continued was counteracted by Rybakina, who used a huge rally backhand to literally knock the racquet out of Swiatek's hands in a hold for 3-2.

The pair exchanged breaks through 4-4, and Swiatek seemed to break in the next game after a Rybakina double fault down break point. The call, however, was overturned, and the Kazakh eventually held on in that game to put herself a game away from snapping Swiatek's streak.

The four-time champion, though, was not fazed. She threw down a thunderous love hold to reach 5-5, then got back in the lead after breaking Rybakina once again. Serving for the victory at 6-5, Swiatek's forehand peaked when she needed it most, finding fiery shots from that wing to close out the grueling tussle.

""I haven't noticed that I made so many winners from my forehand, but for sure, I know it's a weapon,"" Swiatek said. ""I like it on clay. ... It's a shot that I use to kind of lead in the points, so I'm glad it worked.""

The Frenchwoman is the lowest-ranked player to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2017.ByEd McGroganPublished Jun 02, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 02, 2025

In a colossal upset, 361st-ranked Lois Boisson, a 22-year-old French wild card and Grand Slam main-draw debutant, has defeated third-seeded Jessica Pegula in the fourth round of Roland Garros, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.Boisson entered the tournament with one main-draw, tour-level match win on the season: a 6-0, 6-3 victory over 110th-ranked Harriet Dart at Rouen. She now has five, and none more unlikely this one.Pegula, whose strengths are amplified on surfaces faster than red clay, had still never lost to an unseeded player at Roland Garros. She was also 19-2 against opponents ranked outside the Top 100 at Grand Slams.Despite all that, Boisson has become the lowest-ranked player to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2017, when 418th-ranked Kaia Kanepi did so at the US Open.

Boisson came into this match with nothing to lose, and even more so when she trailed by a set and 4-3. From there, she used every tool in her impressive arsenal, from massive inside-out forehands to scrappy defense to drop shots, to unsettle Pegula—and unleash the partisan crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier for the first time.“She's got about 10 people in this stadium who are cheering for her,” noted Lindsay Davenport about Pegula, on the TNT broadcast.Five games later, and Pegula was down 2-0 in third.“Jessie's got to stop the bleeding right here,” said Davenport. “The fans are a real thing.“She's not only fighting the game of Boisson, she's fighting the fans.”

The circumstances of this match were not unlike Pegula's quarterfinal against Alexandra Eala in Miami. Playing an out-of-nowhere underdog on a big stage, with most fans against her and everything to lose, the American remained calm under pressure.It was enough to see her through that night in Florida, but not on Monday in France.Pegula began a turnaround by, first off, simply reducing errors. Boisson—who came into the match having hit the most winners of any player in the women's draw—troubled Pegula late in the second set by making her hit one more ball, time and again. Once Pegula cleaned up her game, she found ways to generate pace, and started using something Boisson was doing against her: the drop shot. A doubles veteran, Pegula began to draw Boisson to net with the slow ball and finish points with simple, crisp volleys.

But despite regaining control of the contest, Pegula could not create enough distance from her challenger. She went just 1 for 6 on break points in the third set—failing to convert at 30-40, while leading 3-2, proved pivotal—as Boisson remained uber-aggreesive and dictated play against the heavy favorite. She looked like the higher-ranked player in the decider, and would be rewarded for her against-all-odds effort.Pegula would earn four break points in the final game, but all four would vanish. The first was erased with a Boisson mishit, but the final miss was the most painful, when a short Pegula volley strayed an inch or so wide.That felt like Pegula's last chance, and indeed it was. Two points later, and a big Boisson forehand—one as big as this upset—sealed a shocker on the terre battue.

Rybakina, who had a point for an opening-set bagel, was serving lights out, and was just as dialed in on both of her ground strokes. She gave Swiatek no room to breath. The few times Iga had a little time to swing out on a forehand, she did what he has been doing all spring: She sent the ball flying long.

But as so often happens when a top player is on the ropes, everything changed when her opponent opened the door a crack. Serving at 2-1, Rybakina started with a doubt fault. Then she swung and missed at a forehand for 15-30. Swiatek talked to her camp and adjusted her service position; it was time for Plan B. At deuce, a slice forehand drew an error from Rybakina. At break point, the door suddenly opened wide, when she dunked the easiest of high forehand volleys into the net. Swiatek was even at 2-2.Still, she didn't walk through the door right away. Her confidence had been too low for too long for that. At 2-2, Swiatek put a backhand in the net, sent a forehand wide, shouted at her camp, and went down break point. That was the moment—finally—when she stopped playing it safe, and found her old clay-queen game. It started with two full-cut backhands that Rybakina couldn't handle.Davenport noticed the change right away.“Pretty fearless tennis from Iga,” she said, “accelerating on all the groundstrokes.”It took 10 minutes, but Swiatek held. By the time the game was over, she was her old self again. No more doubts, no more deceleration, no more wild misses.

She would need her best, too, because Rybakina didn't go away. The two lifted their levels together, extended the rallies, and played a dynamite third set. Swiatek won because her best was a little better than Rybakina's. From 4-5 down in the third, she held at love, hit a good backhand return and a winning backhand pass to break for 6-5, and held with a series of confident forehands for the win.“I think I needed that kind of win to feel these feelings that I'm able to win under pressure, and even if it's not going the right way, you know, still turn the match around to win it,” Swiatek said. “For sure it's a great confirmation for me.“I'm happy that I fought, and I also problem-solved on court.”Swiatek's Roland Garros-winning form, which we were once so accustomed to, felt like a revelation today.

That is, until Zheng rediscovered her serving rhythm at the start of the third. She still wasn't better in the rallies, and she still made her share of errors and nearly gave up a lead. But from that point on, she had her serve to get her out of jail, and she had the confidence that comes from knowing you have that card up your sleeve. She upped her first-serve percentage into the 70s, and finished with 10 aces. The last of them came when she was down 15-30 while serving for the match.Zheng won Olympic gold at Roland Garros last year, but this will be her first quarterfinal appearance there. She sounds excited at the prospect.“I am super happy, honestly,” she said. “There's not many words can describe my emotions because I've been trying every year, and that's the real first time for me to be in quarterfinal in Roland Garros.“Today the match was just, you know, fight. There's nothing more I can say.”

She sounds excited at the prospect.“I am super happy, honestly,” she said. “There's not many words can describe my emotions because I've been trying every year, and that's the real first time for me to be in quarterfinal in Roland Garros.“Today the match was just, you know, fight. There's nothing more I can say.”

It was “just fight,” but it was also about who fought smarter. In the crucial games at the end of the third set, Samsonova overplayed her hand and made errors—she would finish with 42 of them, again 28 winners. She lost a match that she could, and maybe should, have won. Zheng did the opposite. It probably wasn't a coincidence that she found her serve when she needed it. Unlike Samsonova, Zheng knows what it's like to win at this venue, and, at 22, she knows she can win here again.Paolini couldn't quite stop a gathering Svitolina stormElina Svitolina d.

Under the surface, though, things couldn't have been quite as calm. A few minutes earlier, Paolini had led 6-4, 4-1, and was cruising. But instead of the Italian relaxing and hitting out with a lead, it was the Ukrainian who had done those things. With nothing to lose, Svitolina loosened up, swung bigger, and took charge of the rallies. She broke for 3-4, and broke again for 4-5.Which meant that Paolini, with Svitolina getting closer in the rearview mirror, probably felt the pressure to close her out at 5-4. It showed. On her first match point, she overhit a forehand long. On her second, she tried too hard to change directions, taking a backhand above her shoulder and sending it down the line—and wide.To her credit, Paolini didn't panic. She took the set to a tiebreaker, and reached a third match point at 6-5. By then, though, Svitolina had caught and passed her in the confidence and shot-making departments; the score still favored Paolini, but momentum favored Svitolina. She saved a third match point by closing out a long and hard-fought rally with a volley winner. Svitolina has caught Paolini just before she crossed the finish line; she would lose just one more game.

“The match was really close in the second,” Svitolina said. “Yeah, I knew that I had to try to give myself a chance to come back into the match and just leave it all there. I tried to really stick to my game plan, tried to stay in the match, keep fighting, keep doing, you know, aggressive things on the court.”For Paolini, the pill was bitter, but maybe there was still some satisfaction lingering from Rome. She sounded resigned afterward, but not destroyed.“I think we played a great match,” she said. “I had my chances. She played well; I didn't. I didn't take it. You know, it's tennis, so it's hard to accept, but I have to.”

When the two approached the net, their smiling faces lit up the venue. To those watching or documenting a warm embrace that followed, it was clear Alcaraz and Shelton share a mutual respect.“Apart from being a great player, he's also a great person,” Alcaraz explained during the Spanish portion of his post-match press conference.“We get along super well. Of course on the court there are no friends—we both want to win and we'll both do our best to defeat the other. But it's also important to know how to accept a defeat, even though it hurts.”

For Shelton, his two major exits this year have come at the hands of the respective defending champions—having fallen to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open semifinals. But the “ironic” experience of feeling like he made strides against Alcaraz on clay of all surfaces furthered his belief that he's knocking on the door of making his biggest statement yet.“Those two matches I've lost at slams this year, I consider myself a really good Grand Slam match player,” he said in his press conference.“Hopefully I can continue to improve and take that next step, because that's where I want to be.”

MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF: Verstappen made contact with Russell and Leclerc – but why were they racing each other in the first place?

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has admitted that contact with George Russell in the Spanish Grand Prix “was not right and shouldn't have happened” – as Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner urged his lead driver to “keep his nose clean” in upcoming races, with the four-time champion now one penalty point away from an automatic race ban.

Verstappen picked up three penalty points in Barcelona after a late collision with George Russell's Mercedes.

That moves the Dutchman to 11 penalty points – one point away from a ban. The points accrue across a rolling 12-month period, with none coming off Verstappen's tally until the end of June. Before that date, Verstappen must negotiate both the Canadian Grand Prix and Red Bull's home race in Austria.

Verstappen was handed the three penalty points for the crash with Russell late on in the Grand Prix on Sunday, after a chaotic restart saw contact between the Red Bull and both Charles Leclerc's Ferrari and then Russell's Mercedes.

2025 Spanish Grand Prix: The full story of the dramatic collision between Verstappen and Russell

A Safety Car had been called after Kimi Antonelli parked up in a gravel trap following a power unit issue. While Verstappen was fitted with hard tyres for the restart, those around him had softs – and thus the Dutchman was at an immediate disadvantage.

He was lying third behind the two McLarens but lost a place to Leclerc along the straight, with the two banging wheels in an incident that the stewards decided required no further action. Russell then dived down the inside into Turn 1, making contact with Verstappen which sent the Red Bull driver onto the escape road.

While he emerged ahead of Russell, the team ordered him to give the place back – and it was in this moment the second contact was made. The stewards decided Verstappen was to blame, handing him a 10-second time penalty and those three penalty points on his super licence.

Writing on Instagram after the race, Verstappen said: “We had an exciting strategy and good race in Barcelona, [until] the Safety Car came out. Our tyre choice at the end and some moves after the [Safety Car] restart fuelled my frustration, leading to a move that was not right and shouldn't have happened.

“I always give everything out there for the team and emotions can run high. You win some together, you lose some together. See you in Montreal.”

Team boss Horner, meanwhile, was asked how concerned he was at the prospect of losing Verstappen from his line-up for a race should he pass the 12-point threshold.

“You can never guarantee anything,” said Horner. “He's just got to keep his nose clean in the next couple of races. Then the first points come off at the end of June.”

Verstappen is due to drop two points from his licence on June 30, those earned for a collision with Lando Norris at last year's Austrian Grand Prix.

That would take him back to nine points – buying him some breathing room, although the next points will not be removed from his licence until the end of October.

Last season saw Kevin Magnussen banned for one race after accruing 12 penalty points, the Dane sitting out the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for Haas, with the team running Oliver Bearman in his place.

Should Verstappen hypothetically fall foul of a one-race ban, Red Bull could choose to promote one of their two Racing Bulls drivers in Liam Lawson or Isack Hadjar, or run a driver from their pool of talent such as Ayumu Iwasa or Arvid Lindblad.

The trailer for the upcoming Universal and Blumhouse horror movie hit Sunday at the pop culture convention CCPX in Mexico City.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Dead is just a word.


	That's the message behind Universal and Blumhouse's trailer for The Black Phone 2, unveiled Sunday at CCXP Mexico, a pop culture convention being held in Mexico City over the weekend.




	The movie is the sequel to the surprise 2022 hit that made $161 million against an $18 million budget. Based on a short story by Joe Hill, the son of Stephen King, the movie introduced audiences to the Grabber, a masked serial killer who abducts children, locking them up in his basement. One such kid, however, finds an unplugged but haunted rotary phone that connects him to the ghosts of the previous snatched boys. And in that, a possible way out.

					Scott Derrickson Explains Why He Needed to Make 'The Gorge' Before 'The Black Phone 2'		
			









	The movie ends (spoiler alert!) with the Grabber dead, so how the heck is he back? The trailer enticingly builds to a chilling phone conversation between our hero, played by a returning Mason Thames, and the Grabber, once again played by Ethan Hawke, with the latter telling the teen, “You of all people should know that dead is just a word.” Then the trailer unleashes a barrage of horror images.




			Popular on THR		







	Director and co-writer Scott Derrickson, who got on the phone with The Hollywood Reporter prior to the trailer's reveal, was tight-lipped regarding the return. In fact, he was pretty much tight-lipped about a lot of things.


	But he did elaborate on the nature of ghost stories.


	“The first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is typical, a ghost story,” he said. “But in this one, you've got a ghost that is a villain.”

	











	With the first movie, Derrickson tapped into his Denver childhood, where bullies and violence were common. For this one, he drew on his high school experience of going to winter camps in the Rocky Mountains. The severity of the weather, the environment and the surrounding Rockies contributed to the tone of the new movie.


	But the difference between middle school and high school ages of the characters is the big change in tone.


	“A middle school coming-of-age horror movie is a different animal than a high school coming-of-age horror film,” says Derrickson. “And there's a ratcheting up of intensity because of that.”


	Derrickson wasn't necessarily planning on a sequel to Black Phone but said Hill wrote to him a month or two after the movie came out with some ideas. And having it set in the high school years proved appealing, especially when he worked out the timing in his head.


	“I thought if I go make another movie first and don't make a sequel now like you're supposed to, then by the time I finish, these kids are all going to be in high school,” he said. The movie he did was the large-budgeted monster Apple TV+ movie titled The Gorge with Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller. “And I can return to these characters in this different stage of their lives.”


	And because of that, Black Phone 2 is more of a horror film than the first movie, which he considers to be a supernatural thriller.


	“It is certainly more violent, scarier, more graphic,” he says. “And part of that is because of the age of the kids.”

In a role that returned her to acting, Munn opens up about Sam's betrayal and what it means for her and Jon Hamm's Coop for season two, which is currently filming.

[This story contains major spoilers from the season one finale of Your Friends & Neighbors.]


	“You don't deserve it,” Olivia Munn‘s Sam says when confronted by Jon Hamm's Coop in the Your Friends & Neighbors finale. 




	In the first episode of the Apple TV+ series, a death was revealed in the wealthy, fictional Westmont Village, leaving a mystery of who could be a murderer among these elites. Who killed Paul (Jordan Gelber)?


	Sam's husband was the victim, making Coop a prime suspect when the police later found out about Coop and Sam's secret relationship. Coop ended up getting arrested when the murder weapon, a gun, was found in his car — a murder weapon that was planted there by Sam to frame Coop.

	But in the season finale, which released Friday, viewers discovered that there was never a murder. Paul died by suicide — while on FaceTime with Sam — and she staged the scene to make it look like a murder so that she could receive Paul's life insurance money, as she was in the process of divorcing him. When Coop gets out on bail and confronts Sam, one of her reasons for setting him up is because Sam, who comes from a blue-collar background, doesn't think Coop, a former hedge fund guy, deserves the life he has. “Ultimately, the show is a social exploration. It's a little bit of a satire, and thematically it's all about what makes these people tick,” creator Jonathan Tropper told THR in a finale interview about how the reveal and ending sets up the show for the already renewed season two.


Your Friends & Neighbors marked Munn's first on-screen project following her breast cancer diagnosis. She's previously opened up about how she was nervous to film sex scenes with Hamm because of her cancer scars. Last month, the actress told THR at the show's premiere about how their chemistry was something that came naturally. “He and I get along so well it's just really easy to play,” she said. 

	











	Below, Munn talks to THR about how money and privilege are the real villains in the series, explains how anyone could relate to Coop and Sam's on-again-off-again relationship and teases what's next for Sam in season two, which is currently filming.


	***


In episode six, we started to see a different side to Sam when she told off a salesperson when buying skincare. Knowing what we now know, was that a clue that there was more to Sam than we might expect?


	What I loved about that scene was that Sam is on the precipice of losing everything, and that's where we meet her in episode one. And by that point in the show, she's at the apex of that. Everything that she is desperate to hold on to is literally at the very end of her fingertips, and in that moment, everything just explodes. That salesperson is the unfortunate recipient of all of that. But in that moment, it's all the energy she's put into not only holding on to it but to have created it. She's had so much ambition and drive in her life to get to the top of the social mountain and have this incredible wealth. Not only has she been desperately trying to hold on, but she's watching this just disintegrate in her hands.


Before the twist is revealed, Sam broke things off with Coop. Why did she decide to let him go? Then it seemed like he was trying to make their relationship more than a friends-with-benefits situation.


	It wasn't said in the script, but it's something that [Jonathan] Tropper [creator/showrunner] and I talked about a lot, and when I went into the season I was thinking about: “What's the part of the story that we haven't seen before we meet all these characters? And what's been going on with Sam and Coop?” They both entered their relationship in similar places but very different emotionally. He was looking for a soft place to land when he was struggling so much to want to keep his family together, and my character is hoping that this flourishes into something more. So, I thought a lot about what other conversations they were having that we don't see on screen. When he got to that point where it seemed like he wanted more, the reality was that he said that so many times. There's a point where you have to just wake up and realize you're in this cycle of: “Yes, he wants more. OK, no, he doesn't. Yes, he wants more. No, he doesn't.” There's a point where she just has to say, “Enough is enough.”

	











Now, about the ending, what was your reaction to reading in the script that Sam made her ex-husband's suicide look like a murder? 


	I absolutely loved it. (Laughs) Tropper did a really great job of this unflinching exploration of human nature and ambition, and the lengths people will go to make and retain their wealth and status in society. This part was like the Shakespearean equivalent of showing what all that leads to: When you see what happens when blind ambition and the desperate need to maintain your social status and wealth come up against losing it all. At that moment, on the surface, it seems like she just wants the insurance money, and to the length that she's going, it's so extreme. But it's the need. It's a timeless story of people thinking that money buys happiness, and putting all of your self worth and your entire life into the idea that if you have money, then everything is going to be OK. So for her, there was no other way. That was the only path forward.


When Coop asks her why she framed him for Paul's murder, she responds, saying, “You should have been kinder to me,” and notes that he doesn't deserve the privileged life he has. However, that could apply to a lot of people in that neighborhood, so why was Coop the one to pin Paul's death on?


	That line: “You should have been kinder to me” is something that Tropper told me in our first initial call. I thought about that for so long, and I love that line so much. And that's a great question: why him? But it's because of having been so intimate with him and having this close relationship. I think that we've all had those relationships where you feel like you've really given your heart to somebody and really exposed yourself, and you're being very vulnerable and very loving and it's just being taken. Nothing is being given back to you. You're left feeling really empty at the end. For Sam, that is part and parcel of what that entire world is like. People take and take and they feel no need to to replenish anything.

	











	What I really loved about that scene in particular was that there has been so much dialogue in the world about privilege, and I've had to have many conversations with friends about it just over the last five years where it's been at the apex of discussion in the world. I had a conversation with one friend who was asking me to explain it to him and I didn't mind because he really was earnestly wanting to know. He's like, “But I work really hard to get to where I'm at. So why are people saying that I don't deserve it?” I was like, “Look, you know, I'm a first-generation American. This is my mother's 50th anniversary of fleeing Saigon to come to America as an immigrant. No one is saying that people with inherent privilege don't work hard or haven't faced their own battles and slayed their own dragons and worked really, really hard. What people fail to realize is that on that same mountain, they have been given the cheat codes, maps and keys to the gates along the way.”


	So, yes, they have to climb the mountain, but it's all been set up for them to make it through to the next level, the next stage. So they're on their way up and they're working hard to get to the top, while the rest of us have this Sisyphean task to keep trying to get up this mountain. But we don't have the cheat codes. We don't have the maps in front of us. There's no one that we know at that next gate that says, “I'll let you in.” I know your dad; I know your mom. Oh, that's great we went to Yale together, come on in. The rest of us are still struggling to get up the mountain, while on the other side, people with privilege are making their way up the mountain.

	











	That moment in the foyer of Sam's home, that's what Sam is saying: “Yeah, you worked hard, but I worked harder because it was not set up for me to be here.” Everything was set up for Coop. When Tropper first talked to me about this, [he mentioned] it's a lot based on his life. He lived in Westchester and had a whole other life before his life now. He goes: There is this world of people whose families are wealthy and their families went to Harvard or Yale, and so their children get to go to Harvard or Yale. And then, because the dad had a hedge fund, or knew this hedge fund guy, it's set up for his son to then go into this hedge fund, and then it's set up for him to run the hedge fund. Then, there are certain goals they set off for themselves, and they achieve them. Get your first mansion, get your second mansion, get your vacation home, get this plane, get that plane and then it's this accumulation of wealth and things. And then something happens that unravels it all, and you realize that everyone has been putting all their attention and energy onto something that's so external. When the internal cracks even the slightest, it just exposes the fragility of that entire world.


During your monologue, Sam setting up the crime scene reminded me of Gone Girl. Was that an inspiration at all for Sam's storyline? Did it inspire your performance?


	I never thought about that, and Tropper never brought that up, either. So, I never thought about that. But I think of Gone Girl as sociopathic. (Laughs) She's very sociopathic, and I think that Sam is a very nuanced, complex character who came from a blue-collar upbringing who has found herself at the top of this social mountain and has convinced herself this is what she needs to do to survive. She's convinced herself that the only way to survive is to be in this social world and with this enormous wealth and that there is no other path in life to forge, which I always think is interesting because she didn't come from money. She can go back into a life and figure out how to live without money. It's not foreign to her. So why does she so desperately want to do anything to stay in this place with this friend group and have this house and this car and these purses and shoes?

	











	I thought about that a lot. Money can corrupt the soul when you're around a lot of people who put priority on things and not relationships; on the label and the Zip code. That kind of ideology is sticky, and it can stick to you and how you move in the world, and how you think about the world. I think Sam has really lost her sense of self and is focused on only the things she has seen that matter. The money and lifestyle have also corrupted Sam, and when something like that happens, you can't really see any other way besides what you think is the only one in front of you.


Since you are currently shooting season two, how would you compare the first season to the second?


	In the second season, what we've all seen in the world for hundreds of years, too, this is the same story. People with wealth and power can do horrible things, and yet you turn around and they're sitting next to you at the dinner party, and they just keep finding their way back into these social circles and keep finding their way back into being accepted. It's staggering and shocking for most of society who have a moral compass. It's set up that way because they've got the key, those cheat codes. Everything is set up for people who have been born with privilege; life is already set up for them to falter and come back up. My character wasn't born with privilege and yet, here she is. She's fallen off the mountain, and yet she's still in this world, and we're going to see the struggle of trying to stay in that world, keep a place in that world, get back to where she was and how everyone is going to handle that.

""This was a show that started when there were no podcasts. And now, there is nothing but podcasts,"" said Maron when announcing the news on his Monday show. ""We are utterly satisfied with the work we've done.""


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


Marc Maron‘s WTF with Marc Maron Podcast is ending after 16 years.


	Maron announced the news on his Monday show, saying, “It's nice to be able to end things on our own terms. We started the show on our terms. We grew it on our terms, and we'll end it on our terms.”




	Maron and his producing partner Brendan McDonald made the decision together, he said, explaining that the pair behind the two-team groundbreaking podcast are simply burnt out.


	“WTF will turn 16 years old on Sept. 1. Sixteen years, it's a long time. It's a long time to do anything,” he said to open his show, which welcomed on guest John Mulaney. “All of a sudden, you're old and you realize you've been doing something for a long time. This started in the old garage. No one knew what a podcast was. I was coming out of a horrendous divorce. I was wanting to figure out how to continue living my life. Things were not looking good for me.”

	He continued, “When Brendan and I started this thing, all we knew was that we were going to do it e very Monday and Thursday. And there was no way to make money. There was no way that we knew how to build an audience or anything. We were doing it in the garage in the beginning that was just a garage filled with junk. And it slowly evolved into the show that became what you listen to twice a week. Sixteen years we've been doing this and we've decided that we had a great run and now, basically, it's time, folks, It's time. WTF is coming to an end and it's our decision.”


	The final episode will be some time in the fall, and Maron said they will try to have as many people on as possible before they end in what he called the “home stretch.” 


	“Thankfully, we both realized, together, that we were done,” Maron, 62, continued in the announcement. “There was no convincing or pushback or arguing. We were done. And it's OK. It's OK for things to end. … This was a show that started when there were no podcasts. And now, there is nothing but podcasts.”

	











	The GLOW star said this doesn't mean he won't ever have a talk or appear on a podcast again, but that he's looking forward to starting another chapter.


	“We have put up a new show every Monday and Thursday for almost 16 years and we're tired,” he made clear. “We're burnt out. And we are utterly satisfied with the work we've done.”


	Maron thanked the iconic podcast's fans while teasing his new chapter, which includes his new Apple show with Owen Wilson Stick releasing on Wednesday and the documentary focused on him, Are We Good? directed by Steven Feinartz, that follows the podcaster-comedian-actor as he deals with the loss of his partner, filmmaker Lynn Shelton, who died in 2020, amid a shifting comedy landscape.


	Maron is also working on a new comedy special for HBO set to release this year, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. The special filmed in New York City in May.


WTF has remained a top, most-streamed and downloaded podcast since it launched on Sept. 1, 2009, and now boasts nearly 2,000 episodes and more than 55 million listens per year. He's interviewed actors, comedians and icons ranging from Robin Williams, Keith Richards and Nicole Kidman to former President Barack Obama.

The actor explains why he's not interested in appearing in the upcoming Star Wars films — even as a Force Ghost. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Don't expect to see Luke Skywalker in any of the upcoming films Lucasfilm has planned — even as a spectral Force Ghost. 


	The 73-year-old actor, who has appeared in five live-action Star Wars films and made de-aged cameos in The Mandalorian TV series, suggested that Skywalker's run is over — and should be over.




	“I am so grateful to [creator George Lucas] for letting me be a part of that back in the day, the humble days when George called Star Wars ‘the most expensive low-budget movie ever made,'” said Hamill during an interview with ComicBook.com to promote his new film, the Stephen King adaptation The Life of Chuck. “We never expected it to become a permanent franchise and a part of pop culture like that. But my deal is, I had my time. I'm appreciative of that. But I really think they should focus on the future and all the new characters.

	“And by the way,” he added, “when I disappeared in [The Last Jedi], I left my robes behind. And there's no way I'm gonna appear as a naked Force ghost.” 




			Popular on THR		







	The comments come despite Lucasfilm developing a film that would be an obvious project for Skywalker to appear in — a Rise of Skywalker follow-up focused on Daisy Ridley's Rey, who was Skywalker's mentee in the sequel trilogy. The film from director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy picks up roughly 15 years after the events in Skywalker and follows Rey's efforts to build a new Jedi order. The New Order film is only in development, however, along with many other titles. 

	











	Lucasfilm chief Kathleen Kennedy previously teased the film, saying, “Well, we're 15 years out from Rise of Skywalker, so we're post-war, post-First Order, and the Jedi are in disarray. And, there's a lot of discussion around, ‘Who are the Jedi? What are they doing? What's the state of the galaxy?' And, [Rey]'s attempting to rebuild the Jedi Order, based on the books, based on what she promised Luke, so that's where we're going.”


	The next confirmed Star Wars title is The Mandalorian & Grogu coming May 22, 2026, followed a year later by Star Wars: Starfighter from Shawn Levy and starring Ryan Gosling.


	Regarding Hamill's joking comment about leaving his robes behind, he and the late Carrie Fisher appeared as force ghosts at the end of Rise of Skywalker, and he indeed was robed. And hardcore Star Wars fans will counter that in 1977's A New Hope, when Darth Vader killed Obi-Wan Kenobi, his robes were also left behind — but Alec Guinness still appeared in his robes when he showed up as a Force Ghost in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.


	Hamill's career has been busier than ever the last few years. The Life of Chuck is a sci-fi adaptation of a Stephen King story from Hamill's The Fall of the House of Usher filmmaker Mike Flanagan this month. He also stars in another King adaptation, the long-awaited adaptation of the author's cult favorite novel The Long Walk, which is out in September.

Wet'suwet'en leader Molly Wickham, an indigenous activist, used Canadian film and TV's biggest night to call for a ""Free Palestine"" when picking up the best documentary award for ‘Yintah.'


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	A Canadian Screen Awards that put marginalized voices front and center and challenged the global political landscape saw The Apprentice, a film about a young Donald Trump, dominate the national film and TV awards Sunday night in Toronto.


	Director Ali Abbasi's Trump origin story won best movie, while Sebastian Stan, the Romania-born American actor who plays the future U.S. president alongside Jeremy Strong as his consigliere Roy Cohn, earned top honors for best leading role.




	Daniel Bekerman, co-producer of the Canada/Ireland/Denmark co-production The Apprentice, said when accepting the prize, “Our movie shows how the young Donald Trump amassed wealth and power by finding a dilapidated building and slapping his name on it as president. We'll see how that works out.”

	Then Bekerman turned to Trump taunting Canada as a possible 51st state for the United States. “Now he wants to slap his name on this country. This is a challenge, but a good challenge, because as independent filmmakers and storytellers, what we need to do, what is our responsibility, is to tell stories with honesty that can build trust and build community. The rise of indigenous cinema in this country gives me hope. The rise of queer cinema in this country gives me hope. But we're faced with power structures that want to silence us. It's time to lock arms,” he added.

	Bekerman added that The Apprentice, which bowed in Cannes, received nominations at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. “But Ali, I told you, you have to come to Canada if you want to find some guts in this industry,” he said in a call-out to director Abbasi in the audience.

	











	Politics also overshadowed the CSAs when Wet'suwet'en leader Molly Wickham, an indigenous activist, came on stage with fellow directors of Yintah, which won for best documentary and follows a decade-long fight to protect indigenous lands from fossil-fuel companies.


	“The fight continues, and we will never give up. Our sovereignty is tied to our collective freedom. Land back. Free Palestine,” a fist-pumping Wickham declared as the awards show was telecast live on the CBC and CBC Gem networks countrywide. 


	Also Sunday night, the best movie director prize went to Andrew Rankin for Universal Language, a deadpan comedy that riffs on Iranian cinema and also earned the Directors' Fortnight audience award in Cannes. “We all know what political moment we're living in. Every day there are new Berlin Walls shooting up all around us and pitting us against each other in very cruel binaries. And if our film stands for anything, it stands for the fact that kindness can be a radical gesture, and that's really what we believe in now more than ever,” Rankin said when accepting his trophy.


	Elsewhere, the best reality series award went to Canada's Drag Race, the Canadian spinoff of the global format from local producer Blue Ant Media and for CTV. Series showrunner Trevor Boris when accepting the award said he saw the reality show as an “island of misfit toys.” He added, “There are so many of us who are different and don't really fit in because of who we love, or because of where we come from. But on this show, we're normal and we just have the most fun.” 

	











	The CTV and CW series Children Ruin Everything from New Metric Media won for best comedy, and Cate Blanchett picked up the best lead comedy performance prize for her star turn in Guy Maddin's political horror-comedy movie Rumours. Supinder Wraich won for best lead performer in a TV drama for her star turn in Allegiance, a CBC police drama. And Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent won for best drama series after the Canadian version of the Law & Order franchise format came into the CSAs with a field-leading 20 nominations.


	Kiefer Sutherland appeared on the CSAs to pay tribute to his late father, Donald Sutherland, who died in June 2024 after a celebrated career with credits like M*A*S*H*, Ordinary People and The Hunger Games. “Somehow this kid, and he was a kid from the Maritimes, felt like he had something to say,” he said of Donald Sutherland as a young man going to England to begin his acting craft before success in Hollywood. “He managed to forge, well, at least in my opinion, one of the most diverse, prolific and important acting careers in the history of film,” Kiefer Sutherland summed up.


	In other prize-giving, the main audience award went to W Network's The Way Home, and the kids audience award went to APTN's Warrior Up! In special award giving, Star Wars: The Acolyte and The Good Place star Manny Jacinto received the Radius Award on Sunday night for his global impact as a performer. “Who knew that applying to random auditions on Craigslist would end up here,” Jacinto told the CSAs audience in Toronto.

	











	And Marsha Greene, co-creator and showrunner of the CBC and BET+ drama The Porter and producer of the ABC series 10 Days in the Valley, accepted the Changemaker Award for calling out systemic racism and discrimination in Canadian TV. “We are in the time when people are questioning the validity and the necessity of this work. Some have even said our moment is over. Well, this is not about a moment. It is about a movement. I'm proud to live and work in a country that prides itself on its diversity, and I challenge all of us as Canadians to continue to move forward toward an industry that is truly inclusive,” Greene said on stage in Toronto.

The singer-songwriter scores his first leader on the chart.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” ascends to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the singer-songwriter's first leader on the list. It rises from No. 4, after reaching a previous No. 2 best.


	Warren becomes the first male soloist to earn an initial Hot 100 No. 1 this year.


	“Ordinary,” the 1,181st No. 1 in the Hot 100's 66-year history, rose to the top of both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts in May. On the Hot 100, Warren charted one prior entry, “Burning Down” (No. 69 peak, last October). Concurrent with the coronation of “Ordinary,” he adds his second top 40 Hot 100 hit, as “Bloodline,” with Jelly Roll, debuts at No. 32.


	Before concentrating on music full-time, Warren grew a following in Hype House, a group of TikTok content creators that frequently collaborated. He signed to Atlantic Records in 2022.


	“In my career, I have been so open with my friends who follow me,” Warren, who co-authored “Ordinary,” told Billboard earlier this year. “They know everything about me and we're so connected, and I love that. I'm thinking of these people while I'm writing these songs, because I'm thinking about what I would want to hear if I was still going through that.”


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated June 7, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 3.

	“Ordinary” tallied 21 million official streams (down 1% week-over-week), 43.5 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 15%) and 8,000 sold (up 24%) in the United States May 23-29. Boosting its profile, Warren performed the song on the American Music Awards, broadcast on CBS, May 26.


	The track rebounds 3-1 for a fifth week atop the Digital Song Sales chart and 6-4 on Streaming Songs, after four weeks at the summit. It reaches the top five on Radio Songs (7-5), as it becomes Warren's first No. 1 on a Billboard airplay chart, rising to the top of Adult Pop Airplay.


	Warren's “Ordinary” is the first “ordinary”-titled Hot 100 No. 1. Here's a look at all 10 not-so-“ordinary”-named songs that have hit the chart:




	“Ordinary” hits No. 1 in its 16th week on the Hot 100. It's the fifth song to reign for the first time in 2025, following fellow steady risers in Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” (20 weeks to No. 1) and Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” (13 weeks); conversely, Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, debuted at No. 1 a week ago and Travis Scott's “4X4” launched on top in February.


	Titles have taken an average of 10.2 weeks to hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 so far in 2025, the most of any year this decade, with one music industry professional theorizing that, currently, “the whole nature of artist development takes time.”


Avg. Weeks to No. 1 on Hot 100 in the 2020s:


	(Since the Hot 100 adopted electronically-monitored Luminate data in late 1991, hits have taken an average of 8.4 weeks to No. 1.)


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” holds at No. 5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100. It adds a 23rd week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts – surpassing Lamar's “Not Like Us” (in 2024-25) for the longest command on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking). SZA, meanwhile, ranks third with 21 weeks atop Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs with “Kill Bill” in 2022-23.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips to No. 2 on the Hot 100, a week after it soared in as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It claims a second week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. Wallen follows on the Hot 100 with the No. 2-peaking “Just in Case” (2-3) and “I'm the Problem” (3-4), as I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three songs, secures a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” rebounds 9-6 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” dips 6-7 following five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, climbs 11-8. It posts a record-extending 63rd week in the top 10 and a record-padding 93rd week on the chart overall.


	Drake's “Nokia” rises 12-9 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” bumps 14-10, after peaking at No. 2. It adds a 70th week on the survey, becoming just the 10th title ever to reach the milestone.

With her Wicked leading role, the multihyphenate has become a capital ""S"" star — and on her new studio album I Forgive You, is telling the world who she really is.


													By
												

	Stephen Daw


Pride Editor


There was a time when Cynthia Erivo could glide around town on her Razor scooter in peace. “Don't laugh!” she quips as she reminisces about those halcyon days while sitting in a cozy loft above a cavernous Los Angeles studio. “I've been doing it for years!”


	Whether maneuvering New York's busy streets or transporting her from her L.A. home to a nearby studio to record voice-over work, Erivo's reliable kick scooter was once her preferred mode of transit. But even a decade ago, she was warned that her hobby wasn't sustainable with the life she was building. “[Director] John Doyle said to me, ‘Cynthia, you're not going to be able to do that for very long,' ” she recalls. “And I was like, ‘But why? I'm good! It's fine!' ”

	











	His prediction ultimately came true. In the years since making her 2015 Broadway debut in Doyle's production of The Color Purple, Erivo has transformed from buzzy theater ingenue to certified, capital “S” star by practically every metric. At just 38, the multihyphenate is already nearly an EGOT (she's only missing her Oscar, despite three nominations); has starred in prestige TV series like The Outsider, Genius and Poker Face; paid tribute to musical legends at the Kennedy Center; and, most recently, scooped up that third Oscar nom with Wicked, the highest-grossing musical adaptation in film history.

	











	Along the way, Erivo hasn't lost sight of what matters to her, using the star power she has accrued for good. When she publicly came out as queer in 2022, she cited the importance of helping “some young Black queer actress somewhere” feel less alone in the industry. At the top of 2025, she took home GLAAD's prestigious Stephen F. Kolzak Award for her continuing commitment to promoting visibility for the LGBTQ+ community. And in June, she'll bring her talents to the massive WorldPride celebrations in Washington, D.C., making sure that everyone hears her voice — including politicians aiming to strip her community's rights.


	For her latest endeavor, though, Erivo decided to take the same energy she puts into both her community and others' projects and turn it inward. She didn't take to the stage or the screen, but rather the studio, looking to reinvigorate her solo music career — and the result is her revelatory second album, I Forgive You, out June 6 through Verve and Republic Records.


	Back in September 2021, Erivo released Ch. 1 Vs. 1, her debut LP of adult contemporary tracks where she aimed — and, reflecting today, thinks she failed — to provide a soundtrack to her life up until that point. “It never quite felt like it was mine,” she says. She recounts working with a group of “lovely” producers and writers who provided plenty of new ideas and sounds — yet the project itself underutilized her own vocal dexterity. “It didn't feel like it was one uniform story.”


	So when she began thinking about her next album, she started from scratch. On the advice of Wicked co-star Ariana Grande, Erivo met with Republic Records chairwoman and chief creative officer Wendy Goldstein to discuss her strengths and figure out a path forward. What could Erivo do that nobody else could? “Everything fell into place really fast from there,” Goldstein recalls of their first meeting.

	











	The answer was simple: Erivo's greatest asset is and always has been her protean voice, an instrument that belies her diminutive frame and lets her craft entire worlds of intricate harmonies. Her mother has said she first heard her daughter sing beautifully at a mere 18 months old, though Erivo has since said she first recognized her own innate talent around the ripe old age of 11. Following a brief stint studying music psychology at the University of East London, she dropped out, later enrolling at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London (where she now serves as vice president). After graduating in 2010 and spending three years performing around the United Kingdom, Erivo landed a breakthrough role in the off-West End production of The Color Purple in 2013.


	“Anyone who saw her in that performance knew pretty quickly that she was just a generational talent,” says Jessica Morgulis, Erivo's longtime manager who began working with her a year before The Color Purple transferred to Broadway in 2015. “In all my days of going to the theater, I've never seen the entire audience leap out of their seats mid-song in applause.”


	So when it came to creating her own music, Goldstein asked why Erivo wasn't leaning into her biggest strength. “When you hear Cynthia's voice, you're transfixed. I felt like we needed to lead with that,” Goldstein says. “We spoke a lot about how to really highlight her vocals, using it as an instrument with stacking and layering to create beautiful production.”


	That, Erivo says, unlocked something for her. “Wendy is a very singular human being who just gets it,” she says. “It was the first time that everything became really clear. To have someone who understands who you are as a musician and a singer and an artist was just a new experience within this space for me as an artist.”

	











	The subsequent project, executive-produced by Erivo and her longtime collaborator, Will Wells, spans pop, soul, jazz, disco, gospel and more, with her voice front and center. But more importantly, after a career dedicated to portraying characters, I Forgive You is just Erivo, telling the world who she is.


	“People see a very cookie-cutter version of me, and we do this thing with people where we isolate them or crystallize them in one space and go, ‘She's just that,' ” she says. “People don't know me as a musician in the way they're getting to know me now.”


As Erivo arrives for our conversation, you'd never guess that she's coming off one of the biggest performances of her life. Less than 48 hours earlier, she was belting out her forthcoming ballad, “Brick by Brick,” and Prince's “Purple Rain” alongside maestro Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic during a surprise appearance at the orchestra's Coachella set. “I was so surprised at how vast that audience was,” she giddily admits. “It was unbelievable.”


	Though Erivo remains humbly awestruck by the ensemble inviting her to perform for her biggest crowd to date, her own reputation has preceded her from the jump. “I mean, for anyone who likes singers, all of our algorithms were just filled with endless bootlegs of her singing her f–king ass off,” all-star songwriter Justin Tranter says of her Tony Award-winning Broadway debut.


	But while the world was tuned into Erivo's jaw-dropping performances of The Color Purple's showstopper “I'm Here,” she found herself focused on something else entirely while playing the character of Celie: her sexuality. “I hadn't really ever explored [my queerness], I hadn't really ever discovered or understood or really learned about it,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, I get to play this woman who is exploring and learning about her own queerness at the same time as trying to discover what love is.' This sort of wonderful thing happened at the same time — I got to do the same for myself.”


	Erivo had been out to her close friends and family since her early twenties, but playing Celie for two years began to open the door to come out publicly, as fully embodying the experience of a queer woman eight times a week slowly made her more assured. “It's like your feet finally hit the ground,” she explains. “Even the work that I started doing, whether I'm on a set or in a studio, I just felt a lot more relaxed.”

	











	With that newfound sense of ease came a wave of projects. After closing out her run in The Color Purple, she booked her first film roles, in Drew Goddard's Bad Times at the El Royale and Steve McQueen's Widows, holding her own on-screen with stars like Viola Davis and Jeff Bridges. With her starring performance in 2021's Harriet, Erivo earned her first pair of Academy Award nominations (for best actress and best original song) — had she won, she would have become the youngest person ever to earn EGOT status.


	“How lovely is that? To be in this position at this point in my career is one, a privilege — but two, a massive surprise,” Erivo says of her near EGOT. “To be one of those people that's on the edge of even looking that in the face is quite wonderful.”


	Morgulis credits Erivo's sharp instincts, saying she's “almost never wrong” when picking projects and pointing to her client's multiple viral performances at the Kennedy Center Honors, where Erivo has honored Dionne Warwick, Julie Andrews and Earth, Wind & Fire, as an example.


	“Often, the producers of something like that will be leaning one way, because whoever it is you're paying homage to has some favorite song of theirs they want to hear,” she says. “But Cynthia knows herself so well and will say, ‘I know I can really give this individual the best performance from me if we do this other song.' And every time, she nails it.”


	Yet despite her many successes, Erivo says nothing could have prepared her for the cultural phenomenon that was Wicked. She knew the film would do well, but she never predicted it would break box-office records and earn a whopping 10 Oscar nominations. “It's insane,” she says. “And it's insane while it's happening, too.”

	











	Of all Wicked's achievements, none shocked Erivo as much as the soundtrack's immediate Billboard chart success. It bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 (the highest debut for a film adaptation of a stage musical in the chart's history), ruled the Top Album Sales and Vinyl Albums charts, and landed seven songs on the Billboard Hot 100, with her own version of “Defying Gravity” earning the highest position among them at No. 44. “The cast was like, ‘Oh, so it's just in the ether now? People are just listening to it on their way to work at this point?' ” Erivo recalls. “It's really wonderful.”


	The second part of the duology, Wicked: For Good, will arrive in November, and Erivo warns fans unfamiliar with the source material that her viridescent heroine, Elphaba, enters much darker territory in the second act. “She's able to access her rage more,” she says. “The scent I wore changed. The makeup changed. Little shifts that bring you to a more mature version of who Elphaba becomes. And she is delicious in this next one.”


	The Wicked Witch of the West isn't the only one who has changed in between the two films' releases — with rave reviews and another Oscar nomination for her stellar performance in the first act, Erivo became a household name practically overnight. That transition has occasionally felt scary, especially when it comes to maintaining her personal privacy.


	“I think there is an interesting thing that happens, where it's assumed that because you're in the public eye, everything is for everyone,” she explains. “But being in the public eye does not stop you from being a human being — you just have eyes on you now. I am totally OK to share some of my life — whenever you see me on the stage, whenever you hear me sing, whenever you see me act, I am sharing. But that doesn't mean that everything gets to be yours. I should be able to keep something for myself.”

	











	That “something” likely includes her visible, but never publicly confirmed (including for this story) relationship with lauded producer-writer Lena Waithe. “You also wouldn't want me to share everything — nobody should have to, because then what's left?” she says with a half-smile. “You can be grateful, but you can still have a boundary.”


	But thanks to the groundwork she has laid over the course of the last decade, Erivo says she doesn't feel flummoxed by her sudden stardom. “I'm glad that I had those breakthroughs before — it's school for what might come, and it means that here and now, it doesn't feel like it's going to sweep me up,” she says. “A lot of us fear that if this happens, you'll sort of lose yourself. But I still feel like myself.”


There is a moment in “Play the Woman,” an early, R&B-adjacent standout from I Forgive You, when Erivo taps an unexplored topic in her career thus far: unabashed desire. “I could run these hands of mine down the map of your spine/Feel how your heat against my fingertips could make the blood in me rush,” she croons on the pre-chorus before blooming into her glossy head voice: “Could you play the woman for me?/Go slow, 'cause I like what I see.”


	Erivo had long wanted to explore sensuality in her acting. But when the parts didn't materialize, she decided to take matters into her own hands. “Honestly, you rarely get that opportunity as Black women anyway,” she says. “So I was just like, ‘Well, if I don't put it in my own music, I'll never get to put it anywhere else.' ”


	That ethos runs through I Forgive You, as Erivo breaks out of the boxes that the industry at large constructed around her ever-growing career while simultaneously giving voice to the parts of herself that she was once too scared to reveal in public. Whether she's providing a grooving rumination on self-doubt with “Replay” or delivering an airy ballad about finally finding connection after years of trying on “I Choose Love,” Erivo lays all her cards on the table.

	











	“It wasn't scary to write because I really didn't know how else to write it. It had to come,” she explains. “The scary thing was getting ready to share it. When something is personal, you hope that people understand that your humanity exists and they're not just listening to random stories that come from nowhere.”


	When going into their sessions with Erivo, Tranter was already well-aware that she had one of the best voices in the business. What they quickly discovered was just how adept a songwriter she was, too. “She's a real visionary in that she knows what the f–k she's doing,” Tranter says. “It's not even that I was surprised, it's just that the world doesn't know her that way. You don't know what to expect when someone like Cynthia hasn't been able to reveal all her talents yet.”


	That's a recurring theme in Erivo's career: One of the main hurdles she faced while working on her debut album was record executives who were unsure how to utilize her talents or market her. She recalls one telling her, “You can sing everything, and we don't know what to do with you.” Her response? “ ‘Why don't we just try everything, then?' ” she remembers. “ ‘If I can do it, then why not try?' ”


	It's a refrain Morgulis returns to often. With her client's aspirations spreading across multiple fields of entertainment, the manager says that it's vital for her to help Erivo remain in control of the projects she's working on. “That conversation of not putting her in a box and, importantly, not allowing others to put her in a box, is happening on every single level of her team,” Morgulis says. “That act alone kind of sends a message to the industry of who she is and what direction she's going in.”

	











	And recently, Erivo has applied that philosophy to discussing her identity. After coming out publicly on the cover of British Vogue in 2022, she assumed a rare position in the entertainment business as a Black queer woman in the public eye, and it's a platform she takes seriously.


	Her decision to come out, Erivo says, had less to do with her own sense of self-actualization and more to do with the deep sense of care she feels toward her community. “I think I was actively looking for those who were encouraged to be more themselves,” she says. “I can't change a person's opinion of me; if they want to feel some way, there is nothing I can do about that. But I was so excited about being able to at least be one more face where someone could say, ‘Oh, my God, she did it and can still do it. She's still creating, she's still making. So maybe I can also do the same.' ”


	In hindsight, Erivo says she didn't feel any trepidation about her decision to come out and didn't notice any significant change in the roles she booked or the feedback she received for her performances. “Maybe I'm naive and wasn't paying attention to it, because I'm sure there was [pushback],” she confesses.


	The one notable exception came in early 2025, when the Hollywood Bowl announced that Erivo would star in the titular role of its upcoming three-night production of Jesus Christ Superstar. A predictable wave of conservative outrage followed at the thought of a Black queer woman portraying Jesus Christ, accusing the actress and the production itself of “blasphemy.”

	











	Erivo can't help but laugh. “Why not?” she chuckles with a shrug, before adding that most of those comments don't seem to understand the critical lens of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. “You can't please everyone. It is legitimately a three-day performance at the Hollywood Bowl where I get to sing my face off. So hopefully they will come and realize, ‘Oh, it's a musical, the gayest place on Earth.' ”


	It's easy for Erivo to dismiss a vocal minority decrying the mere announcement of her casting in a limited-run performance; it becomes much harder when the conversation turns to politics. Like many, she has watched in horror as the Trump administration has attempted to strip the rights of and federal protections for queer and trans people across the country through a flurry of executive orders.


	Erivo doesn't pretend to have all of the answers. “I'm trying to be a person you can get positive things from, because that is the only way you can balance this stuff,” she says with a sigh. But when she looks at something like the current administration's “anti-woke” takeover of the Kennedy Center — the place where she has delivered some of her most iconic performances to date — she can't help but feel a sense of dread. “I don't know who gains what from that. I hope that it comes back,” she says. “It's really sad to have to watch this happen to it. The Kennedy Center is supposed to be a space of creativity and art and music for everyone.”


	Yet Erivo refuses to let that dread rule her actions. It's part of why, during Pride Month, she will perform a headlining set at the closing concert for WorldPride in Washington, D.C., alongside Doechii. “I want to encourage people to not decide to just tuck away and start hiding and not being themselves anymore, because that is exactly what they want,” she says. “The more yourself you are, the more you are in front of people who don't necessarily understand, the better understanding starts to happen.”


	Tranter points to that sentiment as a perfect example of why Erivo has become such a powerful voice in the entertainment industry. “Cynthia being Black and queer, and being one of the most famous people alive in this moment while our community is dealing with what we are dealing with, is no mistake,” they say. “For someone as talented as her to be a beacon for young Black queer people all over the world, to be in the most successful movie and releasing a gorgeous, poetic album in this moment is no accident.”

	











	It's apparent that Erivo holds herself to an incredibly high standard. As Morgulis rattles off the singer's schedule for the next few months — wrapping up filming on the forthcoming feature film adaptation of Children of Blood and Bone, hosting the 2025 Tony Awards and performing at least six solo concerts around the country, among dozens of other obligations — she must pause for a breath. “It's a lot,” she says. “But she can do it.”


	But today, the singer stops short of perfectionism. Even in a career as fortunate as hers, she knows that she cannot be everything to everyone. “I used to say, ‘I don't want to make any mistakes. I don't want to get anything wrong,' ” she recalls. “What I'm leaning toward is just trying to be the best version of myself, full stop. And hopefully, the best version of myself is enough for those who want it.”

Duran Duran are officially back in the lab with one of their most legendary collaborators.


	On Saturday (June 1), the iconic U.K. band teased new material via Instagram, sharing a snapshot from Abbey Road Studios with the caption, “Working with our good friend Nile at Abbey Road Studios this weekend. Stay tuned…”


Nile Rodgers, who's been behind some of the band's biggest hits, also shared the moment on his socials, writing, “We had as much fun working yesterday as ever!” The reunion marks the first time Rodgers and Duran Duran have worked together in nearly a decade, following their last collaboration on 2015's Paper Gods, which featured the funk-infused single “Pressure Off” with Janelle Monáe and cracked the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic.

	Rodgers' relationship with the band stretches back more than 40 years. He remixed their first Billboard No. 1 single “The Reflex” in 1984, produced the fan-favorite “The Wild Boys,” and went on to helm their fourth studio album Notorious (1986). His signature grooves helped shape Duran Duran's post-new wave sound during a critical period of their evolution. 


	The super-producer later reunited with them for 2004's Astronaut, marking the return of the original five-piece lineup.

	The news arrives just days before Duran Duran kick off their European and U.K. tour with Rodgers and CHIC joining as special guests. The tour begins June 3 in Finland and includes major stops in Amsterdam, Rome, Dublin and the U.K., wrapping in early July.


	While the band hasn't confirmed whether the Abbey Road sessions are for a new album or standalone release, this marks the first major studio move since their Halloween-themed album Danse Macabre, released in 2023.

	











	Duran Duran have sold over 100 million records worldwide and earned two Grammy Awards. Their latest chart appearance came with Future Past in 2021, which debuted at No. 28 on the Billboard 200. Rodgers, meanwhile, remains one of music's most decorated producers, with credits spanning David Bowie, Madonna, Daft Punk and more.

	The sequel follows Adam Sandler's iconic character returning to the green nearly 30 years after the original to raise $300,000 for his daughter's ballet tuition.

	Sandler previously announced the Detroit rapper's inclusion in the highly anticipated sequel during a recent appearance on The Dan Patrick Show.

	“Eminem was cool, he came by, he was great,” Sandler raved of Em, adding, “I've known Eminem for a long time, he's a great guy and he came in and was funny as hell,” he said. “I think we just hung out a day with Eminem and he just shot and shot and he was insane. [He] said a million things we can use and a million that we're glad we have him on tape.” 


	The cameo-filled trailer features a slew of other big names, including Bad Bunny, Travis Kelce, Eric André, Margaret Qualley, and Martin Herlihy. 


	Bad Bunny plays Gilmore's chaotic new caddie, while Ben Stiller, Julie Bowen, and Christopher McDonald reprise their roles from the 1996 classic. The movie also stars Sandler's real-life daughter, Sunny Sandler, who plays Gilmore's daughter.


	Back in August, Sandler also discussed Travis Kelce's cameo in the comedy flick. During a Tonight Show appearance, the comedian shared of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, “He's a very nice guy. You guys would love him in real life. What a big, handsome guy. Funny and cool as hell. He's a stud and he's so funny.”

	











	Directed by Kyle Newacheck and co-written by Sandler and longtime collaborator Tim Herlihy, the film blends nostalgia with a new twist, bringing back fan-favorite characters while introducing fresh faces. Of course, Gilmore's fiery temper and unconventional golf skills are on full display once again.


	Eminem's appearance comes during a prolific era for the rapper. His 2024 album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, moving 281,000 equivalent album units in its first week and marking his 11th No. 1 album.


	The album's lead single, “Houdini,” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, earning Eminem his 23rd career top 10 single and his highest chart debut since “The Monster,” featuring Rihanna, which logged four weeks at No. 1 in December 2013-January 2014. 


	Menawhile, Post Malone is co-headlining the Big Ass Stadium Tour with Jelly Roll, which kicked off in April 2025 and runs through July in North America, before heading to Europe in August and September. The tour supports Post Malone's country-inspired album F-1 Trillion, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


Happy Gilmore 2 swings onto Netflix July 25. Watch the film's latest trailer below.

	The British heavy metal veterans' recently-launched tour takes place as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, with the group kicking things off with a pair of sold-out dates in Budapest, Hungary last week.

	Prior to the tour's launch, Smallwood took to Iron Maiden's website to request that fans put their phones back into their pockets and witness the show as it's supposed to be seen.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“We really want fans to enjoy the shows first hand, rather than on their small screens,” Smallwood wrote. “The amount of phone use nowadays diminishes enjoyment, particularly for the band who are on stage looking out at rows of phones, but also for other concertgoers. 


	“We feel that the passion and involvement of our fans at shows really makes them special, but the phone obsession has now got so out of hand that it has become unnecessarily distracting especially to the band. I hope fans understand this and will be sensible in severely limiting the use of their phone cameras out of respect for the band and their fellow fans.”


	In the wake of the band's first few shows of their latest tour, Smallwood shared a reflective post on social media over the weekend, thanking fans for their support of new drummer Simon Dawson, and applauding those who heeded his request for limited phone usage during the gigs.

	











	“A huge thank you to every one of you who kept your phones down, respected the band and your fellow fans, and embraced the show the way it's meant to be experienced – in the room with us,” Smallwood said. “That was a great boost for us and the band appreciated it greatly. It is so much better when they can see you unencumbered and that drives them on without that distraction. For the selfish few that didn't and just had to keep videoing… I wish you nothing but a very sore arm!


	“But they were few, and we do hope this support from fans, especially in the floor area in front of the sound desk, continues in Prague tomorrow and beyond,” he added. “As I said before, by all means take the odd quick pic as a memento of a great night, but otherwise please keep your phone in your pocket.”


	Iron Maiden's current Run for Your Lives World Tour marks their performances since wrapping the The Future Past Tour in São Paulo, Brazil in December. That tour was the last to feature drummer Nicko McBrain, who announced his “decision to take a step back from the grind of the extensive touring lifestyle.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Major layoffs are underway Monday the Walt Disney Company, with several hundred employees impacted globally, Deadline has learned. The bulk of them are across divisions of Disney Entertainment, including marketing for both film and television as well as television publicity, casting and development. Also affected are Disney's corporate financial operations.


	According to sources, the size of the cuts on the film and TV side of Disney Entertainment is comparable. No teams are being eliminated. The majority of the Disney Entertainment Television staffers are said to be based in Los Angeles. Deadline will continue its coverage as more details about those impacted emerge during what is expected to be a tough day on the Disney campuses.

	











	This is the fourth — and largest — round of layoffs in the past 10 months that has affected various Disney television operations. They are part of an ongoing cost-cutting process at the traditional media companies as they reshape their business to focus on streaming while facing economic headwinds. Disney's Bob Iger set the pace upon his return as CEO, establishing a goal of at least $7.5 billion in cost reductions at the start of 2023, with about 7,000 jobs eliminated that year.




			Watch on Deadline		







In early March, just under 200 Disney employees were laid off, representing almost 6% of the workforce in the ABC News Group and Disney's entertainment networks, including Freeform and FX.


	A big restructuring last October involved the shutdown of ABC Signature, with its operations folded into 20th Television, and the consolidation of ABC and Hulu Originals scripted drama and comedy teams. It resulted in about 30 Disney Entertainment Television layoffs.

	











	And last July, DET underwent a round of staff cuts that impacted roughly 140 people, representing about 2% of the total workforce, 60 of them at National Geographic.


	The latest cuts follow Disney's better-than-expected Q2 earnings last month, fueled largely by  experiences and sports, with streaming also delivering strong results as direct-to-consumer operating profit increased by $289 million to $336 million. At the annual shareholder meeting earlier this spring, Iger spoke about creating new jobs, largely in Disney experiences, including theme parks.


	The Disney layoffs also come on the heels of staff cuts at NBCUniversal as the company is spinning off several cable networks into a new company named Versant.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios is finalizing a deal to acquire Split Fiction, a hot feature package based on the video game of the same name, which is set to team Wicked helmer Jon M. Chu and actress Sydney Sweeney, sources tell Deadline.


	We're told the deal is coming in at north of $2 million. We were first to report on bidding for the project a couple of weeks ago, when Sony was among others in the race. Script is by Paul Wernick & Rhett Reese, the duo behind recent Marvel Studios hit Deadpool & Wolverine.


	Developed by Hazelight Studios and powered by Unreal Engine, Split Fiction centers on two writers — Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster — who become trapped inside a simulation created by Rader Publishing, a tech company that uses AI to mine authors' ideas. The pair must work together to escape as they navigate through surreal environments, inspired by their respective genres of sci-fi and fantasy. Sweeney will play one of the two authors, though it's presently unclear which one it will be.

	











	Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson & Mike Goldberg will produce the feature take, with Timothy I. Stevenson executive producing. Electric Somewhere is also producing, with Hazelight Studios' Josef Fares and Oskar Wolontis exec producing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Split Fiction, we a couple of weeks ago shared an update on Doug Liman's undersea supernatural film Deeper, starring Tom Cruise. We reported that Ana de Armas is poised to co-star in the flick, following an astronaut who encounters a terrifying force while on a deep dive into a never-before-explored trench. Originally set up at MGM, when the studio bought a spec from Max Landis, the film has been in development for nearly a decade. We hear McQuarrie is currently involved in penning the script. Originally, Bradley Cooper was to star, with Kornél Mundruczó directing; Idris Elba and filmmaker Baltasar Kormákur teamed on a later iteration that likewise failed to move forward.

	











	Chu is repped by Artists First, UTA, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman; Sweeney by Paradigm and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Wernick & Reese are repped by WME and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Story Kitchen is with WME & Pryor Cashman, and the latter also reps Hazelight Studios.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


All American has scored an eighth and final season on The CW. 


	The young-adult series from showrunner Nkecki Okoro Carroll and co-showrunner Jamie Turner was renewed for 13 more episodes Monday. No premiere date has been set, but The CW says the episodes will air in 2026.


	The news comes shortly after the Season 7 finale on May 5, which ended on quite a cliffhanger that left the legacy of the Baker family up in the air.


	“How do I condense into just a few words what would be the longest love letter to this show, the fans, the cast, crew, staff, and producers? My heart is so filled with love and gratitude for everyone who helped bring All American to life and kept it going for its historic run. It is so hard to say goodbye to the thing that you love, but we are so excited we get to do it in the way we envisioned with this final season,” showrunner and executive producer Nkechi Okoro Carrol said in a statement. “Thank you to Brad Schwartz, Channing Dungey, Brett Paul, and Greg Berlanti for supporting our vision. Thank you to the many executives at Warner Bros Discovery, CW and Berlanti Productions who have been a supportive part of the All American huddle since day one. Thank you to our OG and new generation cast members, our writers, crew and full staff for raising the bar every episode. Thank you to Spencer Paysinger, whose life inspired this epic journey. And thank you to everyone who not only watched the show, but took Spencer James's mantra of ‘Dream Big. Stay Real' to heart and were inspired to chase their seemingly impossible dreams. We see you. We salute you. Here's to leaving it all on the field one last time.”

			Watch on Deadline		







	Per The CW, All American is the top entertainment program in primetime with adults 18-49 and 25-54. It's also the No. 1 performer on the CW app. With this final season, it'll accomplish a feat few shows have been able to in the modern television era with eight seasons and 132 episodes. 

	











	“All American is one of the greatest CW shows of all time and we are honored to bring it back for one final season to give fans a chance to say a meaningful goodbye to these inspiring characters and this incredible world,” Brad Schwartz, President of The CW Network, said in a statement of his own. “The series took bold new steps in Season 7, adding exciting new characters to the ones we already love, and viewers truly embraced it all. From the first episode of Season 7 to the last, viewership grew 71% among adults 18-49 and 55% among those age 25-54. We cannot wait to see the emotion, heart, and magic that Nkechi Okoro Carroll and the entire cast and creative team deliver in giving this story the proper ending it deserves.”


	Added Channing Dungey, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and WBD U.S. Networks: “Since the moment All American kicked off, the audience fell in love with these characters and their heartfelt stories. Season 7 provided a rare opportunity to keep this world for the fans while introducing new characters alongside some beloved favorites. I couldn't be more thrilled to see this story continue for an eighth and final season. I know Nkechi and our very talented team of writers and executive producers will deliver something unforgettable. Thank you to Greg and Sarah at Berlanti Productions for their leadership, and to our partners at The CW for this opportunity.”


All American underwent a big cast overhaul for its 13-episode seventh season after much of the original cast departed at the end of Season 6, including Daniel Ezra as Spencer James. The departures made way for a new generation, and the series reset to follow a fresh group of Los Angeles teenagers at Beverly Hills High and South Crenshaw High.


	Particularly for Ezra's Spencer, the story had already been building toward a complete character arc and, in the final episodes of Season 6, he makes it to the NFL, wins the Super Bowl, and gets married. However, Deadline also understands that the Season 7 renewal was also likely contingent on a budget cut that would have made it unfeasible to retain the entire original cast, whose episodic rates would understandably have been too high to be sustainable.


	Michael Evans Behling, Greta Onieogou, and Bre-Z returned as series regulars for Season 7, while new cast included Osy Ikhile and Nathaniel McIntyre. Antonio J. Bell and Alexis Chikaeze were also upped to series regulars for Season 7.


	Season 7 positioned these new characters to take even more of the center stage in succeeding installments, after revealing that a few of them are related to the Baker family — and their intentions for being in Los Angeles are not entirely altruistic. 


	The series is from Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television and CBS Studios, with executive producers Nkechi Okoro Carroll, who serves as showrunner, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Jameal Turner, Mike Herro, and David Strauss.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


SPOILER ALERT: The final paragraphs of the following interview contain details about the ending of Maybe Happy Ending


	TV has been good to Darren Criss. He found fame on Glee and critical acclaim in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, to name just a small sampling of his television work. But talk to the Tony-nominated star of Maybe Happy Ending even briefly about his career and one thing quickly becomes clear: He really, really loves Broadway.


	Criss made his Broadway debut as Daniel Radcliffe's replacement in the 2012 revival of How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, returned as Neil Patrick Harris' replacement in 2015's Hedwig And The Angry Inch and in 2022 starred with Sam Rockwell and Laurence Fishburne in American Buffalo.












	But it's his glowingly reviewed starring role in Maybe Happy Ending that has earned Criss his first Tony nomination. Actually his first two – as a producer of the Will Aronson-Hue Park musical, Criss would take a trophy if the show takes the Best Musical award. In all, Maybe Happy Ending is nominated for 10 Tonys, including Criss' Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role/Musical. And for the second time since 2022 Criss will cohost (with Renée Elise Goldsberry) the official Tony Awards pre-show The Tony Awards: Act One. (He also recently extended his run in Maybe Happy Ending through August 31).




			Watch on Deadline		







	In this interview, Criss talks about, among other things, Broadway, the Tonys and his Tony-nominated role of Oliver, a “Helper-Bot” in a future Seoul who lives alone in a small apartment, forever hoping for the return of his owner who, unbeknownst to Oliver has assigned the obsolete robot to a retirement compound where he'll eventually run out of replacement parts. Across the hall, though, is Claire, a more recent (but still obsolete) “Helper Bot” played by Helen J Shen. The two form a bond despite learning of their impending power-down. The sweet and funny musical asks us to ponder: Is love worth the risk of certain heartbreak?

	











	The Tony Awards: Act One will stream live for free on June 8 from 6:40 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. ET (3:40 p.m. – 5 p.m. PT) on Pluto TV. The 78th Annual Tony Awards, hosted by Cynthia Erivo from Radio City Music Hall, will immediately follow, broadcast live to both coasts on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ in the U.S.


	Maybe Happy Ending is playing at Broadway's Belasco Theatre. Directed by Michael Arden, the musical stars Darren Criss, Helen J Shen, Dez Duron and Marcus Choi.


The following interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.


DEADLINE: So you could actually win two Tonys this year, right?


DARREN CRISS: I suppose the answer is yes. I'm always being so, so coy.


DEADLINE: And you're hosting the pre-show [with Renée Elise Goldsberry].


CRISS: I tend to only like doing it when I'm also in a show. So I did it while I was doing American Buffalo [in 2022] and so here we are again. I just love stacking things on. I sort of I thrive on overcommitting.


	And I love the Tony Awards ceremony. I say that specifically because I try not to put too much stock into the sort of organized accolade system of it all, which is not to trivialize its importance and its distinction. But what I love about this ceremony specifically is that it is the biggest mainstream gathering for the Broadway community, historically the biggest platform for the shows. Now things have changed in the past several years, where Broadway, because of social media and quite to an exciting and wonderful degree, in my opinion, has been able to live outside of the theaters of midtown. It used to just be cast albums and the Tonys broadcast that were our access points. This was the way that most people around the US and maybe outside the US, this is how we would get an inside look. The Tonys still have this sort of classic grandeur to them. 


	Everybody who you are seeing perform at the Tonys most likely did a matinee that day. So when you're watching a Tony broadcast, when you're watching YouTube of a famous Tony performance like Patti LuPone performing as Evita, I love to remind people that by the time that she was doing that live on television, she'd had also just done it like three hours before…This is why the Tonys are so remarkable to me. The workhorse dynamic of these people is so important to me. 


	One of the only live shows that's meant to be a live show that features a bunch of people that do live shows. So anyway, just being a part of it means a lot to me, because I love these people dearly. And, you know, people always talk on and on and on, like myself, about the community of Broadway. It's not some disingenuous canned line, it's a real thing, like we're all roommates. We all work within several blocks of each other. We've all seen each other's work. We're all familiar on a very intimate level that by the time we're all in Radio City, most of the people in that room have worked together, have hung out together, have shared experiences in a way that when you're working in film and television, just by the nature of the way those those pieces are created, don't. So, yeah, if you can't tell, I love the Tonys.


DEADLINE: Since so many of you do all know each other, and let's say you're all friends, there must still be a feeling of competition. You, for example, are going up against your friend Jonathan Groff, so what's that feel like?


CRISS: Call me a happy idiot, and naive, deluded, delusional, I genuinely feel zero percent of competition and that I can feel your readers eyes roll from my seat here at home in New York City. But it's just true, like these are all people that I have spent time with, and hope to continue to gladly spend my time and money on getting to receive their work and their art and their inspiration. These are guys that I've hung out in bars with, had laughs with, been in theaters with done projects with. I really, really, really like those guys. I love their work. I think it's all terrific. I think everybody has their own superpowers. Everybody has their own unique thing. And any one of these guys can do stuff I can't do, and that can be said of everybody in that [best acting] category. Not because any of us are better or worse, we're just different people, and we're in wildly different shows. And I have to say, and again, I know that I have a generally happy go lucky disposition, but I mean this with as much genuine objectivity as I could possibly convey: There's something very special about this Broadway season. There's something really special going on this season, with very distinct shows that have something very wonderful and distinct to offer. If there was a guy that was exactly like me in another robot show, then, yeah, it would feel like the dirty C word of competition.

	











DEADLINE: Since you mentioned robots, how were your robot movements on stage developed? You have very specific movements, as opposed to Helen's movements?


CRISS: I was talking about how we all have our own, maybe superpowers is a strong word, but we all have our bag of tricks. You know, we all have our parlor tricks as actors. And any time there's a moment in a piece where one of those tricks might be handy for the piece, you certainly want to use them. But I never thought I'd be able to employ any of my interest in physical theater in this piece, it just truly didn't cross my mind.


	This show came about in the most miraculous way in my life…There's something, dare I say, divine, about the way this thing kind of landed in my in my lap, via a friend who has been a longtime buddy, and somebody who I've admired forever, Michael Arden. We're old pals, and I always wanted to work with him. And so when this came up, I guess maybe he knew about my interest in physical theater work. 


	Michael suggested that I zoom with Moni Yakim, who was a revered professor, now retired I think, at Juilliard for many, many years. I had two zooms with him, about an hour each, just to kind of talk about the physical vocabulary of what this role could be. And then as he was going through stuff, it immediately made me think, oh my god, we're doing clown and Jacques Lecoq and commedia and mime and Marcel Marceau, the stuff that I loved a lot n high school, that I studied in college. I have to give credit to my professor Malcolm Tulip at University of Michigan, who was a Lecoq student. So I kind of got, you know, hip to that shit when I was in college, and then I took time off. I ended up studying abroad in the Italian countryside at a wonderful institution called the Accademia dell'Arte where we studied a lot of these very archaic forms of storytelling and physical storytelling that I fell in love with. 


	So I've got these tricks in my bag that just kind of sat dormant because I never thought I'd be able to use them. And my conversations with Moni kind of opened that attic doorway to go like, Oh my God, look at this dusty old box. Yes, I still have this. This is great. So I started employing a lot of those things that I was interested in, and saw how they kind of fit. 


	And to your point, about how I'm being a little different from Helen. My guiding light was to really contrast myself, not only as differently from her, but to contrast myself as much from an audience as possible, to kind of let them know what's going on immediately. Here's our characters, here's the world we live in, here's the tone, here's the heart, here's what we can laugh at and what we can take seriously. From the very opening of the show, I kind of employ all those sort of goal posts within my physicality. And from the jump, you understand this thing is not human, but there are human tendencies. And so I really wanted to use the physicality. So it's a bit of Commedia dell'arte, it's a bit of Kabuki, it's a bit of geisha, a lot of their physical vocabulary, and with a significant dash of the great Glen Keane, who's one of Disney's finest animators, and to me, one of the great animators of facial expressions. There's a lot of Disney animated film in the way that Oliver emotes with the space.


DEADLINE: Helen Shen isn't quite as robotic, which makes sense because her Helper Bot character Claire is a slightly newer model than yours.












CRISS: Helen has said and very astutely that Oliver exists with a lot of angular edges where Claire has more curves and fluidity. And I think that's absolutely true. And the more I angle, the more she curves, and the more she curves, the more I angle, it's symbiotic, this noticeable polarity between the two characters.


DEADLINE: Which brings me to my my last question. Does Claire erase her memory? Because everyone I discuss this with seems to have different ideas.


CRISS: Well, I think far be it for me to take anybody's particular perspective away from them, but I have a definitive directive from Michael Arden of what happens and I'm happy to tell you what it is, because I think it's neater storytelling, it's more tidy. I think Oliver definitely does keep his memory and Clair deletes hers. That's the play that we're telling, that's the story we're telling. That's the action that she's playing and it's the action I'm playing every night. But the theater is a living, breathing, mutating organism. What I love about people's uncertainty is that it speaks to how invested they are in the story and these characters. I love that people have their own ideas. I think we're telling a very specific story but I'm a big believer that when you make stuff and you put art into the world, it doesn't really belong to you anymore.


	When I was a kid, the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which is such a formative film for me that I will love forever, they literally ride off into the sunset. And I remember just like wanting them to ride forever, like not even time or life itself will stop these people, these heroes, from going on adventures forever. But then the sun goes down and the movie ends, but my takeaway was like, Well, surely they're gonna keep going forever, even though logic tells me they won't. But that hope that they do, and that excitement of it, despite everything I know, is such a fun feeling to hold on to.

Senior Film Reporter


	Amazon MGM Studios announced on Monday that The Accountant 2, starring Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal, will begin streaming globally on Prime Video on Thursday, June 5.


	This comes following an April theatrical release which saw the action thriller sequel gross over $100 million worldwide. Prior to that, it premiered to critical acclaim at SXSW, winning the festival's Headliner Audience Award.


	In the film directed by Gavin O'Connor, which follows up 2016's The Accountant, Affleck reprises his role as Christian Wolff, who has a talent for solving complex problems. When an old acquaintance is murdered, leaving behind a cryptic message to “find the accountant,” Wolff is compelled to solve the case. Realizing more extreme measures are necessary, Wolff recruits his estranged and highly lethal brother, Brax (Bernthal), to help. In partnership with U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), they uncover a deadly conspiracy, becoming targets of a ruthless network of killers who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried.

	











	Daniella Pineda, Allison Robertson, and J.K. Simmons also star in the film, penned by Bill Dubuque, for which Affleck, Lynette Howell Taylor, and Mark Williams served as producers.

	Grossing $155M worldwide in its 2016 theatrical release before going on to become the most-rented digital film of the subsequent year, the first Accountant introduced Affleck as a highly skilled CPA with autism who leads a double life as a forensic accountant for criminal organizations. Affleck and Matt Damon's Artists Equity served as the studio for the sequel and set the pic up at Amazon MGM after acquiring sequel rights from Warner Bros.

Longtime soap opera star and Hallmark hunk Jack Wagner is a married man. On May 31, 2025, his girlfriend of four years, musician Michelle Wolf, revealed via Instagram that the two had tied the knot in an intimate ceremony. 

Captioning a series of photos from the wedding, Wolf tagged Wagner and their photographer, and wrote, “We did it!!!!!! MARRIED in front of our little family!! #MrAndMrs ♥️♥️♥️ 💃🕺”

At the time of publication on June 2, Wagner had not yet commented on or shared his surprise wedding news publicly. It's not clear when or where the “When Calls The Heart” star married Wolf, but on May 29, Wagner shared a video of himself filming in Capri, Italy, as he prepared to make a temporary return to “The Bold and the Beautiful,” where he starred as Nick Marone from 2003 to 2012.

A post shared by Michelle Wolf (@wolfmichelle)

In a series of photos Wolf posted to Instagram, the newlyweds were beaming — with Wagner in a tuxedo and Wolf in a wedding dress and veil. Images included them laughing at an outdoor altar as the priest marrying them looked on, and posing at a small reception. 

Wagner has shared very little publicly about his relationship with Wolf, but she shared a photo of them on January 12, 2022, to mark their first anniversary together as a couple. The first time she posted a photo of them together was the previous May, sharing a brief video of them looking into a mirror, over which she wrote, “My man.”

Friends flooded Wolf's posts with comments, including Wagner's co-star in Hallmark's “The Wedding March” franchise, Josie Bissett, who wrote, “❤️❤️❤️Congratulations!!!!!❤️❤️❤️”

A friend of Wolf's wrote, “MICHELLE!! You're such a beautiful and gorgeous Mrs. Wagner! Lucky Jack!!! You both look so incredibly happy! Congratulations and I can't wait to hear about your Italy trip!! Love you so much!! ❤️👰🤵‍♂️💍”

In her series of images from the wedding, Wolf also included a blended family photo featuring the happy couple flanked by two of their grown kids — Wolf's daughter Ornella, who commented “love you mommy” on the post, and Wagner's son Peter. 

Wagner raised Peter with his ex-wife, actress Kristina Wagner. The former “General Hospital” co-stars went public with their relationship in 1990, when she was expecting Peter, and married three years later, per Soaps. They divorced in 2006. Their younger son, Harrison, died at age 27 in 2022 after years of battling addiction, the former couple shared at the time. 

In 2011, Wagner was also reunited with his daughter Kerry from a previous relationship, per People, who was put up for adoption as an infant. The two did forge a relationship and she's appeared in his Instagram posts periodically, but it's not clear if she was present for his nuptials.

Miley Cyrus shared 80% of her tattoos are mistakes she still thinks about.

In a video The New York Times posted, the “Flowers” singer gave fans insight on her tattoos.

A post shared by The New York Times Magazine (@nytmag)

When asked what is a mistake she made and still thinks about, Cyrus shared with The New York Time it is over half of her tattoos.

“A mistake that I made that I still think about is, like, 80% of my tattoos,” she said. “I don't regret them enough to laser them, but some of them, like–I mean I love my cat, but, like, I didn't need that. I love my dog, but, like, I don't know, just having a pitbull in every picture for the rest of my life is kind of intense. There's just a few I could do without.”

Fans took to the comments sections to share their love for Cyrus.

“She's so authentic and at ease with her. Love this,” one fan shared.

“She's grown into someone very beautiful,” another fan commented.

On May 30, Cyrus released her latest musical body of work, “Something Beautiful”. Fans have taken the 13-track album and made it their own as they resonate with the lyrics.

Cyrus released the official music video for track 6, “Easy Lover” from the album. The single has over 3 million streams on Spotify.

The comments section quickly filled with supportive comments.

“She is exactly what legends are made of,” one person commented. “Her passion for delivering a song is always platinum gold !!! A fierce force of what makes a girl grow into a secure centered woman always having control but truly enjoying life and spreading love to ALL !!! You truly can sense her freedom and love she wants to share with her talents in music.”

“There hasn't been a single pop artist of my generation's progression I have been more impressed with than Miley's,” another fan shared. “How good she obviously feels in her skin is so beautiful to watch and experience. She matures, takes risks, lives her art how she wants it. Good for you darling”

Fans are loving Cyrus' honesty in her music, style and lyrics.

“I am loving this Miley era!” another fan shared. “She keeps dropping tracks that kill it and just looks powerful, raw and authentic! In some ways she, the way she keeps doing this, she reminds me of Prince!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans React To JoJo Siwa & Chris Hughes' Intimate Bed Selfie","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/jojo-siwa-chris-hughes-bed-selfie/","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:55:51 GMT","

JoJo Siwa and Chris Hughes continue to spark romance rumors, this time, with an intimate bed photo. The duo shows no signs of slowing down with the PDA, despite claiming their relationship is “platonic.”

On Sunday, June 1, Hughes, 32, took to Snapchat and shared a photo of himself cuddled up under the covers with Siwa, 22. The shirtless “Love Island” alum planted a kiss on the “Dance Moms” star's forehead while she rested on his chest.

“Sleeepinnn beauty,” Hughes captioned the snap. The sweet photo comes less than a week after Siwa clarified that Hughes is not her boyfriend.

Siwa wasn't the only person Hughes spent some quality time with. The “Celebrity Big Brother” star also bonded with the singer's parents, Jessalynn and Tom.

On his Instagram Stories, Hughes shared a photo of himself playing a video game with Siwa's dad, calling him “my boy.” He also reposted a video taken by Jessalyn showing Siwa kissing him on the head during a “game night.”

In an interview with “Sunday Brunch” (per the Independent), Siwa revealed that her parents “love” and “adore” Hughes.

It feels like we're a family. It feels like he's been in my family for however many years. It feels like they just all get along as well as I do.

A post shared by Chris Hughes (@chrishughesofficial)

Meanwhile, Siwa and Hughes' latest photo together drew mixed reactions online—while some fans expressed support for the pair, others were more critical.

One fan wrote on X, “You can all hate, but Jojo found love in a different place, she's happy, jump out your hate crate and try being happy for her.”

Another chimed in, “In here for JoJo Siwa finding love in all its forms.”

A fan also gushed, “I'm here for it! As surprising as it is, they make a lovely couple and I'm OBSESSED!”

Some weren't fans of the rumored romance between the two. One user commented, “This makes me so uncomfortable cuz she literally looks like a child.”

Another pointed out, “This man can't be trusted. I don't really like Jojo Siwa, but something is off with him. Especially after posting a photo of your gf sleeping beside u.”

Another noted, “It's all publicity guys. We heard nothing at all about Chris until they started dating.”

Siwa and Hughes first sparked romance rumors while on “Celebrity Big Brother UK” in April.

Days after winning the 27th season of “The Voice,” singer Adam David treated travelers at Nashville International Airport to an impromptu concert as they all waited for their flight. 

On May 31, 2025, airport officials at Berry Field Nashville airport (BNA) posted video footage of David, 34, who was waiting to board his flight. As he stood at the gate, he pulled out his acoustic guitar to perform a mini-concert for his fellow passengers.  

The airport's social media team captioned the post, “What happens when The Voice Season 27 winner @adamdavidofficial is flying out of BNA? A live performance at the gate, of course! Huge thanks to @spiritairlines for making this unforgettable moment happen. Just another day of live music at BNA!”

A post shared by Nashville Intl Airport (@flynashville)

As David stood near the ticket counter in the video, a Spirit Airlines agent could be heard announcing over the intercom, “A huge congratulations to Adam on winning season 27 of ‘The Voice!'”

Many people seated at the gate applauded, and David then told them, “I'm gonna play a couple songs,” before launching into “Signed, Sealed, Delivered.” Many fans who saw the video couldn't believe that David's fellow travelers weren't freaking out about being serenaded by the singer. 

One person wrote, “those people are way to calm!! I would be geeking out throwing my shoe and hootin and hollerin!! you sound amazing brother so proud of you!!!”

Someone else commented, “Aaaaand that is why you WON!!!! Humble, talented beyond any doubt with a looooot of soul….🔥👏❤️ What a moment! You must be really proud of yourself! You are the real thing! God bless you and never stop loving music and performing… you were born for this!”

Another fan chimed in, “Live at the airport! Now that's a lucky group of people right there! ❤️”

“No matter where,” someone else wrote, “always putting on a grade A show!! 🔥🔥👏👏❤️❤️”

A post shared by Zack Zaro (@zackzaro)

David, who's a native of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was in Nashville to perform at the Recovery Unplugged “Sober Sessions” on May 30 alongside Struggle Jennings and “American Idol” season 20 winner Noah Thompson. 

David, 34, previously sought help from the organization's branch in Fort Lauderdale and celebrated six years of sobriety in March, he told Nashville's News Channel 5, explaining, “Getting clean wasn't easy,” he added. “I went through everything. Detox. I did the full program down there. I wanted to give myself the chance to be successful, and I didn't want to have to go through it again.”

While in Nashville, he also got to reunite and jam with some of his fellow contestants on season 27 of “The Voice,” including Zack Zaro, Tatum Scott, Page Mackenzie, and his fellow Team Bublé member Carlos Santiago. 

In a post about their reunion, Santiago wrote, “Just a couple of #bublébros reunited in Nashville! After our knockouts, I told Adam, ‘you better win…' and he did. Super proud of you bro. This is only the beginning and I pray God blesses you and keeps you on this journey you're embarking on. I'll be cheering you on the whole way! Thank you @michaelbuble for coaching us and for leading him straight to the finish line!”

Two weeks after taking second place on the season 23 finale of “American Idol,” 18-year-old country crooner John Foster thrilled fans with a glimmer of the new music he's working on, including inspiration from meeting one of his own idols. 

On May 31, 2025, Foster posted a new music video, filmed in one take, of himself performing “Amazing Grace” with a dose of his Louisiana-infused sound. 

“I thought it fitting that my first Post-Idol music video be ‘Amazing Grace', because it's His Grace that's brought me this far,” he wrote. “This is a raw, one-take recording, and every lyric, including the Cajun French chorus, is a thank you to God. Thank you Fable House for capturing this moment.”

A post shared by John Foster (@officialjohnfoster)

“American Idol” fans saw Foster perform “Amazing Grace” a couple of times, including a portion performed in Cajun French, during his hometown visit on the show, when he serenaded lawmakers at the Louisiana State Capitol on May 14. 

Within 24 hours, over 10,000 fans liked Foster's video, loved seeing his full rendition in the new music video, including one who wrote, “I loved hearing you sing Amazing Grace. John always keep this sweet humble spirit that you have ❤️❤️🙏”

Another commented, “John you are an amazing singer!! How sweet the sound. You have touched the hearts of millions with your beautiful voice. 😘”

“One of favorite gospel hymns,” someone else wrote. “Thank you for singing this one…I pray your life journey is Blessed all the way through and Beyond…Gods Blessings Always be with you…I also Loved the Cajun French added for the ‘flavor' and sentiment that represents all of us fellow Louisianans…Huggs!! 🎵🥰🎶”

On the night before the “American Idol” finale, Foster also released his first single, “Tell That Angel I Love Her,” via 19 Recordings, the show's record label partner. 

A post shared by John Foster (@officialjohnfoster)

Two days before sharing his rendition of “Amazing Grace,” Foster shared another meaningful connection to his Louisiana roots, posting a photo with local music legend Wayne Toups on May 29. 

“I'm so glad that this moment was captured,” Foster wrote. “I'm a country musician down to my bones, but there are many genres and musicians that contribute to my unique sound. One of them is this gentleman, Wayne Toups, who is a legend in Louisiana music.” 

The teen continued, “That's what good music is all about: unique sounds combining to connect with the millions. Stay tuned everyone; I'm working hard to get some great things headed your way!”

Foster and Toups — a Grammy-winning artist known for his unique blend of zydeco, Cajun, and southern rock — performed “Mathilda” together at the Cajun Country Memorial Day Festival, according to radio station Gator 99.5. 

Toups also shared photos via Facebook from the concert and wrote, “We even had John Foster hit the stage with me—pure Louisiana magic! It was one for the books!”

Foster will get to perform alongside other legends on June 7, when he makes his Grand Ole Opry debut.

It's not news that the documentary market continues to be in flux, particularly for political documentaries, with many filmmakers complaining about a lack of distribution channels. So it's good news that Netflix has closed a hybrid licensing deal for six documentary films that played well at festivals over the past year, but were not acquired by any distributor. Rather than leave the orphans in limbo, Netflix opted to give this group of diverse titles a distribution home.

The films include Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk's “The White House Effect” and “In Waves and War,” Chris Smith's “Devo,” Kimberly Reed's “I'm Your Venus,” Matthew O. Henderson's “A King Like Me,” and the late Sacha Jenkins‘ “Sunday Best.”

This out-of-the-box Netflix deal gives the docs Netflix Original status in English-speaking territories the U.K., United States, and Canada. In territories outside the English language, they are available non-exclusively.

“There are always more great films out there than there are distribution opportunities,” Netflix's Adam Del Deo, VP of Documentaries wrote IndieWire an email. “We saw a chance to bridge that gap by partnering with our licensing team to make sure these six impactful films — which all received stellar festival receptions — could be seen and loved by wider audiences. The fact that they all come from talented filmmakers we've had the privilege of working with before telling such a diverse range of stories makes this even better.”

 










It makes sense that Netflix would support established filmmakers the streamer had worked with before. They include Impact Partners‘ “The White House Effect” (October 31) from Cohen and Shenk (Netflix's “Athlete A,” “Audrie and Daisy,” and the Oscar-nominated documentary short “Lead Me Home”). “The White House Effect” was well-received at Telluride 2024, followed by 13 more festivals. The directors dig into the origin story of the current climate crisis, going back three decades, when the world was poised to stop global warming. Using exclusively archival material, “The White House Effect” depicts how a political battle in the George H.W. Bush administration changed the course of history.

Netflix also licensed Cohen and Shenk's second Telluride 2024 premiere, “In Waves and War” (November 3) a troubling story about how three Navy SEALs left their tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and returned home with treatment-resistant chronic psychological pain. They, and others in the veteran and PTSD community, are being saved, finally, by a healing psychedelic therapy.

“Netflix came up with interesting way to get films out there that hadn't found a deal yet,” said Submarine co-founder Josh Braun, who repped “In Waves and War” and “The White House Effect.” “We are happy to be part of this, because the market is challenging and this is a good opportunity to get these films out there in a bigger way than a self-release.” 

 










Netflix has also worked with doc veteran Chris Smith and his producer Danny Gabi (“Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond,” “Fyre Fest”). Smith directed Sundance 2024 Premiere “Devo” (August 19) a biodoc that explores the evolution of the art-punk New Wave band, which scored a hit with “Whip It” in 1980 and gained mainstream success with their message of societal “de-evolution,” formed in response to the 1970 Kent State shootings.

Netflix also licensed Tribeca 2024 premiere “I'm Your Venus” (June 23), directed by Kimberly Reed (“Dark Money”), which follows the biological and ballroom families of “Paris Burning” star Venus Xtravaganza as they investigate the unsolved mystery of her 1988 murder.

Another movie in the package, produced by Netflix stalwart Fisher Stevens (“Beckham,” “Dark Money,” Season 1) is Matthew O. Henderson's SXSW 2024 premiere “A King Like Me” (June 19). The movie follows members of the New Orleans cultural institution the Zulu Club, the first Black Mardi Gras krewe, as they struggle to bring the Zulu parade back to the streets for Mardi Gras Day 2022 after Hurricane Ida and losing members to gun violence and COVID. 

Also included in the Netflix buy is Tribeca 2023 debut “Sunday Best,” written by Mark Monroe and directed by the late Sacha Jenkins (July 21). Produced by Netflix veteran Rafael Marmor (“Will & Harper”), the film shows how pioneering television host Ed Sullivan platformed Black musicians during the Civil Rights era. “I was very saddened, like the rest of the documentary community, to hear the tragic news of Sacha Jenkins, the director of ‘Sunday Best,' passing away,” added Del Deo. “He was a creative force and incredibly talented. Our thoughts are with his family.”

 










As recent hits “Becoming Led Zeppelin” ($13 million worldwide) and “No Other Land” ($3.6 million worldwide) prove, a theatrical audience will show up for some docs. But the bottom line for this Netflix non-fiction sextet: these films will now be watched on the world's largest viewing platform.

It's the final installment of beloved series turned film franchise “Downton Abbey.” Aptly titled “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale,” the third film debuted its trailer during CinemaCon, and is now sharing it with audiences everywhere. Julian Fellowes returns to write the installment, which is set in the same universe as his show “The Gilded Age.” Fellowes previously teased that the elusive plot of “The Grand Finale” is “emboldened” by the clock timer invention that takes place in “The Gilded Age.”

The logline for “The Grand Finale” reads: “The time has come to say goodbye to ‘Downton Abbey.' Focus Features is bringing the beloved Crawley household to theaters for the final installment of the wildly successful franchise written by creator Julian Fellowes.”

The ensemble cast includes Hugh Bonneville, Laura Carmichael, Jim Carter, Raquel Cassidy, Brendan Coyle, Michelle Dockery, Kevin Doyle, Michael Fox, Joanne Froggatt, Harry Hadden-Paton, Robert James-Collier, Allen Leech, Phyllis Logan, Elizabeth McGovern, Sophie McShera, Lesley Nicol, Alessandro Nivola, Simon Russell Beale, Dominic West, Penelope Wilton, Arty Froushan, Joely Richardson, Paul Copley, and Douglas Reith. Paul Giamatti is also back to reprise his series role, telling EW that his character will “do something of real significance” in the film. 

 










Fellowes returns to write the script, with Simon Curtis back directing. The first “Downton Abbey” film was released in 2019 after the series concluded its six-season run. A sequel feature, “Downton Abbey: A New Era,” was released in 2022. The “Downton Abbey” series earned 69 Emmy nominations during its run and won 15, with the late Maggie Smith winning three acting awards and the show taking home Outstanding Miniseries or Movie, along with awards for hair, production design, music composition, directing, writing, cinematography, and costumes.

Fellowes told IndieWire in 2022 that he was open to returning to the franchise for a third feature if the story was right. “These things become clearer over time, if there is still a demand for more ‘Downton,' and the actors, if enough of them want to do it,” he said. “I certainly wouldn't block it. I've had five times now of thinking I've said goodbye to them and then here they are again.”

“Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale” is produced by Fellowes, Liz Trubridge, and Gareth Neame. Nigel Marchant executive produces. 

Additional Focus Features films include Chloe Zhao's “Hamnet,” Ethan Coen's “Honey Don't!,” Wes Anderson's “The Phoenician Scheme,” Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia,” and Daniel Day-Lewis' return to acting with “Anemone,” directed by his son Ronan Day-Lewis. 

 










Focus Features will premiere “Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale” September 12 in theaters. Check out the teaser below.

Netflix know that a lot of somebodies want this. The second season of “Nobody Wants This” will premiere October 23. The show first dropped on the streamer last September to sparkling reviews, with IndieWire's Proma Khosla praising the chemistry between leads Kristen Bell and Adam Brody.

The show, created by Erin Foster, finds Joanne (Bell, also an executive producer) and Noah (Brody) in a would-be conventional love story complicated by Noah's position as a rabbi. Popular podcaster Joanne isn't just not Jewish, she's also unreligious generally — as is her entire non-traditional family. As Noah and Joanne attempt to acclimate to each other's worlds, and Joanne explores converting, things get complicated — to put it lightly.

“Nobody Wants This” was renewed back in October, but the drop date was not revealed until the June 1 Netflix FYSEE L.A. Emmy event at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles. The evening featured a screening of the pilot followed by a live taping of Foster's “The World's First Podcast” with Foster, Bell, Brody and fellow cast members Justine Lupe, Timothy Simons, and Jackie Tohn.

 










Stephanie Faracy, Michael Hitchcock, Tovah Feldshuh, Paul Ben-Victor, Emily Arlook, Sherry Cola, and Shiloh Berman will also return for the next batch of episodes, and guests stars will include Miles Fowler, Alex Karpovsky, Arian Moayed, and Bell's “Gossip Girl” co-star Leighton Meester.

Foster based the series on her own life. The actress, writer and podcaster converted to Judaism after falling in love with her Jewish now-husband, Simon Tikhman. Last year, Foster discussed her experience with IndieWire.

“There were about 23 people [in my conversion class] and only three were converting for marriage, which tells you there was 20 very interesting stories going on in that room!” she said. “And I thought it was just interesting. I hadn't ever seen anybody explore that area, and I thought it'd be cool.”

Last month, Foster told IndieWire that Season 2 of “Nobody Wants This” would be “romantic and funny.”

“I'm not in the business of depriving people of what they want on a show like this, and making some like, artistic choice to rob you of what you want to see. I really tried to stay on point with Season 1, [it] was all these firsts, first kiss, first date, and this is going to be the next four to six months of the relationship what that looks like,” she said.

Ethan Hawke is back as serial killer the Grabber for indie horror hit “Black Phone 2.” Three years after “The Black Phone” first rang into theaters in 2022, its sequel already has been deemed a buzzy franchise. The first film grossed $161 million against an $18 million budget, with another installment announced in 2023. 

“Black Phone 2” is co-written by returning director Scott Derrickson along with C. Robert Cargill. The first film was based on a short story by Joe Hill, the son of Stephen King. Hawke's “the Grabber” abducted children and locked his victims in a basement; one of the kids, though (played by Mason Thames), managed to escape with the help of a haunted rotary phone that connected him to the ghosts of previously kidnapped boys. Thames is back for the sequel, along with original co-stars Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, and Miguel Mora.

“Black Phone 2” is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse, with Derrickson and Cargill also producing. Hill and Ryan Turek executive produce. Universal and Blumhouse present the Crooked Highway Production. The film was originally set for a June 27, 2025 release but was delayed until the fall. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Director and co-writer Derrickson told THR that the sequel will put an unexpected twist on the premise of the first film. “The first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is typical, a ghost story,” Derrickson said. “But in this one, you've got a ghost that is a villain.” 

He continued, citing how the plot has now differed since the lead isn't a 13-year-old boy anymore, “A middle school coming-of-age horror movie is a different animal than a high school coming-of-age horror film. There's a ratcheting up of intensity because of that.”

Derrickson previously said in interviews upon the first film's release that short story writer Hill had been speaking about expanding the entire “Black Phone 2” universe beyond just a direct sequel, as well. “It's not something that is innately exciting to me, in the case of this story. I'm interested in the characters that we created, and I think there's a tone to the movie that is unique and can be expanded upon,” Derrickson told The Wrap. “So possibly, we'll see. You never know, but I'm certainly not closed off to the idea.”

Universal will release “Black Phone 2” in theaters October 17. Check out the trailer below.

For Aesop Rock, the line between perceptive and paranoid has always been blurry. Fleeting observations can turn his thoughts into a red-string conspiracy board, mapping out complex connections in search of hidden spheres of meaning. On Tobacco's “Dirt,” for instance, he turns a glance at a yard full of topiary into a psychedelic examination of the human desire to separate from nature by taming it. His keen sense for detail can be a trap: He hears a slight noise outside on “Dog At The Door,” a shifty-eyed highlight from 2020's Spirit World Field Guide, which raises his hackles, setting his mind loose to imagine all sorts of dangerous and violent scenarios. On Black Hole Superette, Aesop still notices the little things, but instead of sending his thoughts into lysergic fractals or bullet-sweating anxiety, they more frequently bring him a sense of calm and wonder.

Despite his reputation as a writer of impenetrable abstraction and intimidating vocabulary, Aesop structures his albums around fairly digestible concepts. Labor Days, his 2001 breakthrough, scrutinized the tug of war between self-actualization and the necessity of work; 2012's Skelethon was a pitch-black analysis of how grief lingers and metastasizes; his last record, 2023's Integrated Tech Solutions, probed the systems under which we live and how they assign or strip value from art, community, and human beings themselves. With Black Hole Superette, Aesop, now closing in on 50, is primarily concerned with aging. He notices a new perspective: Growing older isn't all back pain or the lament of past lives; discovering new wrinkles can also refer to your identity.

Aesop catalogs moments of mundanity, turning them over in his hands until they reveal their quiet magic. There's an almost quizzical delight in his voice when he details the majesty of his vegetable garden during “EWR - Terminal A, Gate 20” or the various characters he runs into while walking his dog on “Movie Night.” The homebody anthem “Costco” is a tour of Aesop's insular day-to-day, which consists of washing dishes while watching Jeopardy!, dusting weed crumbs from various surfaces, and realizing he should invite people over more often. He sprinkles food in his fish tank and notices a steadily multiplying Bladder Snail, a scenario he explores in hilarious depth a few songs later on “Snail Zero,” where a newly-embraced live-and-let-live mentality overtakes his usual nervous need for order. “Bird School” is one of Black Hole Superette's giddiest tracks, with Aesop explaining the grandeur of watching 12,000 Vaux's swifts plunge into the chimney of a Portland elementary school to roost. So much of Aesop's past work feels near agoraphobic, taking place within the confines of his mind or the walls of his apartment—but here he is, sitting with hundreds of other Portlanders to observe the astonishing spectacle. He pulls a Diet Coke from his cooler and snacks on kiwi slices, both of which are on offer if you'd care to join him.

Sometimes these instances of hushed profundity arrive as recovered memories, like how in 1996, he learned about his favorite documentary, When We Were Kings, from an artist talk delivered by “John Something,” a painter or photographer whose name he can't recall. On “Unbelievable Shenanigans,” he raps, “It's interesting what the memory cherry picks and what it pardons,” intrigued by how his brain retains the survival of an escaped pet hamster when he was a child, but not her death. The next line, “We're nothing if not silver linings stuffed into compartments,” has a bit of Aesop's trademark sardonic bite, but it's softened just a bit, as if he's starting to recognize that the lessons of the past don't always have to come strictly from trauma. Now, he seems more fascinated than alarmed by his ever-churning inner workings.

He largely avoids the sepia-toned nostalgia that can plague albums about discovering grays; any rearview-peeking inclinations show up primarily in the production. Since Skelethon, Aesop has handled the beats on solo albums, landing on a mix of chunky, cybernetic funk and jittery synth sequences. He gravitates toward tumbling, heavy drums and thick, distorted basslines—this is the guy who hired Yo La Tengo to be his backing band for a Late Show appearance. Black Hole Superette features some of his best compositions to date, a whittling down of his maximalist tendencies in favor of a more spacious sound that prioritizes wispy atmosphere over cluttered claustrophobia. He leans more into the rap production styles popular during his youth: The herky-jerky rhythms of “Checkers” and “Charlie Horse” have the blocky feel of the late 1980s, while “The Red Phone” evokes the ricocheting noise of the Bomb Squad. “Send Help,” with its syncopated chord structure and fluttery guitar line, could fit nicely on almost any release from the Rawkus heyday, while “Ice Sold Here” is a cold b-boy groove, looping like a DJ's beat juggling routine. Aesop occasionally matches that energy with his flow, pulling his words taut on songs like “Himalayan Yak Chew” and “Snail Zero” in a way that evokes Grandmaster Caz or early Chuck D.

“Black Plums,” a neon-lit cut in Black Hole Superette's final stretch, is the key to unlocking the album's themes. Over foggy pads and a simple breakbeat, Aesop considers the plum tree in his yard an avatar for the uncaring march of time. As the plums “[get] fatter every summer,” Aesop knows there's yet another year behind him, each one filled with once-impossible challenges. The plums become those silver linings he rapped about in “Unbelievable Shenanigans,” a reminder of the sweetness of being alive even at its most difficult. A bite of a plum is a moment for presence, what he calls his “version of smelling a rose.” The existential chorus feels like a sigh of relief: “I'm a particle—a minute quantity of matter/The least possible amount of data.” He's found the freedom in realizing he's but a blip in the grand scheme, and as the days wind down on his tiny corner of the universe, he's learning how to access the beauty of it all.

Halfway through Negotiations, the latest EP from Kilo Kish, the Los Angeles pop experimentalist suddenly sounds like an AI assistant experiencing ego death. “When I came to myself/I was gone/And no one else/Knew but me,” she murmurs during “When I Came to Myself,” a slow-burn highlight from the follow-up to Kish's consumerism-critiquing 2022 album American Gurl. Her glitchy delivery adds a menacing glare to the heightened sense of self-awareness that recurs like a pop-up ad throughout Negotiations. The EP's chrome-plated pop and electro music balances self-worth with self-sabotage, suggesting you can rewrite bad habits into more productive ways of living like you would update your laptop's software.

A corresponding website for Negotiations describes it as an “exploration of the human body and mind as interconnected machines navigating the complexities of modern life,” including the way a working artist can come to feel like a cog in a machine. Accompanying music videos show Kish in dystopian corporate offices and breakrooms, quietly bristling against the sterile environments (in one short clip, she's put on hold with the music industry itself, transmogrified into a purgatorial, always-busy phoneline). The EP's cold sound palette, coproduced by Kish and longtime collaborator Ray Brady, conveys this theme; sharp-cornered synths, punchy programmed beats, and vocoder-warped, monotone vocals establish an icy, intentionally distancing effect across the six tracks.

The heady concept works alongside Kish's laconic lyrics, which openly address being at war with your own invasive thoughts. “Frankly, I'm just going through the motions,” she admits on the highlight “Reprogram,” her terse delivery punctuated by stuttering, robotic backing vocals. Then she drops the posture for the chorus, where she tries to suss out the source of her feelings of defeat: “Every time I think I want to do this/Waiting for the second movement,” she sings, voicing a sentiment familiar to anyone who's endured crushing burnout, “Every time I think I want to try, I don't want to try.” Opener “Digital Emotional,” meanwhile, turns mechanical wordplay into a delightful, straightforward pop workout. Whizzing synths ratchet up the track's airy, singsong verses whose lyrics link emotional aloofness to technological distance. The song's dazzling, heartsick chorus—where Kish's voice climbs up into a brisk, imploring register—is among the most memorable and emotionally resonant in her catalog.

Negotiations' only misstep is “Negotiate,” a collaboration with R&B crooner Miguel. Trading verses in a foggy back-and-forth, the pair sound muted beneath pointillist synth notes and a lumbering beat. The washed-out song briefly drags down the EP's momentum; Kish achieves a more effective buildup on the kiss-off “DCMU,” another track draped in glistening vocoder effects. Here, Kish takes on a slippery flow over clattering drums to dress down a former lover who messed up so badly she's now forced to “obsess over the careless nature of the male species.” Each verse builds toward a cyclonic swirl of stomping drums and synths, amped up to a piercingly affecting crescendo. For all the existential concerns lurking within her lyrics, these moments when Kish's honeyed melodies coalesce with her airtight production effortlessly brightens up Negotiations' anxious perspective.

							By 

	Amal Naj



	President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, the fourth largest contributor to America's trade imbalance, after machinery and electrical equipment and automobiles. A vast majority of these imports are low-cost medicines which account for 90 percent of all prescriptions filled in the U.S. Millions of Americans take them daily for heart diseases and strokes, and to treat life-threatening infections. Disruption of their supply will have catastrophic consequences on America's health, for pharmaceuticals aren't like cars or smart phones one can do without — they're a basic necessity, like food and water.


	But there's a serious case to be made to bring back a large chunk of the manufacturing to the U.S. for reasons of national security, especially in the current divisive and uncertain political climate. It is no secret that the U.S. and China are currently in a testy relation that could escalate into a full blown military conflict over Taiwan. What if supply of these drugs are interrupted? Could there be a scenario where Americans aren't able to attend to machinery in factories or on the farm or, worse, aren't able to respond to a national threat because they don't have the medicines to stay fit for the job?

	











	Tariffs, however, will not alleviate such a scenario. But America's vulnerability is real, and it will take a concerted effort on multiple fronts to make America self-reliant in health care.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The problem with trying to relocate manufacturing of these drugs to the U.S. — which is the president's objective with tariffs — is that these imports are low-margin products. Companies will have a hard time making a business case to manufacture them in the U.S. They can't compete with India and China, the two countries that account for most of the supply of these “commoditized” pharmaceuticals to America, saving the American health care system reportedly more than $400 billion annually.


	India is the main source of supply to the U.S.; in chronic diseases (which account for 90 percent of national health care expenditure) it supplies 60 percent of all hypertension medicines and 90 percent of the two most prescribed blood pressure medicines, amlodipine and losartan. But the kicker is that India relies on China for 70 percent of the raw material. And China directly supplies 40 percent of all raw ingredients used in the U.S. to manufacture drugs.

	For certain life-saving antibiotics like cephalosporins, azithromycin, and penicillin, the dependence on China is as high as 90 percent. One single key ingredient, 6-aminopenicillanic acid, or 6-APA — which is the starting material for a class of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections and is growing in demand — is largely sourced from China. 


	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that in 2019, 72 percent of the raw materials that went into drugs prescribed in the U.S. came from FDA-approved facilities that were located outside the country. 


	In 2021, the Biden administration singled out the raw materials used in drugs sold in the U.S. as being just as critical for national security as semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals. It pointed to antibiotics as an example, citing a 2019 report from China that spoke of Beijing considering leveraging export of “antibiotics as a retaliatory tool in the U.S.-China trade war.” It mentioned Xinhua, China's state media, suggesting China could assume “strategic control” over supplies and limit exports.


	And during Trump's first term, Gary Cohn, then an economic adviser, warned at a security hearing that a Department of Commerce study found that 97 percent of all antibiotics in the U.S. came from China. “If you're the Chinese and you want to really just destroy us, just stop sending us antibiotics,” he said.

	When a skirmish broke out between India and China over a border dispute in 2020, Indian companies became alarmed about whether they would be able to manufacture antibiotics for the country. A story in the Times of India reported that the country depended on China for 90 percent of the raw materials to make the lifesaving drugs. Indian companies urged the government to provide help to bring production back into the country, which they had lost due to China's 15-20 percent cost advantage. 

	











	An executive of a leading manufacturer of antibiotics in India (which manufactures for my firm) said, “We can switch to another country, but the starting chemical to make the raw material comes from China. Without China, we are finished.”


	But China can't be blamed for its success — and its competitors' despair. More than a decade ago, it declared that medicines were a basic necessity for its huge population. With government support, it meticulously invested in large-scale manufacturing plants and manufacturing innovation to make pharmaceutical raw materials cheaply. It was a clever strategy of self-reliance, having full control of the hundreds of raw materials on which others depended.


	U.S. drugmakers seemed not to care. For one, making pharmaceutical raw materials often involves hazardous compounds, and it generates harmful pollutants that are costly to contain. But the biggest reason is that as world leaders in innovation, they're highly focused on research and development. Innovation is their mission, not manufacturing. Patents protect their profit, which depends less on manufacturing costs. 


	These innovator companies have little incentive to plunge into mass manufacturing low-cost medicines, especially the raw materials, where China has a 35-40 percent cost advantage over the U.S. 


	To the president's credit, he is pushing other avenues to make these companies fall in line on his mission to rebuild American manufacturing. He has issued an executive order to push the FDA and other regulatory agencies to expedite the approval process for establishing pharma manufacturing plants in the U.S. And indeed, several leading pharma companies have announced eye-popping investments: Johnson & Johnson said it will invest $55 billion in R&D and manufacturing; Genentech, $50 billion; and Novartis, $23 billion.


	The president seems lulled by these instantaneous pledges. But the fact is they involve manufacturing mostly patent-protected, highly profitable blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes and cancer drugs, and flu vaccines. Few of these medicines are currently imported from China or India. 


	To relocate the production of the low-cost imports on which American health care is so dependent, one of the ideas that has been bandied about in the industry is to modernize and overhaul pharmaceutical manufacturing, a sort of gut-renovation. 


	Today's pharma manufacturing is primitive compared with the aerospace and semiconductor industries, even steel and autos. It's reminiscent of Normal Rockwell's painting of a druggist calmly compounding various ingredients in a mortar and pestle as a sick boy looks on with anticipation. (Parke-Davis, then the largest drug company and now owned by Pfizer, commissioned Rockwell to make a series of illustrations for its ad campaign.)

	











	Production in the factories takes place in a disjointed fashion, in batches: Raw materials are stored in drums in a room, then transferred to another, where they are mixed in a large rotating tumbler. The mixture is hauled to another room, where it's dried, and then to another room where it's pressed into a tablet or filled into a capsule, and finally these are fed into a machine that packs them in blister strips and into a box. One can imagine a continuous process going seamlessly from chemical synthesis to the final tablet or capsule, managed and monitored by sophisticated technology. (This is currently done with biological medicines, where going from cell culture to propagation to filtration, formulation, and filling of vials and syringes is a seamless, automatic process.)


	In October 2019, Janet Woodcock, then director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA, testified before a congressional committee that revolutionizing drug and drug-substance manufacturing was the only way to match the low cost of labor in China and India and bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The agency announced programs to support companies wishing to adopt innovative technologies. (It didn't respond to my request for information on the status of the program.)


	Manufacturing innovations no doubt will help slash costs, but they will be slow and incremental.  What is needed is a leapfrog to get to the goal faster. One obvious way is to strongly persuade some of the companies that export to America to move their production to the U.S. and set up modern, cost-efficient plants.

	These solutions, few as they are with complex challenges, cannot be pursued with tariffs or executive order or piecemeal actions. The administration needs to  consider a large-scale  initiative, akin to the Marshall Plan, to reconstruct pharma manufacturing with loans and grants and other incentives. If there is one industry outside of aerospace and defense, it's the pharmaceuticals where America can be forgiven for ignoring its cherished free-market principles for trade and commerce for national security. 


A former senior executive in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Naj divides his time between overseeing medicine companies he has founded and writing; his latest book, Pandastic Times (Brazen House), is a fable of the Covid pandemic.

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


Sean Combs' personal assistant “Mia” returned to the stand today for the third day, where she spoke about her reticence to come forward sooner with allegations of sexual assault against Combs. “I was terrified and brainwashed,” she said, while being cross-examined by Combs' defense attorney, Brian Steel.


	Steel took a highly aggressive approach to his cross examination as he picked up the defense's efforts to undermine Mia's allegations by highlighting instances where she appeared affection towards, or supportive of, her former boss. Mia (who is testifying under a pseudonym) responded to Steel's questions by trying to convey the complex emotions that came with working for someone who was both her alleged abuser and someone she described as her “protector.” 


	As he pressed Mia, Steel's tone was often exaggerated and sarcastic, and at times directly confrontational. At one point he asked Mia if she'd joined “the #MeToo money grab,”  garnering one of many objections from the prosecution, which the judge sustained. (Mia later asserted that she did not intend to file a civil suit against Combs.)




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Steel also repeatedly cast doubt on the veracity of Mia's allegations, asking if her claims were true, suggesting the events she described never happened, or that she made them up. (Combs' defense has yet to take such a pointed approach to trying to subvert the claims of his other alleged victims.) At one point, Mia retorted, “I would not lie in this courtroom. I never lied in this courtroom. Everything I have said is true.”

	











	As expected, the prosecution has repeatedly objected to Steel's questions and Judge Arun Subramanian has often sided with the prosecution (at one point, he sustained about 10 objections in as many minutes). Federal prosecutor Maurene Comey expressed her concern to the judge that Steel's tone would not be reflected in the court transcripts; and she accused Steel of trying to “humiliate” Mia and effectively deterring other potential victims from coming forward.

	











	One person who certainly seemed engaged with Steel's approach was Combs. The mogul's face was glued to Steel as he grilled Mia, intense and concentrated, as if he was watching a movie for the first time.

	For much of the cross, Steel asked Mia about supportive and loving text messages she sent Combs both during her employment and after. In one exchange from 2019, after she'd stopped working for Combs, Mia described a nightmare in which Combs saved her while she was trapped in an elevator with convicted sex criminal R. Kelly. A few months later, Mia texted Combs that she was sending him “all the love in the world.”


	Asked if Combs still had a hold on her at that point, Mia said the mogul still did “psychologically.” She also added that she sent these texts after “tragic events” in his life, like the death of his partner, Kim Porter, in November 2018. 


	“I was always constantly seeking his approval. He was my authority figure, my only authority figure,” Mia said at one point.


	Steel also pressed Mia over why there was no contemporaneous documentation of Combs' alleged abuse, even though she was constantly filming Combs at his instruction and taking notes during their time together. Mia said she never captured Combs in a moment of anger because she “would not have been allowed to film that.” She added that she only filmed “whatever he wanted me to film” and that capturing such an incident would've been a “huge break of trust, loyalty, and confidentiality.”

	Similarly, Mia said that writing down an alleged instance of abuse, or discussing with others, would've been a breach of confidentiality. She said that the only time she “reached out for help was very subtly to people in the office but not disclosing things that other people hadn't witnessed.” She suggested others who worked for Combs were similarly cautious, saying “nobody around batted an eye” when Combs misbehaved or acted out. 


	Mia even said she grew fearful when Combs threatened to tell his girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, about “everything” between them. Mia said this made her “feel like I had sone something wrong,” as well as “internalize blame and shame.” 


	“I don't know how to explain what that does to a person,” she added.

	











	During her testimony last week, Mia repeatedly broke down in tears as she detailed a hellish eight years working for Combs between 2009 and 2017.  


	She claimed she fluctuated between a constant state of feeling like Combs' best friend and “a worthless piece of crap,” all depending on the volatile mogul's mood. Sometimes, she'd be showered with praise and promised executive roles in one of Combs' many companies. At other times, Mia said, she might have her arm crushed in a heavy industrial door or have a bowl of spaghetti hurled at her for not rushing off to IHOP in the middle of the night fast enough. 


	Mia said her job was always in jeopardy and once was placed on unpaid leave for “insubordination” because she left a hotel without Combs' permission to attend a party with Ventura at Prince's house. “We ran through the house,” Mia said of the women trying to escape when Combs turned up. “There was something across the street that looked like — I don't know if it was woods or not, but somewhere to hide, like bushes, and we were trying to run to hide there.” 


	Mia testified that Combs sexually assaulted her multiple times, describing the alleged attacks as unpredictable and sporadic. They occurred, she said, on Combs' 40th birthday bash at the Plaza Hotel, inside his bedroom closet, and on a staff bunk bed while she slept. There were other sexual assaults, Mia said, but she repressed them, only able to recall a “horrible dark feeling in my stomach.” 


	“I always thought that it was the last time, and if there ever [was] a next time, I would somehow be more prepared,” Mia testified. “We would have to get right back into work, and there was so much going on, I never processed it. I never thought it would happen again.” 


	Mia was identified as Victim-4 in the Southern District of New York's criminal indictment against Combs, with her allegations tied to the racketeering charge against the music mogul. Prosecutors accuse Combs of wielding his vast wealth and “multifaceted business empire” to fulfill his sexual desires with crimes including physical assault, threats, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice. He allegedly forced his sleep-deprived employees to do his bidding by subjecting them to physical force and threats of financial and reputational harm. (Combs has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts against him.) 


	On cross-examination, Combs' attorney Steel grilled Mia on why she never told anyone about the alleged assaults. He also confronted Mia with numerous social media posts where she heaped praise on Combs, promoted his business ventures, and created a specialized scrapbook for Combs' 45th birthday.

	“The man who you say has ruined your life,” Steel asked. “This is what you write to him?” 


	“At the time, as low as he would make me, he would also make me feel the opposite as well,” Mia explained in response. “Again, I can tell you what my therapist has said, but I'm not a professional to explain that.”

	Shane Hawkins, the 18-year-old son of late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, appeared at a Drum Clinic in Newquay, England, on Thursday, where he told the crowd that his father's favorite Foo Fighters song to play in concert wasn't “Aurora,” contrary to public belief, but was actually “Low” from 2002's One by One.


	“People say that song ‘Aurora' was his favorite to play,” Shane Hawkins said. “That's a lie. Dave [Grohl] never let…Dave did let him play it with them, but it's a fuckin' hard one to do all together. And Dave was kind of like ‘fuck that shit,' probably. I don't know. That's what I think. That's what I do if I was a guitar player. It's called ‘Low.' (As you can see in this video, the young Hawkins then played a note-perfect rendition of “Low.” )

#shanehawkins #taylorhawkins #foofighters #davegrohl #foryoupage #blowthisupforme #viral #drummer #taylorhawkinstribute #chevymetal #thealive 


	The Foos performed “Low” 125 times, most recently at the September 2022 tribute concert to Taylor Hawkins in Los Angeles. They last played it with Hawkins on August 26, 2018, at the Hollywood Palladium Parking Lot when they billed themselves as the Holy Shits as a part of a free pop-up show. “Aurora,” meanwhile, has been played 284 times. The last rendition with Taylor Hawkins took place March 15, 2022, at the Foro Sol in Mexico City. The drummer died just 10 days later.

	











	Taylor Hawkins was originally replaced in the Foos by veteran drummer Josh Freese, but they parted ways with him last month without explanation. “In my 40 years drumming professionally, I've never been let go from a band,” Freese wrote on Instagram, “so while I'm not angry – I'm just a bit shocked and disappointed. But as most of you know, I've always worked freelance and bounced between bands so, I'm fine.”

	The Foos have yet to indicate who will replace Freese when they hit the road in October for a run of shows in Indonesia, Singapore, and Japan. Rumors are swirling that Shane Hawkins is in the running for the job, but there's no solid evidence backing that up at this point. 


	That said, Shane Hawkins has stepped into his father's role in his long-running side project Chevy Metal. A new incarnation of the band with Shane Hawkins kicks off a brief tour on July 19 in Denver, Colorado. It wraps up August 31 in Agoura Hills, California. That gives him plenty of time to prep for the Foos tour, but we may not know who actually has the job until they take that stage in Jakarta on October 2.

	Eight people were injured and some burned at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, authorities said on Sunday. A man was taken into custody in the attack at 13th and Pearl Street, a popular pedestrian mall downtown, police said. FBI agents are also investigating what the agency has described as a “targeted terror attack.” A male suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is in custody at Boulder County jail. 


	All eight victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were transported to hospitals where they remain after the suspect threw “an incendiary device” into the crowd, Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the Denver field office, said at a Sunday evening press conference. The suspect could be heard shouting “Free Palestine,” Michalek said. He added that the FBI is investigating the incident as “an act of terrorism.” No charges were immediately filed, but District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the attacker would be held “fully accountable.”


	“A man was throwing Molotov cocktails and using devices to hurt people,” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. At least one of the victims is in serious, possibly critical condition, he said.

	











	A group of walkers participating in a Run for Their Lives event were among the people gathered on Pearl Street. The series of events are “calling for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas,” according to its website.


	“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” Dan Bongino, Deputy Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation said via social media.

	











	The incident occurred around 1:26 p.m., when Boulder police dispatch received several calls reporting there was “a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” Redfearn said in an earlier afternoon press conference. When police arrived on scene there were “multiple victims” with “injuries consistent with burns” and other injuries, which range from minor to very serious, he said.

	The male suspect was pointed out and was taken into custody without incident, Redfearns said, and was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.


	During the earlier press conference, Redfearn noted that there was a group of pro-Israel people who were holding a “peaceful demonstration,” which “happens frequently” in the area. Redfearn said at that time that it was too soon to determine motive. “It would be irresponsible of me to speculate on motive this early on,” while they were still interviewing witnesses.


	Colorado Governor Jared Polis said in a statement: “My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community. Boulder is strong. We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community. I've spoken with Boulder Mayor Brockett, and my administration is working closely with local and federal law enforcement on this afternoon's attack.”


	The scene itself had been contained, Redfearns said, and police were investigating a “vehicle of interest” in the area. Several blocks around the outdoor mall had been evacuated.


	“We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,” FBI Director Kash Patel said on social media Sunday afternoon.  


	In a statement on Instagram, Run for Their Lives noted that their walks “have been held every week” without “any violent incidents until today.” The organization added that “the plight of the hostages is an international humanitarian crisis” and called on world leaders to do “everything they can to ensure the swift return home of each of the 58 hostages.”

	Israel's war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023 when Hamas led attacks in Southern Israel, including attendees of the Supernova Festival, killing more than 1,200 civilians and abducted 251 hostages. There are 58 hostages still being held, it is unclear how many are alive, after many of the others were released following ceasefire agreements and other deals. As The Associated Press reports, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children per Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not identify how many were civilians or combatants.

Linkin Park performed as part of the kick-off show at the UEFA Champions League final in Munich on Saturday night. The rock band showcased four songs — “The Emptiness Machine,” “In The End,” “Numb” and “Heavy Is The Crown” — for the crowd at Munich Football Arena ahead of the match between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan. 


	The show comes ahead of the band's world tour in support of last year's LP From Zero. The North American leg of the tour kicks off on July 29 at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. Linkin Park will then circle the nation throughout August and September — including a massive Dodger Stadium concert with Queens of the Stone Age on the bill — before the U.S. leg concludes Sept. 24 in Seattle.


	Linkin Park kicked off their reunion tour last fall despite protests from the late Chester Bennington's son and mother and a Danny Masterson-related controversy around new vocalist Emily Armstrong. The band's most recent album, From Zero, is their first since 2017's One More Light.

	The band officially added Armstrong to their lineup last September. At the band's first performance in their new incarnation, frontman Mike Shinoda told the audience, “We are thrilled to be back out here. It is not about erasing the past. It is about starting this new chapter into the future and coming out here for each and every one of you. We loved writing this music. We are very fuckin' excited about the new record. So thank you guys very much. We had an incredible night with you.”

	











	Shinoda later spoke about about Bennington's death and what it's been like to perform with Linkin Park without him during an appearance on The Tonight Show. “I think the important thing for us is that we never set out to, like, ‘Let's bring the band back' or ‘Let's find a singer,'” he explained. “That was never our intention or our goal.”

Australia has been receiving high-level briefings from the United States' UFO task force for years, despite the repeated denials of the top military brass, newly revealed emails show.

Login or signup to continue reading

Freedom of information documents from December 2021 show US officials discussing a briefing regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAPs) - the modern term for UFOs - with its Five Eyes allies.

The email chain included officials from the United States UAP Task Force (UAPTF) and an Australian defence representative, using a US Department of Defence email address.

""Re tomorrow's UAP briefing, I received confirmation from Australia and Canada they will be here ... and of course UK,"" a UAPTF official wrote. 

However, a scheduling conflict led to the meeting being rescheduled for early January, 2022, much to the annoyance of the Office Under the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security (OUSD).

""I recall you and your team said last week that you wanted to come in today to brief the other partners. Because of this I urged the partners to build time into their schedules and come in for the brief,"" the OUSD official wrote.

""The last thing we want to do is be dismissive of our allies and their time,"" a UAPTF official replied.

""We definitely would like to continue this conversation with the partners, and now have an obligation to do so for multiple reasons.""

The former Chief of Air Force - and now Vice Chief of Defence - Air Marshal Robert Chipman twice told senators during an estimates hearing that Australia had not been briefed on UAPs after the email exchange and rescheduled Five Eyes briefing. 

In November 2022, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked if the US had discussed UAPs with Australian intelligence services or the Air Force.

""I'm not aware of any formal discussions that we've held with the US,"" Air Marshal Chipman said.

""I imagine it would have come across my desk if those discussions were held in the last four months.""

During the Senate estimates hearing the following year, the Air Marshal was more adamant in response to Senator Whish-Wilson's questions, which specifically queried if Australian defence attaches had received UAPTF briefings.

""No,"" Air Marshal Chipman said.

""No briefings at all,"" Senator Whish-Wilson said.

""No,"" Air Marshal Chipman repeated.

Briefing notes prepared in May 2022 for Air Marshall Chipman's Senate estimate hearing also state that neither ""the US nor any other nation or ally"" had requested or offered to collaborate on the issue of UAPs.

""Defence has no desire to seek collaboration on this issue,"" the briefing note states.

The Department of Defence refused to answer questions from The Canberra Times.

Grant Lavac, an Australian civilian UAP researcher, said the lack of transparency was ""quite concerning"".

""The Chief of Air Force leads all discussions on UAP in Australia, so if there's one person that needs to know what is happening on this topic in an Australian context and our discussions with allies, it's him,"" Mr Lavac said.

""He's either uniformed because there is a complete lack of intelligence sharing, or there's a degree of incompetence, or it's something more sinister like plausible deniability.

""Any one of those three scenarios is concerning.""

It's not the first time the Australian Defence Force has misled Senators about the nation's UAP activities.

In 2024, Defence officials admitted Australia sent representatives to a UAP briefing in the Pentagon, after vigorously denying any involvement.

The agenda of the meeting, which was attended by members of the Five Eyes alliance, was later released by the US government.

It shows the alliance - which includes US, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand - met for a ""caucus working group"" to ""cultivate shared awareness of allies' UAP issues, detection, and mitigation activities and challenges"".

They discussed the need for ""networks to share Five Eyes UAP reporting"", including documents marked ""top secret"" and ""special intelligence"", along with UAP ""collection planning"".

""The intention is to develop a framework for future UAP collaboration,"" one document said.

Australia's UAP policy has previously been criticised for being out of step with its closest military allies, including the US, which introduced mandatory UAP reporting for defence personnel in 2021.

The US considers UAPs a potential flight safety and national security risk, while other allies have acknowledged the unknown aerial phenomenon, including the UK, Canada, France and Spain.

The Canberra Times has previously reported Australian Defence personnel don't feel comfortable reporting UAP sightings through official channels and freedom of information documents revealed senior Defence officials mocked the subject while preparing briefing notes.

The Australian Defence Force stopped collecting reports of UAPs in 1996, ""after determining there was no scientific or other compelling reason to continue to devote resources to the recording and investigation of UAP"".

Ministers from both countries discuss framework agreement and diplomatic upgrades to enhance regional connectivity and ties

In a significant diplomatic and economic development, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of Pakistan and Afghanistan's Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi held a high-level phone call on Sunday to advance the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line project, a transformative infrastructure initiative aimed at reshaping the geopolitical landscape of Central and South Asia.

The proposed 573-kilometer rail link, connecting Tashkent, Kabul, and Peshawar, and extending to Gwadar and Karachi ports, is expected to cost $4.8 billion. It is set to be a vital trade route, linking Central Asia's landlocked economies with international markets, potentially driving regional economic growth and enhancing connectivity.

According to a statement from Pakistan's Foreign Office, both ministers emphasised the urgency of finalizing the framework agreement for the UAP Railway project, signaling their shared commitment to moving the project forward. 

This dialogue followed Dar's recent conversation with Uzbekistan's Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich, in which they coordinated the final details for the upcoming signing ceremony of the agreement.

In addition to the infrastructure discussions, the call also highlighted a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. Minister Muttaqi expressed Afghanistan's appreciation for Pakistan's decision to elevate its diplomatic mission in Kabul from chargé d'affaires to ambassador level, with Afghanistan pledging to reciprocate by upgrading its envoy in Islamabad. 

This step marks a positive shift in the historically tense relationship between the two countries, which had been marked by years of mistrust.

“This is a very positive development,” said Muttaqi, framing the embassy upgrade as a milestone in the growing relationship between the two “brotherly countries.” This diplomatic shift follows similar actions by China and the UAE, which have both taken steps to engage with the Taliban-led Afghan government.

Both ministers also reviewed progress on various agreements from Dar's visit to Kabul in April, reiterating their commitment to building mutual trust and cooperation in a region that has long been affected by geopolitical tensions.

As Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan continue their work on the UAP Railway project and diplomatic relations continue to improve, these efforts may signal a new phase of cooperation and stability in the region, long troubled by division and uncertainty.

ISLAMABAD  -  Pakistan and Afghanistan yesterday agreed to restore full diplomatic ties, eying regional connectivity through the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar held a telephone conversation with Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Amir Khan Muttaqi, to discuss the bilateral ties.

Muttaqi welcomed the decision of Pakistan to up-grade its diplomatic relations to the Ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan has decided to reciprocate the same. He termed it a very positive development in bilateral relations, the Foreign Office said.

Both the leaders also reviewed implementation of decisions taken during DPM's visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed  to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations.

Emphasizing the importance of UAP Railway Line Project for regional connectivity, both leaders agreed to work closely for an early finalization of the framework agreement.

Over the weekend, Pakistan formally upgraded its representation in Afghanistan from a Chargé d'Affaires to a full ambassadorial post, marking a notable upturn in bilateral relations and signalling Islamabad's intent to pursue deeper collaboration on regional security, counter-terrorism, and economic connectivity.

Ishaq Dar announced the decision on platform X, describing it as a continuation of the positive momentum generated during his “very productive” visit to Kabul on April 19, 2025.

This diplomatic upgrade comes at a time when Pakistan appears to be recalibrating its foreign policy posture amid shifting regional dynamics. While tensions with India remain high following a recent deadly flare-up in Kashmir earlier this month, Islamabad has simultaneously intensified diplomatic engagement with both China and Afghanistan. These efforts indicate a strategic reorientation aimed at restoring regional balance and addressing urgent security and economic challenges.

Adding further weight to this policy shift, a China-Pakistan-Afghanistan trilateral meeting was convened in Beijing on May 21, reviving a dialogue framework that had remained dormant since 2023.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, following the meeting, noted that both Kabul and Islamabad had agreed—under China's facilitation—to exchange ambassadors “as soon as possible,” a move seen as pivotal for restoring diplomatic normalcy and building trust.

China also confirmed that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the crown jewel of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), will now formally extend into Afghanistan.

The inclusion of Afghanistan in the CPEC framework is expected to connect the landlocked country to vital regional infrastructure and commercial networks, potentially transforming its economic landscape.

Senior Pakistani officials revealed that another round of trilateral consultations is being planned in the coming weeks to build upon the progress made in Beijing.

Afghan Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to visit Islamabad in the near future for further high-level talks. “The dates for this possible three-day visit are being finalized,” an official confirmed, adding, “We are heading toward deeper and more structured cooperation.”

At the heart of the book trade since 1858

Sphere has won a seven-way auction for a paranormal romance trilogy from bestselling Spanish author Elena Armas. 

Senior commissioning editor Molly Walker-Sharp at the Little, Brown imprint negotiated UK and Commonwealth rights (excluding Canada) in the trilogy from the TikTok and Sunday Times bestselling author in a deal brokered by Anna Carmichael of Abner Stein on behalf of Jessica Watterson at Sandra Dijkstra and Associates. North American rights went to Berkley PRH and a global release is planned for autumn 2026. 

Sphere said: ""Elena Armas first burst onto the romance scene in 2021 with The Spanish Love Deception, which has sold more than a million copies worldwide. The Icarus University series is Armas' first paranormal fiction, and will immerse readers in a small upstate New York college town with its first instalment, Alma Vampires, in which the life of an heiress, Valle Aguirre, is threatened after her mother's death and she must enlist the protection of Hadrian Cruz – the man whose fortune and secrets rival her own – as she searches for answers.” 

Walker-Sharp said: ""True to form, Elena has married together all my favourite romance tropes (billionaire x vampires x dark academia) with so many nods to the all-time favourites we all grew up devouring – with Spanish folklore interwoven at every turn. The result? Pure slow-burn, angsty magic – and all of us at Sphere and Little, Brown are so, so excited to be partnering with Elena as she breaks this new dawn in her publishing.""

Armas added: ""From the first note I got from Molly and the team at Sphere, I knew that my transition to paranormal romance couldn't be in better hands. They not only understood my vision for this series, but also the vibes I want to capture and the homage I want to pay to the early aughts romances that shaped who I am today.""

Armas is a Spanish writer whose books have been translated into over 30 languages. ","{'href': 'https://www.thebookseller.com', 'title': 'The Bookseller'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","A Terminology and Quantitative Framework for Assessing the Habitability of Solar System and Extraterrestrial Worlds","https://astrobiology.com/2025/06/a-terminology-and-quantitative-framework-for-assessing-the-habitability-of-solar-system-and-extraterrestrial-worlds.html","Mon, 02 Jun 2025 15:11:15 GMT","

Our paper fills this gap based on a three year-long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working Group. We reviewed past studies of habitability, but find that the lack of a universally valid definition of life prohibits a universally applicable definition of habitability.

A more nuanced approach is needed. We introduce a quantitative habitability assessment framework (QHF) that enables self-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models: First, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key conditions in the habitat. Second, a viability model, which describes the probability that a metabolism is viable given a set of environmental conditions.

We provide an open-source implementation of this framework and four examples as a proof of concept: (a) Comparison of two exoplanets for observational target prioritization; (b) Interpretation of atmospheric O2 detection in two exoplanets; (c) Subsurface habitability of Mars; and (d) Ocean habitability in Europa. These examples demonstrate that our framework can self-consistently inform astrobiology research over a broad range of questions. The proposed framework is modular so that future work can expand the range and complexity of models available, both for habitats and for metabolisms.

Visual summary of key considerations and arguments about the nature and scope of the definition and use of the term “habitable”. There are strong and valid arguments both for a simpler and more specific meaning and for a more complex and more universal meaning. Any single definition for “habitability” fails to meet the majority of the requirements. — astro-ph.EP

Illustration of the basis of the Framework for Habitability: The comparison of the environmental conditions predicted by the habitat model and the environmental conditions required by the metabolism model. — astro-ph.EP

Overview of the NExSS Framework for Habitability. The framework assesses the suitability of habitats for model organisms/ecosystems. The potential habitats are described through a combination of system/planet-specific data and priors informed by exoplanet statistics. Habitat suitability is assessed by applying a function specific to species/organisms to the habitat properties. The outcomes are probabilistic in nature. This framework is both flexible and specific. A special case of habitat suitability is included that corresponds to “surface liquid habitability”. — astro-ph.EP

Overview of the temperatures ranges in which representative types of terrestrial organisms are biologically active (i.e., likely to complete life cycles). — astro-ph.EP

The search for extraterrestrial life in the Solar System and beyond is a key science driver in astrobiology, planetary science, and astrophysics.

A critical step is the identification and characterization of potential habitats, both to guide the search and to interpret its results. However, a well-accepted, self-consistent, flexible, and quantitative terminology and method of assessment of habitability are lacking.

TOKYO- Unverified earthquake predictions from manga artists, psychics, and feng shui practitioners have triggered widespread travel cancellations to Japan, particularly from East Asian countries. 

As per a CNN Report, despite lacking a scientific basis, these supernatural forecasts have created tangible economic impacts on Japan's tourism industry. The travellers are either postponing or cancelling their visits amid fears of an impending catastrophe.

A 1999 manga by artist Ryo Tatsuki, “The Future I Saw,” has significantly contributed to the current wave of anxiety. The comic correctly indicated March 2011 as a period of major disaster. This coincided with the devastating Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. 

Tatsuki's updated “complete version,” published in 2021, now warns of another major seismic event scheduled for July 2025. This fuelled fears across social media platforms.

Following the manga prediction, multiple psychics from Japan and Hong Kong have issued similar warnings about imminent destruction. These forecasts have gained traction online, particularly in East Asian countries where supernatural predictions sometimes carry cultural significance. 

The cumulative effect of these warnings has created a climate of apprehension among potential travellers despite the absence of scientific evidence.

CN Yuen, managing director of Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, reported to CNN Travel that bookings to Japan dropped by 50% during the Easter holiday period. 

The agency anticipates further declines over the next two months as fears persist. The impact has been most pronounced among travellers from mainland China and Hong Kong, representing Japan's second and fourth largest tourist markets, respectively.

The concern has transcended regional boundaries, reaching countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Social media platforms in these nations now feature abundant content advising against Japan, demonstrating how quickly unverified information can spread globally.

The geographic expansion of these fears illustrates the power of social media to amplify unscientific predictions across diverse markets.

Despite the widespread concern, official statistics demonstrate Japan's continued tourism strength.

The Japan National Tourism Organisation reported a record 10.5 million visitors in the first quarter of 2025. Chinese mainland visitors increased 78% year-on-year to 2.36 million, while Hong Kong arrivals grew 3.9% to 647,600 during the same period.

Japan's location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” makes it inherently vulnerable to seismic activity. In January, the Japanese government announced an 80% probability of a major earthquake striking the southern Nankai Trough within the next 30 years. 

However, seismologists consistently maintain that predicting the exact timing of earthquakes remains scientifically impossible, with some experts criticising the government's probability assessments.

For Japanese residents, earthquake preparedness represents a constant reality rather than a periodic concern. 

The country maintains some of the world's most advanced early warning systems and building codes specifically designed to withstand seismic events. 

Japanese society has developed sophisticated disaster response protocols following historical experiences with major earthquakes.

The contradiction between supernatural predictions driving travel cancellations and Japan's sustained tourism growth highlights the complex interplay between superstition, social media influence, and travel decision-making in modern society.

While authorities continue to emphasise science-based preparedness over prediction, the economic impact of these unverified forecasts demonstrates their tangible effect on consumer behaviour across the region.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump shared an outlandish conspiracy theory Saturday night on social media saying former President Joe Biden had been “executed in 2020” and replaced by a robotic clone, the latest example of the president amplifying dark, false material to his millions of followers. 

Trump reposted a fringe rant that another user had made on the president's social media platform, Truth Social, just after 10 p.m. Saturday. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the post about Biden, whom Trump has targeted for criticism almost daily since the start of his second term. 

The president has blamed Biden for all manner of societal ills and assailed his mental acuity, including with the specious theory that Biden's aides used an autopen to enact policies and issue pardons without Biden's knowledge. (Trump has acknowledged that his administration uses the autopen system on occasion.) 



Trump has long had a penchant for sharing debunked or baseless theories online, but his embrace of conspiracies is not limited to social media. He has also elevated false claims inside the White House and surrounded himself with Cabinet officials promoting such theories. 

Last month, while sitting next to the president of South Africa in the Oval Office, Trump claimed that white South African farmers were victims of mass killings and displayed an image intended to back up his assertion; the image was actually of the conflict in eastern Congo. Trump has falsely asserted that white South Africans are victims of genocide, even though police statistics do not show that white people in the nation are any more vulnerable than other groups. 

Trump's first four years in the White House were filled with false or misleading statements — according to one tally, he made 30,573 of them, or 21 a day on average — and he repeatedly shared conspiracy theories in the lead-up to the 2024 election. 

A New York Times analysis of thousands of Trump's social media posts and reposts over a six-month period in 2024 found that at least 330 of them described both a false, secretive plot against Trump or the American people and a specific entity supposedly responsible for it. They included suggestions that the FBI had ordered his assassination and accusations that government officials had orchestrated the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. 

Trump's repost of the robot conspiracy theory came a day after Biden told reporters that he was feeling good after beginning treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. Trump has suggested that Biden's diagnosis last month was not new and had been concealed from the public.

The Trump administration plans to use a $400 billion green bank the president once sought to kill to finance billions of dollars in loans for nuclear reactors, geothermal power and critical minerals, according to details of the administration's fiscal year 2026 budget request. 

The funding would primarily support the construction of smaller nuclear reactors as well as untested advanced nuclear reactors that have struggled to gain traction. In all, the Energy Department wants to offer more than $67 billion in loan guarantees and other financing over the next two fiscal years, and is asking Congress to approve some $750 million to help pay for the costs of making some of those loans.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

UnitedHealth Group Inc. shareholders approved a pay package for Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley that includes a $60 million stock option award.

The advisory vote is a sign of shareholders' confidence in Hemsley, the chairman and returning CEO who helped shape UnitedHealth for decades. He reclaimed the top job last month as the health giant faces multiple crises that cut its market value by more than half since its November peak. In addition to the $60 million award that vests in three years, Hemsley will get a $1 million annual salary.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Latvia has prohibited entry for Russian citizens who own real estate near strategically important sites in the country, citing national security concerns, local broadcaster TV3 reported on Monday.

According to a statement from the Latvian State Security Service (VDD) cited in the report, a series of agency probes has identified risks emanating from Russian-owned properties near critical infrastructure.

As a result, “in several cases,” Russian property owners have been blacklisted and prohibited from entering Latvia.

Latvian authorities are trying to limit purported Russian influence within its borders. A former Soviet republic, like Baltic neighbors Estonia and Lithuania, it has adopted an increasingly hardline stance against Moscow since the Ukraine conflict escalated in February 2022.

Riga announced sweeping travel restrictions for Russian nationals, barred Russian-registered vehicles from entering the country, and introduced a mandatory Latvian language test for Russians, deporting thousands of those who refused to take it or failed.

Riga has also moved to ban Russians from owning property. A bill presently before parliament aims to prohibit citizens of Russia and Belarus, as well as companies linked to them, from acquiring real estate in Latvia, citing potential threats to national security and circumvention of Western sanctions.

Latvian Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis has cited “a hybrid war” with Russia, and urged EU members prohibit the issuance of Schengen tourist visas to Russian nationals, alleging risks of sabotage.

The three Baltic states, all NATO members bordering Russia, have also warned of potential invasion once the Ukraine conflict ends. Russia has repeatedly dismissed the warnings as “nonsense” meant to scare the European population and justify increases in military spending.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova recently accused the Latvian authorities of “blatant discrimination against Russians,” saying many of their policies were openly Russophobic. She said Russophobia had “reached a new high” in the Baltics in recent years and warned that Latvia, in particular, would have to answer to the International Court of Justice if it continued with its discriminatory practices.

NEW YORK, June 1. /TASS/. US Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin is right that NATO is waging a proxy war with Russia.

""And he (the Russian leader - TASS) considers this a proxy war by NATO as well right now, and frankly, in a way, it is. I mean, you look at what European nations have done with support. I mean, it's clearly Putin sees that,"" Kellogg said in an interview with Fox News, commenting on Germany's possible decision to begin supplying long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine.

Speaking about the progress of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations, Kellogg said as for Russia's term sheet for a memorandum the United States ""have not got it yet."" However, he said that after contacts with the Europeans in London, a 22-point document was prepared, which includes a ceasefire in the air, on land and at sea, but neither side was completely satisfied with it.

In November 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled during the CSTO summit that Moscow had repeatedly warned that the use of long-range weapons of the West on Russian territory would mean direct involvement of NATO in the conflict.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Moscow has said ""several aircraft"" caught fire as Ukraine claims its drone strikes have caused billions of dollars of damage. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a team would go to Istanbul for peace talks. DW has more.

This blog is now closed. Below you can find the main developments regarding Russia's war in Ukraine from Sunday, June 1, 2025:

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to each other about the new round of peace talks due to take place in Istanbul on Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

""The situation linked to the Ukraine crisis was discussed,"" the ministry said.

Lavrov and Rubio ""also exchanged views on various initiatives concerning a settlement of the Ukraine crisis, including plans to resume direct Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul on June 2.""

The ministry also said that Rubio expressed condolences over deaths that occurred when two bridges were blown up in separate Russian regions bordering Ukraine.

The US State Department said Rubio reiterated US President Donald Trump's call for continued direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to achieve ""a lasting peace.""

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed a surprise attack on a number of Russian airfields by his intelligence service, the SBU.

""An absolutely brilliant result. A result achieved solely by Ukraine. One year, six months, and nine days from the start of planning to effective execution,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on X.

""Our people involved in preparing the operation were withdrawn from Russian territory in time,"" Zelenskyy went on to say.

The Ukrainian leader ended his post bv saying, ""Russia started this war, Russia must end it."" 

Russian military airfields were struck by drones in a coordinated action, with claims that over 40 combat and reconnaissance aircraft were destroyed.

Russia's Defense Ministry described the strikes as ""terrorist attacks"" in the regions of Ivanovo, Ryazan, Amur, Murmansk and Irkutsk.

Kyiv reported a record breaking number of Russian missile and drone attacks on Sunday, saying Russia launched 472 drones and seven missiles overnight.

Ukraine admitted a Russian missile hit ""the location of one of the training units,"" killing at least 12 Ukrainian troops and wounding over 60 others.

Most of the soldiers who lost their lives are said to have been in shelters during the attack.

Ukrainian ground forces commander Mykhailo Drapaty resigned following the incident, saying he felt ""responsibility"" for the deaths.

Russia's Defense Ministry said Ukraine had launched drone strikes targeting airfields across five regions.

""In the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions, the launch of FPV drones from an area in close proximity to airfields resulted in several aircraft catching fire,"" the ministry said.

Russia said most of the attacks were repelled.

Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency said it was behind the attacks on Russian planes which it said caused $7 billion (€6.17 billion) in damage.

""This is the estimated cost of the enemy's strategic aviation, which was hit today as a result of the SBU's special operation,"" they said in an online post.

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here. This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and WABE, Atlanta's NPR station.

Thomasville, Georgia, has a water problem. Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.

“We have wastewater infrastructure that is old,” said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. “It's critical that we do the work to replace this.”

But it's expensive to replace. The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.

In September, Thomasville applied to get some help from the federal government, and just under four months later, the city and its partners were awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, build a resilience hub and health clinic, and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.

“The grant itself was really a godsend for us,” Sealy said. 

In early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then on May 1, the city received a termination notice.

“We felt, you know, a little taken off guard when the bottom did let out for us,” said Sealy.

Thomasville isn't alone. 

Under the Trump administration, the EPA has canceled or interrupted hundreds of grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness because the agency “determined that the grant applications no longer support administration priorities,” according to an emailed statement to Grist.

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice, an umbrella term for the effort to help communities that have been hardest hit by pollution and other environmental issues, which often include low-income communities and communities of color. 

In Thomasville's case, the city has a history of heavy industry that has led to poor air quality. Air pollution, health concerns, and high poverty qualified the surrounding county for the Biden administration's Justice40 initiative, which prioritized funding for disadvantaged communities. Thomasville has some of the highest exposure risks in Georgia to toxic air pollutants that can cause respiratory, reproductive, and developmental health problems, according to the Environmental Defense Fund's Climate Vulnerability Index. The city's wastewater woes don't only mean the potential for sewage backups in homes and spills into local waterways but also the risk of upper respiratory problems, according to Zealan Hoover, a former Biden administration EPA official who is now advising the advocacy groups Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government.

“These projects were selected because they have a really clear path to alleviating the health challenges facing this community,” he said.

Critics argue there's a disconnect between the Trump administration's attack on the concept of environmental justice and the realities of what the funds are paying for.

“What is it about building a new health clinic and upgrading wastewater infrastructure … that's inconsistent with administration policy?” Democratic Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at a recent hearing. 

Zeldin repeatedly responded by discussing the agency's review process intended to comply with President Donald Trump's executive orders, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, but Ossoff cut him off, pushing for a specific answer about Thomasville's grant. “Is a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?” he asked.

Thomasville's Sealy said she understands that the federal government has to make hard funding decisions — that's true locally too — but losing this grant has left her city in the lurch. In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards. That overhaul will likely cost $60 million to $70 million, she said.

“How do you fund that?” Sealy asked. “You can't fund that on the backs of the people who pay our rates.”

The funding cuts have left cities across Georgia — including Athens, Norcross, and Savannah — as well as nonprofit groups, in a state of uncertainty: some grants terminated, some suspended then reinstated, some still unclear. This puts city officials in an impossible position, unable to wait or to move forward, according to Athens-Clarke County Sustainability Director Mike Wharton. 

“Do you commit to new programs? Do you commit to services?” he said. “Here you are sitting in limbo for months.” 

Like Thomasville, Athens was also awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant. The city was going to use the money for backup generators, solar power, and battery storage at its public safety complex — ensuring 911, police, the jail, a domestic violence shelter, and other services could all operate during a power outage. That grant has been terminated.

The problem, Wharton said, goes beyond that money not coming in; the city had already spent time, resources, and money to get the grant.

“We spent $60,000 in local funding hiring people to write the grants,” he said. “Over a period of 14 months we invested over 700 hours of local personnel time. So we diverted our services to focus on these things.”

These frustrations are playing out for grant recipients throughout the state and country, according to Hoover. He said it's not just confusing — it's expensive.

“They are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects,” he said. “One of the big drivers of cost overruns in any infrastructure project, public or private, is having to demobilize and remobilize your teams.”

Thomasville and Athens officials both said they're appealing their grant terminations, which require them to submit a formal letter outlining the reasons for their appeal and requesting the agency reconsider the decision. They're also reaching out to their elected officials, hoping that pressure from their senators and members of Congress can get them the federal money they were promised.

Other cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal. But that's a difficult step for many localities to take.

“Suing the federal government to assert your legal rights is very daunting, even if the law is on your side,” Hoover said.

Musk, who departed the administration last week in accordance with the expiration of his special government employee status, appeared alongside President Donald Trump in a news conference in the Oval Office on May 30. The tech billionaire played a key role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whose mission is to root out fraud and cut wasteful government spending.
