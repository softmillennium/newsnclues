                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of scientists at NYU Abu Dhabi has developed a breakthrough paper-based diagnostic device that can detect COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in under 10 minutes, without the need for sophisticated lab equipment or trained personnel. The Radially Compartmentalized Paper Chip (RCP-Chip), engineered by researchers at the Advanced Microfluidics and Microdevices Laboratory (AMMLab), offers a fast, affordable, and portable solution for on-site screening of infectious diseases. Conceived during the early COVID-19 lockdowns, the RCP-Chip has been developed to detect even minute traces of viral genetic material using a droplet of fluid and a visible color change. It operates without electricity or special equipment, needing just a source of mild heat at around 65°C, similar to the temperature of warm water. The research is detailed in a paper titled Single-Layer Radially Compartmentalized Paper Chip (RCP-Chip) for Rapid Isothermal Multiplex Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Gene Targets, published in the journal Advanced Sensor Research. "During the COVID-19 pandemic, our goal was to create something fast, affordable, and easy to use, especially in areas where access to lab facilities is limited," said NYUAD Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering and senior author Mohammad A. Qasaimeh. The device supports multiplex testing, meaning it can detect several gene targets in a single run. Its flexible design can be adapted to detect various pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc. ), across sample types such as saliva, blood, and environmental sources. This is a fast, affordable, lab-free test that detects multiple gene targets in under 10 minutes. This portable test could significantly improve outbreak response by enabling faster isolation, treatment, and control." Pavithra Sukumar, NYUAD Research Assistant and co-first author of the study They also aim to explore smartphone connectivity for real-time data sharing and outbreak tracking, further improving its utility in public health surveillance. This work underscores NYUAD's commitment to advancing scientific innovation that addresses global challenges, particularly in healthcare accessibility and pandemic preparedness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the global population ages, the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continues to rise. Now, a new study by University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers has found that old neurons have unique defects resulting from molecular stress that make them especially vulnerable to neurodegeneration. Nobody is really sure what an aged neuron looks like, how it behaves, or how it's different from a young neuron." Gene Yeo, Ph.D., corresponding author, professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and director of the university's Center for RNA Technologies and Therapeutics and the Sanford Stem Cell Innovation Center at the Sanford Stem Cell Institute Yeo's team created aged neurons in the lab by using a cell culture approach called transdifferentiation. This technique directly reprograms skin cells from human donors into neurons that appear old at the molecular level. The team discovered that in comparison with young neurons, old neurons displayed hallmarks of molecular stress, such as halting growth and storing untranslated RNA and proteins in compartments called "stress granules" outside of the cell's nucleus. "It's the neuronal equivalent of being so stressed that you catch a cold," said first author Kevin Rhine, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research fellow in Yeo's lab. "We think that aged neurons are prioritizing other proteins and forgetting about the stress response and about RNA-binding proteins that keep everything running smoothly," said Yeo. Neurodegenerative diseases put an enormous burden on public health. The study will be published in Nature Neuroscience on June 2, 2025. Neuronal aging causes mislocalization of splicing proteins and unchecked cellular stress. Discover how Unicorn Biotechnologies is revolutionizing lab workflows with cell culture automation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp., 2 gram-positive pathogens highly likely to develop resistance to known treatments, can cause dangerous hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections. This week in Microbiology Spectrum, researchers describe a newly synthesized compound called infuzide that shows activity against antimicrobial resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus in laboratory and mouse tests. In addition, the findings suggest that infuzide kills bacteria in ways that differ from other antimicrobials, which may help keep resistance at bay. Infuzide emerged from more than a decade of work by interdisciplinary researchers looking for ways to create compounds that could act against pathogens in ways similar to known pharmaceutical compounds. Those include hydrazones, inorganic synthesized compounds that previous studies have shown to demonstrate antibacterial activity, including against resistant strains. The researchers synthesized 17 new compounds that contained hydrazones, and among those infuzide showed activity against gram-positive S. aureus and Enterococcus. "We started the project as a collaboration, looking for ways to synthesize compounds and connecting them with compounds that might have biological activities," said medicinal chemist Michel Baltas, Ph.D., from the Laboratoire de Chimie de Coordination at the University of Toulouse in France. The researchers found that infuzide specifically attacks bacterial cells. In lab tests, they compared the antimicrobial effects of infuzide against vancomycin, a powerful antibiotic representing the standard of care in treating resistant infections. They found that infuzide more quickly and effectively reduced the size of bacterial colonies than the standard drug. Infuzide did not show significant activity against gram-negative pathogens, though Baltas said the group is looking for small changes to infuzide that might expand its antimicrobial activity. The simplicity of the chemical reactions, Baltas said, would make it easy to make large quantities to be used in new treatments. "I am sure the same reactions can scale up." "We have many other candidates to make antimicrobial compounds," Baltas said. Discover how Unicorn Biotechnologies is revolutionizing lab workflows with cell culture automation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What happens inside your brain when you hear a steady rhythm or musical tone? According to a new study from Aarhus University and the University of Oxford, your brain doesn't just hear it-it reorganizes itself in real time. Every beep, tone and new sound you hear travels from the ear to registering in your brain. But what actually happens in your brain when you listen to a continuous stream of sounds? A new study from Aarhus University and University of Oxford published in Advanced Science reveals that the brain doesn't simply register sound: it dynamically reshapes its organization in real time, orchestrating a complex interplay of brainwaves in multiple networks. Using advanced algorithms, this method disentangles overlapping brain networks based on their dominant frequency. Once a network is identified by its unique frequency, the method can then trace how it propagates in space across the brain. But what we see with FREQ-NESS is much richer. It is long known that brain activity is organized through activity in different frequencies, tuned both internally and to the environment. Starting from this fundamental principle, we've designed a method that finds how each frequency is expressed across the brain." Dr. Mattia Rosso, Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined frequency bands or regions of interest, the data-driven approach maps the whole brain's internal organization with high spectral and spatial precision. This study adds to a growing body of research exploring how the brain's rhythmic structure shapes everything from music cognition to general perception and attention, and altered states of consciousness. "This could change how we study brain responses to music and beyond, including consciousness, mind-wandering, and broader interactions with the external world." A large-scale research program is now underway to build on this methodology, supported by an international network of neuroscientists. Due to the high reliability across experimental conditions and across datasets - FREQ-NESS might also pave the way for individualized brain mapping, explains Professor Leonardo Bonetti.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a recent study, in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), epileptic seizures are significantly more common than previously known. Epilepsy is known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, for example, but data on the on the connection between FTD and epilepsy remains scarce. The newly published study fills this information gap and shows that epilepsy is considerably more common in patients with FTD than previously estimated. Out of a total of 12,490 medical records, the study identified 245 patients with FTD and 1,326 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Our results show that epilepsy is considerably more common among those with FTD than those with Alzheimer's disease or in healthy controls. It is noteworthy that epilepsy occurred in some patients with FTD already ten years before their dementia diagnosis, and it was more common in all the examined stages of the disease than previous international studies have reported." Doctoral Researcher Annemari Kilpeläinen, first author of the research article and medical specialist in neurology The prevalence of epilepsy was assessed at several time points from ten years before to five years after the dementia diagnosis. In patients with FTD, the prevalence of epilepsy increased over time, and five years after the diagnosis approximately 11% had epilepsy. In addition to epilepsy diagnoses, medications used for epilepsy were more common in patients with FTD, which strengthens the reliability of the results. Diagnosing epilepsy in patients with FTD may be challenging as the symptoms of the disease may resemble epileptic seizures. This may lead to underdiagnosis and delays in treatment. However, untreated epilepsy can significantly worsen patients' condition. "Identifying epilepsy is important because its treatment can improve patients' functional capacity and quality of life. Knowledge about the association between epilepsy and FTD raises new research questions: do these diseases share some pathophysiological mechanisms and could some FTD symptoms be caused by alterations in the specific electrical systems of the brain", says the project's principal investigator, Associate Professor and Director of UEF Brain Research Unit Eino Solje. The recently published study is part of an extensive project that combines exceptionally extensive real-life patient data with different kinds of unique registers.

The study was performed in China and it was really done to determine, potentially once and for all, what the target should be in treating patients with type 2 diabetes. The ACCORD trial tried to answer this question, but it didn't show overall improvement in outcomes with blood pressure reduction, although when they did subset analysis, they did show benefit in certain groups. It still didn't have that definitive feel, and I think this study does. They were looking only at systolic blood pressures, and they wanted to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg in the intensively treated group; in the standardly treated group, the blood pressure target was a systolic of less than 140 mm Hg. You basically began to see a difference between the two in terms of the primary endpoint after about a year, so you started to see this split. The intensively treated group was about 120 mm Hg, and that's compared with the standard treatment group, which was around 130 mm Hg. I must say that, in my own practice, given all the changes that we've seen over the years in blood pressure targets, the results from this study have actually motivated me to lower my systolic target, at least in terms of how I treat patients in clinic, because I think they may get further benefit. That then begs the question of how did they measure blood pressures in this study? I get patients who have what's called white coat hypertension. They come into my office, their blood pressure is higher, and then I have them test at home and it's better. In this study, they tried to take away some of that interference. They just sat there and had their blood pressures measured in the appropriate way. They followed pretty standard treatment regimens for hypertension, which are the ones we use in our ADA guidelines for the management of hypertension. People in the intensive group ended up on one or two additional medications compared with those in the standard group. The overall rate of severe adverse events was equivalent in both groups, but there was more symptomatic hypotension and hyperkalemia in the intensively treated group. The difference between 120 mm Hg and 133 mm Hg isn't that big in my brain, and yet there does seem to be a difference in terms of outcomes, primarily cardiovascular outcomes, as the primary endpoint. I think this was a well-done study that actually will probably inform practice and guidelines in the future because I think it helps inform us of what is potentially the best target for our patients.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A trial of an interactive game that trains people to alter their brain waves has shown promise as a treatment for nerve pain – offering hope for a new generation of drug-free treatments. The PainWaive technology, developed by UNSW Sydney researchers, teaches users how to regulate abnormal brain activity linked to chronic nerve pain, offering a potential in-home, non-invasive alternative to opioids. A recent trial of the technology, led by Professor Sylvia Gustin and Dr. Negin Hesam-Shariati from UNSW Sydney's NeuroRecovery Research Hub, has delivered promising results, published in the Journal of Pain. The study compared hundreds of measures across participants' pain and related issues like pain interference before, during and after four weeks of interactive game play. Their brain activity was tracked via EEG (electroencephalogram) headsets, with the app responding in real time to shifts in brainwave patterns. Overall, the pain relief achieved by the three was comparable to or greater than that offered by opioids. Restrictions in the study's size, design and duration limit our ability to generalise the findings or rule out placebo effects. But the results we've seen are exciting and give us confidence to move to the next stage and our larger trial." The PainWaive project builds on UNSW Professor Sylvia Gustin's seminal research into changes in the brain's thalamus – a central relay hub in the brain – associated with nerve (neuropathic) pain. "I wondered, can we develop a treatment that directly targets and normalises these abnormal waves?" They were also given tips for different mental strategies, like relaxing or focusing on happy memories, to help bring their brain activity into a more "normal" state. "After just a couple of Zoom sessions, participants were able to run the treatment entirely on their own," says Dr Hesam-Shariati. That's a huge part of what makes this special." Initially, Dr Hesam-Shariati says, the team planned to use existing commercial EEG systems, but they were either too expensive or didn't meet the quality needed to deliver the project. "Everything except the open-source EEG board was built in-house," says Dr Hesam-Shariati. "And soon, even that will be replaced by a custom-designed board." "We've worked closely with patients to ensure the headset is lightweight, comfortable, and user-friendly," says Prof. Gustin. "Owning the technology offers us the potential to one day offer PainWaive as a truly affordable, accessible solution for at-home pain management, especially for those with limited access to traditional treatments." The researchers are now calling for participants to register their interest in two upcoming trials of the neuromodulation technology: the Spinal Pain Trial, investigating its potential to reduce chronic spinal pain, and the StoPain Trial, exploring its use in treating chronic neuropathic pain in people with a spinal cord injury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When cancer spreads from a primary tumor to new sites throughout the body, it undergoes changes that increase its genetic complexity. A new study from researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provides fresh insights about how cancers evolve when they metastasize - insights that could aid in developing strategies to improve the effectiveness of treatment. The team - led by collaborators Dr. Luc Morris, a surgeon and cancer genetics research lab director at MSK, Dr. Xi Kathy Zhou, a professor of research in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, and Dr. Chaitanya Bandlamudi, a cancer genomics researcher at MSK - examined the genomic profiles of more than 3,700 patients across 24 cancer types who had multiple tumor sites biopsied over time. The samples were profiled using MSK's proprietary tumor sequencing test. The team's findings, which were published June 2 in Nature Genetics, showed that tumors evolve over time, and that metastases tend to accumulate more copy-number alterations (CNAs) than mutations. This led the researchers to wonder why CNAs, but not mutations, were so commonly emerging when tumors metastasized. CNAs, on the other hand, are larger scale duplications or deletions of genetic material. "We found that whole-genome duplication - which is the doubling of the entire set of chromosomes in a cancer cell - was the most common genetic event during metastasis, occurring in nearly one-third of patients," explained study first author Dr. Karena Zhao, who conducted research at MSK while attending medical school at Weill Cornell Medical College. As cancer cells divide and make mistakes in replicating their DNA, mutations accumulate. Genome doubling allows cancer cells to hedge their bets, creating additional copies of genes, so that one copy can be mutated or deleted, while the other copy survives intact. This enhances the tumor cell's ability to adapt, survive, and resist treatments." Dr. Xi Kathy Zhou, professor of research in population health sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine That's because the changes to their genetic sequences can make them produce abnormal proteins, which are then treated like a foreign threat by the immune system. "In the end, our study found that during metastasis, cancer cells tend to evolve by maximizing CNAs, while not generating too many mutations that could potentially stimulate an immune response," Dr. Bandlamudi said. Together, the findings suggest that newer strategies, such as therapies to target genetic instability in these highly altered cells or to alter the tumor microenvironment, could be critical for creating lasting responses in metastatic cancer, the researchers said. "Understanding these key genomic differences between primary and metastatic tumors is vital for clinical care, as biomarkers like CNAs and tumor mutational burden are increasingly used by clinicians to inform decision-making, especially around the use of immunotherapy drugs," Dr. Morris said.
