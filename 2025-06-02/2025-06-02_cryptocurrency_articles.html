                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta (META) shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to add bitcoin BTC$105,034.70 to the company's balance sheet, according to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Just 3.92 million votes supported the measure, while nearly 5 billion were cast in opposition. Peck's proposal called for Meta to move a portion of its $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. He argued that the tech giant should treat bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to weather monetary policy uncertainty. Peck also targeted Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) with similar proposals, filed on behalf of the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). Amazon has not yet held a vote. Though Meta doesn't hold crypto on its balance sheet, the company has dabbled in blockchain before. That effort collapsed in 2022 after regulatory backlash and internal struggles, rebranding briefly as Diem before being shut down. While its metaverse ambitions prompted the 2021 rebrand from Facebook to Meta, the company has pulled back on that vision in recent months. Still, earlier this year, reports surfaced that Meta was exploring the use of stablecoins to manage payments across its family of apps. Shares of the company were up 3.5% on Monday, trading at $670.09 a piece.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao proposed launching a dark pool perpetual DEX to protect large traders from front-running and MEV attacks. Update (June 2 at 3:33 pm UTC): This article has been updated to incorporate comments from Li.Fi's Philipp Zentner and StealthEX's Maria Carola. Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao proposed creating a dark pool perpetual swap decentralized exchange (DEX) to prevent market manipulation. In a June 1 X post, Zhao said that he has “always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX.” “The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations,” he said. Zhao added, “If you're looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you generally wouldn't want others to notice your order until it's completed.” This is to prevent front-running and maximum extractable value (MEV) bot attacks, which can result in increased slippage, worse prices and higher costs. His comments follow the liquidation of nearly $100 million in Bitcoin long positions on Hyperliquid reportedly held by a trader known as James Wynn. The event, which occurred after Bitcoin fell below $105,000, sparked claims on X that some users had coordinated to “hunt” Wynn's liquidation. One X user claimed that Tron co-founder Justin Sun showed interest in participating, but the claim remains unconfirmed. Still, implementing decentralized dark pools would require complex systems such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) or delayed settlement mechanisms. Philipp Zentner, founder and CEO of the decentralized exchange Li.Fi, told Cointelegraph that decentralized dark pools “replace the human broker with cryptography.” He cited several protocols that already use this type of system. According to Zentner, the Arbitrum-based protocol Renegade encrypts every order with multiparty computation (MPC) and then posts a zero-knowledge proof so Ethereum can verify settlement without seeing the raw book. Maria Carola, CEO of instant exchange StealthEX, told Cointelegraph that “the fundamental challenge in building a dark pool-style perp DEX is achieving both privacy and verifiability.” She noted that ZK-proofs and encrypted order matching are promising avenues for development. Carola highlighted that “launching an onchain dark pool, especially for perpetuals, enters a complex regulatory landscape.” “I won't get into an argument on which is right or wrong. StealthEX's Carola added that “opacity is a double-edged sword,” noting that it reduces front-running, but “also obscures manipulation attempts, especially in a leveraged environment.” “To address this, a ‘dark' perp DEX must implement adaptive risk engines and behavioral anomaly detection, ideally with cryptographic accountability baked in,“ she said. Zhao concluded by encouraging developers to launch an onchain dark pool decentralized exchange with perpetual swaps. He said this could be achieved “either by not showing the orderbook, or even better, not showing deposits into smart contracts at all, or until much later.” Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and iGaming industries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink Gaming Stock Falls Back to Earth Following Ethereum Treasury Pivot Shares in SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm and affiliate network operator, are down more than 38% since the market opened, despite the company finalizing an investment round to help it acquire up to $425 million in Ethereum. After closing at $76.70 on Friday, SharpLink shares—which trade with ticker SBET on the Nasdaq Exchange—are trading at $47.16, down more than 38% since open and a whopping 62% down from last week's peak. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) The company's newly established treasury pivot makes it the latest in a series of publicly traded companies adopting digital asset treasuries, a move popularized by the Bitcoin-stacking Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and outspoken co-founder Michael Saylor. Those companies range from DeFI Development Corporation (formerly Janover), an AI-powered real estate platform that has built nearly a $100 million Solana treasury, to President Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group, which recently raised $2.4 billion to buy Bitcoin. SharpLink, though, is the most notable company to focus on acquiring Ethereum, crypto's second largest asset by market capitalization. ETH has been the butt of many jokes over the last year, especially as it has underperformed competing layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Solana—but some optimism is growing for the asset following a price surge in May following the Pectra network upgrade. Last week, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes told Decrypt that he believes ETH could touch $4,000-$5,000 in 2025, potentially making a new all-time high in the process as the “most hated layer-1.” Plus, analysts from Bernstein have indicated a growing interest in underlying networks where stablecoins have a major presence, a metric ETH dominates with more than 51% of stablecoin market share, per the firm's investment note.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article draws on insights from a joint report by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and Chainlink, exploring how blockchain-based identity systems can enhance trust and efficiency in global financial services. Digital assets are rapidly reshaping the financial landscape, from tokenized assets and onchain funds to the continued growth and development of decentralized finance (DeFi). But as capital flows increasingly migrate to blockchains, one critical standardization issue remains unresolved: digital identity verification. This process is critical to both traditional finance and the still-burgeoning digital asset industry, yet it lacks an efficient, scalable, and secure solution. In traditional finance, verifying the identity of legal entities is a prerequisite to virtually any institutional financial activity. Whether opening a bank account, trading in public markets, or investing in a fund, legal entities must prove who they are, and this requirement remains fundamentally important when interacting with digital assets. If anything, the complexity multiplies when interactions occur across multiple blockchains, jurisdictions, and financial instruments. A recent survey by Fenergo on Know-Your-Customer (KYC) practices revealed that financial institutions across the UK, U.S., and Singapore dedicate approximately a third of their compliance budgets specifically to KYC activities. It connects to validated reference data about the entity, such as its legal name, ownership structure, and jurisdiction. Today, LEIs are required in more than 250 jurisdictions for activities like derivatives trading and securities issuance. Bringing vLEI onchain has the potential to reshape the traditional finance industry's involvement in onchain financial activities by building confidence and clarity through standardization. It renders traditional LEI data as a verifiable credential—a tamper-evident, machine-readable identity asset that can be validated across platforms, including blockchains. Both GLEIF's work on global digital organizational identity and blockchain infrastructure built by Chainlink, the standard for onchain finance, support identity systems that are secure, work across different platforms, and easily connect with existing systems. Now, when that organization transacts—subscribing to a fund, issuing an asset, or joining a liquidity pool—counterparties can validate its identity with full cryptographic assurance. Just as Chainlink has helped proof of reserves and net asset value (NAV) become foundational data points in digital assets, GLEIF's vLEI can serve as a foundational identity primitive—enabling secure, transparent participation in onchain markets. But without trusted identity standards, they operate in a vacuum of verification. This, in turn, creates additional friction for asset managers, fund administrators, and institutional investors looking to engage more fully with blockchain-based markets. Bringing LEIs onchain through vLEIs bridges that gap by enabling organizations to assert their legal identity within blockchain environments in a cryptographically verifiable way. As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink noted in his 2025 letter to investors: “One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs — provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification.” For digital assets to achieve their full potential—as a new layer of global financial infrastructure—digital identity must not only meet but exceed the expectations of the traditional financial industry and global regulatory bodies. Blockchain-enabled identity offers a new approach: rather than uploading documents or manually validating entities, organizations can rely on cryptographic proofs tied to a digital identity. These proofs can be shared across platforms and verified instantly, without exposing sensitive underlying data. Chainlink's infrastructure can help facilitate this process by enabling secure delivery and validation of identity proofs across diverse blockchains, supporting greater interoperability across the digital asset ecosystem. Chainlink can make digital identity portable, secure, and interoperable. To realize this opportunity, the industry needs a common identity language—one that bridges traditional finance and digital assets. Regulatory initiatives like the EU's European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) are already exploring decentralized identity as a trust layer for digital ecosystems, reinforcing the momentum behind this shift. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and its digital platform-agnostic evolution, the verifiable LEI (vLEI), offer a promising foundation for building that shared identity standard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This move targets the backbone of fraudulent virtual currency investment platforms, aiming to protect Americans from billions in losses. The US government has taken a major step to fight online financial scams, particularly those involving cryptocurrency. This Philippines-based company and its administrator, Liu Lizhi, are accused of providing the essential tools and support for a huge number of fake online investment schemes. These widespread frauds, aka pig butchering scams, have already caused Americans to lose billions of dollars, and the government's action aims to stop these criminals by cutting off their financial lifelines. Pig butchering refers to a sophisticated type of scam where criminals build trust with victims, often through social media or dating apps, over an extended period. Once a relationship is established, the scammers convince victims to invest in fake virtual currency platforms, promising high returns. Victims are led to believe their investments are growing, only to find they cannot withdraw funds, and the scammers disappear, taking all their invested money. The average individual loss for victims linked to Funnull's network was over $150,000. Reportedly, Funnull Technology Inc. was a key player in fraudulent activities by buying large numbers of IP addresses from global cloud service providers and selling them to cybercriminals. This allowed them to create fake websites that resembled legitimate investment platforms. Funnull also provided web design templates and used domain generation algorithms to create similar website names. Liu Lizhi, a Chinese national, managed Funnull's daily operations, overseeing tasks like assigning domain names for fraud, phishing, and illegal gambling sites. OFAC's sanctions included two cryptocurrency addresses, Ethereum and TRON, likely used for Funnull's services. These addresses are linked to other illicit financial activities, including Huione Pay, a company identified by FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) as a primary money laundering concern. As a result of these sanctions, all property and assets of Funnull and Liu Lizhi within the United States or under US control are blocked.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A joint blog from John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, and Nikhil Rathi Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). From AI to digital ID, data-driven technologies are transforming financial services. And how we harness these technologies is key to delivering the Government's mission on growth. But innovation only succeeds when it's underpinned by confidence to try new ideas, trust, and a joined-up regulatory approach even where it is challenging to provide clarity with the frontiers of technology moving fast. That's why the FCA and ICO are working closely together to support firms navigating data protection and financial regulation in a way that helps them innovate confidently. Done right, regulation isn't a brake on innovation. The FCA and ICO frequently collaborate to make it easier for firms to navigate UK financial and data protection regulations. In 2023, we clarified that data protection rules don't prevent banks from telling customers about better savings deals. Since then, firms have significantly ramped up their communications, with over 100 million savings messages sent out. Our cooperation extends to the services that we provide to innovators – ensuring that whether firms enter the FCA's AI Lab or the ICO's Regulatory Sandbox, they can have confidence that they are getting joined-up regulatory positions. That's why we hosted a roundtable on May 9 with industry leaders to better understand the challenges firms face when deploying AI, and to explore how we can support responsible innovation and personal information use. What came through was very little about specific regulations standing in the way of innovation. Rather firms understand the broad rules, but many – especially smaller ones – want clearer examples of ‘what good looks like' in practice and more opportunities for engagement to build confidence in trying new technologies. The ICO has already published extensive guidance on AI. To support good practice into the future we will be developing a statutory code of practice for organisations developing or deploying AI and automated decision making – enabling innovation while safeguarding privacy. The FCA plans to host a roundtable with smaller firms later this year to better understand challenges around AI adoption. The new DRCF workplan also commits regulators to develop our collective understanding of how one another's regulatory regimes might apply to AI – including agentic AI systems - and work to identify and resolve any points of conflict. This can lead to reluctance, especially under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime. We know some firms have been able to move forward with confidence in line with their risk appetite, while others find these to be complex issues. We will continue to work together and with other regulators in the DRCF to explain our expectations, while recognising many choices are about firms' own risk appetites and choices. We're increasing visibility of these services and signposting practical help. The DRCF workplan also notes how we will be cooperating over the coming year to support regulatory clarity for financial services firms. This includes continued engagement on the Consumer Duty and its intersections with data protection, supporting the development of open finance data sharing, sharing insights on scams and fraud mitigation efforts and convening a DRCF symposium on digital ID. The message from industry was clear: regulation is not the main blocker to innovation but uncertainty and lack of familiarity are. We can support in building familiarity, while firms themselves are also developing their capabilities. But this isn't something regulators can do alone. We need firms and trade bodies to keep talking to us – not just when there's a problem, real or perceived, but earlier in the innovation journey. But we need their insight to do things better. With regulatory agility and confidence to innovate and invest in new technologies, businesses will provide the UK with the fuel to power economic growth.

According to a press release by the finance ministry, the meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and attended by PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, governor of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and government officials. The press release said that the PCC members gave valuable input for “a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment” which aims to promote “responsible blockchain adoption, safeguarding investors, and advancing financial inclusion”. The finance minister appreciated the contributions of all stakeholders and reaffirmed the government's commitment to creating a “future-ready financial infrastructure that supports innovation while maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance”, it added. Last week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance held a meeting, where PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations. He announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”. Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal. However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally. In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.</p>

Michael Saylor during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Turns out, buying Bitcoin to boost your share price might not be the corporate panacea that it once seemed.

In recent weeks, companies such as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., have announced plans to use their cash — sometimes borrowed — to plow into Bitcoin, joining a growing list of firms adopting an approach pioneered by Strategy's Michael Saylor.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together, they'll co-produce an animated series based on the digital-native franchise. Rosamund Pike Says She Was Asked to 'Unzip and Drop' Her Dress and 'Just Stand There in Underwear' During Bond Girl Audition: 'I Won't Be Doing That' Jesse Cleverly, the award-winning co-founder and creative director of Mediawan-owned, Bristol-based banner Wildseed Studios, is on board as showrunner. Claynosaurz, created in 2021 by Nicholas Cabana, Dan Cabral and Daniel Jervis (former VFX artists at Sony Pictures, Animal Logic and Framestore) has already garnered over 450 million views and 200 million impressions across digital platforms, as well as an online community of over 530,000 subscribers with its humorous short videos. Julien Borde, Mediawan Kids & Family president, told Variety that the series will likely be the first of its kind and addresses a demand from buyers for content that “comes with a pre-existing engagement and data.” “I think it's the very first time a digital collectible brand is expanded into a TV series so it's a milestone, not just for Mediawan Kids & Family but for the industry,” Borde said. Cabana said he created Claynosaurz with a “group of artists from all sorts of studios, including Illumination, Dreamworks, Sony, Disney and Ubisoft.” Having entered the market through collectibles and NFTs gave them the opportunity to monetize early in their development cycle and focus on building the characters rather than building long-form content, he said. When Mediawan approached them, they “immediately understood the tone, warmth and irreverent humour that define Claynosaurz, and share our belief that great franchises can emerge from unexpected places,” Cabana said. He noted that “this type of community-driven development isn't just different, it's necessary.” He also explained how the banner will test creative ideas on social media and “treat it as our test kitchen” to “find out what's sticking and what's not sticking,” he said. Nicolas Fisch, who is producing the series for Mediawan Kids & Family, said Claynosaurz's creative teams and Mediawan's will come together in a writers room.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency is a growing sector in finance, influencing how we approach financial systems and investment opportunities. Each digital asset in the market has its own features and potential. Here are the top 15 digital assets that stand out for their market value, innovation, and adoption potential. DAI is generally more stable than other cryptocurrencies, but it may fluctuate during times of market stress. DAI is widely used in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem — a system of financial applications built on blockchain technology that allows users to borrow, lend, trade, and earn interest without relying on traditional banks. It appeals to those who value decentralization and transparency. It gives users more control over their data and enables developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) — programs that run on a distributed network of computers rather than a central server. This decentralized approach often increases security and user control. After purchasing TRX through a cryptocurrency exchange, you can use it to tip content creators and purchase games and apps on platforms built on the TRON network. The SHIB cryptocurrency started as a meme-based joke, but it quickly became popular among crypto investors because of its community-driven nature and viral appeal. It was created by an anonymous figure known only as “Ryoshi” to compete with Dogecoin, Elon Musk's favorite memecoin. It enticed buyers and captured attention with its playful mascot. SHIB also immediately stood out because it was one of the first to be controlled by community members who could actively participate. The biggest difference between the two is that USDC is backed by fiat currency, government-issued money not backed by a physical commodity like gold and silver, which includes U.S. government securities and cash. USDC originally launched on the Ethereum blockchain but is now available on multiple platforms, including Polygon, Base, and Avalanche, increasing its accessibility across crypto ecosystems. Tether Limited introduced its cryptocurrency several years before USDC, DAI, and other stablecoins entered the market. Like USDC, Tether is pegged to the U.S. dollar, so its value remains stable over time. Instead of facilitating individual transactions, Ripple's XRP gives banks and other financial institutions a faster, more secure way to transfer money across borders. Because of its popularity, Ethereum can be slow and costly. High transaction fees make it difficult for users to earn a return on small investments. Polygon helps by processing transactions off the Ethereum chain, reducing costs and preventing delays. AVAX, its native token, is used for staking (earning rewards), transactions, and trading. What makes the Avalanche network stand out is its eco-friendly design. AVAX uses less energy than proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, appealing to investors who want to trade crypto while minimizing their carbon footprint. Telegram, a cloud-based messaging service, originally developed the Telegram Open Network (TON) with the intention of launching a cryptocurrency known as Gram. The company raised more than $1 billion in a private token sale, but had to abandon its plans when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit alleging that Telegram raised the funds by selling unregistered securities. Elon Musk further boosted DOGE by frequently referencing it on social media, and eventually using its ticker symbol as the shorthand for his Department of Government Efficiency. Like other cryptocurrencies, DOGE can be used for online tipping, charitable donations, investing, and quick, low-cost payments. Named after Ada Lovelace, a mathematician whose work helped make modern computer programming possible, ADA is the native coin for the Cardano platform. While Cardano supports smart contracts, it doesn't consume as much energy as other blockchain platforms, giving users a more sustainable option. Cardano also uses a unique proof-of-stake system to validate transactions, making the platform more secure and scalable. You can send money to someone thousands of miles away in seconds. Developed by Binance, one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, BNB enables users to earn rewards, send payments, play games, and cover transaction fees. One reason for BNB's popularity is that Binance regularly burns a portion of its digital tokens, reducing supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining cryptocurrency. Despite this, the platform's momentum stayed strong, and developers continued to use Ethereum to build decentralized applications and make payments, which resulted in unprecedented growth. As the original digital payment token introduced to the public in 2008, Bitcoin is used by investors and consumers for value exchange — trading digital assets for other assets — and purchases. Developed by an anonymous group or individual using the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto,” BTC is one of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrencies. It was also one of the first cryptocurrencies to receive support from major companies, including Tesla, PayPal, and Microsoft.</p>

SharpLink's $425M private placement transforms it into the largest publicly-traded ETH holder, representing institutional blockchain adoption with strategic industry backing. SharpLink Gaming's $425 million private placement marks a watershed moment for institutional Ethereum adoption. This transaction, led by Consensys Software Inc. alongside major crypto venture firms like ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, and Galaxy Digital, positions SharpLink to become the largest publicly-traded ETH holder globally—a significant milestone for both the company and the broader digital asset ecosystem. The appointment of Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO, as Chairman signals extraordinary legitimacy to this strategic pivot. This isn't merely a funding round; it represents a fundamental transformation of SharpLink's treasury strategy, embracing ETH as its primary reserve asset while maintaining its core business in performance-based marketing for gambling industries. SharpLink plans to participate in protocol-level activities like staking and DeFi mechanisms, potentially generating additional yield on its holdings beyond simple appreciation. This move represents one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies adopting a significant Ethereum treasury strategy, following a path similar to what companies like MicroStrategy pioneered with Bitcoin. The transaction's structure—combining both fiat and ETH funding—demonstrates flexibility in capital formation that bridges traditional finance with digital asset ecosystems. For the broader market, this signals growing institutional comfort with Ethereum as a treasury asset class, potentially paving the way for other public companies to follow suit. SharpLink will use the net proceeds to launch its treasury strategy focused on Ethereum, becoming one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to take this step. SharpLink continues its online performance-based marketing company serving the U.S. sports betting and global iGaming industries This announcement marks a key milestone in SharpLink's growth strategy. Ethereum powers the majority of stablecoin payments, tokenized assets, and decentralized financial applications. SharpLink's direct ETH treasury position will allow for access to protocol-level activities, such as staking and decentralized finance mechanisms, which are native to the Ethereum network. Rob Phythian, CEO of SharpLink stated, “We believe that this is a powerful partnership combining SharpLink's deep capital markets experience with Consensys' leadership in both technological innovation and its role in building the Ethereum ecosystem. This marks a pivotal moment for SharpLink – one that underscores our commitment to innovation and long-term growth. With this investment, we're not only strengthening our affiliate marketing business, but also pioneering an Ethereum-based treasury strategy by a Nasdaq-listed company.” This partnership with SharpLink represents more than just a financial milestone: it reflects the growing recognition across capital markets that programmable assets like ETH play an important role today in how value, trust, and financial systems are structured globally. I am pleased to join as Sharplink's Chairman of the Board of Directors in adopting Ethereum's open, secure, and scalable infrastructure, which is already being used across institutional and decentralized applications.” This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.
