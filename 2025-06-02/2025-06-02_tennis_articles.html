                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic reached a remarkable milestone with his dominant straight-set win against Cameron Norrie at the 2025 French Open. In his on-court interview, Djokovic said: “I feel good. Asked about reaching 100 wins at Roland Garros, the former world No 1 added: “It's a good number, a happy number for me. I hope there will be another win in a couple of days.” The 24-time major champion will face world No 3 Alexander Zverev in a quarter-final blockbuster. The 7 men with most French Open match wins: Rafael Nadal 112, Novak Djokovic hits milestone Tim Henman makes bold Novak Djokovic prediction as he looks beyond Roland Garros Djokovic's win against Norrie was his 100th victory at the French Open, which makes him the third man to reach a century of wins at a single Grand Slam event. Djokovic, who celebrated his 38th birthday on May 22, has become the oldest man to reach the French Open quarter-finals since Hungarian Istvan Gulyas in 1971. With his fourth round win, Djokovic extended his winning streak to eight matches — a run that includes four wins from his 100th ATP singles title run at the Geneva Open ahead of Roland Garros. The Serb is chasing a fourth French Open title and record-extending 25th Grand Slam overall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameron Norrie was knocked out of the French Open in straight sets as Novak Djokovic claimed his 100th win at Roland Garros. Asked about his milestone victory, Djokovic said on court afterwards: “It's a good number, but victory 101 would be better, so in search of another win it's obviously not over here for me. Norrie needed a medical timeout in the second set for a foot problem that seemed to affect his movement slightly, but Djokovic was the superior player on court throughout for his 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 win. At one point in the second set, with the score poised at three games apiece, three-time Roland Garros winner Djokovic needed six game points in order to hold, having been broken in the first game. But as he has done so often in the last few years, when it mattered, Djokovic delivered. There were glimpses of some of his best tennis, swerving down the line passing shots and he looked almost infallible when he came to the net, but he did not need to be at his best to beat 29-year-old Norrie. As both players employed their drop shots all too frequently – Djokovic used his 18 times in the match – it was the experienced Serbian who benefited.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>3 seed Jessica Pegula in a thrilling comeback at Roland Garros, reaching her first Grand Slam quarterfinal in her Grand Slam main-draw debut. It was her first meeting vs. a Top 20 player -- and she got the win. France will be represented in the Roland Garros quarterfinals after all, following a stunning comeback upset by one of the lowest-ranked players to ever make it this far at a Grand Slam event. Lois Boisson, the 22-year-old wild card ranked No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in their fourth-round meeting on Monday. In front of a delighted crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, Boisson executed the come-from-behind win after 2 hours and 40 minutes of gripping play. "I trust in myself, but yeah, for sure, if you say that, no, I can't believe. Boisson is the lowest-ranked woman to make a Grand Slam quarterfinal since former Top 20 player Kaia Kanepi reached the 2017 US Open quarterfinals ranked No. Boisson is also the first woman to make the quarterfinals of her Grand Slam main-draw debut since Carla Suarez Navarro made the last eight here in 2008 as a qualifier. "For the match point, I really felt very tense, and when I saw that my forehand was a winner, well, the whole pressure went off," Boisson told the French press. 3 Pegula was her first-ever meeting with a player ranked inside that echelon. Things won't get any easier for the wild card: another of the world's Top 10 players will be Boisson's quarterfinal opponent. She will have her first meeting with No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva, who bested Daria Kasatkina earlier on Monday. Regardless, Boisson will reach a career-high ranking after the tournament. "Things are not going to change for me," Boisson said. "They're going to continue in the same way. It's just that my ranking will enable me to play larger, more important tournaments. Boisson was projected to receive a Roland Garros main-draw wild card last year after winning her first WTA 125 title on home soil in Saint-Malo. However, before last year's Roland Garros started, Boisson suffered an ACL injury that kept her off tour for nine months. And she backed it all up, beating Elise Mertens in the first round for her first Top 25 win. After four straight three-set wins, Boisson is now flying the tricolore for the home nation all the way into her first tour-level quarterfinal, at a Grand Slam no less. "It's absolutely great to be in the quarterfinals," Boisson said. It represents a lot to be in the quarterfinals here, and as I said, I hope to go even further." But Boisson kept pace with the No. 3 seed, using her heavy forehand well on the clay. Boisson also regularly found passing and lob winners to chip away at Pegula's advantage. In a perfectly constructed point, Boisson fired a rally backhand crosscourt to break for 5-4, then routinely held serve to tie the match at one set apiece. A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports) In a back-and-forth third set, Boisson took control by converting her fourth break point of a tense 4-4 game. Serving for the match at 5-4, Boisson faced four break points herself, but she refused to yield, finishing off the shocking upset. Boisson is the first player to reach her first WTA Tour-level quarterfinal at a Grand Slam event since Emma Raducanu at the 2021 US Open. It's still a long way away, but she needs just three more wins to replicate Raducanu's result and win a Slam title. 3 seed Jessica Pegula in a thrilling comeback at Roland Garros, reaching her first Grand Slam quarterfinal in her Grand Slam main-draw debut. It was her first meeting vs. a Top 20 player -- and she got the win.</p>

The seventh seed will now face fellow American Coco Gauff in the quarterfinals, as Gauff matched a historic Venus Williams record with her win over Yekaterina Aleksandrova in the fourth round. She lost to Sloane Stephens in straight sets. This season, Keys has claimed two titles: the Australian Open and Adelaide. However, she has struggled to make deep runs on clay, with her best result being a quarterfinal finish in Madrid, where she fell to Iga Swiatek.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boisson, a wild card entry ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating third-seeded American Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier in Monday's fourth-round play. Quite some victory, considering Pegula was the U.S. Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points. “I really don't know what to say, but ‘Thank you to all of you'" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview. “Playing on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.” Boisson made the notoriously hard-to-please crowd laugh when she added: “I'm really happy on here. I can stay a long time if you like.” She was in the news last month. Now she's the only French player — male or female — left at Roland-Garros. Asked what her ambitions were for the rest of the tournament — she plays sixth-seeded Mirra Andreeva on Wednesday in the quarterfinals — she replied, “I hope to win, right?” That prompted more laughter from the crowd at Court Philippe-Chatrier, which included tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who has been criticized in some quarters for the lack of women playing in the night session. Top-ranked Jannik Sinner was playing his fourth-round match later Monday in the night session against No. 17 Andrey Rublev, following 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic's match against Britain's Cameron Norrie. In other women's fourth-round play, second-seeded Coco Gauff, the 2023 U.S. Open champion, won 6-0, 7-5 against No. Over on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, the 18-year-old Andreeva, who reached the semifinals at Roland-Garros last year for her best performance at a major, won 7-5, 6-3 against No. She playfully threw her wristband at Andreeva when they came to the net and Andreeva joked she would keep it. 7 Madison Keys also advanced on Court Suzanne-Lenglen after beating Hailey Baptiste 6-3, 7-5 in an all-American contest. There's another one coming up for Keys against Gauff. 3 Alexander Zverev, last year's runner-up, was leading 6-4, 3-0 against Tallon Griekspoor when the unseeded Dutch player retired from the match. He later said it was due to an abdominal strain. The quarterfinals are underway, with two men's matches and two women's matches, all on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka faces Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng followed by defending women's champ Iga Swiatek against No. The first men's contest sees eighth-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti take on No. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — Coco Gauff might have earned her fifth consecutive trip to the French Open quarterfinals with a straight-set victory Monday, but she still is catching flak because she forgot to bring her rackets to a match earlier in the tournament. 2-seeded Gauff, who won the 2023 U.S. Open and was the runner-up in Paris in 2022, has been engaging in a bit of back-and-forth with another American and Roland-Garros quarterfinalist, Frances Tiafoe, over the equipment blunder. Tiafoe teasingly called the 21-year-old Gauff “Mrs. Mature.” Gauff's retort: “I feel like maybe just playing tennis, it forces you to grow up faster for some people. It was Tiafoe who first made that very mistake back in March, showing up for a match at the tournament in Indian Wells, California, without his rackets. He got plenty of ribbing on social media and from other players — including Gauff. So when Gauff went to Court Philippe-Chatrier for her first-round match last week and opened her bag only to realize there weren't any rackets inside, the 27-year-old Tiafoe was only too happy to call her out. “She was full out shaking her whole bag like it was an empty cookie jar on Chatrier. I was like, ‘What are you doing?' I'm going to keep ripping her for a long time. That was incredible,” said Tiafoe, who will play in the quarterfinals Tuesday. “That kind of thing is so big because it just makes everyone (realize) we're all human. People make mistakes, whether it's the team or her or whatever,” he said, then added with a smile: “That was a funny moment, especially (because) she tries to be Mrs. Gauff acknowledged she couldn't really offer much of a retort. I don't like losing arguments," Gauff said Monday after beating No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-0, 7-5 in the fourth round. “But that one, I just had to take it. I learned that I had nothing to say, especially because I gave him a lot of (hassle) for it,” she said, “and then not even six months later, I did the same thing on an even bigger stage. But I have learned my lesson, and hopefully it won't happen again." Next for Gauff is an all-American matchup in Wednesday's quarterfinals against No. 7 Madison Keys, who won the Australian Open in January. Keys eliminated yet another American, Hailey Baptiste, 6-3, 7-5. As for Tiafoe's barb about “Mrs. Mature" — stemming from how Gauff carries herself on the court and off after breaking through at Wimbledon at age 15 and collecting her first Grand Slam title at 19 — she said she hears that type of comment a lot. I remember getting yellow for the behavior chart once, and that was like the worst day of my life,” Gauff said. “I'm definitely someone that prides myself in being a good example.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are few in the history of tennis who would have been able to compete with stars like Serena and Venus Williams, and there were not many within their generation who managed to do so. And then, when she snatched that top spot back in 2008, it also came at the same time as Henin's decline. During that period, the 43-year-old, born in Liege, won more majors (7 v 4), had a positive head-to-head of five wins and three losses, and an even more impressive record of four wins and one loss in Grand Slams against one another. Naturally, there are alternative factors to consider for this period, such as Williams' torrid injury record coinciding with Henin's peak. With that in mind, many can argue for Venus, and it would be a valid claim. But Henin, with a patented one-handed backhand that John McEnroe dubbed the best of all time, certainly deserves to be in the conversation for Serena's greatest rival. Having won seven Grand Slam titles, including a magical 2007 run to the US Open title where she beat both Serena and Venus on her way to the final, she is widely regarded as one of the best players of her generation. In early January of 2011 though, at just 28 years of age, she cited a chronic elbow injury as the reason behind her decision to quit tennis. She claimed: ‘In these recent months I have rarely been spared of the pain. After having considered the advice of doctors, it is now clear and accepted that my career finally ends.' Regardless of the frustrating nature of Henin's retirement, she is still remembered fondly over a decade on from such a sad decision.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — One year ago, Loïs Boisson had her tennis dream dashed. A week before, at a minor tournament in Paris, Boisson tore her anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and missed nine months of tennis. She didn't even watch the tournament on television. Twelve months after the pain, Boisson was on Court Philippe-Chatrier, soaking in the adoration of a French crowd. She upset Jessica Pegula, the world No. She is the first French woman to reach the last eight at Roland Garros since Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic in 2017, after beating Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. “I don't know what to say,” Boisson told the crowd in French on court. Boisson looked a little overawed by the occasion in the first set, as Pegula's relentless accuracy and consistency from the baseline ground her down and drew her into mistakes. Boisson couldn't read the American's drop shots and was often scrambling to no avail after being pushed further and further to the back of the court. 361 as she makes her return from injury, and the 358 places were showing. But Boisson did not wilt, and the slow filling-up of the lower bowl of Chatrier was a barometer for how she worked her way into the match. Boisson figured out that she could make Pegula hesitate in coming to the net, with a combination of drop shots and lobs that left the American in two minds. Pegula missed two groundstrokes she will likely never miss at a major again, before Boisson cracked a backhand crosscourt to take the set. Riding a wave of tricolores and chants of “Loïs,” Boisson broke Pegula in the first game of the third set, but the American came back to reel off three games as Boisson went from sparkling to flat — and the crowd did too. But at 4-4, just as in the second set, her combination of high, heavy spin and elite redirection on her forehand — dragging Pegula this way and that — put more doubts in the American's mind. Pegula waifed a backhand over the net and then hit a clever short, angled forehand, but Boisson eked it over and the ball died at Pegula's feet. By the final game, Court Philippe-Chatrier was almost full. Word moved around the ticket-holders, likely waiting for Novak Djokovic's match to follow this one, that one of their own was doing something special. Pegula got to it but could only net. On her first match point, Boisson sent a forehand inside-in and raised her arms to a roar that shook Chatrier. James Hansen  is a Senior Editor for The Athletic covering tennis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian Open figures have been left stunned by suggestions that the tournament could be pushed back to February, Express Sport has learned. Speculation over a new date for the first Grand Slam of the year intensified after former pro Patrick McEnroe claimed that it could be moved to create a longer winter break. McEnroe suggested that talks over a new date had happened and that there was a ‘plan' for the Australian Open to be shifted. Last September, Carlos Alcaraz suggested that tennis bosses risked ‘killing' stars by adding more tournaments to their already packed schedules. His brother, Patrick, a commentator and former player, responded: “I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.” But Express Sport has learned that there is no truth to these rumours after speaking with Tennis Australia sources. There was confusion over where the speculation might have started, followed by categorical denial. Patrick McEnroe went on to suggest that moving the Australian Open would open a window for a new tournament, potentially played in the Middle East. He said: “Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. “It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.” Prize money is the main source of income for many professional players, meaning they are compelled to enter as many tournaments as possible and risk injuries and burnout. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Last September, Alcaraz said: “I'm the kind of player who think there is a lot of tournaments during the year. So, I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way.” A few months later, ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi confessed sympathy with players who feel they do not get enough of a break during the winter. Now you don't have enough time to rest, rebuild your body and start playing tennis again.” See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Serena Williams was a trailblazer on and off the court. The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion amassed over $95 million in career earnings and is widely regarded as the GOAT female tennis player. Serena's iconic 'superhero' outfit forced an entire rule change at the 2018 French Open. At the same tournament 16 years prior, Williams caused a stir by playing in a custom tennis kit inspired by the Cameroonian national team. The Indomitable Lions, led by ex Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o, were embroiled in their own kit controversy that summer when then their sleeveless shirts were banned from the 2002 World Cup. FIFA banned the Cameroonian squad from wearing their signature sleeveless shirts because they were 'vests' and not 'shirts'. Puma were the creative minds behind the iconic shirts, and just so happened to be Serena's sponsor as she headed to Paris that year. 3 and in search of her second Grand Slam title after winning on home soil at the 1999 US Open. Sensing an opportunity, Williams and Puma collaborated on their own version of the banned Cameroonian kit for her to wear at Roland  Garros. The homage to the 2002 World Cup team was complete with yellow high socks, matching green and yellow shoes, and a color- coordinated headband to match. 26 to be stitched onto the back as a nod to her birth date, but it was rejected by tournament organizers. “I was reading an article where it says that Cameroon is everyone's favorite team,” she added. “[Even] if you're supporting England, a lot of people have this love for Cameroon because they're always fighting so much it seems. Sadly, Cameroon failed to get out of their group at the 2002 World Cup, finishing in third place in Group E, ahead of Saudi Arabia but behind the Republic of Ireland and Germany. Fortunately, Serena fared much better at Roland Garros, but only after switching up her Cameroon-inspired outfit. Williams would win four straight majors – the 'Serena Slam' (all four majors in a row but not during one season) - across 2002 and 2003. Serena would go on to claim her second and third French Open titles in 2013 and 2015 before retiring from the sport in 2022. The 43-year-old has been focusing on family and business but did nit at a sensational return to tennis. "I'm ready to hit some balls again," she wrote on social media. Announcing the end of her glittering 26-year career in August 2022 in Vogue magazine, Williams revealed that she struggled making the call to retire, but ultimately did so to focus on her young family. She said of her career: "I don't want it to be over, but at the same time I'm ready for what's next. I'm here to tell you that I'm evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. Sister Venus, meanwhile, is over 30 years into her WTA career, although during recent years she has been plagued by injury, particularly to her knee. However, the 44-year-old is still around the game, having still yet to official retire, serving as a broadcaster for TNT Sports at this year's French Open. Williams is on commentary duties alongside Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki. This will be Williams' first major broadcasting role at a Slam since stepping back from full-time competition. "I know what it's like to battle on the clay, and I'm looking forward to sharing that experience,” Williams said in a press release. She has been watching the likes of Coco Gauff make a run, but ruled out coaching her compatriot for one specific reason.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cruz Hewitt has rekindled memories of his dad Lleyton's battling heyday as he went down fighting in his first-round contest in the boys' event at the French Open. The 16-year-old son of Australia's former world No.1, who had gone through qualifying to make the event at Roland Garros, proved a handful on Sunday for Italian Pierluigi Basile, two years his senior and higher-placed in the world junior standings, before succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 5-7 6-3. The loss marked Cruz's grand slam return after his time at this year's tournament in Melbourne was marked by controversy surrounding him and fellow Aussie Nick Kyrgios. Cruz Hewitt showed the grit his dad Lleyton became famous for as he fought back strongly before crashing out of the French Open junior event on Sunday Hewitt survived being down 5-3 in the second set, then giving his opponent match point before turning it around to take the match to a deciding set Cruz (pictured with his famous parents Lleyton and Bec) also lost in the first round when he competed at the Australian Open earlier this year Kyrgios was accused of harassing Hewitt over a photo the youngster posted to social media showing him posing with world No.1 Jannik Sinner, who was awaiting his punishment for breaching anti-doping rules at the time. The Aussie firebrand also wrote: 'Thought we were boys' with several broken-heart emojis, with his comments drawing heavy fire from tennis fans and great of the game Andy Roddick. Kyrgios later explained that he's good friends with Cruz and his remarks were a joke between the pair. Hewitt wasn't the only son of a famous player to feature in Sunday's program, with fifth seed Jagger Leach, whose mother is American former triple grand slam winner Lindsay Davenport, beating Kazakh Zangar Nurlanuly 6-1 1-6 6-0.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis fans were left in awe of Cruz Hewitt's display at the French Open on Sunday, but saddened that he couldn't progress past the first round of the junior boys event. Cruz went through qualifying to make the junior event at Roland Garros, and proved a handful on Sunday for Pierluigi Basile. The Italian player is two years older and higher-placed in the world junior standings at No.24, compared to Hewitt at 41. Hewitt lost a very tight opening set in a tie-breaker, and looked headed for a straight-sets exit when Basile served for the match at 5-3 in the second. But in the end Hewitt ran out of steam and it was Basile advancing to the second round. The 16-year-old is trying to emulate his famous father and make a career of his own, but has so far failed to make it past the second round of a junior grand slam event. Fans were left impressed by his performance on Sunday, but disappointed he couldn't go any further. He wasn't the only son of a famous player to feature on Sunday, with fifth seed Jagger Leach beating Kazakh player Zangar Nurlanuly 6-1 1-6 6-0. Leach is the son of American former triple grand slam winner Lindsay Davenport. Hewitt's fellow Aussie 16-year-old Emerson Jones - the world's No.2 female junior - will kick off her campaign as top seed in the girls' event against US qualifier Capucine Jauffret on Monday (local time), The other Australian in the boys' tournament (Ty Host) will face US sixth seed Benjamin Willwerth. The only Australian remaining in the senior singles tournament is Daria Kasatkina, after Alexei Popyrin proved no match for Tommy Paul on Sunday night. Alex de Minaur and fiancee captured in behind-the-scenes moment Tennis world saddened after brutal development for Kyrgios and Osaka Kasatkina will face 18-year-old wizz-kid Mirra Andreeva on Monday after a 6-1 7-5 defeat of former World No.2 Paula Badosa in the third round. Kasatkina is playing her first tournament under the Australian flag after switching allegiances from Russia.</p>
