                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man accused of a fire attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, was charged with multiple counts of attempted murder on Monday in state court as prosecutors asked that a judge order him held on a $10 million cash bond "given the seriousness of the crimes." Mohamed Sabry Soliman was also hit with a federal hate crime charge by prosecutors, who revealed he confessed that he had planned the horrific assault for a year, and waited until his daughter graduated from school to commit it. An FBI affidavit filed as part of that federal complaint said there is probable cause to believe the married father of five attacked the demonstrators on Sunday with a makeshift flamethrower because they were supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages still being held by the Palestinian terror group Hamas. Soliman, 45, is due to appear Monday afternoon in Boulder court to face state charges related to the attack, which left eight people hospitalized with burns and other injuries. He is charged there with eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation, and another eight counts of attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference. He is charged in U.S. District Court in Colorado with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin. An affidavit signed by an FBI agent says that Soliman threw "Molotov cocktails into a pro-Israel crowd while yelling 'Free Palestine.' In that container "were at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Bell jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles," the affidavit says. The liquid in those bottles, and a backpack weed sprayer also found nearby, was determined to be 87 octane gasoline, the agent wrote. "Soliman as placed under arrest and a mirandized interview was conducted by local and federal law enforcement," the affidavit said. "He traveled to Boulder, Colorado in his vehicle with the Molotov cocktails and threw two of the cocktails at individuals participating in a pro-Israel gathering. He also stated that he picked up gas at a gas station on the way to Boulder," the affidavit said. "Soliman stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again. He specifically targeted the 'Zionist Group' that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search." "Throughout the interview, Soliman stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over 'our land,' which he explained to be Palestine," the affidavit said. "He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack." Shortly before the federal hate crime charge was revealed, President Donald Trump condemned the attack and blamed former President Joe Biden for a border policy that Trump said allowed entry to the accused assailant. "He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly," Trump wrote. "He must go out under "TRUMP" Policy. "This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!" Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI is already taking human jobs, but Google DeepMind's CEO says the disruption will lead to the creation of new, "very valuable" roles. Speaking at SXSW London on Monday, Demis Hassabis said he expects AI to be a bigger transformation than the Industrial Revolution, but he is optimistic because humans are "infinitely adaptable." "I think new jobs will appear, new very valuable jobs," he said, adding that AI over the next five to 10 years will "supercharge sort of technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies." However, when it comes to choosing what to study, Hassabis said he would still recommend studying STEM subjects. He said it's "still important to understand fundamentals" in areas including mathematics, physics, and computer science to understand "how these systems are put together." Speaking at Google's I/O developer conference last week, Hassabis and Google cofounder Sergey Brin predicted AGI — the moment AI reaches or surpasses human intelligence — will arrive around 2030. But AI is already rapidly transforming the job market. Some companies are dialling down hiring for roles that can be done with AI, and companies such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google are increasingly using the technology to write code. While Hassabis said he'd still study STEM subjects, he recommended that people get experience using AI tools.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets. The Danish multinational booked a loss of 1.2 billion Danish kroner ($183 million) in its first-quarter results in May after the U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. "Assuming Orsted have yet to move these equipment into the US in the weeks following the results, the announced 50% tariff is likely to lead to another c.DKK1.2bn impairment in 2Q," said Citi analysts led by Jenny Ping in a note to clients on June 2. "We continue to wait for clarity around the outcome of US/EU tariff negotiation, which Orsted said a 20% tariff could add c.DKK 0.6bn, which has yet to be recognized in its accounts." The Wall Street bank analysts downgraded the stock to a "Sell" rating, saying "these tariff risks does not help Orsted's equity story." Sydbank analysts agree that the raised tariff will hurt Orsted, but maintain their "Buy" rating. "Ørsted is particularly hard hit by the steel and aluminum tariffs because the company does not have a local offshore wind turbine supply chain in the US," said Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank. "We do not expect the increased tariffs to have an impact on Ørsted's plans to implement the two American projects. However, the tariff increase will again reduce the profitability of Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind compared to Ørsted's original assumptions." Shares of Sweden's SSAB were 6.36% higher at 2 p.m. in London. The steel producer is "a beneficiary of higher US plate pricing," analysts at Jefferies said in a Monday note, as investors assess the impact of a potential increase in U.S. steel tariffs to 50% from 25% starting Wednesday. More broadly, the higher tariffs are a headwind for European steel companies which export to the U.S., analysts Cole Hathorn and Tommaso Castello also noted. However, they continued that higher prices would benefit SSAB's Americas division, which the company says is the largest heavy plate producer in North America. Oil and gas stocks remain on the rise, moving in tandem with higher crude prices after OPEC+ announced a supply hike rate lower than some analysts expected. The Stoxx aerospace and defense index is 0.45% higher. Germany's Hensoldt has jumped 11.6% after analysts at JPMorgan upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral. The sector is also getting a boost from U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who outlined a series of new defense spending commitments, including new attack submarines. Shares of Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk climbed 3% Monday as telehealth platform Hims & Hers is reportedly set to cut 4% of its workforce amid a U.S. ban on copycat weight loss drugs. Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo has been battling a slowdown in sales in its largest market as a drug shortage ruling by the Food and Drug Administration had permitted the rise of cheaper compounded obesity drugs. "Trump's protectionist policies, speculated desire for a weaker [U.S. dollar] and tax bill seem to have accelerated the USD decline of late," analysts at Maybank said Monday. European equities are seeing a broadly negative start to the new trading week and month. The U.K.'s FTSE 100, however, pushed 0.08% higher, helped by an 0.57% rise in oil and gas stocks as prices jump. Autos stocks fell 1.4% amid fears that a slew of recent developments in the Trump tariff story could lead to more stringent tariffs on the sector, particularly after the U.S. president unexpectedly announced a hike in steel duties to 50%. Spot gold prices are up by around 1.5% ahead of the stock market open at $3,337 an ounce, the highest level for a week. The market safe haven may be holding more appeal as investors ponder whether U.S. President Donald Trump will take even more aggressive tariff action against certain countries and sectors, and as fighting escalates in the Russia-Ukraine war. Producer association OPEC+ on Saturday announced a supply increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July, similar to its hikes in May and June. ING strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said in a Monday note that prices may nonetheless be rallying because there were suggestions the supply increase could have been even bigger. French pharmaceutical group Sanofi announced this morning that it will acquire Massachusetts-based Blueprint Medicines Corporation for an equity value of $9.1 billion, a move to expand its portfolio in rare immunological diseases. Good morning from London, where futures data from IG suggest stock markets will nudge higher at the open — following declines in France, Germany and Italy. U.S. tariffs will be in focus yet again this week, after President Donald Trump said Friday that he will double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50% on June 4. Investors will also be monitoring any developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China, which soured last week. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett suggested Sunday that Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could have a conversation as soon as this week. Trade frictions between Washington and Beijing have flared up after a hiatus following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng in Geneva, Switzerland, that had led them to suspend most tariffs on each other goods for 90 days. The Trump administration has ratcheted up export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, while announcing it would revoke visas for Chinese students, drawing ire from Beijing.

Russia and Ukraine wrapped up a second round of talks in Istanbul that failed to bring the two sides closer to ending the war, but laid the groundwork for a new exchange of prisoners.

The Russian delegation handed over peace proposals that include Kyiv surrendering control of territory it still holds in four partially occupied regions, a Ukrainian official said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender said Monday that the Trump administration continues "to make very good progress" on trade negotiations, and it is "close to the finish line on a couple" of deals. "As long as we continue to make progress, I think you're going to see a lot more deals that are announced prior to that July 9 time frame," Faulkender said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." President Donald Trump on April 9 paused his "reciprocal" tariffs on most U.S. trade partners for 90 days, pushing implementation of the steep levies to early July. But nearly two months after the April announcement, the White House has so far only announced a deal with Britain. Nonetheless, top Trump advisors have indicated they do not plan to extend the 90-day deadline. Faulkender said the White House is looking "to conclude as many of these discussion as we can" before the 90-day pause expires, noting that negotiations "are sometimes complicated." "We want to see that we reach at least terms of an agreement prior to the expiration of that pause, as long as [trade partners] make progress and demonstrate goodwill, we will continue to make progress towards announcing those deals," he said. Faulkender also said the White House negotiators "continue to make very good progress on a couple of countries that should be imminent." Major U.S. stock indexes opened lower Monday, weighed down by investor concerns about escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. But they flared again last week, when the Trump administration accused China of violating a preliminary trade agreement by slow-walking its pledge to renew exporting critical minerals to the U.S. China pushed back against Trump's claims on Monday, and countered that the U.S. had undermined the Geneva deal by imposing new restrictions on Chinese student visas, among other measures. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett signaled Sunday that Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could hold a direct talk as soon as this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said the White House DOGE office was treated unfairly by its critics and became a "whipping boy for everything." Musk was speaking to CBS in an interview that aired on Sunday when he was asked about the backlash he faced over his work at the cost-cutting outfit. "It was a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything," Musk said. "So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE. The Trump administration said in March that it "will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits." This clarification came after Musk called Social Security "the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time" in an episode of "The Joe Rogan Experience," which aired in February. President Donald Trump announced in November that Musk would co-lead DOGE with Vivek Ramaswamy. During his tenure, DOGE tried to slash government spending by shutting down foreign aid programs and laying off thousands of federal workers. The cuts sparked boycotts and protests against Tesla, Musk's EV company. The blowback Musk faced alarmed investors as well, who repeatedly told him to focus on Tesla. Last month, Musk told investors in a Tesla earnings call that he would be scaling down his involvement with DOGE to spend more time on Tesla. "DOGE is going to continue, just as a way of life, and I will have some participation in that. Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uber's chief product officer has one AI tool on his to-do list. In an episode of "Lenny's Podcast" released on Sunday, Uber's product chief, Sachin Kansal, shared two ways he is using AI for his everyday tasks at the ride-hailing giant and how he plans to add NotebookLM to his AI suite. Kansal joined Uber eight years ago as its director of product management after working at cybersecurity and taxi startups. Kansal said he uses OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini to summarize long reports. "Some of these reports, they're 50 to 100 pages long," he said. "I will never have the time to read them." He said he uses the chatbots to acquaint himself with what's happening and how riders are feeling in Uber's various markets, such as South Africa, Brazil, and Korea. The CPO said his second use case is treating AI like a research assistant, because some large language models now offer a deep research feature. He asked ChatGPT's deep research mode about what drivers may think of the add-on. "It's an amazing research assistant and it's absolutely a starting point for a brainstorm with my team with some really, really good ideas," the CPO said. In April, Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, said that not enough of his 30,000-odd employees are using AI. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. On the podcast, Kansal also highlighted NotebookLM, Google Lab's research and note-taking tool, which is especially helpful for interacting with documents. "I know a lot of people who have started using it, and that is the next thing that I'm going to use," he said. Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former director of AI and OpenAI cofounder, is among those who have praised the tool and its podcast feature. "It's possible that NotebookLM podcast episode generation is touching on a whole new territory of highly compelling LLM product formats," he said in a September post on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven years ago, Mike Holp was riding through the streets of Austin as a food delivery worker, earning between $15 and $20 an hour. He lived just outside downtown in a shared rental with three roommates. Even with a computer science degree, the tough competition made it hard for him to get the tech job he'd hoped for. "Basically, the only thing that I could find to do to pay expenses was to deliver food on my bike," Mike Holp, now 38, a digital creator, told Business Insider. It was a relentless cycle, and the lifestyle started to wear him down. He felt disillusioned, and the rising cost of living wasn't helping his situation. In 2019, with money saved from delivering food and working real estate photography gigs on the side, Holp bought a one-way ticket to Asia. After a brief stint in Bali and then Singapore, Holp decided to make Thailand his next stop. He spent time living in different parts of Thailand, including Chiang Mai — where he met his now fiancée, Mary. She was on vacation at that time but was based in both Bangkok and Koh Samui for work. House hunting was fairly easy: He found their first home on Facebook Marketplace. It was a one-bedroom house in Lamai, a laid-back area along the southeastern coast of the island. After three years in that house, it was time for a change. His fiancée had left her previous job and now works at a school, and they wanted to live close by. They're still in Lamai but in a bigger one-bedroom property that costs 20,000 Thai baht, or about $600, each month. It's on a raised platform, about 12 feet off the ground, so if there's any flooding, we don't have to worry about that," Holp said. Though Holp has learned a little bit of Thai, the good thing about Samui, being a tourist destination, is that many locals can speak and understand basic English, he said. It was also fairly easy for him to connect with new people. Post-workout, it's time for a coffee at a nearby café before he heads home to start work for the day. Apart from creating content for his own social pages, Holp also runs a photography business and a consulting business that helps others relocate to Thailand. "It's just a much more carefree, relaxed lifestyle compared to Austin." The lower cost of living in Thailand helps, he said. "It frees up my time so that I can focus on passion projects like the YouTube channel, and I don't have to worry about just paying rent all the time and stressing out," he said. "We sometimes cook at home, but the meals are usually very affordable here, so going out to eat is very easy," Holp said. Their weekly grocery run costs about 2,000 Thai baht, and it's also fairly easy to find international brands and products at the larger stores, he said. "Even going to the grocery store, you can get 30 eggs for five bucks," he added. Holp estimated a comparable lifestyle for two in Austin would cost about five times as much. A 2025 SmartAsset analysis based on data from MIT's Living Wage Calculator found that a single person needed to earn at least $101,587 annually to live comfortably in Austin. He also feels very safe living in Samui. "I don't even really have to worry about locking the door, whereas back in Austin, I probably have to worry about how somebody might break in and rob me," he said. There isn't much that he misses anyway. "There's a big car culture in the US. I do kind of miss driving a car around here. I just use the motorbike for everything since it's really easy to get around the little roads and stuff," he said. "But I can't think of much that I really miss about the US other than my family, obviously, and friends. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>
