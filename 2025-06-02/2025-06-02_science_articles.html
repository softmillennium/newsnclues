                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from Colorado State University and Cornell University shows that the presence of solar panels in Colorado's grasslands may reduce water stress, improve soil moisture levels and -- particularly during dry years -- increase plant growth by about 20% or more compared to open fields. The findings were published in Environmental Research Letters this week. The work, based on four years of data from an agrivoltaics solar facility in Longmont, Colorado, represents the first effort to field test how co-locating solar and grasslands changes those dynamics. Colorado's semi-arid grasslands often need more water than is available through precipitation in each season. They found that during a dry year, grass growth on the east side of panels was up to 90% more productive in some cases than the neighboring open site. Cornell Postdoctoral Research Associate Matthew Sturchio is an author on the paper along with CSU University Distinguished Professor Alan Knapp. "There have been several studies reporting improved plant and water relations from solar arrays," he said. "The most important takeaway here is that even though this solar array was designed to maximize energy generation -- not to promote beneficial environmental conditions for the grasses grown beneath -- it still provided a more favorable environment during a dry year." Sturchio said those gains could increase if panels were instead designed to maximize their benefits depending on conditions. That may include changing their position to provide shade when air temperatures rise or configuring them to let more light in during key parts of the growing season. "With small changes in array design, configuration and management, we may even realize untapped benefits, particularly those related to water use," he said. The paper is part of ongoing research by the pair into agrivoltaics: a dual use approach where solar power infrastructure is designed and placed to also support livestock grazing or pollinator habitats in parallel. However, because of their heavy reliance on rain to support plant growth, research like this is needed to understand how the addition of panels changes the environment overall. He said research in the paper focuses on perennial C3, "cool season" grasses that prefer wetter conditions. Those plants flourish in warmer conditions with lots of sunlight. "Those grasslands are even more water-limited than the ones we used in this study. Thus, we expect the capability of solar arrays to mitigate water stress may be even greater," Knapp said. Sturchio added that solar panels may even provide an opportunity to restore grassland ecosystems by promoting diverse plant communities. He said building solar facilities in ecosystems that could benefit from their strategic placement is an obvious win-win. "We hypothesize that grassland restoration in arid and semi-arid regions could benefit not only from the favorable conditions in solar arrays, but also from the environmental heterogeneity created by panels," he said.

In February, the online image repository DiscoverLife, which contains nearly 3 million photographs of different species, started to receive millions of hits to its website every day — a much higher volume than normal.

Open-source AI chatbots are booming — what does this mean for researchers? Open-source AI chatbots are booming — what does this mean for researchers? Much of the bot traffic comes from anonymized IP addresses, and the sudden increase has led many website owners to suspect that these web-scrapers are gathering data to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as chatbots and image generators. But this is no easy task, especially for organizations with limited resources. “These smaller ventures could go extinct if these sorts of issues are not dealt with,” says Michael Orr, a zoologist at the Stuttgart State Museum of National History in Germany. The aggressive behaviour of these bots overloaded the publisher's servers and led to interruptions in services for legitimate customers, says Ian Mulvany, BMJ's chief technology officer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Often taking the form of the “Fermi paradox”—a 75-year-old thought experiment that explores why there are so many worlds, yet seemingly no alien civilizations—this grand question has inspired a lot of possible solutions. Maybe it's incredibly difficult to evolve into a modern civilization like ours? Or maybe aliens are speaking in a language we simply don't understand. However, there's one possible solution that eerily speaks to our current moment. Known as the “Sustainability Solution,” this idea posits that endless economic growth may simply be impossible to sustain, so alien societies either adapt by creating sustainable civilization in harmony with their host planet, or they simply die out. First proposed by Pennsylvania State University scientists Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum in 2009, the “Sustainability Solution” suggests that if aliens do exist, they likely wouldn't create the technosignatures we often attribute to advanced civilizations, such as Dyson Spheres or interstellar spacecraft. The paper re-conceptualizes technology, history, and sustainability on a planetary scale. Humans play a strange, transitory role in this conceptualization. But our creations—at least, as argued by this theory—become part of the theoretically detectable technosphere (whether this region is a permanent fixture or a temporary arm of the biosphere is up for debate). Drawing on a sample size of one (i.e. human civilization), it's easy to think that progress will continue unabated until we become masters of our own Solar System and beyond. However, as Haqq-Mistra and Baum originally stated in 2009, this “Sustainability Solution” questions the assumption of the unimpeded exponential growth of such civilizations. “It is still possible that slower-growth ETI civilizations exist but have not expanded rapidly enough to be easily detectable by the searches humans have yet made,” the original authors wrote. “It is also possible that faster-growth ETI civilizations previously expanded throughout the galaxy but could not sustain this state, collapsing in a way that whatever artifacts they might have left have also remained undetected.” To support this point, Likavčan quotes Canadian sci-fi author Karl Schroeder, who wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature,” itself a reformulation of sci-fi Arthur C. Clarke's famous words that compared technology to magic. This could also explain why we haven't found civilizations while looking for technosignatures alone. Magic or no, the nature of the Fermi paradox makes it a “we won't know until we know” kind of question. But the exploration of possible solutions can also provide a valuable lens through which to value our own society, its future perils, and how we might—against all odds—survive long enough to one day solve this perplexing question.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Haenyeo, an all-female group of divers on South Korea's Jeju Island, spend much of their lives underwater without equipment—a “superpower” that may be written into their DNA Often likened to mermaids in media reports and popular culture, South Korea's famed Haenyeo (“sea women”) spend much of the day underwater, diving without scuba gear to collect abalone, octopus, kelp and other prized seafood. Admired both culturally and scientifically, they have been plunging into the frigid waters of Jeju Island since as early as 503 C.E. Now, for the first time, a study has found both genetic adaptations and training effects that are unique to these women and could explain how the Haenyeo withstand the intense physical stresses that come with continuous diving. The researchers hope closer investigations into such genetic traits could inform future approaches to certain disorders or illnesses in the general population.

For centuries, they have conspicuously maintained their own culture and style. They have kept their tradition afloat through Japan's decades-long occupation of the Korean Peninsula, massacres under dictatorships and relentless industrial development. And the new study suggests that there might even be a ring of scientific truth to “superpower” analogy. Her team found the Bajau had an extra large spleens that could store additional oxygenated blood for lengthy dives. “If one group of divers had evolved to dive, then maybe others have as well,” Ilardo says. “What's interesting about studying populations who have lived in a particular environment for many, many generations is that if there's been a selective pressure in that environment, you can look at their genomes and start to pull out regions that appear to be essential for their survival,” explains Tatum Simonson, a geneticist at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the new study. Those essential genetic irregularities are “probably linked to some aspect of physiology that has been beneficial over time in that environment.” Ilardo thinks that could be a direct result of natural selection. For example, “sleep apnea—which is kind of like unintentional diving in your sleep [in that it reduces oxygen availability]—increases the risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy,” she explains, adding that these can include preeclampsia (a pregnancy complication that can dangerously raise blood pressure). The Haenyeo are known to continue diving while pregnant, she notes. “If diving is increasing [a Haenyeo diver's] risk of preeclampsia, that could take out an entire generation,” Ilardo says. But the Haenyeo aren't known to have a particularly high risk of hypertensive pregnancy disorders, and they have obviously birthed many generations of babies. Ilardo's research suggests it's likely that a gene allowing for better regulation of blood pressure has been passed down through the years. But Ilardo notes that some physiological differences, such as heartbeat changes, were unique to the Haenyeo. During the face-dunking experiment, Haenyeo participants' heart rates slowed by 50 percent more, on average, compared with nondiver Jeju residents. This helps their bodies manage oxygen circulation through their bodies during a long dive, letting them “spend that resource as frugally as possible,” Ilardo says. She adds that this acquired trait could also develop in nondiver individuals who are not from Jeju Island. Researchers can learn vital lessons about human evolution from such unique adaptations, says Ben Trumble, an Arizona State University biologist who specializes in human biology and was not involved in the new study. Cataloging the lifestyle and genes of special populations such as the Haenyeo could inform research into areas such as precision medicine, which requires a specialized understanding of how certain genetic variations translate into physiological traits, Trumble explains. “We're absolutely allowed to plagiarize from natural selection” in approaching health care, he says. “How natural selection solves a particular problem with a particular gene can give us clues for developing new drugs to treat some of the problems that people have in our society today.” Studies such as Ilardo's take the “first step” toward medical applications, Trumble says, although he and Simonson believe any actual drugs that could emerge from such research will probably take longer to develop. In any case, Ilardo says, being able to pinpoint the genetic cause behind certain populations' remarkable abilities could offer remarkable solutions in medical genetics. “I think by focusing on what makes the population special and unique..., it brings a health focus instead of a disease focus [to medical genetics research]. And it's certainly a much more fun way to do the science.” A philosopher turned journalist, originally from South Korea, Lee is interested finding unexpected connections between life and different science, particularly in theoretical physics and mathematics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've seen electric automakers attempt swappable battery packs with varying levels of success. The technology is promising enough that it's already being tested in a small-scale pilot program at the time we're writing this. Unfortunately, it appears that CATL's Choco Swap technology will require a subscription to gain access. As you'll see above, the technology is surprisingly simple. Along with its removable battery, the Oshan can also be plugged in like a conventional EV. It didn't take us long to realize that these swappable batteries are the perfect solution for fleet vehicles like taxi cabs—at least in areas that still use them. Less downtime to charge means more time working and, well, making money. Each vehicle is fitted with CATL's Choco-SEB battery, named for its chocolate-bar-like appearance. It's currently available in two different form factors: one for smaller vehicles like the Changan, and another larger size for commercial “A- or B-Class” vehicles. For context, CATL has already helped Chinese automakers release 10 different “Choco Swap” compatible vehicles. First and foremost, charging a battery is best done slowly. Your automaker might not tell you, but charging—especially fast charging—produces a lot of heat. And that's good news, as slow charging promotes battery longevity. One of the biggest questions that came up for us is what EV owners should do if they merely need to top up their battery before a road trip; what if you theoretically had 65-percent charge and wanted to top up to 100 before you set off again? Is it really worth the hassle to swap in an entirely new battery? It's all too easy with these new and exciting technologies for stories to claim that it “makes the gas station obsolete” or “change the EV game” forever. Along with many unanswered questions about logistics, the fact remains that automakers still can't decide on one single charging standard. We don't disagree that the new battery swap technology is fast, but we do wonder about other factors including how much it will cost, how much demand there will be, vehicle compatibility, and what happens if the new battery doesn't work. As of right now, Chinese automakers GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW, and BAIC, are also looking to adapt to the new standard.

T cells (blue) attack a prostate cancer cell (pink) in this scanning electron micrograph image.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library A clinical trial using engineered immune cells to hunt cancer cells has reported impressive results for solid tumours, a type of cancer that is difficult to treat. The phase II clinical trial in China tested chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in people with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, which are solid tumours. “Solid tumours generally don't respond well to CAR-T-cell therapy,” says Lisa Mielke, a cancer researcher at the Olivia Newton John Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg, Australia. They provide “evidence that there is potential for CAR T cells to be further optimized for future treatment of patients with solid tumours”, adds Mielke. The trial included 156 participants, aged 18–75, who had received at least two unsuccessful treatments for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer and had tumour-tissue samples that were positive for CLDN18.2.

Governments in many European countries have high hopes for cheap green hydrogen (H2) from Africa to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. Using geospatial levelized cost models, this study evaluates the economic feasibility of exporting green H2 in the form of ammonia from Africa to Europe under four realistic financing scenarios by 2030. Our findings suggest that without European policy interventions, green H2 from Africa remains prohibitively expensive with least costs from €4.2 kgH2−1 to €4.9 kgH2−1 depending on the interest rate environment. Using de-risking policy, we identify 214 locations in six African countries that may be competitive in the current interest rate environment, yet many of these face a challenging security situation casting doubt on long-term investments. Under optimal policy and interest rate scenarios, we find a least cost of €3.2 kgH2−1 in Mauritania by 2030. Overall, de-risking and strategic location selection are key to make African green H2 exports competitive on the global stage. In 2022, 99% of hydrogen (H2) was produced using fossil fuels1. This ‘grey' H2 mainly serves demand from the refining and industrial sectors. Achieving net zero requires a change to ‘green' H2 using renewable energy to meet current demand at low emissions and to decarbonize further hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel production1. Decarbonizing such hard-to-abate sectors is projected to cause an almost sixfold increase in global H2 demand by 20501. However, deploying green H2 at scale will require market-competitive costs. To become competitive, technical and operational cost reductions could be pursued, projected at up to 85% through lower-cost renewable electricity, reduced electrolyser costs, enhanced electrolyser efficiency and optimized operating hours2. Additionally, shifting green H2 production to more cost-efficient locations with better availability of renewable energy, including overseas4,5, could increase its competitiveness against other types of hydrogen production. The European Union explicitly supports the creation of green H2 export markets and aims to import 10 megatons (MT) of green H2 to support decarbonization6. Over 70 potential supply regions, many in Africa7 due to often abundant renewable energy, have been identified, and bilateral agreements have already been signed, for example, between the European Union and Namibia8. African countries have started implementing domestic H2 policies too, with countries such as Namibia, South Africa, Morocco and Kenya developing strategies focused on export9. Geospatial modelling including variable capital expenditure (CAPEX) or energy cost10 is commonly used to inform policymakers on the economic viability of different green H2 (ref. We complement the available green H2 cost estimates for the African continent, such as H2Atlas Africa12, in at least three substantive ways. We base these on realistic demand scenarios, and we do so in a transparent and replicable way. Yet, irrespective of the granularity, these models typically use a uniform financing cost or cost of capital (COC) set to 4–8% (refs. 10,13,14), which is problematic as energy infrastructure research indicates large variations in COC across Africa15. The few studies that account for these variations leverage data from the oil and gas sector16 or country-specific ratings17,18,19, which do not adequately represent the specific risks associated with green H2 investments and lack empirical calibration. Consequently, current modelling risks producing overly optimistic green H2 levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) estimates for export from African countries due to inaccurate representation of their investment and policy environments20. Given the existing north–south disparities regarding decisionmaking power and future visions for the sector21, this is ever more concerning because it could result in unviable infrastructure investments and stranded assets without development benefits in African countries. To tackle this issue, here we estimate COC across potential green H2 exporters in Africa for four realistic financing scenarios and use these to calculate LCOH. Differentiating COC by country, financing structure and interest rate environment—verified through expert interviews—we optimize green H2 production locations using GeoH2 (refs. 13,14), a geospatial least-cost model that optimizes production, transport, storage and conversion using granular spatial data. On the basis of an overview of currently planned projects, we model the case of ammonia production, which is shipped and reconverted to H2 in Europe. For simplicity, we choose Rotterdam as the entry port, and we exclude the possibility of pipeline construction or refurbishment for transport to Europe as we analyse the cost of projects to be operational in 2030. 9 depicts the process, which is described in Methods. To understand the status of green H2 development throughout the African continent, we identified all projects planned to be operational by 2030. Somalia and Libya are excluded due to political instability, and small island states are excluded due to infrastructure and space constraints, resulting in a sample of 31 countries (Methods). Thirty-four projects are found across seven countries (Fig. 1), 89% of which are either at concept or feasibility stages. Two of the projects have reached a financial investment decision and are under construction, and only one small-scale project (that is, 3.5 MW) in South Africa is operational. Planned project sizes vary from 3.5 MW to 6.9 GW. Whereas Egypt and South Africa have numerous smaller projects planned, Mauritania has three large projects planned, totalling 7 GW of capacity. a, Number of projects by project status (bars) and the sum of planned capacity by country (bar labels). b, Share of planned standardized electrolyser capacity. Only projects planned to go online by 2030 are included. Projects can have more than one end use; hence, shares in b add up to 112%. Information on local versus export end use is unavailable. Note that capacity figures were not available for two planned projects in Mauritania and Morocco. Methods provide data sources and details on sample selection. Figure 1 shows that 74% of planned electrolyser capacity is intended for ammonia (NH3) production. NH3 offers advantages as a H2 carrier for long-distance transport, including higher volumetric energy density compared to gaseous or liquid H2, and avoiding the boil-off rate of liquefied H2 (refs. Moreover, unlike gaseous or liquid H2, international trade networks for NH3 are well established, so existing port facilities and trade routes can be utilized for shipping. Finally, the 2024 H2Global auction for African green H2 to be exported to Europe has resulted in a winning bid from an Egyptian project shipping NH3 to Rotterdam, illustrating the practical relevance of the case. For the remainder of this Article, we therefore analyse the economic viability of exporting green H2 by producing NH3, maintaining this state for transport and shipping and converting NH3 to H2 upon import. This excludes the consideration of other shipping carriers, such as liquid organic hydrogen carriers or methanol (CH4), as the intent of this work is not a comprehensive cost modelling of different theoretical options but providing guidance on the expected cost competitiveness of green H2 exported from African countries to Europe by 2030. To date, only three green H2 deals have reached financial closure on the African continent, as shown in Fig. Consequently, it is impossible to draw on empirical data regarding the COC for green H2 projects across African countries. Therefore, we developed four financing scenarios shown in Table 1, estimated the COC for each and triangulated the approach through 12 semi-structured expert interviews conducted in February–September 2023 (Methods). On interest rate, we depict an investment-friendly world with low interest rates reflective of the time after the financial crisis in 2008 (2009–2013) and a cash-constrained world with high interest rates reflective of the most recent full year of data available (August 2023–July 2024; Methods). For policy, we contrast a de-risked scenario, where European policymakers issue a complete price and off-taker guarantee to lower investment risk, with a commercial scenario, where investment risk lies entirely with the project sponsor. The COC in the de-risked scenario differs by country despite identical offtake guarantees because, based on expert interviews, we assume projects require insurance against expropriation and war by the World Bank Group (Methods provide operationalizing scenarios). As such, the COC can be understood as an aggregate financial metric, which includes underlying techno-economic and socio-political risks. Contrary to many existing reports12, which calculate the cost of green H2 first and then incorporate risk as a qualitative contextual factor, this approach allows us to consider these risks and their variance by country explicitly in the modelling of the cost of green H2 via the COC. Figure 2 shows the calculated COC for green H2 projects by country, including investment into dedicated renewable generation and transport infrastructure, for scenarios 1 and 2. These are most representative of the current macroeconomic environment where interest rates are relatively high (Methods), and they illustrate the de-risking effect of offtake guarantees by European governments. Data on scenarios 3 and 4 are provided in Supplementary Fig. Country COC for a low interest rate environment is provided in Supplementary Fig. Country differences result from different investment risks based on default spreads, whereas differences between policy scenarios—commercial versus de-risked—are the result of different sources of capital and premia (Methods). It also shows that de-risking projects has two effects. First, it lowers the COC for all countries to 9.0% on average (a 42% reduction). This improves the economic viability of green H2 substantially as shown in subsequent analyses (Figs. Second, de-risking reduces the variance of COC across countries. Whereas in the commercial scenario, COC varies by 15.9 percentage points across countries, this variance reduces to 1.9 percentage points in a de-risked scenario. Hence, de-risking acts as a leveller, bringing green H2 costs across different countries much closer together. Each violin plot shows the distribution of LCOH for imports from all modelled locations to Rotterdam. Scenarios are defined as shown in Table 1. The orange line represents the cost of producing green H2 in Rotterdam by 2030 as described in Methods; the green line shows green H2 least cost realized in the European Hydrogen Bank auction closed in February 2024 with production scheduled to start in 2029 at the latest (Supplementary Table 6). Colours indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of green hydrogen produced in Rotterdam. Countries are ordered by median LCOH in scenario 2. The orange line represents the cost of producing green H2 in Rotterdam by 2030 as described in Methods. Colours are on the same scale as in Fig. 3 and indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam, yellow is near the European cost and red is likely to be uncompetitive. c–i, Detailed maps for Angola (c), Egypt (d), Kenya (e), Mauritania (f), Morocco (g), Namibia (h) and South Africa (i). The detailed map costs shown are for scenario 2, cash-constrained de-risked. Countries are not shown to scale to improve readability; each hexagon is the same area across all sub-figures. Colours indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam, yellow is near the European cost and red is likely to be uncompetitive. Stars denote planned projects, as listed in Fig. Finally, the absolute de-risking effect amounts to 6.5 percentage points, irrespective of the interest rate environment (Fig. 2b), which translates into a relative reduction of 42–52% depending on the interest rate scenario. Hence, the policy effect of 6.5 percentage points exceeds the difference between the two interest rate scenarios of 3 percentage points, and the combined difference of policy and interest rate environment amounts to a staggering 9.5 percentage points (average difference between scenarios 1 and 4). The GeoH2 model is employed to calculate the LCOH achievable in each country by optimizing location-specific production, transport, storage and conversion. The greenfield cost of NH3 production from renewable electricity is modelled for 10,300 hexagons (~1,770 km2 each) covering the 31 sample countries (Methods). A plant size of 300 MW, the median size of African projects with a planned operation by 2030, is modelled (Fig. Hourly solar and wind data are used to optimize solar PV, onshore wind, battery storage, electrolysis, H2 storage and NH3 storage, subject to realistic technical constraints (Methods). As we consider plants to be operational by 2030, we focus on shipping to Europe (that is, Rotterdam) rather than pipeline transport, a potential option for North African countries. Given the recent results of H2Global auctions, shipping is confirmed to be the most realistic option for North African countries, such as Egypt, too. Pipeline and trucking transport to the port are considered; the cheapest option is selected for each hexagon. Shipping costs to Rotterdam are calculated per distance based on the literature (Methods). The results are contrasted with a European green H2 cost estimate inferred from our model and triangulated with values from literature. Figure 3 shows the resulting LCOH distribution across the sampled coastal African countries under each financing scenario. In a high interest environment (scenarios 1 and 2), least costs for green H2 exported from Africa are €4.9 kgH2−1 without policy support and €3.8 kgH2−1 when fully de-risked by European governments. Recent auction results from H2Global point to a price of green H2 around €4.5 kgH2−1 for de-risked delivery to Rotterdam from 2027 until 203326, well in line with our results. Our results also demonstrate the importance of de-risking, which reduces least costs by €1.1 kgH2−1 and median costs by €3.9 kgH2−1 (average between high- and low interest environment). The lowest achievable costs in the sampled African countries are roughly in the range of estimates for European green H2 by 2030, around €3–5 kgH2−1 (Methods), demonstrating that achieving cost competitiveness with European green H2 will be challenging. In the current high interest macroeconomic environment, cost-competitive production (that is, below costs in Rotterdam estimated at €4.67–4.75 kgH2−1 with slight variations according to scenarios; Methods and Supplementary Table 2) is unattainable without de-risking. With de-risking, only 2.1% of all studied locations are economically competitive (Supplementary Table 2 and compare Fig. These are situated in Algeria, Kenya, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia and Sudan. In a low interest rate environment, the proportions of locations reaching cost competitiveness without de-risking remains minimal at 0.5% (11.0% with de-risking). We find no location competitive with the first round of auction results by the European Hydrogen Bank, which yielded a lowest bid of €2.8 kgH2−1 in Spain (Supplementary Table 6). De-risking not only increases the number of cost-competitive African locations but also narrows the cost distribution substantially across countries. Costs range from €4.9–22.8 kgH2−1 without de-risking in the current macroeconomic environment but only from €3.8 to €12.0 kgH2−1 with de-risking. Irrespective of the interest rate environment, the lowest-cost locations for green H2 production without de-risking are mainly in Morocco and Algeria, due to their relatively good institutional quality, exceptional wind resources and relative proximity to Rotterdam. Whereas Mauritania shares Morocco's advantages in wind resources and proximity to Europe, it has lower institutional quality, reflected in its higher COC compared to Morocco (that is, 13.6% versus 10.6% without de-risking, 8.6% versus 8.1% with de-risking). To further clarify spatial cost variance, Fig. 5a,b maps continent-wide LCOH for scenarios 1 and 2 alongside planned project locations (Supplementary Fig. Equatorial costs are high due to moderate wind resources and consistent cloud cover, increasing renewable energy cost and thus LCOH. We identify least-cost green H2 production locations in the Western Sahara (modelled as part of Morocco, the authors make no statement about its political status), Mauritania, Central Algeria, at the Sudanese–Egyptian border and Lake Turkana's shores at the Kenyan–Ethiopian border. Some coastal areas in Namibia and South Africa also exhibit low costs as shown in Fig. To increase the number of cost-competitive African green H2 production locations, cost drivers and cost-reduction levers must be identified. To this end, a detailed cost breakdown for the least-cost green H2 location by country is provided in Fig. This figure shows that the lowest LCOH is achieved by leveraging excellent onshore wind resources, which facilitate lower-cost green H2 production than solar photovoltaics (PV) systems due to their more consistent electricity output. Scrutinizing the temporal optimization results, we find that NH3 and compressed H2 storage are used to balance intermittent renewable energy generation and demand more cost competitively than battery storage in all examined countries' least-cost production locations (Supplementary Fig. Nevertheless, more consistent wind resources reduce the expenditure required for any form of storage, driving down costs. Cost for the least-cost location in each country under scenario 2, cash-constrained de-risked. ‘Other' contains costs for H2 compression and decompression, trucking transportation, battery interface, Haber–Bosch process, H2 fuel cell and a ramping penalty. Figure 6 also shows that renewable energy investment constitutes the largest cost component for all countries. This points to two levers for cost reductions. First, lowering renewable energy costs would directly reduce the cost of green H2. This could potentially enhance the cost competitiveness of African green H2 exports, depending on concurrent impacts on European electricity prices, as these would probably move too if renewable energy costs shift drastically. Note that we currently consider a Rotterdam reference case using grid electricity. If contrasted with a newly built renewable energy production facility, wind energy cost changes would only affect the relative cost advantage to the extent that African projects face a higher COC and therefore benefit from a CAPEX reduction slightly more. Secondly, efficient de-risking (that is, maximally reducing the COC) can lower COC-intensive investments into renewables and consequently green H2 costs. Whereas movements in the general interest rate would affect the cost competitiveness of African projects compared to European ones only to the extent that African projects are more capital intensive because they require greenfield renewable energy, strong de-risking would improve the cost competitiveness of African projects directly. Finally, shipping costs are shown to have a marginal impact on LCOH. This suggests that potential economies of scale in NH3 shipping or repurposing existing pipelines from northern Africa to southern Europe may not notably enhance cost competitiveness of African green H2. On the upside, it indicates that uncertainties around NH3 shipping costs should not constitute a major impediment to planning green H2 export projects in African countries. We conduct a sensitivity analysis shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 where we vary the most important and most discussed input costs (that is, wind, solar PV and electrolyser CAPEX) by ± 20% for each financing scenario, indicating that a combination of wind and electrolyser CAPEX reductions could lower costs by roughly €0.5 kgH2−1 depending on the scenario. We note that battery storage costs may also decrease substantially making solar PV a more viable electricity source by powering the electrolyser at night (compared with Supplementary Fig. However, for the purpose of this analysis, we subsume this effect into the modelled cost decrease of solar PV, which yielded minimal benefits as shown in Supplementary Fig. Our findings indicate that using African green H2 to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors in Europe might be unrealistic without de-risking from European countries, at least in the near-term. In a commercial scenario, green H2 from Africa is not cost competitive by 2030. With de-risking, several locations (2.1% of all studied) become cost competitive, yet questions around the economic feasibility of large infrastructure projects in many of these locations remain, as they face challenging localized security situations. Notwithstanding these challenges, de-risking is probably necessary to develop a market with a sufficient portfolio of potential locations, and future research is required to assess the potential for improved competitiveness beyond 2030. Results also illuminate potential issues beyond cost that could hinder investment. First, many low-cost locations are in regions that are either politically contested or encounter relatively regular flares of armed conflict where the UK and German governments advise against travel. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or off-taker guarantees are probably unavailable in these areas, limiting de-risking potential. While beyond the scope of this paper, future analyses could consider investment risk variations within countries, including in specific regions with severe political instabilities. For example, as of 2021, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Mauritania is roughly US$10 billion; however, the planned green H2 project Aman is estimated to require an investment of US$40 billion, four times the country's GDP29,30. This situation is concerning as many African countries face massive foreign debt burdens31. Third, whereas we find that wind resources are critical to low-cost green H2 production, local expertise to install this wind capacity may be insufficient. For context, there were 7.7 GW of installed wind capacity on the continent in 2022 (versus 12.5 GW of solar PV)15; meanwhile, wind plants on GW scale will be needed for each H2 production site (for example, up to 1.6 GW in Morocco), requiring massive upskilling efforts. Finally, some low-cost locations, such as those near the Red Sea or the river Nile in Egypt, may also face challenges of water insecurity potentially disrupting consistent production. Whereas water costs are considered in GeoH2, the potential for water depletion and associated conflict risks are not at present. African countries will face global competition for cheap green H2 production from countries such as Chile32, Oman33 and Saudi Arabia1 with plans to expand production of H2 and downstream products (for example, iron). These countries have the domestic financial resources to fund infrastructure development, institutional frameworks to attract large international private investment and strategic locations along major international trading routes. European countries such as Spain also offer favourable H2 production costs, low COC and proximity to demand locations17. Tailored de-risking support from international organizations, such as the World Bank or the United Nations Development Program34,35, may therefore be necessary for African nations to compete. Similarly, African countries should consider such benefits in bilateral negotiations with prospective green H2 importers. Considering the prospects for local industrial use of green H2 (for example, in creating value-added downstream products) when designing policy support schemes may favour countries such as Morocco, Egypt, South Africa or Kenya, in contrast to Mauritania or Namibia, as the latter exhibit less fitting industrial pre-conditions, which are relevant for the successful implementation of green H2 production value chains36. African countries could also strike intra-continental agreements concerning the optimal production, use and trade of green H2, which may necessitate modelling costs for countries that are excluded in the present analysis. International organizations may consider de-risking local use in such cases. Whereas potentially more challenging, such multi-use projects may improve developmental impacts and avoid neo-colonial extractive patterns of excessively large, export-only projects—a risk evident in planned projects. Comprehensive plans for economic development around green H2 production will be crucial to ensure a beneficial industry for decarbonization in Europe and development in Africa alike. We model the LCOH for all African countries with access to ports, excluding landlocked countries, due to the logistical and infrastructural complexities that hinder H2 export from these areas. Further, Somalia and Libya are excluded from our analysis given that in the past 5 years, both countries were in the bottom 5% of the World Bank Governance Indicators in terms of political stability37. It is therefore likely that investors would refrain from any project in these countries, irrespective of the theoretical COC. Finally, we exclude small island states such as Cape Verde or Mauritius from our analysis due to space and infrastructure constraints. This yields a list of 31 African countries for our sample, which constitutes 85% of total African GDP38. To collect planned green H2 projects, we use the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Hydrogen Database, which lists 1,991 H2 projects as of December 202322. Of these, 66 projects are located in our sample countries and plan to produce H2 from electrolysis using renewable electricity from either wind or solar. First, announced projects with live dates beyond 2030 are probably speculative, and it is difficult to assess the credibility of the plans. The final green H2 project sample consists of 34 projects, for which we include the project's development status, planned first year of operation, designated end-use applications and size in standardized electrolysis capacity as calculated by the IEA in MW H2 output (LHV) for all Power-to-X projects (Supplementary Table 3)22. Capacity affects the LCOH via economies of scale (for example, in the electrolyser) and space constraints as larger projects need more space, mainly for renewable energy build-out. Between February and August 2023, F. Schneider and F. Egli conducted 12 virtual exploratory expert interviews with 13 representatives to inform the financing scenarios shown in Table 1. All interviews followed the same question guide provided in a slide deck to interviewees. Interviewees were sampled from organizations that would probably be involved in financing deals if de-risked by European policymakers. Early interviewees were contacted using the researchers' network and subsequent ones via snowball sampling. Systematic sampling is impossible because few experts globally can comment on the planned financing structures. Note that interviews only served to triangulate our COC estimation approach, which is based on peer-reviewed literature. Hence, we are less concerned about potential sampling biases regarding gender or region. Interviews took place under Chatham House rules, and consent to use provided information in research was obtained at the beginning together with shared information on the research project in the form of a slide deck. No personal information beyond participants' names and affiliations was obtained and interviewees are listed anonymously only. An overview of the interview sample is provided in Supplementary Table 4. The COC is the price that a profit-maximizing capital provider demands for investing equity into a project or issuing debt (for example, loans) for a project. The COC increases with the risk for an investor of being unable to recoup their investment, for example, due to uncertain policy environments or novel risky technologies. In financial economics, it is common practice to decompose the COC into a risk-free rate (reflecting the time value of money) and a risk premium (reflecting the investment-specific risk). The latter typically differs between countries, technologies and over time39. A standard project-level specification of the COC is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), where capital is sourced from equity and debt financing. In line with the literature39, a standard notation ‘vanilla-WACC' (no consideration of potential tax deductions for debt payments) can be defined as follows: where \({K}_{{\mathrm{e}},{{i}}}\) and \({K}_{{\mathrm{d}},i}\) denote the cost of equity and the cost of debt, respectively, for investments in a specific country i. \(E\), \(D\) and \(V\) denote total equity, debt and capital; the debt share is denoted as \(\frac{D}{V}\). As we model the case of exporting green H2 from Africa to Europe, it is uncertain which entities would be liable to pay tax where and we do not consider a country-specific tax rate. We use the terms COC and WACC interchangeably in this paper, focusing on COC in the main text for simplicity. In the absence of a track record for the financing of green H2 projects globally and certainly in Africa, we define four financing scenarios to model the COC based on insights from the finance literature and expert interviews (Table 1, main text). Across all financing scenarios, we use a separate COC for the plant investment encompassing H2 production facilities (for example, the electrolyser), the renewable energy generation assets and the supporting infrastructure encompassing roads, pipelines and so on. The risk-free rate \({r}_\mathrm{f}\) is based on two indicators: a long-term risk-free bond, commonly depicted with the 10-year US treasury bond yield and an overnight interbank rate reflecting the current interest rate environment, commonly depicted with the Effective Federal Funds Rate (FFR). In line with previous work40, we estimate \({r}_\mathrm{f}\) for a high and a low interest rate scenario to account for the fact that the interest rate environment has a large impact on the cost of renewables. Conversely, \({r}_{\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{high}}}\) is set to 5%, which is representative of the high interest environment over the last year (August 2023–July 2024) at the time of writing. During this period, the average 10-year US treasury bond yield stood at 4.33% and the FFR at 5.33% (refs. In this Article, we therefore consider the high interest rate environment (Table 1) to be representative of the status quo. The share of debt in total financing, \(\frac{D}{V}\), is assumed to be 75% across all scenarios18. We model a commercial scenario in both interest rate environments (Table 1, main text). For these commercial scenarios 1 and 3, we define the cost of debt to reflect lending to a large infrastructure project in a specific country. Namely, we add a country default spread to reflect country risk43 (\({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\)) and a lender margin (\({L}_\mathrm{m}\)), which we set to 2% in line with the literature15,44,45, to reflect infrastructure risk. The country default spreads are reflective of country risk at the time of writing in 2023. Furthermore, we add an equity risk premium and a technology premium to reflect the additional risk of equity compared to debt and the risk of green H2 investments, as there is a very limited track record. The cost of equity for commercial scenarios was calculated as follows: where ERP is the equity risk premium of a mature market, set to 5% in July 202343. \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) varies by country i and accounts for the return that investors require as compensation for the risk of an investment in a publicly listed company in each country. In addition, the technology premium (Tp) reflects that green H2 is a relatively immature technology with a limited track record of successfully constructing large-scale projects. Following a recent IRENA report15, Tp is set to 3.25%, reflecting an investment premium for novel technologies. 43 does not provide \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) and \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) for Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Djibouti and Mauritania, \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) is obtained using Wikiratings as described in Supplementary Table 5. Thereafter, \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) is calculated following the approach suggested by ref. Finally, we assume that any supporting infrastructure will be financed by a project's host government at its sovereign rate. Consequently, the COC for infrastructure is given by: For the de-risked scenarios 2 and 4 (Table 1, main text), we model a situation where a green H2 project on the African continent benefits from access to below-market terms financing due to an offtake guarantee from a western European government entity. This assumption follows developments driven in particular by Germany, which has established diplomatic relations to support the transition of current fossil fuel exporting nations such as Angola or Nigeria to a decarbonized energy export industry by substituting fossil fuel exports at least partially by H2 (ref. Moreover, Germany has recently announced a joint declaration of intent with the Netherlands to implement a joint tender under the H2Global Instrument, offering 10-year purchase agreements to suppliers to kick-start the emergent European green H2 import market47. Finally, Germany has signed further bilateral partnership agreements with countries such as South Africa48, Namibia49 and Kenya50. In these scenarios, the cost of debt can be represented as follows: where \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{\mathrm{WesternEU}}\) represents the average default spread of a western European country weighted by its GDP, where western Europe includes Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom43. Despite the offtake guarantee, certain risks, such as the risk of expropriation or war, will remain. Consequently, we assume that in scenarios 2 and 4, investors will seek insurance against such political risks, which could disrupt operations or damage assets. Informed by the expert interviews and because private political risk insurance is not available in most countries in our sample, we assume political risk insurance by the World Bank Group's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). \({\mathrm{MIGA}}_{{\mathrm{expr}}_{i}}\) and \({\mathrm{MIGA}}_{{\mathrm{war}}_{i}}\) represent the price for obtaining such coverage for war and expropriation risk. Assuming that in a de-risked scenario, only country risk will remain as the project is fully de-risked, the distribution of in-sample country risk, reflected by the credit default spread provided by ref. 43 can be mapped onto the pricing range indicated by ref. Formally, the approach can be represented as follows: The cost of equity was calculated as follows: where \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{\mathrm{WesternEU}}\) reflects the average equity country risk premium in Western Europe weighted by GDP. Finally, we assume that infrastructure in the de-risked scenarios is either financed by the host government, that is, as in the commercial scenarios or financed by the project sponsor backed with an offtake guarantee from a western European government. A detailed breakdown of how the COC components were obtained and the corresponding data sources are provided in Supplementary Table 5. The GeoH2 optimization model is used to calculate the lowest possible cost of H2 achievable throughout each country, assuming an electrolyser lifetime of 20 years. Electrolyser lifetimes are subject to some uncertainty, but do not have a major impact on LCOH52 and most importantly for this analysis, affect the LCOH in European and African countries alike except for a small penalty for Africa-based production due to higher financing costs on the CAPEX. In each hexagon, a cost-optimal off-grid H2 plant powered by PV and wind turbines is designed to meet the specified demand. The electrical infrastructure (that is, PV, turbines, battery storage) and plant infrastructure (that is, electrolyser, NH3 storage, compressed H2 storage) are sized for cost optimality using site-specific, hourly weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 dataset53. Here data for the duration of 2022 are used. The Corine Land Cover54 and OpenStreetMap55 datasets are used to constrain land availability in each hexagon, and country boundary base maps are from GADM, which allows free academic re-use. Water costs for either desalination or freshwater processing are included as applicable—however, no limit is placed on water consumption to avoid depletion in either case. Cost parameters used in the modelling are available in Supplementary Table 1 and harmonized to 2023 euros using average annual US$/€ exchange rates from the Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and an annual average of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices from Eurostat. A demand of 60.6 ktH2 yr−1 is simulated at each country's main port. This demand is assumed to be met in the form of green NH3 (that is, 341.4 ktNH3 yr−1) due to its cost advantages in shipping and to be temporally uniform (that is, evenly spaced truck pick-ups throughout the year or a consistent pipeline flow rate). A first stream of this literature investigates green ammonia costs in/from specific countries56,57 and trading routes58 whereby a second stream of literature looks at global ammonia trade. Reference 59 applies a global optimization model to locate optimal ammonia production sites, however the site selection is based on a previous paper and planned projects, considering a total of 112 sites. Such models are great to assess the cost competitiveness of planned projects; however, they cannot compare these to alternative possibilities as we do for the African continent. 60 applies a geospatial model in 28 countries with a less granular resolution within country and abstracting from water costs and transportation options to port (pipeline vs trucking), which are included in this paper. Hence, whereas the key contribution of this paper is the inclusion and comparison of different financing and policy scenarios and the explicit calculation of the cost differentials for the entire African continent, we also apply a state-of-the-art bottom-up model, which can serve to improve within-country cost comparisons. Level-four H3 hexagons61 are used to define the spatial resolution. Land availability is constrained such that H2 production and associated generation are not permitted to be built on wetland, built-up areas, water bodies or within 250 m of coastlines or protected areas. PV is additionally not permitted to be built on agricultural land. Whereas elevation is not considered as an exclusion criterion here due to data constraints, future work may also wish to exclude high elevations or steep slopes. All maps are based on the authors' own analysis of publicly available input data. Note that this work leverages a model of the Haber–Bosch process in plant optimization in place of the H2 production process available in the standard GeoH2 model14. This variant of the codebase is made available on GitHub (Code Availability). Previous work has estimated the cost of shipping NH3 over a distance of approximately 13,800 km to be €0.39 kgH2−1 (ref. 24, shipping cost projections depend approximately linearly on transport distance. Consequently, we scale this estimate linearly to km, resulting in our cost parameter of €0.00003 kgNH3−1 km−1, which we multiplied with each of the obtained distances from the African port to Rotterdam. Implementing this approach yields a shipping cost range of €0.09 kgH2−1 (Morocco)–€0.44 kgH2−1 (Mozambique), in line with other estimates in the literature, according to which shipping could add up to €0.46 kgH2−1 by 203063. The interest rates for Rotterdam are obtained following the same approach as for all other countries described in Methods and following previous work, heat costs of €0.06 kWh−1 are assumed for converting NH3 to H2 (ref. Note that the cost of this process is subject to some uncertainty because it does not yet exist at scale. At the time of writing, Dutch Power Base futures are available until October 2028, and the average price obtained is €0.097 kWh−1. Ideally, we would base our calculation on a Dutch Power Base future that matches our modelling period of 20 years. As this is not available, we took the longest available market-based future as input for our simplified model in Rotterdam using constant electricity prices. Moreover, future prices reflect the current interest rate environment; hence, we deem our Rotterdam costing most representative for scenarios 1 and 2, on which all results in the main text are based and suggest some caution when using it for scenarios 3 and 4. Whereas Rotterdam serves as our comparison case, the resulting electricity cost is deemed representative of the European Union as a whole, given that historically, Dutch wholesale electricity prices were strongly correlated with German wholesale electricity prices, and the Dutch wholesale price roughly represents the average wholesale electricity price in Europe66. Our modelling excludes two cost components: namely, (1) costs associated with upgrading ports to enable large-scale NH3 shipments and (2) costs for last-mile distribution in Europe. Both would require detailed information (that is, on port design and demand locations respectively), which is beyond the scope of this analysis. Furthermore, our model does not account for potential cost reductions in onshore wind, solar PV, electrolysers and battery storage that may occur by the year 2030. Such cost decreases will not only reduce the cost of green H2 projects in Africa but may also influence renewable deployment in Europe and, therefore, European wholesale electricity prices. As such, the net effect on the cost competitiveness of African green H2 exports vs European green H2 production remains inconclusive. Finally, we calculate the LCOH in Rotterdam to create a European cost benchmark. We use the same assumptions for electricity and heat costs as mentioned above to model LCOH for green H2 produced in Rotterdam using grid electricity due to space constraints for renewable energy. Due to the absence of renewable energy investments, these projects are much less capital intensive, and variations in the COC, therefore, are less important for LCOH. Note that recent auctions by the European Hydrogen Bank have yielded winning projects using grid electricity and/or greenfield renewable energy. Here we consider the former case only, whereas future research could model European least costs more comprehensively by considering all locations in Europe with their respective transport costs to demand centres. Because large green H2 production plants do not currently exist, cost estimates are not commonly available, but several reports have tried to estimate costs. These are broadly in line with our costs; for example, Aurora Energy Research estimates the least-cost LCOH in Germany by 2030 between €3.9 and €5 kgH2−1 (ref. Other research reports even lower 2030 costs for Germany of US$3.1 kgH2−1 in a baseline scenario and US$2.7 kgH2−1 in an optimistic scenario68, which is roughly the range where the IEA Global Hydrogen Review places North-Western European green H2 costs by 2020 (€3.1 kgH2−1) (ref. Other European locations, such as Spain, with more favourable renewable energy sources and similarly favourable financing costs, may reach even lower costs by 2030 at €2.7 kgH2−1 as estimated by the Hydrogen Council and McKinsey69. These costs have been confirmed by the results of the recent European Hydrogen Bank auction yielding a lowest bid in Spain at €2.8 kgH2−1. For the four other countries where least costs were disclosed, they ranged from €4.6 kgH2−1 in Norway to €7.6 kgH2−1 in the Netherlands (Supplementary Table 6). Note that we prefer comparing our results to realized costs as comparisons across studies with different methodological approaches, spatial resolutions, geographical and technological scopes and policy cases considered are difficult (Supplementary Table 7).

Here we question how newer facility types fare relative to standard bicycle lanes. Using 6 years of longitudinal data across 14,011 block groups in 28 US cities, we find that block groups that installed protected bicycle lanes experienced bicycle commuter increases 1.8 times larger than standard bicycle lane block groups, 1.6 times larger than shared-lane marking block groups and 4.3 times larger than block groups that did not install bicycle facilities. The results suggest that lower-stress bicycle facilities—such as protected bicycle lanes—are significantly associated with larger increases in ridership at the block-group level compared with higher-stress facilities such as standard bicycle lanes and shared-lane markings. ‘Build it, and they will come' has long been repeated by cities seeking to promote sustainable mobility and increase bicycle ridership via the installation of bicycle infrastructure. Early cross-sectional research into this topic by Nelson and Allen found a significant association between additional miles of bicycle pathways per capita and increased bicycle commute mode share across 18 US municipalities, including several small college towns1. Dill and Carr assessed a more uniform set of 43 large US cities and found bicycle commute mode share to be positively and significantly associated with the presence of bicycle lanes2. Additional research has confirmed the positive relationship between bicycle lanes and bicycle ridership, especially for facilities that are part of a connected bicycle network3,4,5. The above research establishes a link between standard bicycle lanes (SBLs) and bicycle commuters, but there is an immediate need to expand beyond SBLs to account for increasingly popular bicycle facility types such as protected bicycle lanes (PBLs), buffered bicycle lanes (BBLs) and shared-lane markings (more commonly referred to as sharrows; SHRs)6,7. While surveys have shown that potential riders' stated preferences are for lower-stress bicycle facilities such as PBLs8,9, few studies have explored whether that preference translates to ridership. Existing research exploring ridership relative to newer bicycle facility types has consisted of limited geographic range (typically a single corridor or single city) and/or has examined individual bicycle facility types as opposed to a holistic study that compares all bicycle facility types10,11,12,13. Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of the above papers introduces another research question: are bicycle facilities causing the high levels of bicycle commuting observed, or are bicycle facilities being installed in areas with high preexisting levels of bicycle commuting? Cross-sectional studies make it difficult to substantiate causality14, so a longitudinal study comparing changes in bicycle facilities over time with changes in ridership over time may provide insight into the above research question. With this Article, we present a holistic examination of the relationship between different on-road bicycle facility types and bicycle commute ridership. More specifically, we collected 6 years of longitudinal bicycle facility installation data across 14,011 block groups in 28 US cities. For each facility type, we then explored bicycle commuting changes while controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) and built environment factors via three complementary analyses. The first two analyses—analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and difference-in-difference (DID)—designated block groups based on the lowest-stress bicycle facility installed in each block group between 2014 and 2019 (block groups could also be designated as ‘None' if there were no bicycle facilities installed during the period). The ANCOVA explored changes in the number of bicycle commuters, whereas the DID explored changes in bicycle commute mode share. The third analysis—a multivariate regression—explored changes in the number of bicycle commuters while simultaneously accounting for the length of every bicycle facility type installed in each block group between 2014 and 2019. From lowest stress to highest stress, the bicycle facility types studied were PBLs, BBLs, SBL and SHRs. More specifically, block groups that installed PBLs, which we designated as PBL block groups, saw increases in the number of bicycle commuters that were 1.9, 1.8, 1.6 and 4.3 times larger than block groups whose lowest-stress bicycle facility installed was a BBL (BBL block groups), SBL (SBL block groups), SHR (SHR block groups) or ‘None' (that is, block groups that installed no bicycle facilities), respectively. Block groups of all bicycle facility types had significantly larger increases in bicycle commuting than block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed. There were, however, no significant differences between the BBL, SBL and SHR block groups. For the second analysis, we tested the same block group data using a DID approach, comparing changes in bicycle commute mode share in each facility type's block groups with changes in block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed. This time, the BBL block groups experienced the largest increase in bicycle commute mode share (Fig. Although PBLs were installed in block groups with the highest extant levels of bicycle commuting, the PBL block groups still experienced the second largest increase in bicycle commute mode share in the after period. Interestingly, the initial bicycle commute mode shares in the SBL block groups were similar to the BBL block groups, yet bicycle commute mode share growth was 42.2% stronger in the BBL block group than in the SBL block groups. SHRs also tended to be installed in areas with higher extant levels of bicycle commuting, but the SHR block group bicycle commute mode share increase was 30.4% weaker than the increase experienced in PBL block groups. Block groups for all the bicycle facility types experienced bicycle commuting growth between 60% and 220% stronger than block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed (see all DID P values reaching 95% statistical significance in Fig. Solid lines are actual changes in bicycle commute mode share; dashed lines are estimated changes had facilities not been installed. The third analysis—a multivariate regression—also explored longitudinal changes in the number of bicycle commuters by block group but simultaneously accounted for the mileage of all bicycle facility types installed between 2014 and 2019 while controlling for SES and built environment factors. The installation mileage of PBLs and BBLs had especially strong and significant relationships with increases in bicycle commuters at the block group level (Table 2). For an average-sized block group with average characteristics (that is, a commuter population of 687.2 commuters and a land area of 0.57 square miles), each additional mile of PBLs was significantly associated with 11.9 more bicycle commuters per block group and each additional mile of BBLs was associated with 14.0 more bicycle commuters per block group. Installation mileage of SBLs had a significant and positive relationship with bicycle commuters but was only 35–44% as strong as PBLs or BBLs. In other words, each additional mile of SBLs was associated with 6.9 more bicycle commuters per block group. The installation mileage of SHRs did not have a significant relationship with changes in ridership. Results suggest that (1) cities that wish to encourage more biking activity seem justified in installing bicycle facilities toward that end, and (2) lower-stress bicycle facilities—such as PBLs and BBLs—tend to be significantly associated with larger increases in ridership at the block group level than higher-stress bicycle facilities such as SBLs and SHRs. While SHRs correlated with increased bicycle commuting relative to no new bicycling infrastructure in the initial ANCOVA analysis, the shift became weaker once accounting for extant levels of bicycle commuting in the second DID analysis, and then insignificant once other bicycle facilities were accounted for in the third multivariate analysis. The results can be interpreted as a general validation of stress-based planning tools such as bicycle level of traffic stress15. Agencies have widely adopted bicycle level of traffic stress to assess their bicycle networks, frequently endeavoring to provide connected bicycle networks with the lowest possible stress level. This Article's findings support this approach; cities that seek to boost bicycle commute mode shifts should focus on implementing low-stress bicycle facilities if they want to best facilitate the sizable population of less-confident potential riders16. Although higher bicycle mode share is not necessarily an end in itself, it could help cities to lower fuel consumption, emissions and transportation costs while providing more mobility options to a greater percentage of the population along with better health outcomes and better safety for bicyclists and nonbicyclist road users alike17,18. Future research might examine various PBL characteristics in further depth such as the amount of separation, type of protection, and vehicle volume or speed of the adjoining roadway to examine their impacts on bicycle ridership. For example, do PBLs on large roadways with high vehicle volumes and speeds have less impact on potential ridership? Future research might also account for each facility's place in the wider bicycle network to understand whether isolated lower-stress bicycle facilities are as impactful as connected lower-stress bicycle facilities. Furthermore, as different ages or genders may be more or less sensitive to different types of bicycle infrastructure, future work might explore how facility types are correlated with age or gendered ridership. Future research might also explore how quickly different bicycle facility types encourage additional ridership and for how long that additional ridership may last. As cities' commitments to promoting sustainable transportation through biking continue to evolve with more mature bicycle facilities and expanding bicycle networks, results of this study suggest more nuance to the old mantra ‘Build it, and they will come' by unveiling a link between lower-stress bicycle facilities and larger increases in bicycle commuting. We first identified high-bicycling cities with more than double the national average of bicycle commute mode share using 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. Next, each high-bicycling city needed a logical paired comparison city that had substantially lower levels of bicycle commute mode share but similar population, geographic location, climate and function. To match the smallest ACS commute mode share geography, we conducted this study at the block group level. Our dependent variables were related to bicycle commuting and obtained from the ACS. The ACS asks respondents how they usually traveled to work during the previous week. The ACS does not provide an option to record linked trips. The respondent is instead asked to select the one mode that was used for most of their commuting distance. Bike-to-work commuting has proven to be a strong proxy for overall levels of bicycling activity (Spearman ρ of 0.53) and especially strong for large central metro areas and medium metro areas such as those explored in this Article (Spearman ρ of 0.58 and 0.57, respectively)19. For the first and second analyses—ANCOVA and DID—each block group was designated as its lowest-stress bicycle facility type installed between 2014 and 2019 while the multivariate regression analysis simultaneously accounted for the mileage of every bicycle facility type installed between 2014 and 2019 for each block group. We manually derived the installation month of every bicycle facility in our study cities using historic bicycle maps, interviews with city employees, historic satellite images from Google Earth, and historic Google Street Views. As SHRs consist of individual pavement markings without any longitudinal markings, we designated any road segment that had SHRs at consistent spacing along the segment as having that facility type. If the SHRs ended at a midblock location, we ended the facility type at that location. We obtained a variety of SES covariates from 2016 5-year ACS estimates and built environment covariates from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Smart Location Database (SLD) representative of conditions in 2017 and 2018. After removing variables that introduced multicollinearity based on a Pearson's correlation analysis, our final covariates were the number of commuters (from the ACS), proportion of population with a bachelor's degree (from the ACS), population density (from the SLD) and road density (from the SLD). We first ran an ANCOVA test to understand whether block groups that installed different types of bicycle facility experienced distinct changes in bicycle commuting. Because past research identified that potential riders are more willing to try lower-stress bicycle facilities, we designated each block group as the lowest-stress facility that was installed in the block group between 2014 and 2019, regardless of whether or what type of bicycle facility was present on the roadway previously8. The dependent variable was the change in the number of bicycle commuters between 2013/2014 and 2018/2019 (two years were averaged because of relatively high variability in bicycle commuting numbers), and we controlled for all the covariates detailed above. The second DID analyses on the block group level allowed us to understand whether increases in bicycle commuting were following extant trends or whether the changes in bicycle commuting were statistically associated with the installation of different bicycle facility types. For each bicycle facility type, we first derived a bicycle facility type dummy variable where each block group's lowest-stress bicycle facility type installed between 2014 and 2019 was designated as 1 and block groups with no bicycle facilities installed between 2014 and 2019 were designated as 0. We also created a time dummy variable where the before period (2010/2011 to 2013/2014) was designated as 0 and the after period (2013/2014 to 2018/2019) was designated as 1. We derived a DID interaction variable by multiplying the treatment and time dummy variables. The dependent variable was the change in bicycle commute mode share between 2014 and 2019 as a continuous variable. We derived linear regressions using the lm command in R to compare the change in bicycle commute mode share between 2014 and 2019 for the block groups of each bicycle facility type relative to block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed. We converted the independent variables and covariates to z scores so the coefficients could be directly compared.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Black Death Plague That Killed Millions Became Less Fatal because of This Genetic Tweak Reducing the copies of one gene in the bubonic plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, made it less deadly but potentially more transmissible A small genetic change makes the bacterium that caused the plague less fatal but possibly more transmissible, allowing for greater disease spread in smaller populations, a study in Science reports. The bacteria still circulate in low levels in parts of the United States, Africa and Asia, and are typically transmitted to humans by infected fleas carried by rats or other rodents. Previous research found that some strains of Y. pestis had reduced amounts of pla, a gene associated with disease severity, but it was unclear why, says Ravneet Sidhu, a palaeogeneticist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and a co-author of the latest work. “Our findings in this study characterize a case in which a pandemic-causing pathogen has independently evolved to cause what we believe is a slightly weaker form of the disease,” she says.

The team also looked at the genomes of ancient and modern strains of Y. pestis to find out how prevalent pla depletion was. Between 30% and 50% of ancient strains obtained from previously published studies showed signs of depletion, as did three modern strains, isolated from a human and two rats in 1994. Wanting to understand why pla was depleted, the researchers analysed the genetic data from these ancient and modern strains. The findings show how small genetic changes can have significant effects on pathogen transmission, says Francesca Short, a microbiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. It is a dosage change that has emerged multiple times in history, and the authors have plausibly linked that change to reduced virulence and potentially increased transmission, Short says. “In reality, to understand how other diseases behave, we require specific research into those diseases from multiple fields, including theoretical and experimental evolution,” Sidhu adds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI Found a ‘Magic Potion' That Can Bring Dead Batteries Back to Life A team of researchers in China has found a way to bring dead lithium-ion batteries back to life, potentially reducing both the amount of waste that's quickly piling up from spent electric vehicle (EV) batteries and the need to produce as many new ones. The amount of spent lithium-ion batteries that need disposal is expected to soar from an estimate of 900,000 metric tons this year to 20.5 million metric tons by 2040, according to a report released by the United Nations Development Program last September. As the world's leader in deploying EVs, China is already handling 2.8 million metric tons of retired cells ever year, according to Huang Jianzhong, chairman of China Electronic Energy Saving Technology Association, a government-approved trade body.

With consumer markets and waste piles both growing rapidly, Yue Gao, a chemist at Fudan University in Shanghai, and his colleagues anticipated a rising demand for longer-life lithium-ion batteries. But “we had no idea what kinds of molecules could do that job or what their chemical structures would be, so we used machine learning to help us,” says Chihao Zhao, a Ph.D. student at Fudan University, who is a member of Gao's team but was not a co-author of the new study. Lithium ions were restored to a spent battery pack by injecting an electrolyte solution. They fed it a database of electrochemical reactions and had it look for molecules that would meet their requirements, such as dissolving well in an electrolyte solution and being relatively cheap to produce. The researchers tested this lithium-ion salt by dissolving it in an electrolyte solution, which allows ions to pass between a cell's positive and negative terminals. Gao likens this to giving a human patient an IV. “If we can give an injection to a sick person to help them recover,” he says, “why can't we have a magic potion for drained batteries, too?” An LFP battery that powers an EV can typically be charged and then discharged about 2,000 times before it is considered “dead” (when its capacity is below the 80 percent mark). A follow-up experiment showed the method also worked on NMC (nickel, manganese and cobalt) lithium-ion batteries, Gao says. Fudan University is currently working with China-based battery-material maker Zhejiang Yongtai New Material to commercialize the method, according to a social media post published by Yongtai. Gao envisions a widespread system of “battery-boosting stations” where EV owners will be able to bring dead power sources to be rejuvenated. The idea is “promising,” says Chenguang Liu of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in China, who researches battery materials and was not involved in the study. And EV power comes not from a single, simple cell but from a battery pack that can comprise hundreds or even thousands of cells, along with heat-control systems and other components. “We have only conducted experiments on cells, and we need to find a way to apply it onto a whole battery pack,” Gao says. His team's method is the closest thing yet to a “direct-recycling process” for EV batteries in China today, says Hans Eric Melin, an analyst of battery reuse and recycling and managing director of Circular Energy Storage, a London-based consultancy. (In China, some degraded EV batteries are currently used to power other products that require lower energy outputs, such as electric mopeds and energy storage stations. Others are crushed and shredded into industrial waste called “black mass,” from which valuable raw materials, such as lithium and graphite, can be harvested.) It will also require battery packs that are designed in a way to allow for injections of the electrolyte, he notes. You Xiaoying is a freelance journalist based in London.</p>

On his first fossil-hunting expedition to the Arctic regions of Greenland in 1988, evolutionary biologist and science writer Neil Shubin felt utterly disoriented. He explores polar science through the work of leading researchers and examines broader issues, such as how melting ice is beginning to expose microorganisms previously unknown to science. Climate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice Climate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice He weaves his own story, and those of his collaborators, into a broader narrative that touches on geopolitical issues and the lives of pioneering explorers. The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, and the species' migration out of Africa, occurred at a moment when Earth's physical geography — its coastlines, islands and ocean levels — was defined by “the amount of water locked in polar ice”, Shubin writes. For example, Antarctica's dry, stable air and vast ice sheets make it one of the best places on Earth to collect interstellar dust, which settles and is preserved in the snow. This might apply to Antarctica, a whole continent covered by ice, but is not true of the Arctic, whose landscapes include tundra and, by most reckonings, forests. Much of that region remained unglaciated even in the last ice age.
