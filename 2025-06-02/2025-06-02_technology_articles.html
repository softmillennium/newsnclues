                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The New York Times published a new report last Friday that claimed Elon Musk has been using illicit drugs, which led to speculation about why he looked so spaced out during his “farewell” press conference at the Oval Office. The denials started in a rather jokey way after a Musk fan account named Whole Mars Catalog tweeted, “Given Elon Musk's business track record, any drugs he's taking should be put in the public's drinking water.” Musk replied with a crying-laughing emoji and “100” before getting into his denial: “Also, to be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off. The Wall Street Journal was the first major newspaper to publish an extensive report on Musk's alleged drug use back in Jan. 2024. Aside from the Ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, Adderall, and ketamine, the Journal's reporting also included allegations that he used cocaine and LSD. Recreational use of marijuana has been legal in California, where that episode was filmed, since 2016. However, drug use is still prohibited for people to acquire high-level security clearances, which Musk holds as a federal contractor through SpaceX. It was Musk's alleged use of ketamine that has received the most attention on social media, especially after the Journal report came out. Musk made a rather bizarre appearance at the White House on Friday, appearing with a black eye that he claimed was caused by his 5-year-old son. The Tesla CEO also rolled his head around and appeared to gaze into the distance at odd intervals as Trump was speaking. Musk has previously said that he was prescribed ketamine for depression, but on Saturday he denied using it at all in recent years. “I'm not on ketamine ffs,” Musk wrote over the weekend in response to social media speculation he may have been using the drug recently when he was filmed playing with silverware at a dinner with President Trump. Musk playing with his silverware while tripping on ketamine at Bedminster.pic.twitter.com/2nvI7Wzuri Musk's work for President Donald Trump has been centered around supposedly rooting out fraud in the federal government. But the billionaire is a federal contractor who's now been accused of somehow getting around drug tests. If Trump's right-hand man is using illegal drugs—substances that would otherwise get the average person into trouble—normal people are going to see that as terribly hypocritical. Musk has also complained about how other people treat mental illness with medications, writing as recently as Friday, “Overprescription of psychiatric drugs is a real problem.” The SpaceX CEO wrote in a tweet last year, “We're definitely oversubscribing drugs to kids,” apparently intending to write “overprescribing.” Gizmodo reached out to Musk's companies X and Tesla for comment but did not receive a response.

AMD's RX 9060 XT 16GB appears to lag behind Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti in leaked review benchmarks from Eteknix. Despite the video being quickly removed due to an embargo breach, a Reddit user, via VideoCardz, managed to capture several snapshots, unraveling the most important metrics. While these thorough and detailed performance charts appear to be authentic, we suggest you wait for official reviews. The RX 9060 XT is AMD's direct response to Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti family, similarly fragmented into 8GB and 16GB flavors, coming in at $299 and $349, respectively. Aside from pricing, this isn't an entirely fair comparison, as we're aware how an 8GB framebuffer can cripple performance in VRAM-intensive titles. Nonetheless, it still manages to maintain its 35% lead over the RX 7600 XT. This is an impressive showdown by AMD, but we'll hold off on price-to-performance comparisons until we're certain AMD can supply these GPUs in ample quantities at their stated MSRP, something the RTX 5060 series struggles with. On a theoretical basis, AMD's option is 20% more affordable, while only sacrificing approximately 5% of the performance. While AMD has made ground with FSR 4, Nvidia still reigns supreme in terms of software, with its comprehensive CUDA platform, and other exclusives like RTX VSR (Video Super Resolution), HDR, Multi Frame Generation, Smooth Motion, among others. This adds to the inherent value Nvidia offers, as AMD still lacks alternatives for most of these features. A quick check at Best Buy shows most RTX 5060 Ti 16GB models are currently selling around the $500 mark, so AMD has a lot of flexibility and headroom if it can ensure a consistent supply at launch and in the weeks to come.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The future of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is looking bright. Scientists have just reported the first in-human recording from a novel wireless BCI device that could possibly help people with stroke communicate independently again. Paradromics is now planning to conduct clinical trials of the device later this year. The U-M research team, led by neurosurgeon Matthew Willsey, is working on a project to better understand how epilepsy affects the brain's signaling. They partnered with Paradromics, one of several companies vying to pioneer the next generation of BCI technology (a list that also includes Elon Musk's Neuralink), to use its experimental Connexus device. Chinese Brain Implant Project Set to Overtake Musk's Neuralink According to Willsey, the device offers several advantages over existing BCI systems. For instance, it's tiny (no smaller than a dime) yet contains over 400 microelectrodes that act as sensors, allowing the researchers to capture plenty of information from the brain. This also means that the device should be fully implantable, ideally providing its users more freedom. “This could lead to its eventual use as a high-performance BCI and could also lead to downstream clinical trials,” Willsey said. Paradromics announced in March that the first of these trials is expected to occur in late 2025, provided they receive the go-ahead from regulators. The company plans to initially test whether the Connexus can restore communication through digital devices in people with speech impairment caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, or severe spinal cord injuries. They're hoping that the device can have applications for mental health or chronic pain as well. In January, for instance, they published research showing how their high-performance BCI device allowed a paralyzed man to fly a virtual drone with only his thoughts, and with much greater accuracy than other, non-invasive systems. With any luck, these devices, while still experimental, will someday provide many people a new lease on life. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. This study offers new hope for drug-free pain treatments, but further trials will need to verify its results. Microplastics could play a hidden role in the relationship between ultra-processed foods and certain neurological disorders, according to new research. Neurotech companies have few regulations when it comes to selling neural information. Scientists argue that blanking out is its own state of consciousness, distinct from having your mind wander off. Elon Musk has been vocal about his startup that promises to augment humans with computer implants, but it does not appear to have a wide lead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk on Sunday announced that a new version of X's direct messaging (DM) feature, XChat, was rolling out with support for features like vanishing messages, encryption, and the ability to share files, alongside its audio and video calling support. The new features aren't yet broadly available, as XChat only recently started beta testing among a select group of users. However, Musk said that the X team expects to bring XChat to all users sometime this week, unless they encounter scaling issues during the rollout. In a series of X posts, Musk also noted that the updated version of XChat has been built on Rust with “Bitcoin-style” encryption and a “whole new architecture.” It's not clear what he means by Bitcoin-style encryption, given that Bitcoin itself cannot be described as “encrypted.” (Bitcoin uses public key cryptography and signatures for its security.) As a result, some are debating whether Musk is using the terminology simply as marketing speak, if he misunderstands encryption, or if he used the wrong word — perhaps meaning to say “cryptography” instead. In addition, Musk shared on X that XChat users can now make audio and video calls without a phone number across all platforms. Ahead of this launch, X said it was pausing work on encrypted DMs, presumably because XChat would soon replace the older system. Unfortunately for X users, the service has faced some significant instability over the past week or so, as multiple outages left users unable to browse timelines and use other features, including XChat.

Multiple leaks have reported different names for this accelerator, shifting from the RTX Pro 6000D to B40, and now B30, possibly indicating different variants within the forthcoming BXX family. The Information claims that Nvidia's future B30 solutions will support connecting multiple GPUs for scaling. It's important to note these accelerators are reportedly built using GDDR7 memory, employing GB20X silicon — the same chips that power consumer-grade RTX 50 GPUs. The company introduced RTX Pro Blackwell servers at Computex, which employ up to eight RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, connected via ConnectX-8 SuperNICs with built-in PCIe 6.0 switches for GPU-to-GPU communication. This configuration also applies when connecting two DGX Spark superchips together, and that's likely what we'll see with the B30 as well. It is theoretically possible that Nvidia has modified existing GB202 chips, the ones you find on an RTX 5090, and enabled NVLink support. When asked regarding the H20 ban, Jensen explicitly stated that Nvidia would not create further alternatives based on Hopper, indicating a shift to the Blackwell architecture for future China-bound chips. The rationale was that these AI accelerators can be used to build supercomputers in China for military applications. These export control policies have also impacted competitors, such as AMD, which recently reported potential losses of up to $800 million following the ban on its MI308 chips. Citing these policies as "a failure", Jensen Huang highlighted how the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge if Chinese rivals like Huawei are forced to innovate and design hardware that can compete against Nvidia, and possibly even define future global standards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And the certainty that these SoCs will pack 18 Oryon V3 cores continues to grow. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A seasoned tech tipster has stated that Qualcomm is testing Snapdragon X2 Elite devices in configurations with 64GB of RAM. Roland Quandt, best known for his exclusives published via Germany's WinFuture.de, stated this weekend that the “SC8480XP aka SD X2 Elite [is] in testing with 64GB RAM.” He is also more convinced than ever that this upcoming Oryon V3 CPU architecture chip will come packing 18 cores. PC enthusiasts are hopeful that Qualcomm has learnt some lessons from its initial Snapdragon X Elite venture. It had a lot of help from Microsoft to spearhead Copilot PCs using the first Oryon architecture processors last June. However, interest in them fell sharply as AMD and Intel responded rather swiftly with their own power-sipping but potent AI/NPU-enhanced laptop processors. Moreover, the newer architecture is expected to deliver its own performance boost. This notion comes from chatter about Qualcomm testing chips like the SC8480XP with advanced cooling solutions, including a 120mm radiator toting AiO. Moving on to other SoC specs, like onboard RAM, the last we heard, the SC8480XP was being tested in Qualcomm SiP (system in package) format with 48GB RAM on board, as well as a 1TB SSD storage on board. Now it looks like options with up to 64GB of RAM on board may be offered. Quandt was at Computex 2025 and kept a keen eye on Qualcomm developments during the show. If his leaked info didn't come via a Qualcomm contact, perhaps a device partner talked about upcoming SC8480XP configurations behind closed doors somewhere in Taipei. Since we've sailed by Computex without any official Snapdragon X2 Elite, or what might be called Snapdragon X2 Ultra Premium, news, we are most likely looking at the Snapdragon Summit 2025, in September, for Qualcomm to take the wraps off its next-gen processors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not totally clear what Laura Loomer, the 32-year-old conspiracy monger and right-wing media personality, means to President Donald Trump. She really, really doesn't like it when people call her an influencer or an adviser to the president, and, technically, she's not a lobbyist—although that's becoming increasingly complicated within Trumpworld. Whatever she is, Trump's advisers have officially grown tired of her. Just shy of a month after Loomer met with Trump in the Oval Office and successfully advocated for the firings of six National Security Council officials, Loomer had finally gotten what she really wanted: Mike Waltz was removed from his post as national security adviser. (Waltz, Hough, and the NSC officials did not reply to requests for comment.) In a phone call with WIRED, Loomer was adamant that Waltz's appearance in a 2016 ad about veterans opposing Trump was grounds for his departure. Both in private and in front of her more than 1.6 million followers on X, Loomer had been waging a holy war against Waltz for hiring, she alleged, “individuals who have a history of anti-Trump remarks and anti-Trump associations.” Though it took a few extra weeks after her meeting with Trump for it to finally happen, Loomer said she had successfully convinced the president—who considers her “terrific” and “very special,” in his own words—to cut loose one of the most important officials in geopolitics. A number of Trump's advisers tell WIRED that while they have seen a certain utility in Loomer, even if they find her tiresome and off-putting, their mutually beneficial arrangements may be coming to an end. As much as these sources, who requested anonymity to avoid incurring Loomer's wrath, believe that Loomer is reaching the end of her rope as far as her influence with the president goes, they're still aware that she possesses enough power to potentially destroy their careers with a single tweet or blog post. The White House would keep her at a distance, but also let her rip when it was convenient for certain factions within the West Wing. Internal discontent with Waltz, in this case, was one of those instances. “She overestimates and overstates her influence,” an administration source with knowledge of the Waltz discussions told WIRED at the time of the firing, “but that doesn't mean her takes aren't ever appreciated from time to time.” (The White House did not answer questions from WIRED about Loomer's role in personnel decisions. A source close to Trump tells WIRED that “Laura Loomer plays no role in the administration.”) The Trump superfan and MAGA version of a gonzo content creator had gone from gadfly status to something approaching a real player in just under two years, but her ascent was particularly rapid upon Trump's return to office. Loomer, whether Trump's advisers liked it or not, couldn't be squelched. The MAGA embodiment of Arnold Schwarzenegger's “I'll be back,” Loomer had frustrated campaign advisers to such an extent that they tried, and mostly failed, to keep her at arm's length during both the 2024 GOP primary and general elections, and she wasn't officially hired by the campaign despite repeated requests. Loomer rose to prominence by openly embracing anti-Muslim rhetoric and other extreme positions, like sharing a video on X about how 9/11 was “an inside job,” leading even the likes of GOP congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to urge Trump in mid-2023 not to hire her. My phone is blowing up,” Loomer told WIRED minutes after the news about Waltz broke on May 1. She's gone after big fish like Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, but also takes broadsides at the spouses of lower-level nominees. In a May 4 post on her “Loomered” website titled “EXCLUSIVE: BLM-Linked Wife of Trump DOJ Nominee Raises Vetting Concerns,” Loomer attacked pro bono attorney Kristin McGough over alleged</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change amid a widening campaign to slash federal funding for scientists and institutions studying the rising risks of a warming world. The move will cut off what's likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works. They come on top of the White House's broader efforts to cut research funding and revenue for universities and significantly raise their taxes. Broader economic anxieties and uncertainty over clean-energy subsidies are compounding industry fears. “I don't think it takes a lot of imagination to understand where this is going,” says Daniel Schrag, co-director of the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University, which has seen greater funding cuts than any other university amid an escalating legal conflict with the administration. “I believe the Trump administration intends to zero out funding for climate science altogether.” The NSF says it's terminating grants that aren't aligned with the agency's program goals, “including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), environmental justice, and misinformation/disinformation.” Trump administration officials have argued that DEI considerations have contaminated US science, favoring certain groups over others and undermining the public's trust in researchers. “Political biases have displaced the vital search for truth,” Michael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said to a group of NSF administrations and others last month, according to reporting in Science. The NSF has also canceled funding for work that has little obvious connections to DEI ambitions, such as research on catalysts. “It certainly seems like a deliberate attempt to undo any science that contradicts the administration,” says Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. On May 28, a group of states including California, New York, and Illinois sued the NSF, arguing that the cuts illegally violated diversity goals and funding priorities clearly established by Congress, which controls federal spending. A group of universities also filed a lawsuit against the NSF over its earlier decision to reduce the indirect cost rate for research, which reimburses universities for overhead expenses associated with work carried out on campuses. GrantWatch is an effort among researchers at rOpenSci, Harvard, and other organizations to track terminations of grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NSF. A search of its database for the terms “climate change,” “clean energy,” “climate adaptation,” “environmental justice,” and “climate justice” showed that the NSF has canceled funds for 118 projects, which were supposed to receive more than $100 million in total. (That word often indicates climate-change-related research, but in some abstracts it refers to the cultural climate.) Some share of those funds has already been issued to research groups. A search for “climate change” among the NIH projects produces another 22 studies that were terminated and were still owed nearly $50 million in grants. The NSF more recently released its own list of terminated projects, which mostly mirrored GrantWatch's findings and confirms the specific terminations mentioned in this story. “These grant terminations are theft from the American people,” Ross said in an email response. Havard, the country's oldest university, has been particularly hard hit. In April, the university sued the Trump administration over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies. The White House, in turn, has moved to eliminate all federal funds for the university, including hundreds of NSF and NIH grants. Daniel Nocera, a professor at Harvard who has done pioneering work on so-called artificial photosynthesis, a pathway for producing clean fuels from sunlight, said in an email that all of his grants were terminated. “We completed most of the work and were able to bring it to a stopping point,” Daniel Jacob, a professor at Harvard listed as the principal investigator on the project, said in an email. “But it will affect the ability to study chemistry-climate interactions. And it is clearly not right to pull funding from an existing project.” But that's because there is ample evidence that disadvantaged communities experience higher rates of illness from energy-sector pollution, will be harder hit by the escalating effects of extreme weather and are underrepresented in scientific fields. “We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says. “Diverse teams have been shown to do better science,” Johnson adds. Numerous researchers whose grants were terminated didn't respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review or declined to comment, amid growing concerns that the Trump administration will punish scientists or institutions that criticize their policies. The White House's budget proposal for the coming fiscal year seeks to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in funding across federal agencies, specifically calling out “Green New Scam funds” at the Department of Energy; “low-priority climate monitoring satellites” at NASA; “climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs” at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and “climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences” at the NSF.The administration released a more detailed NSF budget proposal on May 30th, which called for a 60% reduction in research spending and nearly zeroed out the clean energy technology program. It also proposed cutting funds by 97% for the US Global Change Research Program, which produces regular assessments of climate risks; 80% for the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a global network of ocean sensors that monitor shifting marine conditions; and 40% for NCAR, the atmospheric research center. Even short gaps in these time-series studies, which scientists around the world rely upon, would have an enduring impact on researchers' ability to analyze and understand weather and climate trends. Growing fears that public research funding will take an even larger hit in the coming fiscal year are forcing scientists to rethink their research plans—or to reconsider whether they want to stay in the field at all, numerous observers said. “The amount of funding we're talking about isn't something a university can fill indefinitely, and it's not something that private philanthropy can fill for very long,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “So what we're talking about is potentially cataclysmic for climate science.” One climate scientist, who declined to speak on the record out of concern that the administration might punish his institution, said the declining funding is forcing researchers to shrink their scientific ambitions down to a question of “What can I do with my laptop and existing data sets?” “If your goal was to make the United States a second-class or third-class country when it comes to science and education, you would be doing exactly what the administration is doing,” the scientist said. Given the rising challenges, Harvard's Schrag fears that the best young climate scientists will decide to shift their careers outside of the US, or move into high tech or other fields where they can make significantly more money. “We might lose a generation of talent—and that's not going to get fixed four years from now,” he says.
