                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOAL looks at the tiers of teams in the 2025 Club World Cup, asking who might win it all and who is just happy to be here? With the European season finally coming to a close, attention turns directly to the Club World Cup, FIFA's shiny new fun competition, soon to be played out in the U.S. summer sun. But with 32 teams hailing from all over the world, it can be chaotic to summarize it all. How can you piece together RB Slazburg, HD Ulsan and Real Madrid? What is the through line among them? And what are the vibes to be found? Sure, there are three or four clear favorites, but outside of them, it gets a bit tricky. And with less than two weeks until the opening kick, it's time to ask: Who's here to win it? GOAL US breaks it all down in the 2025 Club World Cup Tier Rankings.

Real's matchup vs Al Hilal could be spicy, as the Saudi champs have European pedigree and a chance to upset if Madrid comes out flat. Daily Notables: Groups A and B are back in action. Inter Miami vs FC Porto headlines the day. Daily Notables: Chelsea makes its tournament debut after their earlier match was canceled. Look for Cole Palmer to lead the attack.

Daily Notables: Group C could get chaotic depending on Boca's earlier results. Group D should see Chelsea and Flamengo advance. Daily Notables: Group F likely belongs to Dortmund. Fluminense vs Ulsan is key for second place. In Group E, Inter Milan looks strong, but Urawa could play spoiler against Monterrey. Expect fireworks, especially with Madrid's front line going up against Salzburg's press. For more deals on streaming services and entertainment products, check out TV Guide's Shopping hub.</p>

Seattle's Lumen Field will host six games of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. During which it won't be known as Lumen Field, because of FIFA rules relating to stadium sponsorships. Via multiple reports, the venue will undergo $19.4 million in upgrades to make it suitable for the top tournament in international soccer. This will require irrigation, vacuum ventilation, and grow lights. Also, FIFA rules require a full complement of individual seats with backs. For the World Cup matches, they will. Every stadium that will host FIFA World Cup games must have a grass playing surface. NFL players overwhelmingly prefer playing on grass. The owners won't do it for them. But they won't hesitate to do it for FIFA. DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even head coach Mauricio Pochettino is speaking out about it. The team was already going to be shorthanded with several key players tied into Club World Cup duties, so it seemed imperative for the best remaining players to take advantage of the last extended camp together for the next year. Pulisic — citing the need for rest — saw it differently. He said that players he's coached like Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane were all "desperate" to play for their national teams. Pochettino said in a podcast appearance with former USMNT stars Landon Donovan and Tim Howard: "Today, we have plenty of players playing abroad for USA. We were working with these guys, Harry Kane. Because the possibility to defend one time more, your flag, your shirt, I want to feel proud about that. And that it the responsibility of us to translate." Those comments appeared to be an obvious jab at Pulisic, Robinson and others for viewing the Gold Cup as not worth their time. And sure, the Gold Cup has been relegated to a developmental tournament in recent years in light of the CONCACAF Nations League. But Pochettino wants to see a culture of players who look at USMNT duty as an honor regardless of the tournament or competition. That mentality had clearly been lost among this current generation of players despite the immense individual talent. And Pochettino is running out of time to reinstate it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Traditionally, the event has been a global supercup of sorts, each year pitting the seven winners of FIFA's seven federations' continental tournaments against each other in a brief, midseason contest that virtually nobody really cared about. This month will bring the inaugural edition of the new-look CWC, a 32-team behemoth that will cram an already over-stuffed soccer calendar with yet another competition that nobody asked for. It will take a lot of work to make this tournament into something fans care about. For the players and clubs involved, however, there are hundreds of millions of reasons why they're willing to cut into their already vanishingly small rest and recovery time to try their damnedest to win. In its effort to make this whole thing matter, FIFA has filled the prize pool with ungodly sums of money, enticing participants with lucrative payouts that can rise up to $125 million for the winners. That's almost one Florian Wirtz, if reports are to be believed, which should ensure that clubs like Real Madrid—who just paid Liverpool €10 million to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold early enough for him to play in the group stage of the CWC—and freshly crowned Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will provide a good showing. For players, getting a cut of the prize money could make for their biggest paychecks of the whole year. But lo, what misshapen beast looms on the horizon, hobbling over to mess up the rest of our soccer fun? (v) Compulsory Tournament/Non-Compulsory Tournament: If an MLS Team or MLS receives prize money by virtue of the Team's performance and/or participation in a Compulsory Tournament or Non-Compulsory Tournament (other than the tournaments set forth above i.e., USOC, Canadian Championship, CCL, Campeones Cup, Leagues Cup), Players competing in that tournament will receive the following: (a) If the Team or MLS receives prize money, fifty percent (50%) of such prize money up to a maximum payment to the Players (collectively) of $1,000,000 per tournament. This likely would not be an issue in previous iterations of the Club World Cup, but with the money FIFA is throwing at this new format, the $1 million cap on player earnings becomes more egregious, since entry into the tournament itself comes with almost $10 million. Even if the Sounders crash out with three straight losses, earning no additional prize money, the players could only receive roughly 10 percent of that initial bonus. This, as one can imagine, has not gone over well with the players. Ahead a league match against Minnesota on Sunday, Sounders players took to the pitch wearing t-shirts that read "Club World Cash Grab," while fans in the stands, already among the most vocal in MLS, chanted "you dirty greedy bastards." The MLS Players Association has also come out in support. The player complaints makes even more sense when considering what a good performance could mean financially. Despite drawing a tough group featuring PSG and Atlético Madrid, the Sounders could earn up to $13.5 million just from that stage of the tournament (the team stands to earn $2 million per win, $1 million per draw, and $7.5 million if it advances into the round of 16). MLS players have an extra consideration when it comes to the Club World Cup. In a league that constantly twists itself and its rules into knots looking to get what it wants, it's no surprise to see MLS suddenly turn rigid when players come asking for what's fair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the U.S. Women's National Team victory over China PR, Sam Coffey intentionally sought out Naomi Girma to give her a hug of celebration but also one of gratitude. I can't put into words what she means to this team.” Head coach Emma Hayes echoed how valuable it was to have the center back on her side again. The backline of Girma, Avery Patterson, Emily Sonnett and Crystal Dunn helped hold No. It was the 26th shutout Girma has contributed to as a USWNT starter. “She's a world-class player, and you can see that,” Hayes said. At 24 years old and despite having just 45 caps, Girma returned to the USWNT as a full-fledged veteran as Hayes continues to develop younger players as larger tournaments like the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics draw closer. Girma will be charged with helping players like Patterson acclimate to the international game. “It just feels good to be back on the field with this group and playing with a lot of players, some I've never played with and some I haven't played with in six months,” Girma said.“So, just good to get that rhythm again.” Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce is a player who hadn't played with Girma yet, although the two are more than familiar as Women's Super League rivals with their clubs Manchester United and Chelsea FC. They recently met in the FA Women's Cup Final where Girma (along with fellow USWNT teammate Catarina Macario) and Chelsea took home the trophy. Tullis-Joyce and Girma began their new relationship as teammates in camp in Minnesota, and the ‘keeper quickly noted Girma's leadership and how articulate the defender was as the two bounced ideas off each other. To no one's surprise, Girma has picked up right where she left off at the end of 2024. It was just nice to be back on the field.” They'll get another chance to develop chemistry with Girma again when the U.S. takes on Jamaica on June 3rd in St. Louis, Mo. “She's just a joy in this environment and such a light for us, and we have missed her so much.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European club season may have come to a close with Paris Saint-Germain's win in the UEFA Champions League final on Saturday but there is still plenty of soccer to watch this summer. I'm Pardeep Cattry with a preview of what's to come. Tuesday, June 3🇪🇺 UWNL: Spain vs. England, 1 p.m. ➡️ CBS Sports Network, Paramount+🌎 Friendly: USWNT vs. Jamaica, 8 p.m. ➡️ TNT Saturday's win offered another glimpse at a new-look version of the USWNT, one where the pieces are beginning to fall into place after months of work together. The USWNT's attacking trio on Saturday, featuring a front line of Macario, Alyssa Thompson and Michelle Cooper, filled in nicely as Hayes explores her attacking options as all three members of triple espresso – Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilason – remain unavailable. Hayes has other players available to her for Tuesday's match against Jamaica, including fellow youngsters Ally Sentnor and Emma Sears and veteran Lynn Biyendolo. Whatever combination she opts for in the upcoming match, though, she did identify some areas of improvement for a relatively young group as they continue in the lengthy buildup to the 2027 Women's World Cup. A first-of-its-kind summer of soccer awaits, one with several high-stakes matches on the schedule. June 11 marks the one year mark before the 2026 World Cup, a tournament that will be top of mind for several national teams as they look to book a spot at the 48 team tournament in North America next summer. Four nations – Japan, New Zealand, iran and Argentina – have already joined the three host nations, while a handful of other teams could join them before the month is over. While some confederations are several months into their qualifying campaigns, Europe is still in the early stages of their qualification tournament. A handful of high-profile teams will play their first qualifiers this month, a list that includes previous World Cup winners Germany, Spain, France and Italy. Luciano Spaletti's Italy will be a team to watch during UEFA's qualifying run since they have missed the last two editions of the World Cup, especially surprising since they won the Euros in 2021. How exactly each team will approach this competition is a big question and seems likely to vary from squad to squad. Al-Hilal, the club owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, may go all out by recruiting Al-Nassr's Cristiano Ronaldo but will only have until June 10 to get a deal done. It is unclear how the European clubs will handle this tournament considering it is the final stage of a demanding season that began last August and could run until July 13, should they reach the final. England enter the competition as the reigning champions, winning on home soil in 2022 during a tournament that set records for attendance and viewership, though there have been some dynamic shifts in Europe since. Chief among them is the rapid transformation of Spain, who were a team with potential but no history of deep runs in major competitions and exited in the quarterfinals after a loss to the hosts. Hopes will still be high for England, though they will be without goalkeeper Mary Earps after she suddenly announced her international retirement last month. Earps had lost a starting role in recent months to Chelsea's Hannah Hampton, who has been the expected starter at the Euros for some time. 🏆 PSG's dominance: Paris Saint-Germain's lopsided win over Inter in the Champions League final could be the start of a dynastic period for the club, led by Luis Enrique's tactical vision and a host of young players and unsung heroes. 🇫🇷 Two dead during celebrations: Two people died and hundreds were arrested in Paris as the city broke out into celebrations of Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League win. 1️⃣1️⃣ UCL team of the season: Four PSG players cracked CBS Sports' Champions League team of the season, and so did Barcelona's Lamine Yamal and Raphinha. 🔵⚫ Inzaghi postmortem: Inter manager Simone Inzaghi is likely to leave the club after their defeat in the Champions League final, which was a showcase for his biggest mistakes despite an otherwise successful tenure. 🔮 Next season's contenders: With this season officially in the books, it's officially time to make way-too-early predictions for who will hoist the Champions League trophy this time next year. 🇺🇸 Yohannes' first year: Teenage midfielder Lily Yohannes celebrated her first year with the USWNT, one in which she is slowly but surely living up to her potential. 👋 Managerial comings and goings: Massimilianno Allegri will take charge of AC Milan from next season, while Jonatan Giraldez is likely to make a shock move to OL Lyonnes after less than a year with the Washington Spirit. 🔴 Beckham criticizes United: David Beckham accused some Manchester United players of "disrespecting" fans, comparing the Red Devils to a PSG team that showed team spirit. 👎 Curse watch: After Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur broke their curses this season, here's a look at which teams now carry the weight of expectations going into next season. ☀️ Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it helps fans get their day started on the right foot on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On course for her best club campaign, the 20-year-old is beginning to prove why the USWNT have another potential star player on their hands. After scoring her first international goal last October, Thompson has broken free of anything holding her back, skyrocketing her status as one of the best forwards in the NWSL this term. Alyssa has found the back of the net five times and assisted her teammates twice, one of which was to set up her sister Gisele, the two playing alongside one another. Her best return prior came in 2024, also scoring on five occasions, assisting seven. Thompson's club form is electric, and now she's challenging that energy into the national team, stepping up in the absence of key forwards Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith, and Mallory Swanson. With an assist in their latest 3-0 win over People's Republic of China, it seems the American wonderkid is seizing her opportunity with both hands, and lightning-fast feet. It has always been a matter of when, not if. By her own admission, the winger was not the best forward Emma Hayes had at her disposal at the time, though it didn't make missing out any easier to accept. Press is one of several veterans to take her compatriot under their wing while playing together in California. The 36-year-old is a figure of resilience, fighting her way back to the sport through difficult injuries among other setbacks. “I've always looked up to her,” Thompson told Just Women's Sports. “It's just been really nice getting to know her as a person and I feel like I've learned so much from her.” The pair often will put in extra time training, doing shooting drills - the Christen Press school of finishing, their teammate Madison Hammond joked. Small changes, like her first touch before shooting, has elevated her abilities and contributed to the fine form she is in of late. “Knowing that she is [saying] ‘you can score, I believe in you', really gives me a lot of confidence,” Thompson added. “Like yeah, if you believe in me, what can I not do?” Those words alone, from someone who has been there before, have had the power to transform doubt into determination. Alyssa Thompson for Angel City in the NWSL. She is making it increasingly difficult for Hayes not to include her in full strength national team rosters, let alone current ones. Perhaps more impressively, is that the Los Angeles native has proven that she isn't just there to make up the numbers, but rather she can contribute effectively to the team when called upon. Two months ago, at the SheBelieves Cup, Hayes believed it would take half a dozen experiences with the player to get to a point where they began moving forward. While their hand may have been forced with notable absentees, the youngster has shown she is very capable to rise to the occasion. Thompson has demonstrated that setbacks don't define a career – even this early on – it's how you bounce back that does.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi will wear his Argentina shirt again for two matches with his beloved national team in the next 10 days, before leading Inter Miami in the FIFA Club World Cup. or "good morning, captain" was the caption on a photo of Messi arriving to Argentina's headquarters. Then, Argentina will host Colombia – a battle between the 2024 Copa America finalists – on June 10 at 8 p.m. Messi is coming off one of his best stretches during the 2025 MLS season, scoring five goals in his last three matches, helping Inter Miami improve from sixth to third place in the MLS Eastern Conference. Messi has traditionally played with the national team when healthy as a member of Inter Miami – including two matches before the MLS Cup playoffs last season. These two matches could be no different despite the timing. Messi and Inter Miami will star in the Club World Cup opening match on June 14 against Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. They will also play against FC Porto (Portugal) in Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 19, and return to Miami for their final group stage match against SE Palmeiras (Brazil) on June 23. Playing with Argentina before the MLS Cup playoffs last year, Messi was scoreless in a 1-1 draw against Venezuela on Oct. 11, 2024, then exploded with a hat trick and two assists in a 6-0 victory over Bolivia on Oct. 15, 2024. Messi last played with the national team in November: He was scoreless as Argentina lost 2-1 to Paraguay on Nov. 14, 2024, and had the assist to Lautaro Martinez in a 1-0 win over Peru on Nov. 19, 2024. Messi was unable to play with Argentina in matches against Uruguay and Brazil this March, while he was recovering from an adductor strain. Messi has yet to declare whether he will play for Argentina for World Cup 2026, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Salt Bae has responded to claims online that he was turned away at an after-party following PSG's Champions League triumph over Inter Milan. The notorious restaurateur attended the showpiece event in Munich, in which Luis Enrique's side cruised to a 5-0 win - the largest ever margin of victory in a Champions League final. Salt Bae has been a controversial figure in the footballing world since the 2022 World Cup final, when he broke FIFA rules after gaining access to the pitch and gatecrashing Argentina's celebrations. In other cringeworthy scenes, the Turkish chef put another player's medal in his mouth and kept trying to grab the trophy from the Argentina team so he could pose for a photo. He was then seen waving at fans, posing for photos, and signing books. However, the chef denied such claims on his Instagram, and explained that he was at the hotel solely for the thousands of fans that wanted to see him there. Salt Bae said: 'After the Champions League final match, we arrived to the hotel in UEFA bus, the reason we were there at that moment was because of our thousands of fans who wanted to see us there. Due to the busyness that occurred, while I was waiting for my vehicle to go to my own hotel, my back turned in front of the door, there was a directive from Mr. Dormen. 'Let it be known that we are never happy to go anywhere we are called with love not to be taken anywhere. Don't worry about such little things, the rest is artificial intelligence.' Real name Nusret Gokce, Salt Bae owns more than 20 Nusr-Et restaurants and charges £2,000 for a tomahawk steak wrapped in gold. He first went viral online in 2017 after filming his flamboyant method of seasoning meat, often in front of diners. The 41-year-old has struck up a close rapport with several of football's biggest figures, including FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who visited one of his restaurants in 2021 and mimicked his salt-seasoning pose. 'Mr Nusrat, number one, the best of the best, unforgettable evening in Dubai,' Infantino said on a video posted on social media. 'King of football gianni_infantino Under your leadership, football has not only grown - it has united the world in ways few ever could.' After Salt Bae's World Cup final antics, FIFA later revealed that he was not permitted to walk onto the pitch and, after launching an investigation, vowed to take 'appropriate internal action'. He said: 'I didn't go on the pitch with the purpose of advertising; I just felt like it. There were at least another 1,000 people on the pitch but when they show the video they make out it was just me.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ALAJUELA, Costa Rica – The U.S. U-20 Women's National Team dominated Puerto Rico to win 3-1 in its second Group A match at the Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship. The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will be held from September 5–27 next year in Poland. The USA will finish group play on June 3 against Costa Rica (4 p.m. U.S. head coach Carrie Kveton made nine changes to the starting XI from the USA's 8-0 opening game win over Guyana – center back Abby Mills and forward Mya Townes were the only holdovers — but it mattered little. The first goal came from a somewhat unlikely source, right back Kate Scott. Puerto Rico's only chance of the first half came in the sixth minute when a long ball behind the U.S. defense led to some confusion between goalkeeper Keally Titmuss and Scott, who smashed into each other as Titmuss raced out of her net, leaving an open goal for Puerto Rico striker Susana Roberts. Scott recovered and threw her body to the ground block Roberts' initial shot and then Roberts sent her second chance over an open net. Forward Mary Long then doubled the lead in the 24th minute when she timed her run to stay onside by a slim margin and raced in on goal off a through ball from Scott. Long held off her defender and finished under duress from six yards out as she tumbled to the ground to make it 2-0. Puerto Rico pulled one back in the 67th minute as University of Arizona striker Aurora Gaines ran onto a poor back pass by the U.S. defense and fought off three U.S. defenders on a mazy dribbling run to slot home from six yards out. • After 15 players earned their first U-20 caps in the first game against Guyana, five players earned their first U-20 international caps in this match: Kealey Titmuss, Kate Scott, Kennedy Ring, Mary Long and Chloe Rickets. • Aven Alverez earned her team leading fourth U-20 international cap when she came on in the 84th minute.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of the next FIFA window, five Inter Miami CF players have been called up to represent their national teams during the June international break. Here's a look at the players and their upcoming matches. Inter Miami CF captain Lionel Messi has been called up to represent the Argentine national team during this CONMEBOL qualifying window for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. ET in Ñuñoa, Chile, before hosting Colombia on June 10 at 8 p.m. Messi is the all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying with 34 goals in 69 matches, and he will look to add to that tally during this international window. La Vinotinto will play two crucial games in their quest for a first-ever World Cup qualification. First, they will host direct rivals Bolivia on June 6 at 6 p.m. ET in Maturín, Venezuela, and will wrap up the window with a visit to Uruguay on June 10 at 7 p.m. ET in Oranjestad, Aruba, to then host Curaçao on June 10 at 6 p.m. Picault has made 14 appearances for the Haitian national team, registering one goal and four assists. Midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi has been called up to the Under-20 U.S. Men's Youth National Team for an international training camp and friendlies in Cairo, Egypt from June 2 through June 11. After earning minutes with the senior USMNT earlier this year in matches against Venezuela and Costa Rica, Cremaschi will now represent the youth team in friendlies against the U-20 squads of Colombia on June 7 and Egypt on June 10. Academy product Santiago Morales has been called up to represent the U.S. Under-18 Men's National Team for the upcoming UEFA Friendship Cup in Nyon, Switzerland. Morales is part of the 20-player roster selected by Head Coach Marlon LeBlanc to compete in the prestigious eight-team tournament taking place from May 30 to June 11. The U.S. has been drawn into Group A and will face Argentina on Wednesday, June 4, and Australia on Saturday, June 7, after already playing their first match against France. Morales scored in the opening match, helping the U-18 USMYNT earn a 2-2 draw against France and subsequently earning a penalty shootout win. Following the group stage, Morales and the U.S. U-18s will play a placement match on Tuesday, June 10, with opponents determined by final group standings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wanderers are facing a huge window with Matheus Cunha and Pablo Sarabia having already moved on. Cunha has now officially joined United after much speculation. He will of course be very difficult to replace, such was his ability to change a game in an instant with a bit of magic. Wolves have been linked with a few players to potentially play in his left sided 10 position next term. Harvey Elliott was briefly linked with Wolves, but the feeling is that he will be too expensive at over £40 million. But James McAtee is also a target for Wolves – and Manchester City look set to sanction his exit. At the moment, there is heavy speculation that Manchester City are trying to sign Rayan Ait-Nouri. City were expected to join the hunt for Ait-Nouri, and now they are firming up their interest and a deal is expected to happen. But potentially, we might see Wolves try and raid City for McAtee. But there are plenty of other clubs in the mix to sign him, including ones from overseas such as Bayer Leverkusen. Wolves are up against it to sign McAtee, who is valued around the £25 million mark. He plays in those attacking midfield roles and likes to play between the lines. He is not dynamic or explosive like Cunha, but very good in the pockets and tight spaces. Pep Guardiola has branded McAtee ‘incredible' before (Manchester Evening News) and made it clear that he's been in an unfair situation with his game time at the Etihad Stadium.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Settling into a gray upholstered chair in her living room in central London, beneath an enormous chandelier that makes even the nearby grand piano look compact, Michele Kang finds her mind drifting to the PBS home improvement series This Old House. She is fresh off a meeting with architects—down a glass-encased elevator to the conference room below her five-bedroom Knightsbridge apartment—and she has buildings on the brain. “I just want to see the before-and-after picture,” says Kang, 65. Her entire life, Kang has focused on the endgame. Her outcome-oriented approach has made her a phenomenally successful tech entrepreneur—ranking 28th on Forbes' 2025 list of America's Richest Self-Made Women (which publishes on June 3) with a net worth estimated at $1.2 billion. But while she might privately wish that she could skip the process, she's also a woman who, after earning an economics degree from the University of Chicago and an MBA from Yale, meticulously mapped out the next 30 years of her career. Acquaintances and business partners describe Kang as unfailingly prepared. She's still perfectly ready to go—couture, perfect hair, on her game. She's been taking notes while I'm still waking up.” Even so, Kang never could have foreseen her second act. Six years after a chance meeting at an event on Capitol Hill awakened an interest in professional soccer, she is the owner of three prominent teams: the Washington Spirit of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), OL Lyonnes of France's Première Ligue and the London City Lionesses, recently promoted to England's Women's Super League. GOAL GETTER | Michele Kang's London City Lionesses (top) earned promotion to the Women's Super League by claiming the title in England's second division this year—and it wasn't her first championship as a team owner. Her Lyon club (middle) has won back- to-back titles in France, and the Washington Spirit, built around star Trinity Rodman, won the NWSL Championship in 2021. “I didn't know who Leo Messi was,” she says of the Argentine soccer superstar, laughing. Last year, L.A.'s Angel City FC sold at a record $250 million valuation to Disney CEO Bob Iger and his wife, Willow Bay. Then, in January, the league selected Denver as its 16th franchise for a $110 million expansion fee. “Michele really set the valuation boom in motion,” NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman says. Once again, Kang has an ambitious goal in mind, and this time, she is expecting her grand plan to take a lot less than 30 years. In the not-too-distant future, she believes, women's soccer teams will be trading for $1 billion or more—and she's willing to spend whatever it takes to make that happen. Between purchasing her three clubs, seeding a handful of women-focused sports startups and donating $30 million to the U.S. Soccer federation, Kang entered the sports world with an ante of at least $200 million. And she's not done: Her February meeting with architects centered on her plans to construct a practice facility in Kent, southeast of London, for the Lionesses, and in April, she announced what amounted to a $25 million donation to U.S. Soccer as she handed over the nonprofit research arm of her holding company, which focuses on the biomechanics of female athletes. By comparison, the women's leagues are still in their infancy, and many of the clubs have yet to show they're able to generate real money. For example, despite having won the NWSL title in 2021 and reached the 2024 championship game, Kang's Spirit posted roughly $15 million in regular-season revenue last year. Meanwhile, Major League Soccer's D.C. United, playing home games at the same stadium, collected $90 million in 2024, according to Forbes estimates. Those concerns—paired with massive pay gaps between male and female players, unequal media coverage and occasionally outright discrimination—have led some critics to write off the recent women's sports boom as nothing more than a social cause. Kang considers herself a “very, very private person” and says she is still adjusting to the spotlight that has come with her involvement in professional sports. “You're going to interview me for an hour?” she says. “I don't have a story for an hour.” “When she comes in the room, she commands that room, and that's hard to do—especially in a male-dominated situation,” says billionaire NBA legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson, who joined the Spirit last year as a minority investor and strategic partner. Berman, the NWSL's commissioner, remembers her first time meeting Kang, at a breakfast in 2022: “She was the most put-together human I had ever seen—a little bit intimidating for me.” From her earliest days, Kang has had no trouble taking charge. Growing up in South Korea as a self-described tomboy, she refused to practice piano and would play sports instead. (Years later, after a few of her friends went on to study at Juilliard, she joked with her mother, “You should have made me practice!”) While Kang, whose given name is Yongmee, aspired to follow in her father's footsteps by studying in America, her parents weren't exactly keen to see their youngest daughter cross the Pacific. But she managed to convince them that, amid the 1980s political unrest that pushed South Korea from dictatorship to democracy, they were better off paying for college than saving for a wedding. After business school, she became a partner at Ernst & Young, specializing in the high-tech and telecommunications sectors, and in 2000 she jumped to TRW as head of corporate strategy for the nonautomotive divisions at the conglomerate, which developed weapons and spacecraft. When the company was acquired by aerospace giant Northrop Grumman in a hostile takeover two years later, she saw an opportunity. “They gave me this health IT business that was failing miserably,” she says. Between 2003 and 2007, Kang more than tripled the revenue of her division. Armed with new expertise in health care IT—an industry that was (and some would argue remains) technologically antiquated—Kang then decided to strike out on her own. To hear Kang tell it, nothing Cognosante did was revolutionary. But she recognized that as hospitals and pharmacies moved their paper records online, too many systems were popping up that couldn't communicate with one another—using different file formats for insurance information, for instance, or different codes to identify diseases. Cognosante essentially connected the dots, helping doctors and health care professionals access notes and imaging results from anywhere, with a particular focus on improving the flow of information at state government agencies. It also extended its services into areas such as cybersecurity and Medicaid fraud detection. The company got to a point where, Kang says, she had two options: go public or bring in new management. “I see the value, and if I don't start valuing it, who else is going to do it for us?” says Kang, who paid $35 million for her first team. Kaiya McCullough, a rookie defender, told the Post that Burke had made racially insensitive jokes and that the experience had sent her “into survival mode.” She questioned whether she would ever play soccer again. Burke denied any wrongdoing but was fired, and an ensuing leaguewide investigation uncovered similar allegations against coaches at three other clubs. Negotiations turned ugly, with Baldwin reportedly accusing Kang of organizing “a coup attempt,” but she eventually took control by besting an offer from billionaire bond investor Todd Boehly, who turned around and bought the men's and women's clubs of English soccer powerhouse Chelsea FC for a combined $5.2 billion in May 2022. Kang's $35 million price tag shocked observers, given that valuations in the NWSL historically had been under $5 million and that, despite the success of the U.S. women's national team, women's pro soccer had a bumpy track record. The Women's United Soccer Association, a $40 million effort to capitalize on American excitement around the 1999 Women's World Cup, began play with eight teams in 2001 and folded after three seasons, reportedly racking up $100 million in losses. “I see the value, and if I don't start valuing it, who else is going to do it for us?” she says. Changes came quickly, with investments in the Spirit's front office and coaching staff and a reinforced roster around superstar forward Trinity Rodman (the daughter of NBA great Dennis Rodman). When Kang first joined the Spirit, its annual revenue was an estimated $5 million; by 2024, that number had tripled. Attendance climbed to nearly 14,000 per game, up from fewer than 6,000 in 2022. “She hasn't wavered on spending money not only to make the Spirit better but also women's sports better, period,” says Magic Johnson, who notes that he had an opportunity to invest in the NWSL's Angel City FC but was won over by Kang and ended up putting his money in the Spirit. Later that year, she acquired the London City Lionesses and formed Kynisca Sports International to house her soccer investments under one roof, in London. The company is also developing best practices with its facilities as Kang works to build new training centers for all three of her clubs. “Michele shows up, and she starts talking about the incidence of ligament injuries during the menstrual cycle—she's putting money into research on women's bodies and how to train as women,” says Textor, whose Eagle Football Holdings owned the Lyon team, now known as OL Lyonnes, before Kang's purchase and maintains a minority stake. The NWSL has added blue-chip sponsors including AT&T and Google in the past year, and it achieved a financial breakthrough in 2023 when it signed media rights deals with CBS, ESPN, Ion and Amazon Prime Video collectively worth $240 million over four years—roughly 60 times the league's previous fees. Kang, at the center of it all, has a hard time wrapping her mind around everything she has accomplished in five years, saying, “The fact that I'm talking about the word legacy is surreal.” But she is also enjoying the moment and taking pride in her teams, trying to travel to most Spirit games.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first jersey auction from US Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team. The U.S. Soccer Federation, United States National Soccer Team Players Association (USNSTPA) and United States Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA) have announced a partnership with MatchWornShirt, a global leader in the sports memorabilia market. The agreement represents MatchWornShirt's official U.S. launch and an important turning point in the company's growth trajectory and expansion, providing real-time access to signed, game-worn jerseys from the United States Men's and Women's National Teams. The first jersey auction from U.S. Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) during their recent back-to-back games against Brazil. On May 31, 2025, a fresh auction started at kickoff when the USWNT faced China. This summer, MatchWornShirt will hold further auctions showcasing players' jerseys from the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) throughout its 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign. Lilian Bours, Chief Marketing Officer of MatchWornShirt, said, “The energy around sports memorabilia in the U.S. has never been higher – and soccer in America is entering a golden era. We're thrilled to give American soccer fans unprecedented access to their National Teams, deepening the emotional connection to their favorite players and celebrating the game's most iconic moments. We turn matchdays into memories – in wearable and collectible form.” Tijmen Zonderwijk, CEO and Co-founder of MatchWornShirt, commented, “What started as one small auction in the Netherlands has now grown into a global community, and we are excited to bring that same trusted experience to fans in the U.S., starting with their beloved men's and women's national teams.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City have opted against including James McAtee in their squad for the Club World Cup as their neighbours Manchester United continue to circle. City will jet halfway across the world to play in the tournament but won't go with McAtee, who instead has been added to England's pre-tournament training squad ahead of the U21s Euros in Slovakia. McAtee has enjoyed moments in a City shirt, but is still very much establishing himself. As a result potential suitors are beginning to circle and one of those is the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move, especially as McAtee is tipped to have a bright future. He said in April: “For the age, I'd like him to stay. He can play different positions but I don't know how the squad will be and we will see.” Another factor at play is that McAtee's contract expires in 2026 - leaving the City hierarchy to either hand him a new deal or cash in before he becomes a free agent. McAtee himself is keen on a move to the Bundesliga, where he's been linked with the likes of Bayer Leverkusen. He's seen first-hand how young English players have thrived in the Germany environment with Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham among them. Letting McAtee leave would represent a risk for Guardiola, who has copped criticism for allowing City's academy products to leave before giving them a proper shot.
