                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On June 3, South Korea will conclude a snap election prompted by the impeachment of former president Yoon Seok-yeol on insurrection charges for a failed coup. Yoon, Moon's hardline conservative successor, further strained relations with North Korea by intensifying military exercises with the U.S., including joining a trilateral military alliance with Japan and enacting repressive policies intent on “eradicating pro-North Korea forces.” Yoon's hawkish turn so impressed the warmongering RAND Corporation that it called him “Biden's Perfect South Korean Partner.” In response, North Korea tested nearly 100 missiles, blew up any remnants of reunification efforts, and declared that the demilitarized zone (DMZ) was now a permanent national boundary under its Constitution. Under Yoon's reign, South Korea sent arms to Ukraine, while North Korea sent arms and troops to fight alongside Russia, further entrenching the two Koreas in a new Cold War between the U.S., China and Russia. South Korea is already home to the largest overseas U.S. military base, Camp Humphreys, and because of its proximity to China, a U.S. missile defense system, THAAD. The cost of hosting U.S. forces in Korea — comprising 28,500 servicemembers on 15 U.S. military bases — will also be a major issue facing a potential Lee government as President Donald Trump will try to extract more from Seoul in negotiations over tariffs. On the campaign trail, Trump signaled his desire to meet Kim Jong Un, and in March indicated that he has a “very good relationship” with Kim and would “probably do something with him at some point.” In April, a senior official told Axios that the Trump administration is quietly exploring resuming talks. Although members of the previous Trump administration, namely John Bolton, botched talks with North Korea in Hanoi in 2019, the Biden and Yoon administrations further worsened relations. The 2018 summits between Moon and Kim yielded progress, too, including reunions of separated families and a Comprehensive Military Agreement to “completely cease all hostile acts against each other” by ending military drills near the border, limiting live-fire drills, imposing no-fly zones, and establishing crucial communication lines and a buffer zone in the West Sea. Additionally, Moon and Kim, along with the U.S.-led UN Command, agreed to remove firearms and guards in the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom. Still, the Blob chastised Trump's overtures to North Korea, including his call to cancel the U.S.-South Korea military exercises, war drills that he aptly called “very provocative.” Every spring and fall, the U.S. and South Korea hold joint military exercises, deploying B-2 bombers, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines, and pre-emptive strikes simulating “decapitation measures” against the North Korean regime. The U.S. says these are for “readiness,” but North Koreans view them as rehearsals for war, which is backed by studies which show that they create a more threatening security environment and elicit greater provocation from Pyongyang. After Singapore, instead of supporting steps to remove Washington's permanent war footing in Korea, senior Democrats, led by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois) and Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), proposed a bill preventing Trump from withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea unless the “Secretary of Defense certifies it is in our national security interest.” A rumor was recently leaked to the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. was considering moving 4,500 troops from South Korea to elsewhere in the Pacific as part of its realignment targeting China, which was quickly dismissed by senior Pentagon officials. But Trump has in the past called for withdrawing troops from South Korea, saying that Washington is not properly compensated for maintaining 28,500 troops and that nearly eight decades of U.S. military presence on the Peninsula had not prevented North Korea's nuclear ambitions. South Korea allegedly pays half for maintaining the U.S. troops — more than $800 million annually — but Trump has demanded that Seoul foot the entire bill. “Even when South Korea was still poor in the 1970s, it began subsidizing U.S. bases through free labor, electricity and water.” “Withdrawing some troops as part of U.S. negotiations with North and South Korea could be a helpful gesture of goodwill and seriousness,” Vine told Truthout. A peace treaty, Vine affirmed, would both make the world more peaceful and “allow the U.S. to save billions of dollars per year by withdrawing some, and eventually all, of its troops on the Korean Peninsula.” Lee may have more political coverage to find agreement with Trump to reduce U.S. troops since the South Korean Ministry of Justice just released a report that found that U.S. military crimes against civilians rose 70 percent from 2018 to 2023. There is a robust peace movement in South Korea that has long demanded demilitarization and opposed the construction and expansion of U.S. military bases. South Korean feminists have sought justice for thousands of Korean women who provided sexual services to U.S. troops in military camp towns established around U.S. bases in a formal arrangement between the two governments. They have set up an encampment at the monkey house in Dongducheon to prevent its demolition, which they say would erase and cover up this travesty. Lee will also have the support of U.S. trans-partisan national security experts and organizations (including Women Cross DMZ, which I founded) who in April sent Trump a letter urging him to close military bases overseas to save billions of taxpayer dollars and improve national security. And last year, a coalition of U.S.-based antiwar organizations led by Nodutdol launched the “U.S. We need more Americans traveling to North Korea, whether it's Korean Americans reuniting with their families, the New York Philharmonic performing a concert, Dennis Rodman engaging in basketball diplomacy, or international women peacemakers meeting with North Korean women and crossing the DMZ. In order to do this, the peace movement must demand that President Trump lift his 2017 draconian ban on U.S. travel to North Korea which has halted all initiatives of this kind. The good news is that most Americans support cutting spending on the military and reinvesting in programs that directly improve Americans' lives. Moreover, a recent Harris Poll found that 70 percent of Americans want Trump to meet with Kim Jong Un again. The bill, reintroduced by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California) as H.R.1841, currently has 38 bipartisan co-sponsors. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California), who drafted the initial Korea peace bill, says, “We should not oppose efforts to reduce military spending & work towards peace just because it is proposed by Trump.” This has disappointed peace activists like Choi Sung-hee of the Gangjeong Peace Center, who told Truthout that Lee's aims to make South Korea a leading arms exporter will “promote a killing industry.” By taking a principled stand for peace and pursuing a policy of mutual respect for sovereignty and peaceful coexistence, Lee Jae-myung can steer the country away from developing a nuclear arsenal and redirect funds for war preparation toward improving the Korean people's welfare. “To have a diplomatic breakthrough, President Lee should get ready to make a serious, comprehensive disarmament deal with the DPRK, while navigating skillfully through both domestic and U.S. pressure for the arms race,” says Francis Daehoon Lee, director of PEACEMOMO. And we need pro-peace leaders like Lee Jae-myung to help us push for a less militarized U.S. foreign policy. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal agents detained 18-year-old Marcelo Gomes Da Silva while he was on his way to volleyball practice. Gomes was born in Brazil but has been in the U.S. since he was 6 years old and has two younger siblings, both of whom are American citizens. According to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement database, Gomes is being held in a Burlington, Massachusetts detention facility. His arrest cast a dark shadow over Milford High School's commencement ceremony on Sunday, with principal Joshua Otlin saying during his address, “We cannot and will not pretend that all is well at Milford High School this morning.” The Boston Globe reported that shortly before noon on Sunday, “demonstrators — from parents with young children to retired teachers — began to gather in front of Milford Town Hall.” “Many were Milford residents, outraged that a teenager who'd grown up in their town had been detained,” the Globe reported. Teachers, administrators, and athletic staff from Milford schools joined the rally. Shortly before 1 pm, the numbers swelled as students, some still donning their scarlet red graduation robes, descended upon Town Hall from commencement.” Democratic State Rep. Becca Rausch, one of the lawmakers who attended Sunday's rally, ripped ICE's conduct and said that “putting high school students in shackles does not make anyone safer.” Maura Healey said she was “disturbed and outraged by reports that a Milford High School student was arrested by ICE on his way to volleyball practice yesterday.” I'm demanding that ICE provide immediate information about why he was arrested, where he is, and how his due process is being protected,” said Healey. The Trump administration continues to create fear in our communities, and it's making us all less safe.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

NEW YORK, June 1. /TASS/. US Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin is right that NATO is waging a proxy war with Russia.

"And he (the Russian leader - TASS) considers this a proxy war by NATO as well right now, and frankly, in a way, it is. I mean, you look at what European nations have done with support. I mean, it's clearly Putin sees that," Kellogg said in an interview with Fox News, commenting on Germany's possible decision to begin supplying long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine.

Speaking about the progress of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations, Kellogg said as for Russia's term sheet for a memorandum the United States "have not got it yet." However, he said that after contacts with the Europeans in London, a 22-point document was prepared, which includes a ceasefire in the air, on land and at sea, but neither side was completely satisfied with it.

In November 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled during the CSTO summit that Moscow had repeatedly warned that the use of long-range weapons of the West on Russian territory would mean direct involvement of NATO in the conflict.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump allies call on administration to condemn surprise offensive if it had no warning of attack Steve Bannon, the White House chief strategist during Donald Trump's first term, used a Second World War comparison as he pointed out that Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, launched the operation just a day ahead of talks in Turkey. He called on the Trump administration to immediately condemn the strikes if it had no warning that Ukraine was planning such a huge attack. A day earlier, Ukrainian officials said the surprise drone offensive had destroyed or damaged more than 40 warplanes at air bases deep inside Russia. Operation “Spiders Web”, 18 months in the planning, targeted strategic bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons. As well as sending a message to Moscow, analysts said it was hard not to see a message for Mr Trump after his Oval Office showdown with Mr Zelensky, when he told the Ukrainian president: “You don't have the cards. Mr Trump is expected to speak to Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, and he will host Friedrich Merz, the new German chancellor, on Thursday. Mike Flynn, who was Mr Trump's first national adviser in 2017 before resigning over undeclared meetings with Russian officials, described the weekend strikes as a “geopolitical insult” if Washington had not been informed in advance. “People, and especially world leaders, need to realise the global implications to such an operation as Ukraine just pulled off,” he posted on X. Ukraine's short-term win could be the world's long-term loss.” Long an admirer of Vladimir Putin and his hardline rule of Russia, he hardened his position on Moscow after a surprise meeting with Mr Zelensky at the Vatican in April, but has not pushed through additional sanctions and has given the Russian leader more time to show he is serious about wanting peace. On Monday, the two sides met for just an hour in Turkey. Mr Bannon and his allies speculated that the Trump administration had given tacit approval. “There's no way that our intelligence services could not have known about this,” Jack Posobiec, a conservative activist and conspiracy theorist, told Mr Bannon's show. “Russia is just not going to sit there and take it,” he said about the strikes</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump announced on Friday the new steel and aluminum levies, which take effect on June 4, intensifying a global trade war just hours after he accused China of violating an agreement with the U.S. to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for critical minerals. Trump says he will double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% The country that helped build Quebec's aluminum industry now threatens its survival While some industry experts questioned whether the tariffs would be implemented as stated, in light of Trump's previous reversals, they said uncertainty and climbing prices of the metals would dampen industrial activity. “Higher prices are also likely to weigh further on U.S. steel demand from the manufacturing sector, which we already expect to contract this year,” said analyst Eoin Dinsmore at Goldman Sachs. U.S. President Donald Trump says he's going to double the tariff rate on steel to 50 per cent, a dramatic increase that could further push up prices for a metal used to make housing, autos and other goods. Copper prices also surged as traders bet that Trump would impose hefty duties on the metal used in power and construction. U.S copper touched a near two-month peak, widening its premium over benchmark London prices. Germany's second-biggest steelmaker Salzgitter warned that Washington's tariff policy was dealing a severe blow to European industry. “I think the final result will be far lower than initially projected, especially concerning its duration,” said Chelsea Ye, senior analyst at metals research firm McCloskey. Meanwhile, the tariff shift was applauded by U.S. producers of aluminum, used in transport, packaging and construction, who said the move would stop a “flood” of imports. Shares of U.S. steelmakers climbed in early Wall Street trading, with Nucor, Cleveland-Cliffs and Steel Dynamics surging between 11 per cent and 24 per cent. Shares of steelmakers fell in South Korea, which was the fourth-biggest exporter of steel to the U.S. last year, behind Canada, Mexico and Brazil, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data. South Korea's Industry Ministry said in a statement that it had held an emergency meeting with officials from the country's major steelmakers, including POSCO and Hyundai Steel . Shares of POSCO and Hyundai Steel fell 3 per cent, while those of South Korean peer SeAH Steel Corp tumbled 8 per cent. The 50 tariffs will add to the challenges facing Korean steel exporters, which have refrained from sharply boosting exports to the U.S. to avoid Washington's scrutiny, despite rising U.S. steel prices, an industry executive told Reuters. “It will be a burden to exporting companies if there are no additional steel price increases in the U.S,” he told Reuters, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Steel and aluminum tariffs were among the earliest Trump imposed when he returned to office in January. South Korea, a major U.S. ally, has called for an exemption from tariffs on steel, autos and others items, during talks with the United States. Seoul agreed in late April to craft a trade package by the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's reciprocal tariffs in July, but it has been difficult for negotiators to make big decisions due to a political leadership vacuum ahead of elections on Tuesday. In India, which relies heavily on the U.S. for aluminum exports, industry experts also warned of a major hit. Government has been negotiating so we are hopeful that with talks, the tariffs will come down.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, agreeing on a new prisoners of war (POWs) exchange but failing to reach a ceasefire. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the next prisoner exchange would feature at least 1,000 people on each side, and might reach a 1,200-for-1,200 swap that would possibly also include imprisoned journalists and political prisoners held in Russia. After the talks, Russia pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine and also proposed a ceasefire for two or three days in some areas of the front line in order to retrieve the bodies of the fallen soldiers. Zelensky said that only 15% of the mentioned 6,000 are identified and that Ukraine would need to check that the bodies Russia is willing to return are those of Ukrainian soldiers. "We had instances when they returned bodies that later were identified as their own," Zelensky said on June 2. Kyiv also handed over to the Russian delegation a list of 339 children abducted by Russia, and Moscow passed over its memorandum of proposals for a ceasefire. Ukraine called for guarantees that would prevent Russia from repeating its aggression, as well as the involvement of the international community to achieve this. According to Ukraine's proposal seen by the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine will continue on its path toward joining the EU and will become a member of NATO if there is consensus within the alliance. Ukraine is also ready to agree to the gradual lifting of some sanctions against Russia, but with a mechanism for their renewal if necessary. Frozen Russian assets, in turn, should be used to restore Ukraine and pay reparations. Umerov was leading Ukraine's 14-member delegation, which includes several figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors who did not take part in the May 16 negotiations. Russia has not officially submitted its memorandum outlining peace terms, but Ukraine plans to present a detailed roadmap aimed at securing a lasting settlement. Before the talks, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia and Ukrainian delegation member Oleksandr Bevz met representatives from Germany, Italy, and the U.K. to coordinate their positions, Tykhyi said on X. "Members of the Ukrainian delegation reiterated Ukraine's commitment to peace efforts. They elaborated on the items of the agenda, which include leaders' meeting, a full ceasefire, and humanitarian confidence-building measures," he added. Security advisors from the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany also plan to attend the talks, according to U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. He has so far refused to impose additional sanctions on Russia. The talks are taking place only a day after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched a mass drone attack against Russian air bases, allegedly hitting 41 Russian bombers and disabling 34% of Russia's cruise missile air fleet. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mohamed Sabry Soliman charged with multiple felonies after allegedly shouting ‘Free Palestine' as he attacked Boulder crowd Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is alleged to have shouted “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowd on Sunday. Soliman was booked into Boulder county jail on Sunday and has a hearing scheduled for 1.30pm local time on Monday. An FBI affidavit said Mohammed Soliman – upon confessing to Sunday's attack after his arrest – told the police he would do it again. NBC reported Soliman was an Egyptian national, and the White House claimed Soliman was in the US without legal status. Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old, including a woman that a Department of Justice official said was a survivor of the Holocaust, were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said, with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”. The Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time on Sunday of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire. Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old University of Colorado student, told Reuters she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, Coffman said. Alex Osante, from San Diego, told the Associated Press he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming. In a video of the scene filmed by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had been burned during the attack. After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a molotov cocktail but appeared to accidentally set himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. “She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,” said Leo Terrell, a senior counsel on civil rights in the justice department. “This is all caused by the same type of hatred: antisemitism.” Terrell, who leads the Trump administration's antisemitism taskforce, was criticized in March after he shared a post by a white supremacist. Law enforcement officials said Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries. On his Truth Social platform Monday, Donald Trump said the attack “will not be tolerated in the United States of America”. In a post on X, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, described Soliman as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed his tourist visa. Miller criticized Joe Biden's presidential administration, whom he said had given Soliman a work permit. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump's presidency. Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005. Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”. In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman's presence in the US to “Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was “illegally in our country”. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said. It follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel. Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Donald Trump's administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel's war on Gaza have taken place. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. U.S. President Donald Trump was not informed in advance about Ukraine's mass drone attack that allegedly hit 41 Russian aircraft across four air bases, CBS News and Axios reported on June 1, citing their undisclosed sources. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) operation, dubbed "Spiderweb," allegedly destroyed or damaged A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases on June 1. Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war. The strike reportedly involved 117 drones launched from trucks hidden across Russian territory. Trump is yet to comment publicly on the attack, which took place a day before the second round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul. The Kremlin continues to reject the truce backed by Kyiv, Washington, and European partners, and is reportedly preparing a new offensive this summer. Trump has also often criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky, claiming that Ukraine is at times "more difficult" to deal with than Russia. Zelensky has urged the U.S. president to impose stronger sanctions against Russia if the upcoming round of negotiations fails to bring results. If not, he warned, Washington would "respond a little bit differently." The U.S. president said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman was arrested at the scene in Boulder, Colorado “We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,” FBI director Kash Patel said. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was arrested at the scene after using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set demonstrators on fire. “A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien,” Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said. In response, the Biden administration gave him a work permit.” But Steve Redfearn, Boulder's police chief, refused to call the incident a terror attack. “We are not calling it a terror attack at this point,” Mr Redfearn said. It would be irresponsible for me to speculate right now on motive and other things.” It was unclear whether they were among the injured victims. I believe that [the demonstration] happens frequently down here,” he said. FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said the victims were taken to hospitals, many of whom suffered from burns. He shouted “end Zionists”, “Palestine is free”, and “they are killers” towards several people as they tended to a person lying on the ground. Other videos showed victims lying motionless on the ground as bystanders rushed to douse them with water. Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old student at the University of Colorado, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. She said one woman appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone. Mr Redfearn said officers raced to the scene after receiving reports that people had been set on fire. “The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. The popular pedestrian mall is known for attracting tourists and college students. “I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” he wrote on X. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that it was “aware of reports of an attack at today's Boulder Run for Their Lives event”. “Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,” he said in a statement. “Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing Molotov cocktails at them,” he said. The attack comes a week after two Israeli embassy staff were shot dead as they left a reception for diplomats near Washington's Jewish museum. Elias Rodriguez, 30, was arrested after allegedly shooting Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were soon to be engaged.</p>

NEW DELHI, June 2 (Reuters) – The head of a global airlines industry body said on Monday that growing trade barriers risked damaging the economy and the air travel sector, and “unacceptable” plane delivery delays were frustrating growth plans at a time of record passenger numbers. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) shaved a key forecast for 2025 industry-wide profits, blaming trade tensions and declining consumer confidence. “Like all forms of connectivity, flying makes the world more prosperous,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said at the group's annual meeting in New Delhi. For the times we live in, this is an important message,” he said. Sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have stoked fears of an economic slowdown and squeezed discretionary spending, prompting many consumers especially in the United States to delay or scale back travel plans. They also threaten a decades-old pact between more than 30 countries to eliminate duties on aircraft and their parts. IATA represents some 300 airlines accounting for more than 80% of global traffic. On environmental sustainability, Walsh said progress was not what it should be at this point in time. He criticized energy firms for not producing enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is made from waste oil and biomass and costs more than conventional jet fuel. IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will struggle to meet their sustainability goals, but Walsh said the aviation industry was still aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF. More people are flying than ever before after a post-pandemic passenger market recovery, but airline growth is being hampered by extended plane delivery delays and supply chain bottlenecks driving up maintenance and repair time. Walsh called predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade “off-the-chart unacceptable.” He said the airline industry was evaluating legal options over the delays, but it preferred to work with manufacturers collaboratively. IATA said the number of deliveries scheduled for 2025 was 26% less than what was promised a year ago, although at 1,692 this would be the highest number of new planes since 2018. Tim Clark, president of the world's largest international airline, Dubai's Emirates, said on Sunday that the pandemic was no longer an acceptable excuse for delivery delays and challenged planemakers to take responsibility. Transparency, to be frank, is lacking, and we're getting agitated. I mean it is just going beyond a joke now,” flyadeal CEO Steven Greenway told Reuters. Last week, sources told Reuters that Europe's Airbus AIR.PA has been warning airlines it faces another three years of delivery delays. Tata Group's Air India is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a major new aircraft order including some 200 extra single-aisle planes, topping up a mammoth deal in 2023 as the former state carrier pursues a multi-billion-dollar revamp, Reuters reported on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mongolia has been thrown into fresh political crisis with protesters calling for the resignation of the country's prime minister over his family's lavish displays of wealth. For two weeks, young Mongolians have taken to the streets of the capital putting pressure on Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai who will face a vote of confidence in his government on Monday. Democratic Mongolia is a landlocked nation of just 3.5 million people sandwiched between authoritarian giants China and Russia, and the latest political crisis has put renewed scrutiny on the stability of the country's democracy. The protests were triggered by social media posts that went viral showing the prime minister's 23-year-old son's lavish engagement proposal and their apparent extravagant lifestyle including helicopter-rides, an expensive ring, designer handbags and a luxury car. Suspicion grew over how the son accumulated such wealth – especially as Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene campaigned on being from a rural, not wealthy family. “With no visible sources of income, their display of luxury bags, private travel, and high-end living was a blatant slap in the face to the average Mongolian citizen,” said Amina, 28, a member of protest group Ogtsroh Amarhan (Resigning is Easy). Amina, who wanted to go by one name for security reasons, said the protests go beyond the social media posts flaunting wealth, which she said were symptomatic of a widening disconnect between the ruling elite and everyday people. “The cost of living in Mongolia has skyrocketed — many people are paying nearly half of their monthly income in taxes while barely making enough to cover food, rent, or utilities. Protesters have gathered in the capital Ulaanbaatar's central Sükhbaatar Square, in front of the Government Palace, almost daily for two weeks, calling for Oyun-Erdene to release his finances and resign. “The prime minister makes regular financial declarations annually in line with Mongolian law,” the office said in a statement to CNN. For decades, Mongolia has struggled with endemic graft and protests often break out over allegations that corrupt officials and business leaders were enriching themselves with public funds. Seeing so much inequality, injustice, and arrogance from those in power pushed me to speak up,” said Ariunzaya Khajidmaa, 23, a resident of Ulaanbaatar who joined the protests with her 2-month-old baby. “If you look at the corruption index, it has gone down. And one explanation is that, even though the Prime Minister has exposed a lot of the corruption cases, nothing has been done. So now everybody's looking at the judiciary,” said Bolor Lkhaajav, a Mongolian political analyst and commentator. The Prime Minister is trying to save his coalition government and parliament, called the State Great Khural, is holding a vote of confidence on Monday. Oyun-Erdene and his son have submitted themselves to Mongolia's anti-corruption agency and the prime minister said he would resign if the investigation uncovered any irregularities. Oyun-Erdene, who was re-elected to a second term in 2024, had promised to diversify the country's economy, which is dependent on the mining industry accounting for about a quarter of GDP. Oyun-Erdene's coalition government last year announced 14 new mega projects to boost economic growth, including cross-border railway connections and a major expansion of renewable energy. The Sovereign Wealth Fund law, approved by parliament in April, allows the government to take a 34% stake in mines considered to have strategic mineral deposits, meaning they are vital for the country's economy and development. There are currently 16 such sites and the profits will go into the fund, with portions allocated to benefitting Mongolian people including through financial assistance, healthcare, education, and housing, according to public broadcaster Montsame. “These people, they are now at the edge of losing their power - huge money - which created huge inequality in the country. So they are fighting to the death against this government,” said Jargalsaikhan. Mongolia has been a parliamentary democracy since its democratic revolution in 1991. But the years since have seen multiple governments toppled, or leaders shuffled. This instability has led some Mongolians to believe the powers of President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, who is head of state, should be extended. Currently, the president can only serve one six-year term. Khurelsukh has repeatedly said he does not want to change Mongolia's parliamentary democracy. “Freedom comes only with the parliamentary system… If we don't do that, we will be another failed economy, a failed nation.” Analysts say Mongolia needs to show it can have stable governance so it can attract broader foreign investment and reduce its economic dependence on China and Russia. Khurelsukh last year welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin for an official visit to Mongolia, a trip condemened by Ukraine. The visit was Putin's first to a member country of the International Criminal Court which had issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges on war crimes. “A lot of the governments that are looking at Mongolia as an oasis of democracy between Russia and China, so they want to trust us, but at the same time, you have to show some accountability and stability for other governments to say, okay, Mongolia is getting better,” said Bolor. Those on the streets say they are tired of political games and want to see tangible improvements to their daily lives. “We want stronger anti-corruption measures, public officials who are held to ethical standards, and a system that ensures no one is above the law,” said Ariunzaya.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The operation, dubbed “Spiderweb,” saw drones hit targets across a large swathe of Russia, including in Belaya – which is closer to Japan than Ukraine – and at Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, according to the source. More than 40 Russian aircraft were “burning en masse” at four air bases, the source said. The SBU, Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency, said the strikes caused an estimated $7 billion in damages and hit 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers at its main air bases. The drone attacks came on the eve of expected peace talks in Istanbul between Russia and Ukraine, which were already strained by uncertainty and pressure from US President Donald Trump. The strikes appear intended to send a message to Russia that Ukraine could still apply pressure more than three years since Russia's unprovoked invasion. Kyiv has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not wanting to end the war as Moscow ramps up its attacks and offensive operations, including launching its largest drone assault on Ukraine since the war began overnight Saturday. Social media video geolocated by CNN to seven kilometers southeast of the Belaya Air Base in Russia's eastern Irkutsk region, appears to show a drone flying out of a wooden shed loaded onto a truck as smoke rises in the background. Images also show drones stacked inside what appear to be wooden crates with retractable roofs ahead of the operation. It can be confidently said that this was an absolutely unique operation,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X. Zelensky said 117 drones were used to carry out the attacks, which were played up as a military and propaganda win for Ukraine that caught Russia off-guard. Related article Two bridges collapse in Russian regions bordering Ukraine, killing at least 7 “The ‘office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,” Zelensky said on X. More than 40 aircraft were known to have been hit, according to the Security source, including TU-95 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers and one of Russia's few remaining A-50 surveillance planes. “We are doing everything to drive the enemy from our native land! We will strike them at sea, in the air, and on land. And if needed — we'll reach them even from underground,” the SBU said in a statement. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth received regular updates as he traveled to Joint Base Andrews on Sunday but has not yet spoken to his Ukrainian counterparts, the official said. The airfields targeted included Belaya in Irkutsk, some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia, and the Dyagilevo base in Ryazan in western Russia, about 520 kilometers (320 miles) from Ukraine, which is a training center for Russia's strategic bomber force. Ivanovo is a base for Russian military transport aircraft. The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed Ukraine had targeted Russian airfields across five regions on Sunday, calling the drone strikes “terrorist attacks.” It added that the fires had since been extinguished. Kobzev said on Telegram that the exact number of drones deployed had not been determined. Emergency and security services were at the site, he added. SBU drones were targeting aircraft that bomb Ukrainian cities every night, the security source said. CNN was able to confirm the location of that video, as well as two others posted on social media showing smoke rising from the Belaya air base. It was not immediately able to independently verify other videos provided by the SBU. One video purportedly of one attack appears to show drones rising from a truck, as vehicles pass on a nearby highway. The source added that people involved were already back in Ukraine. It came the same day as a Russian missile strike on a training site used by Ukrainian forces, killing at least 12 people and wounding more than 60 others. The talks, which will take place in Istanbul, have been strained by uncertainty. Putin proposed holding “direct talks” in Turkey earlier this month – but never showed up, despite Zelensky agreeing to meet. A framework from the Ukrainian delegation lists key principles for the talks that include a full and unconditional ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, and the release of hostages and return of abducted children.

MOSCOW, June 2. /TASS/. The candidate of the opposition Law and Justice party Karol Nawrocki has won the second round of the Polish presidential election, gaining 50.9% of the vote after the State Election Commission processed all ballots, the TVP Info channel reported.
