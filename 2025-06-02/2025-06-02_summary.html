A pro-peace presidential candidate offers a historic opening to transform the front line of a new Cold War.

On June 3, South Korea will conclude a snap election prompted by the impeachment of former president Yoon Seok-yeol on insurrection charges for a failed coup. The strong frontrunner in the race is Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party pro-peace candidate. While Lee's election could open the window for peace talks, progressives must learn from the last peace process that began in 2018. In the coming weeks, as the dust settles on the election, it is crucial to get out ahead of the Trump administration to call for policies that can reduce the threat of nuclear war and improve prospects for peace in Korea and the region.

The inter-Korean and geopolitical context has drastically changed since the last South Korean liberal president, Moon Jae-in, was in power. Yoon, Moon's hardline conservative successor, further strained relations with North Korea by intensifying military exercises with the U.S., including joining a trilateral military alliance with Japan and enacting repressive policies intent on “eradicating pro-North Korea forces.” Yoon's hawkish turn so impressed the warmongering RAND Corporation that it called him “Biden's Perfect South Korean Partner.” In response, North Korea tested nearly 100 missiles, blew up any remnants of reunification efforts, and declared that the demilitarized zone (DMZ) was now a permanent national boundary under its Constitution. Under Yoon's reign, South Korea sent arms to Ukraine, while North Korea sent arms and troops to fight alongside Russia, further entrenching the two Koreas in a new Cold War between the U.S., China and Russia. South Korea is already home to the largest overseas U.S. military base, Camp Humphreys, and because of its proximity to China, a U.S. missile defense system, THAAD.

In a rare redux, a liberal South Korean president could face a second Trump administration interested in resuming talks with North Korea. The cost of hosting U.S. forces in Korea — comprising 28,500 servicemembers on 15 U.S. military bases — will also be a major issue facing a potential Lee government as President Donald Trump will try to extract more from Seoul in negotiations over tariffs.

On the campaign trail, Trump signaled his desire to meet Kim Jong Un, and in March indicated that he has a “very good relationship” with Kim and would “probably do something with him at some point.” In April, a senior official told Axios that the Trump administration is quietly exploring resuming talks.

Although members of the previous Trump administration, namely John Bolton, botched talks with North Korea in Hanoi in 2019, the Biden and Yoon administrations further worsened relations. Bolton is emblematic of the entrenched, hardline foreign policy establishment colloquially known as “the Blob”; contrary to their assessment, the 2018 historic summits between the U.S. and North Korea (DPRK), and North Korea and South Korea, actually led to tangible outcomes.

After the 2018 Singapore Declaration, in which the U.S. and DPRK committed to establishing new relations toward “peace and prosperity,” North Korea released three detained Americans, repatriated U.S. servicemember remains, and self-imposed a five-year moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile testing.

The 2018 summits between Moon and Kim yielded progress, too, including reunions of separated families and a Comprehensive Military Agreement to “completely cease all hostile acts against each other” by ending military drills near the border, limiting live-fire drills, imposing no-fly zones, and establishing crucial communication lines and a buffer zone in the West Sea. North and South Korean soldiers cleared landmines together in the DMZ, the border that separates the two countries and is widely considered to be the most heavily militarized border on Earth. Additionally, Moon and Kim, along with the U.S.-led UN Command, agreed to remove firearms and guards in the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom.

Still, the Blob chastised Trump's overtures to North Korea, including his call to cancel the U.S.-South Korea military exercises, war drills that he aptly called “very provocative.” Every spring and fall, the U.S. and South Korea hold joint military exercises, deploying B-2 bombers, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines, and pre-emptive strikes simulating “decapitation measures” against the North Korean regime. The U.S. says these are for “readiness,” but North Koreans view them as rehearsals for war, which is backed by studies which show that they create a more threatening security environment and elicit greater provocation from Pyongyang.

After Singapore, instead of supporting steps to remove Washington's permanent war footing in Korea, senior Democrats, led by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois) and Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), proposed a bill preventing Trump from withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea unless the “Secretary of Defense certifies it is in our national security interest.”

A rumor was recently leaked to the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. was considering moving 4,500 troops from South Korea to elsewhere in the Pacific as part of its realignment targeting China, which was quickly dismissed by senior Pentagon officials. But Trump has in the past called for withdrawing troops from South Korea, saying that Washington is not properly compensated for maintaining 28,500 troops and that nearly eight decades of U.S. military presence on the Peninsula had not prevented North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

South Korea allegedly pays half for maintaining the U.S. troops — more than $800 million annually — but Trump has demanded that Seoul foot the entire bill. “Only a few Americans know that the South Korean government paid about 90 percent of the $10.8 billion for the construction of Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. overseas base built with the military rise of China in mind,” Kap Seol, a veteran Korean journalist, told Truthout, noting that at that time, China was South Korea's largest trading partner. “Even when South Korea was still poor in the 1970s, it began subsidizing U.S. bases through free labor, electricity and water.”

According to David Vine, U.S. military base expert and author of The United States of War, an exact calculation of the costs to maintain U.S. bases and troops in South Korea is impossible given a lack of Pentagon budget transparency and audit failures. Using data from the Government Accountability Office and the Pentagon, in a preliminary analysis, Vine estimates that, after subtracting the value of direct payments and in-kind contributions from the South Korean government, U.S. taxpayers pay between $3 billion and $4.6 billion every year to maintain the U.S. troops and bases in South Korea, and true costs may exceed $5.3 billion yearly.

“Withdrawing some troops as part of U.S. negotiations with North and South Korea could be a helpful gesture of goodwill and seriousness,” Vine told Truthout. A peace treaty, Vine affirmed, would both make the world more peaceful and “allow the U.S. to save billions of dollars per year by withdrawing some, and eventually all, of its troops on the Korean Peninsula.”

Lee may have more political coverage to find agreement with Trump to reduce U.S. troops since the South Korean Ministry of Justice just released a report that found that U.S. military crimes against civilians rose 70 percent from 2018 to 2023. There is a robust peace movement in South Korea that has long demanded demilitarization and opposed the construction and expansion of U.S. military bases. South Korean feminists have sought justice for thousands of Korean women who provided sexual services to U.S. troops in military camp towns established around U.S. bases in a formal arrangement between the two governments. To prevent U.S. soldiers from contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the South Korean government, under pressure from the U.S., established STD detention centers called the “monkey house” where women were forced into inhumane treatments and quarantine. They have set up an encampment at the monkey house in Dongducheon to prevent its demolition, which they say would erase and cover up this travesty.

Lee will also have the support of U.S. trans-partisan national security experts and organizations (including Women Cross DMZ, which I founded) who in April sent Trump a letter urging him to close military bases overseas to save billions of taxpayer dollars and improve national security. And last year, a coalition of U.S.-based antiwar organizations led by Nodutdol launched the “U.S. Out of Korea” campaign to stop the war drills and demand the withdrawal of U.S. bases and soldiers from South Korea. Peace movements in the U.S. and South Korea should seize the historic opening to call for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, which has occupied the southern half of the peninsula for 80 years.

Trump may be willing to buck the bipartisan consensus that engagement amounts to appeasement, but the peace movement must offer concrete solutions that can ratchet down tensions and the U.S.'s permanent war footing in Korea and the region. The Korean War is the longest standing U.S. conflict and was only halted in 1953 when the U.S., North Korea and China signed an armistice, but not a peace settlement. The war claimed 4 million lives, obliterated 80 percent of North Korean cities, and divided millions of Korean families. Central to achieving peace is negotiating a peace agreement that finally ends the Korean War.

To make peace durable and sustainable requires people-to-people engagement, especially the involvement of women, to build understanding, empathy, and trust. We need more Americans traveling to North Korea, whether it's Korean Americans reuniting with their families, the New York Philharmonic performing a concert, Dennis Rodman engaging in basketball diplomacy, or international women peacemakers meeting with North Korean women and crossing the DMZ. In order to do this, the peace movement must demand that President Trump lift his 2017 draconian ban on U.S. travel to North Korea which has halted all initiatives of this kind.

The good news is that most Americans support cutting spending on the military and reinvesting in programs that directly improve Americans' lives. Moreover, a recent Harris Poll found that 70 percent of Americans want Trump to meet with Kim Jong Un again. And this time, there is a coordinated peace movement and peace champions in Congress.

In 2018, as peace talks began, Women Cross DMZ launched our Korea Peace Now! Campaign and Grassroots Network to press for the first-ever congressional resolution to end the Korean War, the Peace on the Korean Peninsula Act in 2019. The bill, reintroduced by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California) as H.R.1841, currently has 38 bipartisan co-sponsors. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California), who drafted the initial Korea peace bill, says, “We should not oppose efforts to reduce military spending & work towards peace just because it is proposed by Trump.”

Although Lee pledges to reopen hotlines and dialogue with North Korea and to not “unnecessarily” antagonize China and Russia, he has campaigned to continue the trilateral military alliance. This has disappointed peace activists like Choi Sung-hee of the Gangjeong Peace Center, who told Truthout that Lee's aims to make South Korea a leading arms exporter will “promote a killing industry.”

Still, a Lee presidency promises a new chapter for the Korean Peninsula. By taking a principled stand for peace and pursuing a policy of mutual respect for sovereignty and peaceful coexistence, Lee Jae-myung can steer the country away from developing a nuclear arsenal and redirect funds for war preparation toward improving the Korean people's welfare. “To have a diplomatic breakthrough, President Lee should get ready to make a serious, comprehensive disarmament deal with the DPRK, while navigating skillfully through both domestic and U.S. pressure for the arms race,” says Francis Daehoon Lee, director of PEACEMOMO.

The Korean Peninsula can be transformed from the front line of the new Cold War to the site of regional and global peace, but the lesson past South Korean liberal administrations show is that for them to succeed, they need the support of the U.S. peace movements to apply political pressure on Washington. And we need pro-peace leaders like Lee Jae-myung to help us push for a less militarized U.S. foreign policy.

Federal agents detained 18-year-old Marcelo Gomes Da Silva while he was on his way to volleyball practice.

The arrest of 18-year-old Marcelo Gomes Da Silva by federal immigration agents sparked outrage in the town of Milford, Massachusetts over the weekend, with community members rallying on Sunday to demand the high school student's immediate release after he was detained while on his way to volleyball practice.

Gomes was born in Brazil but has been in the U.S. since he was 6 years old and has two younger siblings, both of whom are American citizens. According to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement database, Gomes is being held in a Burlington, Massachusetts detention facility.

His arrest cast a dark shadow over Milford High School's commencement ceremony on Sunday, with principal Joshua Otlin saying during his address, “We cannot and will not pretend that all is well at Milford High School this morning.”

“It is not,” he added.

The Boston Globe reported that shortly before noon on Sunday, “demonstrators — from parents with young children to retired teachers — began to gather in front of Milford Town Hall.”

“Many were Milford residents, outraged that a teenager who'd grown up in their town had been detained,” the Globe reported. “Others were supporters and advocates from surrounding communities. Teachers, administrators, and athletic staff from Milford schools joined the rally. Soon, rows of demonstrators stretched for a block on both sides of the street adjacent to Town Hall. Shortly before 1 pm, the numbers swelled as students, some still donning their scarlet red graduation robes, descended upon Town Hall from commencement.”

Democratic State Rep. Becca Rausch, one of the lawmakers who attended Sunday's rally, ripped ICE's conduct and said that “putting high school students in shackles does not make anyone safer.”

The arrest came amid a recent flurry of ICE arrests in Massachusetts and across the country. On Monday, U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) is set to convene a press conference and roundtable to discuss “an uptick in ICE activity across the Massachusetts 7th Congressional District and the Commonwealth, including a series of harrowing incidents in East Boston, Chelsea, Everett, and other predominantly immigrant communities.”

In a statement Sunday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said she was “disturbed and outraged by reports that a Milford High School student was arrested by ICE on his way to volleyball practice yesterday.”

“Yet again, local officials and law enforcement have been left in the dark with no heads up and no answers to their questions. I'm demanding that ICE provide immediate information about why he was arrested, where he is, and how his due process is being protected,” said Healey. “My heart goes out to the Milford community on what was supposed to be a celebratory graduation day. The Trump administration continues to create fear in our communities, and it's making us all less safe.”

NEW YORK, June 1. /TASS/. US Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin is right that NATO is waging a proxy war with Russia.

"And he (the Russian leader - TASS) considers this a proxy war by NATO as well right now, and frankly, in a way, it is. I mean, you look at what European nations have done with support. I mean, it's clearly Putin sees that," Kellogg said in an interview with Fox News, commenting on Germany's possible decision to begin supplying long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine.

Speaking about the progress of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations, Kellogg said as for Russia's term sheet for a memorandum the United States "have not got it yet." However, he said that after contacts with the Europeans in London, a 22-point document was prepared, which includes a ceasefire in the air, on land and at sea, but neither side was completely satisfied with it.

In November 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled during the CSTO summit that Moscow had repeatedly warned that the use of long-range weapons of the West on Russian territory would mean direct involvement of NATO in the conflict.

			Trump allies call on administration to condemn surprise offensive if it had no warning of attack

Key Trump allies have condemned the Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian nuclear bombers, warning the attacks risked escalating the conflict at a time when Washington is trying to keep both sides at the negotiating table.

Steve Bannon, the White House chief strategist during Donald Trump's first term, used a Second World War comparison as he pointed out that Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, launched the operation just a day ahead of talks in Turkey.

“On the eve of peace talks or ceasefire talks he takes the Japanese role in Pearl Harbor – the sneak attack,” he said on his popular War Room show.

He called on the Trump administration to immediately condemn the strikes if it had no warning that Ukraine was planning such a huge attack.

Mr Bannon and his allies fear the world is hurtling towards a Third World War, as China and Russia deepen ties, and flashpoints ignite around the world.

A day earlier, Ukrainian officials said the surprise drone offensive had destroyed or damaged more than 40 warplanes at air bases deep inside Russia.

Operation “Spiders Web”, 18 months in the planning, targeted strategic bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons.

As well as sending a message to Moscow, analysts said it was hard not to see a message for Mr Trump after his Oval Office showdown with Mr Zelensky, when he told the Ukrainian president: “You don't have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us, you don't have any cards.”

The strike was launched ahead of a big week of diplomacy.

Mr Trump is expected to speak to Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, and he will host Friedrich Merz, the new German chancellor, on Thursday.

Mike Flynn, who was Mr Trump's first national adviser in 2017 before resigning over undeclared meetings with Russian officials, described the weekend strikes as a “geopolitical insult” if Washington had not been informed in advance.

“People, and especially world leaders, need to realise the global implications to such an operation as Ukraine just pulled off,” he posted on X.

“Russia will respond. Action, reaction, counteraction. Those are the shifting tides of warfare.

“This wasn't a bold action, it was brash. Ukraine's short-term win could be the world's long-term loss.”

The US president has moved one way and then the other as he tries to make good on his campaign promise to end the conflict in Ukraine.

Long an admirer of Vladimir Putin and his hardline rule of Russia, he hardened his position on Moscow after a surprise meeting with Mr Zelensky at the Vatican in April, but has not pushed through additional sanctions and has given the Russian leader more time to show he is serious about wanting peace.

On Monday, the two sides met for just an hour in Turkey. That was still enough time to agree to swap the bodies of 6,000 soldiers killed in action.

Mr Bannon said: “This is scampering up the escalatory ladder at the exact moment President Trump wants to get everybody off the escalatory ladder.”

Mr Bannon and his allies speculated that the Trump administration had given tacit approval.

“There's no way that our intelligence services could not have known about this,” Jack Posobiec, a conservative activist and conspiracy theorist, told Mr Bannon's show.

“We've had intelligence services that have been on the ground, as we know prior to the war, that are directly embedded, direct embeds with Ukrainian intelligence services and Ukrainian security services.”

Mr Bannon may no longer be in the White House, but he continues to talk with the president and his show is deeply influential with the wider Maga base.

“Russia is just not going to sit there and take it,” he said about the strikes

“The attack was audacious and bold and brilliant. That's also not the point.”

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice.

Thomasville, Georgia, has a water problem. Its treatment system is far out of date, posing serious health and environmental risks.

“We have wastewater infrastructure that is old,” said Sheryl Sealy, the assistant city manager for this city of 18,881 near the Florida border, about 45 minutes from Tallahassee. “It's critical that we do the work to replace this.”

But it's expensive to replace. The system is especially bad in underserved parts of the city, Sealy said.

In September, Thomasville applied to get some help from the federal government, and just under four months later, the city and its partners were awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to make the long-overdue wastewater improvements, build a resilience hub and health clinic, and upgrade homes in several historic neighborhoods.

“The grant itself was really a godsend for us,” Sealy said. 

In early April, as the EPA canceled grants for similar projects across the country, federal officials assured Thomasville that their funding was on track. Then on May 1, the city received a termination notice.

“We felt, you know, a little taken off guard when the bottom did let out for us,” said Sealy.

Thomasville isn't alone. 

Under the Trump administration, the EPA has canceled or interrupted hundreds of grants aimed at improving health and severe weather preparedness because the agency “determined that the grant applications no longer support administration priorities,” according to an emailed statement to Grist.

The cuts are part of a broader gutting of federal programs aimed at furthering environmental justice, an umbrella term for the effort to help communities that have been hardest hit by pollution and other environmental issues, which often include low-income communities and communities of color. 

In Thomasville's case, the city has a history of heavy industry that has led to poor air quality. Air pollution, health concerns, and high poverty qualified the surrounding county for the Biden administration's Justice40 initiative, which prioritized funding for disadvantaged communities. Thomasville has some of the highest exposure risks in Georgia to toxic air pollutants that can cause respiratory, reproductive, and developmental health problems, according to the Environmental Defense Fund's Climate Vulnerability Index. The city's wastewater woes don't only mean the potential for sewage backups in homes and spills into local waterways but also the risk of upper respiratory problems, according to Zealan Hoover, a former Biden administration EPA official who is now advising the advocacy groups Environmental Protection Network and Lawyers for Good Government.

“These projects were selected because they have a really clear path to alleviating the health challenges facing this community,” he said.

Critics argue there's a disconnect between the Trump administration's attack on the concept of environmental justice and the realities of what the funds are paying for.

“What is it about building a new health clinic and upgrading wastewater infrastructure … that's inconsistent with administration policy?” Democratic Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at a recent hearing. 

Zeldin repeatedly responded by discussing the agency's review process intended to comply with President Donald Trump's executive orders, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, but Ossoff cut him off, pushing for a specific answer about Thomasville's grant. “Is a new health clinic for Thomasville, Georgia, woke?” he asked.

Thomasville's Sealy said she understands that the federal government has to make hard funding decisions — that's true locally too — but losing this grant has left her city in the lurch. In addition to the planned work on the wastewater collection system, the city needs to update its treatment plant to meet EPA standards. That overhaul will likely cost $60 million to $70 million, she said.

“How do you fund that?” Sealy asked. “You can't fund that on the backs of the people who pay our rates.”

The funding cuts have left cities across Georgia — including Athens, Norcross, and Savannah — as well as nonprofit groups, in a state of uncertainty: some grants terminated, some suspended then reinstated, some still unclear. This puts city officials in an impossible position, unable to wait or to move forward, according to Athens-Clarke County Sustainability Director Mike Wharton. 

“Do you commit to new programs? Do you commit to services?” he said. “Here you are sitting in limbo for months.” 

Like Thomasville, Athens was also awarded a nearly $20 million Community Change grant. The city was going to use the money for backup generators, solar power, and battery storage at its public safety complex — ensuring 911, police, the jail, a domestic violence shelter, and other services could all operate during a power outage. That grant has been terminated.

The problem, Wharton said, goes beyond that money not coming in; the city had already spent time, resources, and money to get the grant.

“We spent $60,000 in local funding hiring people to write the grants,” he said. “Over a period of 14 months we invested over 700 hours of local personnel time. So we diverted our services to focus on these things.”

These frustrations are playing out for grant recipients throughout the state and country, according to Hoover. He said it's not just confusing — it's expensive.

“They are causing project costs to skyrocket because they keep freezing and unfreezing and refreezing projects,” he said. “One of the big drivers of cost overruns in any infrastructure project, public or private, is having to demobilize and remobilize your teams.”

Thomasville and Athens officials both said they're appealing their grant terminations, which require them to submit a formal letter outlining the reasons for their appeal and requesting the agency reconsider the decision. They're also reaching out to their elected officials, hoping that pressure from their senators and members of Congress can get them the federal money they were promised.

Other cities and nonprofits, as well as a group of Democratic state attorneys general, have sued, arguing that terminating their grants without following proper procedures is illegal. But that's a difficult step for many localities to take.

“Suing the federal government to assert your legal rights is very daunting, even if the law is on your side,” Hoover said.

“The Americans and Israelis set a huge trap for us to lure us here and kill us,” one Palestinian eyewitness said.

On Sunday morning at dawn, Palestinians from southern Gaza headed to the aid distribution point in Rafah run by the Gaza Humanitarian Fund (GHF), the U.S. contractor tasked with delivering aid to Palestinians instead of the UN. Once thousands of aid-seekers arrived at the al-Alam area of Rafah's Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, the Israeli army opened fire on the crowds, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Mondoweiss. 

As throngs of people waited outside the aid site in the early morning hours, waiting for the instructions of the American employees, eyewitnesses described an Israeli quadcopter drone hovering overhead and ordering them via loudspeaker to enter the fenced delivery site at 6:00 a.m.

After hundreds of people had entered, soldiers opened fire on the crowd, killing 31 people and wounding 200 others with live ammunition, Gaza's Ministry of Health said in a statement on Sunday.

 “Every martyr who arrived at the hospital had sustained only one gunshot wound to the head or chest,” the Health Ministry said. “This confirms the occupation's intent to kill civilians.”

Director of Hospitals in Gaza, Muhammad Zaqout, said at a press conference in front of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis that the injured had arrived at the medical compound in animal-drawn carts or were carried on people's shoulders due to the Israeli army's prevention of ambulances from reaching the aid site.

The Israeli army denied that any soldiers had fired at civilians in the center, regarding the allegations as “false reports.” The GHF also denied the reports as “completely false and fabricated,” publishing CCTV footage of aid distribution in Rafah as apparent proof that the day had gone on “without incident.”

Last week, three people were killed at the GHF-run aid distribution point in al-Bureij, north of the Netzarim Axis, and seven others were reported missing in the wake of the chaos last week in the southern GHF site in Rafah. Today, June 2, the Israeli army killed another 3 people at the al-Bureij GHF site.

Ahmed Abu Libdeh, 28, arrived at the aid distribution center in Rafah at 5:00 a.m. from eastern Khan Younis. Instead of receiving food, he witnessed what he described as “one of the most horrific massacres perpetrated by the [Israeli] army” at the Rafah center.

“We were standing outside the distribution point,” Abu Libdeh told Mondoweiss. “At around 6:00 a.m., a quadcopter flew overhead and announced over the loudspeaker that the place was safe and we could enter to get the food.”

“The quadcopter loudspeaker said, ‘walk, you're safe. We'll get the aid out in a little while,'” Abu Libdeh added, stating that after the aid had arrived, “they began bombing and killing us.” 

“As soon as we entered the distribution point and started carrying the aid, the Israeli army opened fire,” he explained. “The scene was horrific. We couldn't see anything because of the dust and the shelling and the heavy gunfire directed at us. Dozens of people were killed. And the airstrikes also killed dozens of people.”

Abu Libdeh noted that the first strike occurred at around 6:15, the first bombing occurred, with a drone bombing a car full of people who had received food and were leaving the area. “After the car was bombed, tanks opened fire on us,” he described.

Ahmad said that the first few minutes were “a shock to everyone,” explaining that they had entered the distribution site according to Israeli army instructions. “We didn't know where the bombing was coming from or from whom. Dust filled the area, and people were running without knowing what was going on. People were falling in the stampede, and I saw dozens lying on the ground, bleeding. They all died because no one could save them.”

“The Americans and Israelis set a huge trap for us to lure us here and kill us by the dozens,” Abu Libdeh concluded. “We don't want America's help. We want to stop the war and stop the hunger.”

The massacre on Sunday has led many Palestinians in Gaza to conclude that the goal of the GHF is not to distribute food to the people but to aid and abet the Israeli army's goal of “exterminating” Palestinians.

Arafat, 49, who preferred not to give his surname, is shown sitting in Nasser Hospital with a small child in his lap in video testimony for Mondoweiss. Both are crying, while Arafat lets out a sigh for his brother, who he says was killed by the Israeli army in Rafah while on his way to secure food for his family.

“Why do they tell us to go get food only to kill us when we get there?” Arafat says. “They are liars. They lie to us and the world. The Americans are conspiring with the Israelis to kill us. They killed my brother because he went to get food for his family.” Arafat explains that the child in his lap is his brother's son.

“They made a place for us to go and be killed in cold blood,” Arafat continued. “They shouldn't say this is a humanitarian area. It's a trap and a massacre of starving people.”

Arafat notes that some people had been queuing near the distribution point since 11 p.m. the night before. “The result is that we're getting death instead of food,” he says. “We don't want America's help. We don't want America's food. If America wants to help us, as it claims, let it stop the war. We don't want anything more from it.”

Right-wing figures around the world celebrated Karol Nawrocki's defeat of Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski.

Far-right candidate Karol Nawrocki emerged Monday as the narrow winner of Poland's presidential election, a contest in which the Trump administration in the U.S. and Hungary's authoritarian leader, Viktor Orbán, weighed in on the side of their ideological compatriot.

Nawrocki's victory over Rafał Trzaskowski, the Warsaw mayor who was representing the party of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, was celebrated by right-wing figures around the world, including Orbán and Jordan Bardella, the head of France's far-right National Rally party.

“The Polish people have spoken and their free and democratic choice must be respected, including by the Brussels leaders who ardently hoped for their defeat,” Bardella wrote on social media following news that Nawrocki, a historian and “former football hooligan” backed by Poland's Law and Justice Party, prevailed in one of the closest elections in the country's history.

Nawrocki's win came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem endorsed him during a speech at a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering in Poland last week.

“[U.S. President] Donald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity to have just as strong of a leader in Karol if you make him the leader of this country,” said Noem. “If you elect a leader who will work with President Trump, the Polish people will have a strong ally. You will continue to have a U.S. military presence here… and you will have equipment that is American-made, high quality.”

In early May, Nawrocki met with Trump in the Oval Office in what was seen as a show of support from the White House ahead of the election.

Franziska Davies, assistant professor of Eastern and Central-Eastern European History at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, wrote that Nawrocki's win is “bad news for Poland, for Europe, for Ukraine, and for democracy.”

As the Financial Times reported, “Nawrocki ran a campaign centred on conservative Catholic values and rhetoric attacking the E.U.'s stance on migration and climate change.”

“The 42-year-old is a political ally of Hungary's premier Viktor Orbán and other Eurosceptic populists, and has suggested that he could seek to alter Poland's strongly pro-Ukraine stance, as one of the NATO alliance's most important Eastern members,” FT added. “While Poland's prime minister holds more political power, the president can block legislation, and nominates senior posts such as the central bank governor.”

Adam Simpson, senior lecturer in International Studies in Justice and Society at the University of South Australia, warned Monday that the ensuing “legislative gridlock could well see Law and Justice return to government in the 2027 general elections, which would lock in the anti-democratic changes the party made during their last term in office from 2015–2023.”

“This included eroding Poland's judicial independence by effectively taking control of judicial appointments and the Supreme Court,” Simpson added. “Nawrocki's win has given pro-Donald Trump, anti-liberal, anti-E.U. forces across the continent a shot in the arm. It's bad news for the E.U., Ukraine, and women.”

U.S. prices of steel and aluminum spiked on Monday while shares of foreign steelmakers slumped after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would double tariffs on imports of the two metals to 50 per cent.

Trump announced on Friday the new steel and aluminum levies, which take effect on June 4, intensifying a global trade war just hours after he accused China of violating an agreement with the U.S. to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for critical minerals.

The U.S. is the world's largest steel importer, excluding the European Union, with a total of 26.2 million tons of steel imported in 2024, according to the Department of Commerce.

Trump says he will double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%

While some industry experts questioned whether the tariffs would be implemented as stated, in light of Trump's previous reversals, they said uncertainty and climbing prices of the metals would dampen industrial activity.

“Higher prices are also likely to weigh further on U.S. steel demand from the manufacturing sector, which we already expect to contract this year,” said analyst Eoin Dinsmore at Goldman Sachs.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he's going to double the tariff rate on steel to 50 per cent, a dramatic increase that could further push up prices for a metal used to make housing, autos and other goods.

The Associated Press

The premium for consumers buying aluminum on the physical market in the United States jumped 54 per cent, while U.S. hot rolled coil steel climbed 7.4 per cent.

Copper prices also surged as traders bet that Trump would impose hefty duties on the metal used in power and construction. U.S copper touched a near two-month peak, widening its premium over benchmark London prices.

Germany's second-biggest steelmaker Salzgitter warned that Washington's tariff policy was dealing a severe blow to European industry.

The U.S. accounted for around a fifth of European steel exports outside of the EU, according to Germany's steel association.

“The risk for the European market, as well as other regional markets, is that some of the trade flow could reroute,” said Bastian Synagowitz at Deutsche Bank.

Analysts were skeptical whether the full force of the tariffs as announced on Friday would come into play.

“I think the final result will be far lower than initially projected, especially concerning its duration,” said Chelsea Ye, senior analyst at metals research firm McCloskey.

Meanwhile, the tariff shift was applauded by U.S. producers of aluminum, used in transport, packaging and construction, who said the move would stop a “flood” of imports.

“For decades, subsidized foreign producers have hollowed out domestic aluminum manufacturing,” said Mark Duffy, president of the American Primary Aluminum Association.

Shares of U.S. steelmakers climbed in early Wall Street trading, with Nucor, Cleveland-Cliffs and Steel Dynamics surging between 11 per cent and 24 per cent.

Shares of steelmakers fell in South Korea, which was the fourth-biggest exporter of steel to the U.S. last year, behind Canada, Mexico and Brazil, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data.

South Korea's Industry Ministry said in a statement that it had held an emergency meeting with officials from the country's major steelmakers, including POSCO and Hyundai Steel .

Shares of POSCO and Hyundai Steel fell 3 per cent, while those of South Korean peer SeAH Steel Corp tumbled 8 per cent.

In Vietnam, steel companies Hoa Sen Group, Nam Kim Steel and Vietnam Steel Corp dropped between 2.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent.

The 50 tariffs will add to the challenges facing Korean steel exporters, which have refrained from sharply boosting exports to the U.S. to avoid Washington's scrutiny, despite rising U.S. steel prices, an industry executive told Reuters.

“It will be a burden to exporting companies if there are no additional steel price increases in the U.S,” he told Reuters, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Steel and aluminum tariffs were among the earliest Trump imposed when he returned to office in January. Tariffs of 25 per cent on most steel and aluminum imported to the U.S. went into effect on March 12.

South Korea, a major U.S. ally, has called for an exemption from tariffs on steel, autos and others items, during talks with the United States.

Seoul agreed in late April to craft a trade package by the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's reciprocal tariffs in July, but it has been difficult for negotiators to make big decisions due to a political leadership vacuum ahead of elections on Tuesday.

In late March, Hyundai Steel announced a plan to build a US$5.8-billion factory in Louisiana in response to U.S. tariffs, but the factory will not open until 2029. In April, Hyundai Steel's bigger rival POSCO signed a preliminary deal to make an equity investment in the factory project.

In India, which relies heavily on the U.S. for aluminum exports, industry experts also warned of a major hit.

“This is going to have a detrimental impact,” B.K. Bhatia, director-general at the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the country's leading mining body, told Reuters.

“The U.S. is the biggest market for Indian aluminum. Government has been negotiating so we are hopeful that with talks, the tariffs will come down.”

Editor's note: The story is being updated.

The Ukrainian and Russian delegations concluded peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, agreeing on a new prisoners of war (POWs) exchange but failing to reach a ceasefire.

The talks, hosted by Turkish officials, follow the first round of negotiations on May 16. The initial meeting ended with an agreement on the largest prisoner exchange of the war, but without any tangible progress toward a peace deal.

The parties agreed to conduct a major swap, which will include severely injured and young people aged 18 to 25. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the next prisoner exchange would feature at least 1,000 people on each side, and might reach a 1,200-for-1,200 swap that would possibly also include imprisoned journalists and political prisoners held in Russia.

After the talks, Russia pledged to transfer 6,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers and officers to Ukraine and also proposed a ceasefire for two or three days in some areas of the front line in order to retrieve the bodies of the fallen soldiers. 

Zelensky said that only 15% of the mentioned 6,000 are identified and that Ukraine would need to check that the bodies Russia is willing to return are those of Ukrainian soldiers.

"We had instances when they returned bodies that later were identified as their own," Zelensky said on June 2.

Kyiv also handed over to the Russian delegation a list of 339 children abducted by Russia, and Moscow passed over its memorandum of proposals for a ceasefire. Ukraine submitted its document on May 28.

Following the talks, the Kyiv Independent obtained the text of the peace proposals that Ukraine presented to Russia in Istanbul.

According to the document, the Ukrainian delegation offered Moscow a complete ceasefire, the exchange of prisoners of war in an "all-for-all format," bringing back the children abducted by Russia, and the release of all civilians from Russian captivity.

Ukraine called for guarantees that would prevent Russia from repeating its aggression, as well as the involvement of the international community to achieve this.

According to Ukraine's proposal seen by the Kyiv Independent, Ukraine will continue on its path toward joining the EU and will become a member of NATO if there is consensus within the alliance.

Ukraine is also ready to agree to the gradual lifting of some sanctions against Russia, but with a mechanism for their renewal if necessary. Frozen Russian assets, in turn, should be used to restore Ukraine and pay reparations.

Umerov was leading Ukraine's 14-member delegation, which includes several figures from Ukraine's military, human rights, and legal sectors who did not take part in the May 16 negotiations.

Before meeting with Russian officials, Umerov held a bilateral meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Suspilne reported.

Russian delegates were led by Medinsky, who represented Moscow both during the first unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul in 2022 and then again in May this year.

Russia has not officially submitted its memorandum outlining peace terms, but Ukraine plans to present a detailed roadmap aimed at securing a lasting settlement.

Before the talks, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia and Ukrainian delegation member Oleksandr Bevz met representatives from Germany, Italy, and the U.K. to coordinate their positions, Tykhyi said on X.

"Members of the Ukrainian delegation reiterated Ukraine's commitment to peace efforts. They elaborated on the items of the agenda, which include leaders' meeting, a full ceasefire, and humanitarian confidence-building measures," he added.

Security advisors from the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany also plan to attend the talks, according to U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.

While the U.S. and Ukraine have pushed for an unconditional ceasefire, the Kremlin has rejected it.

Instead, Moscow has regularly voiced maximalist demands that are unlikely to be accepted by Kyiv, such as recognition of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian regions and withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the parts of these regions remaining under Kyiv's control.

Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's reluctance to make concessions and its intensifying and deadly attacks on Ukraine. He has so far refused to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

The talks are taking place only a day after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched a mass drone attack against Russian air bases, allegedly hitting 41 Russian bombers and disabling 34% of Russia's cruise missile air fleet.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman charged with multiple felonies after allegedly shouting ‘Free Palestine' as he attacked Boulder crowd

A man has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple other felonies after he allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to attack a crowd of people who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza, injuring eight.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is alleged to have shouted “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowd on Sunday. The FBI said Soliman told police he planned the attack for a year and had specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the Associated Press reported.

Soliman was booked into Boulder county jail on Sunday and has a hearing scheduled for 1.30pm local time on Monday.

An FBI affidavit said Mohammed Soliman – upon confessing to Sunday's attack after his arrest – told the police he would do it again.

Officials said there was no indication that the attack was associated with any group. NBC reported Soliman was an Egyptian national, and the White House claimed Soliman was in the US without legal status.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old, including a woman that a Department of Justice official said was a survivor of the Holocaust, were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said, with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, close to the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group which aims to draw attention to the people taken hostage following Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel.

Soliman is alleged to have thrown a device into a group of people who had assembled in a pedestrianized zone for the peaceful rally. The Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time on Sunday of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old University of Colorado student, told Reuters she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, Coffman said.

She said she saw a man whom she presumed to be the attacker holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

“Everybody is yelling: ‘Get water, get water,'” Coffman said.

Alex Osante, from San Diego, told the Associated Press he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In a video of the scene filmed by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had been burned during the attack.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a molotov cocktail but appeared to accidentally set himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

The justice department said one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor.

“She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,” said Leo Terrell, a senior counsel on civil rights in the justice department. “This is all caused by the same type of hatred: antisemitism.” Terrell, who leads the Trump administration's antisemitism taskforce, was criticized in March after he shared a post by a white supremacist.

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, identified Soliman as the lone suspect.

“It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek told a press conference, citing witnesses.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, described the incident as a “targeted terror attack”, and Colorado's attorney general, Phil Weiser, said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted”.

Soliman is due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time on Monday, according to Boulder county jail records. He is being held on a $10m bond. Law enforcement officials said Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

On his Truth Social platform Monday, Donald Trump said the attack “will not be tolerated in the United States of America”. The US president also said acts of terrorism “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.

In a post on X, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, described Soliman as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed his tourist visa. Miller criticized Joe Biden's presidential administration, whom he said had given Soliman a work permit.

CNN, citing law enforcement officials, reported that Soliman arrived in the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump's presidency.

Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005.

Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”.

In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman's presence in the US to “Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was “illegally in our country”.

“He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said.

The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Israel's war in Gaza, which in the US has spurred both an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes.

It follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Donald Trump's administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel's war on Gaza have taken place.

Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. It is still holding 58 hostages in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be still alive. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement that the Colorado victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law”.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is alleged to have shouted ‘Free Palestine' as he attacked crowd in Boulder, in what the FBI is treating as an ‘act of terrorism'

U.S. President Donald Trump was not informed in advance about Ukraine's mass drone attack that allegedly hit 41 Russian aircraft across four air bases, CBS News and Axios reported on June 1, citing their undisclosed sources.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) operation, dubbed "Spiderweb," allegedly destroyed or damaged A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3 planes parked at the Belaya, Diaghilev, Olenya, and Ivanovo air bases on June 1.

Kyiv has claimed it had disabled 34% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet in what is seen as one of the most daring operations during the full-scale war. The strike reportedly involved 117 drones launched from trucks hidden across Russian territory.

The White House was not notified about the plans, which had been being prepared for a year and a half, Axios reported, citing a Ukrainian security official. CBS News' sources in the Trump administration also confirmed that the Trump administration was not informed.

Trump is yet to comment publicly on the attack, which took place a day before the second round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul.

The U.S. president has repeatedly criticized Moscow for launching attacks on Ukrainian cities as he pushes for a ceasefire deal. The Kremlin continues to reject the truce backed by Kyiv, Washington, and European partners, and is reportedly preparing a new offensive this summer.

Trump has also often criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky, claiming that Ukraine is at times "more difficult" to deal with than Russia. The two came into an open clash during a tense meeting in the White House on Feb. 28.

Zelensky has urged the U.S. president to impose stronger sanctions against Russia if the upcoming round of negotiations fails to bring results.

"If the Istanbul meeting brings nothing, that clearly means strong new sanctions are urgently needed — from the EU's 18th package, and from the United States specifically, the strongest sanctions President Trump promised," Zelensky said.

Trump said on May 28 that the U.S. would soon know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about ending the war. If not, he warned, Washington would "respond a little bit differently."

The U.S. president said he had not yet imposed new sanctions on Russia because he believed a peace deal might be within reach. "If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that," he said, but added he is prepared to act if Moscow stalls further.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information

An operation by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) using first-person-view (FPV) drones smuggled deep inside Russian and hidden inside trucks has hit 41 Russian heavy bombers at four airfields across the country, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on June 1.

The operation — codenamed "Spiderweb" and a year-and-a-half in the planning — appears to have dealt a major blow to the aircraft Moscow uses to launch long-range missile attacks on Ukraine's cities.

"The SBU first transported FPV drones to Russia, and later, on the territory of the Russian Federation, the drones were hidden under the roofs of mobile wooden cabins, already placed on trucks," the source said.

"At the right moment, the roofs of the cabins were opened remotely, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers."

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

"Currently, more than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22 M3," the source added.

The SBU later reported that the drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile carriers in key Russian airbases.

The agency said that more details will be revealed soon. Also, they vowed to continue to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory.

“We will strike them (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we'll get them from underground too,” the SBU said.

A video provided by the source shows what appears to be a row of heavy bomber aircraft on fire at one of the airbases.

Unconfirmed videos posted on social media show FPV drones being launched from trucks parked near the airfields.

Irkutsk Oblast Governor Igor Kobzev later confirmed "a drone attack on a military unit in the village of Sredny" and said the "source" of the drones was a "truck."

Murmansk Governor Andrey Chibis later confirmed that "enemy drones have attacked the territory of the Murmansk region" but gave no further details.

Later on June 1, Russia's Defense Ministry acknowledged what it described as a "terrorist attack" on the four air bases and said "several units of aircraft caught fire" at Murmansk and Irkutsk.

Ukraine has long-struggled to target the Russian bombers used to launch mass missile targets against Ukrainian cities, as Moscow has kept them out of range of weapons Kyiv has developed itself as well as those supplied by its Western allies. 

The use of FPV drones in such a way would mark just the latest stage in the ever-evolving and still relatively fledgling world on drone warfare.

The attack was also likely highly cost effective — FPV drones can be bought for a just a few hundred dollars each but the cost of 41 heavy bombers runs into the billions.

The source said that those behind the operation have "been in Ukraine for a long time."

"So, if the Putin regime demonstratively detains someone, it will be another staged performance for the domestic audience," they said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky and SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk personally oversaw the operation, they added.

On the evening of June 1, Zelensky described the operation as "brilliant," adding that Russia suffered "significant losses — entirely justified and deserved."

"What's most interesting, and this can now be stated publicly, is that the 'office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions," he said in a post on social media.

"In total, 117 drones were used in the operation with a corresponding number of drone operators involved," he added.

It's genuinely satisfying when something I authorized a year and six months ago comes to fruition and deprives Russians of over forty units of strategic aviation. We will continue this work.

Maliuk publicly confirmed on June 2 the details of the attack, including successful hits against 41 planes parked at the four aforementioned air bases. The SBU chief stressed that "our strikes will last exactly as long as Russia keeps terrorizing Ukrainians with missiles and Shahed drones."

Russia "thought that it could bomb Ukraine and endlessly kill Ukrainians with impunity. But that is not the case. We will respond to Russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere - at sea, in the air, and on land," Maliuk added.

In March, Ukraine announced it had developed a new drone with a range of 3,000 kilometers but gave no details about its type, its name, the size of its warhead, or when it would go into mass production.

But even this long-range drone would not be capable of reaching some of the air bases hit in the operation.

The A-50 provides several critical functions for the ongoing war in Ukraine, such as detecting air defense systems, guided missiles, and coordinating targets for Russian fighter jets. 

Russia possesses fewer than ten of these planes. A-50 aircraft have an estimated price tag of around $350 million.

The  Tupolev Tu-95, the Tupolev Tu-22, as well as the Tupolev Tu-160, are all Russian heavy bombers regularly used to launch missiles at Ukrainian cities.

The Tu-95 is the oldest of the three aircraft, a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

It features turboprop engines rather than jet engines, as during the Cold War, their increased efficiency allowed it to fly all the way to the United States without refueling.

The Tu-22 carries the Kh-22 missiles, which pose a particular problem for Ukraine. It is supersonic and travels at around 4,000 kilometers per hour. 

Currently, it can only be shot down with the U.S.-made Patriot air defense system and potentially the SAMP-T, a joint Italian-French system.

The Tu-160 is Russia's more modern strategic bomber, entering service in 1987. To this day, it remains the largest operational bomber in the world.

It can carry a total of 12 Kh-55 missiles and up to 24 Kh-15s.

Mohamed Soliman, who faces potential murder charges, said he targeted what he described as the ‘Zionist group', according to several media reports

Suspect charged with multiple felonies in attack on Colorado rally for Israeli hostages

The FBI have said the man charged in the attack in Boulder, Colorado, that left eight people injured told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”.
 An FBI affidavit says Mohammed Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again, the Associated Press reports.
 The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the justice department earlier today.
 The group that was targeted had gathered in a popular pedestrian park in Boulder to draw attention to the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

The Islamic Center of Boulder has condemned the “targeted violence” of yesterday's attack. “Such actions have no place in the Boulder community,” the center said in a statement today.

The statement reads:

Hate and violence oppose our values and are a threat to all Americans. We call on our neighbors to focus on supporting the victims of this terrible attack, and to reject those who would use this horrible incident to divide our community.

Every individual and every community has the constitutional right to peaceful assembly and free expression. These fundamental freedoms must be respected and safeguarded for everyone, regardless of their views or background.

Earlier this morning, Colorado attorney general Phil Weiser said the Boulder attack was “very cruel” and has “every single hallmark of being a hate crime”.

“This was a peaceful march done every single week by the Jewish community, calling out the injustices of the hostages, and they were attacked because of who they are,” he said on MSNBC. “It is heart-wrenching for all of us in Colorado.”

“It is repulsive,” said Weiser, who is Jewish, of the violence. “It's got to be condemned. There's no possible justification for this.”

Donald Trump has said the suspect in the Boulder attack would be prosecuted to “to the fullest extent of the law” and stressed the need for his deportation policies, saying the suspect “must go”.

“Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “He must go out under ‘TRUMP' Policy.”

Here's the full post:

Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America. He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in yesterday's attack in Boulder, Colorado, on a crowd who were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza has been charged with a hate crime, CNN is reporting citing an affidavit filed today.

He was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin”, CNN quotes the affidavit as saying.

Donald Trump's administration has asked the supreme court to halt a judicial order blocking mass job cuts and the restructuring of agencies, Reuters reports.

The justice department's request came after San Francisco-based US district judge Susan Illston blocked large-scale federal layoffs, known as “reductions in force,” in a 22 May ruling siding with a group of unions, non-profit groups and local governments that challenged the administration.

The case involves the departments of agriculture, commerce, health and human services, state, treasury and veterans affairs, among others.

Trump directed federal agencies in February to “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force” as part of his administration's restructuring plans.

Illston wrote in her ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering the downsizing. “As history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,” Illston wrote.

Illston on 9 May had initially blocked about 20 agencies from making mass layoffs for two weeks and ordered the reinstatement of workers who had lost their jobs. She continued most of that relief in her 22 May ruling.

The San Francisco-based 9th US circuit court of appeals in a 2-1 ruling on 30 May denied the Trump administration's request to halt the judge's ruling.

The 9th Circuit said the administration had not shown that it would suffer an irreparable injury if the judge's order remained in place and that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in their lawsuit. “The executive order at issue here far exceeds the president's supervisory powers under the Constitution,” the 9th Circuit wrote, calling the administration's actions “an unprecedented attempted restructuring of the federal government and its operations.”

Trump's administration has sought relief from the supreme court in a growing number of cases following rulings by lower courts impeding various policies since he returned to office in January.

Police found 16 additional molotov cocktails in the area where the Boulder attack suspect was spotted, CNN is reporting citing multiple law enforcement sources.

The suspect arrived in the area of the incident around 1pm local time and lingered there before throwing two incendiary devices, according to multiple law enforcement sources. He was wearing a utility vest over his shirt and was carrying a garden sprayer filled with gasoline, sources said.

Many witnesses said he looked like a gardener, officials added. He used the garden sprayer as the ‘makeshift flamethrower', apparently, by spraying gasoline in the direction of the marchers while holding a lighter in front of the stream of fuel, sources said.

Investigators believe he stopped at gas stations in the area before the attack to fill the bottles and the garden sprayer.

Witnesses said the suspect took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. He was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.

Democratic senator Chris Murphy has launched a new political action committee to help fund groups that are organizing opposition to the Trump administration.

The group, American Mobilization Pac, plans to spend $400,000 to organizations that oppose cuts to Medicaid and register young people to vote. The group expects to spend upwards of $2m in the 2026 midterm cycle, Politico reports.

In an interview with the outlet, Murphy said his Pac is unique because it is not focused on funding campaigns and instead is looking to mobilize people against Trump's agenda. He said:

All of us have to realize that if we don't act aggressively right now to organize and mobilize, we may not have our democracy in 2026. I'm a believer that the only thing that is ultimately going to stop Trump's corruption and his destruction of democracy is mass mobilization.

The Boulder police department has released a mugshot of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who has been charged with multiple felonies related to the Sunday attack at an event in Boulder, Colorado to raise attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza.

At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics across seven states have shuttered since the start of 2025 or have announced plans to close soon – closures that come amid immense financial and political turbulence for the reproductive health giant as the United States continues to grapple with the fallout from the end of Roe v Wade.

The Planned Parenthood network, which operates nearly 600 clinics through a web of independent regional affiliates and is overseen by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, is facing a number of threats from the Trump administration.

A Guardian analysis has found that Planned Parenthood closures have occurred or are in the works across six affiliates that maintain clinics in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Utah and Vermont.

In late March, the Trump administration suddenly froze tens of millions of dollars in funding for nine Planned Parenthood affiliates, including at least two that have since closed clinics or are set to do so soon.

The funding, which flowed from the federal family planning program Title X, was used to provide services such as contraception, cancer screenings and STI tests.

Donald Trump is expected to have a direct conversation with Chinese president Xi Jinping in the coming days after his outburst last week accusing Beijing of “totally violating” an interim trade deal reached by the two countries in Geneva last month. According to CNBC the call will come “very soon” but probably not today.

Politico had also reported this morning that cabinet members confirmed yesterday that trade talks with China had slowed but had also hinted at the Trump-Xi conversation likely taking place this week. “That's our expectation,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said a call should come “very soon”, telling CBS that China has slow-walked a critical minerals agreement – which was also cited by US trade representative Jamieson Greer last week.

A man used a makeshift flamethrower to set people on fire in a terror attack at a pro-Israel demonstration in Colorado on Sunday.

The FBI and local police are investigating after at least eight people, aged between 67 and 88, were injured in the attack at the busy Pearl Street Mall area about 1.30pm local time (7.30pm GMT).

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, told reporters that one of the victims is understood to be an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor.

“We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,” FBI director Kash Patel said.

The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was arrested at the scene after using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set demonstrators on fire.

Police officers were seen pinning the suspect to the ground before arresting him. He was taken to hospital.

The FBI said it was investigating the attack as terrorism, while the White House said on Sunday that the suspect was living in the country illegally and was granted a work permit by Joe Biden's administration.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien,” Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said.

“He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden administration, and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden administration gave him a work permit.”

But Steve Redfearn, Boulder's police chief, refused to call the incident a terror attack.

“We are not calling it a terror attack at this point,” Mr Redfearn said. “It is way too early. It would be irresponsible for me to speculate right now on motive and other things.”

Demonstrators with the volunteer group Run For Their Lives, consisting of Jewish community members, had gathered in the mall to call for the release of Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

Mr Redfearn said police were investigating whether the demonstrators were targeted. It was unclear whether they were among the injured victims.

“There was a group of pro-Israel people that were there in a peaceful demonstration, I wouldn't even call it a protest. I believe that [the demonstration] happens frequently down here,” he said.

“We are looking and actively interviewing victims and witnesses to determine whether that group was targeted or others.”

FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said the victims were taken to hospitals, many of whom suffered from burns.

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” he said.

Video of the aftermath of the attack showed Mr Soliman, wearing sunglasses and holding clear spray bottles, pacing as a fire on the grass burned in front of him.

He shouted “end Zionists”, “Palestine is free”, and “they are killers” towards several people as they tended to a person lying on the ground.

At one point, he was confronted by onlookers, including one who said: “He is spraying alcohol... he is making Molotov cocktails.”

Other videos showed victims lying motionless on the ground as bystanders rushed to douse them with water.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old student at the University of Colorado, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs.

She said one woman appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone.

“Everybody [was] yelling, ‘get water, get water',” she said.

Mr Redfearn said officers raced to the scene after receiving reports that people had been set on fire.

“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said.

“When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims who were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”

The popular pedestrian mall is known for attracting tourists and college students.

People were told to evacuate the area due to the “active incident”.

Mr Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable”.

“I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” he wrote on X.

“While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation. More information will be provided as it becomes available.”

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that it was “aware of reports of an attack at today's Boulder Run for Their Lives event”.

The group said the event was a “weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages” who were seized during Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, sparking the war in Gaza.

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in New York, Danny Danon, condemned the attack.

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,” he said in a statement.

“Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing Molotov cocktails at them,” he said.

“Make no mistake – this is not a political protest, this is terrorism.”

The attack comes a week after two Israeli embassy staff were shot dead as they left a reception for diplomats near Washington's Jewish museum.

Elias Rodriguez, 30, was arrested after allegedly shooting Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were soon to be engaged.

He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He was also charged with murder of foreign officials, causing death with a firearm, and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.

17:35 JST, June 2, 2025

NEW DELHI, June 2 (Reuters) – The head of a global airlines industry body said on Monday that growing trade barriers risked damaging the economy and the air travel sector, and “unacceptable” plane delivery delays were frustrating growth plans at a time of record passenger numbers.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) shaved a key forecast for 2025 industry-wide profits, blaming trade tensions and declining consumer confidence.

“Like all forms of connectivity, flying makes the world more prosperous,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said at the group's annual meeting in New Delhi.

“That stands in contrast to isolationism, trade barriers and the fragmentation of the multilateral rules-based system. These destroy wealth and lower living standards. For the times we live in, this is an important message,” he said.

Sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have stoked fears of an economic slowdown and squeezed discretionary spending, prompting many consumers especially in the United States to delay or scale back travel plans.

They also threaten a decades-old pact between more than 30 countries to eliminate duties on aircraft and their parts.

While Walsh said there was no indication aircraft prices had increased due to tariffs, he said airlines would resist any attempt by aerospace manufacturers to raise prices and called for governments to “keep aerospace out of trade wars.”

IATA represents some 300 airlines accounting for more than 80% of global traffic.

On environmental sustainability, Walsh said progress was not what it should be at this point in time. He criticized energy firms for not producing enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is made from waste oil and biomass and costs more than conventional jet fuel.

IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will struggle to meet their sustainability goals, but Walsh said the aviation industry was still aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF.

More people are flying than ever before after a post-pandemic passenger market recovery, but airline growth is being hampered by extended plane delivery delays and supply chain bottlenecks driving up maintenance and repair time.

Walsh called predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade “off-the-chart unacceptable.” He said the airline industry was evaluating legal options over the delays, but it preferred to work with manufacturers collaboratively.

“The manufacturing sector is failing badly,” he said.

IATA said the number of deliveries scheduled for 2025 was 26% less than what was promised a year ago, although at 1,692 this would be the highest number of new planes since 2018.

“Further downward revisions are likely, given that supply chain issues are expected to persist in 2025 and possibly to the end of the decade,” IATA said in the update to its industry outlook.

Tim Clark, president of the world's largest international airline, Dubai's Emirates, said on Sunday that the pandemic was no longer an acceptable excuse for delivery delays and challenged planemakers to take responsibility.

Similar frustration was voiced by Saudi budget carrier flyadeal.

“Delays are becoming inexcusable. Transparency, to be frank, is lacking, and we're getting agitated. How else can we plan? I mean it is just going beyond a joke now,” flyadeal CEO Steven Greenway told Reuters.

U.S. planemaker Boeing BA.N is trying to stabilize and ramp up production after a quality crisis and a labor strike slowed output last year.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Europe's Airbus AIR.PA has been warning airlines it faces another three years of delivery delays.

Despite the challenges, carriers are still looking to purchase more planes to ensure they can meet future travel demand.

Tata Group's Air India is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a major new aircraft order including some 200 extra single-aisle planes, topping up a mammoth deal in 2023 as the former state carrier pursues a multi-billion-dollar revamp, Reuters reported on Sunday.

            Mongolia has been thrown into fresh political crisis with protesters calling for the resignation of the country's prime minister over his family's lavish displays of wealth.
    


            For two weeks, young Mongolians have taken to the streets of the capital putting pressure on Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai who will face a vote of confidence in his government on Monday.
    


            Democratic Mongolia is a landlocked nation of just 3.5 million people sandwiched between authoritarian giants China and Russia, and the latest political crisis has put renewed scrutiny on the stability of the country's democracy.
    


            Here's what to know:
    


            The protests were triggered by social media posts that went viral showing the prime minister's 23-year-old son's lavish engagement proposal and their apparent extravagant lifestyle including helicopter-rides, an expensive ring, designer handbags and a luxury car.
    


            Suspicion grew over how the son accumulated such wealth – especially as Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene campaigned on being from a rural, not wealthy family.
    


            “With no visible sources of income, their display of luxury bags, private travel, and high-end living was a blatant slap in the face to the average Mongolian citizen,” said Amina, 28, a member of protest group Ogtsroh Amarhan (Resigning is Easy).
    


            Amina, who wanted to go by one name for security reasons, said the protests go beyond the social media posts flaunting wealth, which she said were symptomatic of a widening disconnect between the ruling elite and everyday people.
    


            Deepening the anger is the rising cost of living, soaring inflation in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine, and choking pollution in the capital that's home to half the population.
    


            “The cost of living in Mongolia has skyrocketed — many people are paying nearly half of their monthly income in taxes while barely making enough to cover food, rent, or utilities. Most are not living paycheck to paycheck anymore — they're living loan to loan, debt to debt,” she said.
    


            Protesters have gathered in the capital Ulaanbaatar's central Sükhbaatar Square, in front of the Government Palace, almost daily for two weeks, calling for Oyun-Erdene to release his finances and resign.
    


            The Prime Minister's office called the allegations of financial impropriety “completely unfounded.”
    


            “The prime minister makes regular financial declarations annually in line with Mongolian law,” the office said in a statement to CNN.
    


            For decades, Mongolia has struggled with endemic graft and protests often break out over allegations that corrupt officials and business leaders were enriching themselves with public funds.
    


            Mass protests erupted in 2022 over a corruption scandal involving the alleged embezzlement of billions of dollars' worth of coal destined for China.
    


            Though analysts say there is no evidence of corruption by Oyun-Erdene, his son's social media posts deepened the frustration of a public long wary of their elected officials misusing public resources.
    


            “I want a fair society where ordinary people have a voice, and where government officials are held accountable. Seeing so much inequality, injustice, and arrogance from those in power pushed me to speak up,” said Ariunzaya Khajidmaa, 23, a resident of Ulaanbaatar who joined the protests with her 2-month-old baby.
    


            Part of public frustration is that even when corruption cases are prosecuted, they are slow to work their way through the judicial system, leading some to question the independence of the judiciary.
    


            The 2024 Freedom House index said “corruption and political influence in the daily work of judges remain concerns.”
    


            “If you look at the corruption index, it has gone down. And one explanation is that, even though the Prime Minister has exposed a lot of the corruption cases, nothing has been done. So now everybody's looking at the judiciary,” said Bolor Lkhaajav, a Mongolian political analyst and commentator.
    


            The Prime Minister is trying to save his coalition government and parliament, called the State Great Khural, is holding a vote of confidence on Monday.
    


            Oyun-Erdene and his son have submitted themselves to Mongolia's anti-corruption agency and the prime minister said he would resign if the investigation uncovered any irregularities.
    


            His Mongolian People's Party (MPP) is the largest in the 126-seat parliament, holding 68 seats. But complicating the confidence vote is that the ruling coalition appears to be breaking up. The MPP kicked out its junior partner, the Democratic Party – which controls 43 seats – after some of its members supported the protesters.
    


            The protests are just “the tip of the iceberg,” said Jargalsaikhan Dambadarjaa, a Mongolian broadcaster and political commentator, who pointed to some of the major economic shifts in the country.
    


            Oyun-Erdene, who was re-elected to a second term in 2024, had promised to diversify the country's economy, which is dependent on the mining industry accounting for about a quarter of GDP.
    


            Mongolia has huge deposits of coal, copper, gold and phosphorite, and about 90% of Mongolia's coal exports go to China.
    


            Oyun-Erdene's coalition government last year announced 14 new mega projects to boost economic growth, including cross-border railway connections and a major expansion of renewable energy.
    


            And one of Oyun-Erdene's signature policy centerpieces was establishing a national wealth fund, which the government said aimed to redistribute the country's assets to the people.
    


            The Sovereign Wealth Fund law, approved by parliament in April, allows the government to take a 34% stake in mines considered to have strategic mineral deposits, meaning they are vital for the country's economy and development.
    


            There are currently 16 such sites and the profits will go into the fund, with portions allocated to benefitting Mongolian people including through financial assistance, healthcare, education, and housing, according to public broadcaster Montsame.
    


            The move has not sat well with the country's wealthy and powerful mining elite.
    


            “These people, they are now at the edge of losing their power - huge money - which created huge inequality in the country. So they are fighting to the death against this government,” said Jargalsaikhan.
    


            Mongolia has been a parliamentary democracy since its democratic revolution in 1991. But the years since have seen multiple governments toppled, or leaders shuffled.
    


            This instability has led some Mongolians to believe the powers of President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, who is head of state, should be extended. Currently, the president can only serve one six-year term.
    


            “In this mosaic, those who are supporting presidential power argue that, look at Russia and China, they are one-man presidential powers and they are very stable. They say, we tried this parliamentarian system and it looks like it doesn't work. That's their idea,” Jargalsaikhan said.
    


            Khurelsukh has repeatedly said he does not want to change Mongolia's parliamentary democracy. However, some believe amending the constitution to extend presidential term limits is on the table.
    


            “It's a very crucial time, a very delicate time, and it's another test to our democracy,” said Jargalsaikhan. “Freedom comes only with the parliamentary system… If we don't do that, we will be another failed economy, a failed nation.”
    


            In a statement, the prime minister's office said, “there has been a deliberate attempt to undermine” the reforms of the coalition government by a “hostile campaign” that would “turn Mongolia away from a parliamentary democracy and return power and wealth to a small group driven by self-interest.”
    


            Analysts say Mongolia needs to show it can have stable governance so it can attract broader foreign investment and reduce its economic dependence on China and Russia.
    


            Khurelsukh last year welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin for an official visit to Mongolia, a trip condemened by Ukraine. The visit was Putin's first to a member country of the International Criminal Court which had issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges on war crimes.
    


            “A lot of the governments that are looking at Mongolia as an oasis of democracy between Russia and China, so they want to trust us, but at the same time, you have to show some accountability and stability for other governments to say, okay, Mongolia is getting better,” said Bolor.
    


            Those on the streets say they are tired of political games and want to see tangible improvements to their daily lives.
    


            “We want stronger anti-corruption measures, public officials who are held to ethical standards, and a system that ensures no one is above the law,” said Ariunzaya.
    


            “It's time for the government to listen to its citizens and take meaningful, lasting action—not just offer words.”

            Ukrainian forces have destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes parked at air bases thousands of miles from the front lines, according to a source in the country's security services, in one of Kyiv's most audacious and sophisticated counter assaults since the beginning of the war.
    


            The operation, dubbed “Spiderweb,” saw drones hit targets across a large swathe of Russia, including in Belaya – which is closer to Japan than Ukraine – and at Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, according to the source.
    


            More than 40 Russian aircraft were “burning en masse” at four air bases, the source said.
    


            The SBU, Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency, said the strikes caused an estimated $7 billion in damages and hit 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers at its main air bases.
    


            The drone attacks came on the eve of expected peace talks in Istanbul between Russia and Ukraine, which were already strained by uncertainty and pressure from US President Donald Trump.
    


            The Trump administration was not given a heads-up about the operation, an administration official told CNN.
    


            The strikes appear intended to send a message to Russia that Ukraine could still apply pressure more than three years since Russia's unprovoked invasion. Kyiv has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of not wanting to end the war as Moscow ramps up its attacks and offensive operations, including launching its largest drone assault on Ukraine since the war began overnight Saturday.
    


            The operation, more than a year and a half in the making, involved drones being smuggled into Russian territory and hidden in wooden mobile houses atop trucks, according to the security source. The roofs were then remotely opened, and the drones deployed to launch their strikes.
    


            Social media video geolocated by CNN to seven kilometers southeast of the Belaya Air Base in Russia's eastern Irkutsk region, appears to show a drone flying out of a wooden shed loaded onto a truck as smoke rises in the background. Images also show drones stacked inside what appear to be wooden crates with retractable roofs ahead of the operation.
    


            “The planning, organization, and all the details were perfectly prepared. It can be confidently said that this was an absolutely unique operation,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X.
    


            Zelensky said 117 drones were used to carry out the attacks, which were played up as a military and propaganda win for Ukraine that caught Russia off-guard.

            “The ‘office' of our operation on Russian territory was located directly next to FSB headquarters in one of their regions,” Zelensky said on X.
    


            More than 40 aircraft were known to have been hit, according to the Security source, including TU-95 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers and one of Russia's few remaining A-50 surveillance planes.
    


            “We are doing everything to drive the enemy from our native land! We will strike them at sea, in the air, and on land. And if needed — we'll reach them even from underground,” the SBU said in a statement.
    


            A senior US defense official told CNN that Ukraine's attack showed a level of sophistication that they had not seen before.
    


            US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth received regular updates as he traveled to Joint Base Andrews on Sunday but has not yet spoken to his Ukrainian counterparts, the official said.
    


            The airfields targeted included Belaya in Irkutsk, some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia, and the Dyagilevo base in Ryazan in western Russia, about 520 kilometers (320 miles) from Ukraine, which is a training center for Russia's strategic bomber force.
    


            The Olenya base near Murmansk in the Arctic Circle, more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Ukraine, was also struck, according to the source, as well as the Ivanovo air base, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Ukraine. Ivanovo is a base for Russian military transport aircraft.
    


            The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed Ukraine had targeted Russian airfields across five regions on Sunday, calling the drone strikes “terrorist attacks.”
    


            The ministry said strikes were repelled in the Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions but that “several pieces of aircraft” caught fire after attacks in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions. It added that the fires had since been extinguished.
    


            There were no casualties as a result of the attacks, the ministry continued, adding that “some participants in the terrorist attacks have been detained.”
    


            The governor of Irkutsk region, Igor Kobzev, said that drones had been launched from a truck near the Belaya base.
    


            Kobzev said on Telegram that the exact number of drones deployed had not been determined. Emergency and security services were at the site, he added.
    


            SBU drones were targeting aircraft that bomb Ukrainian cities every night, the security source said.
    


            One video supplied by the source purportedly shows the Belaya airfield in flames and the voice of the head of the SBU, Lt. Gen. Vasyl Malyuk, commenting on the situation. “How beautiful Belaya airfield looks now. Enemy's strategic aircraft,” he says.
    


            CNN was able to confirm the location of that video, as well as two others posted on social media showing smoke rising from the Belaya air base. It was not immediately able to independently verify other videos provided by the SBU.
    


            The security source said that the operation was “extremely complicated from a logistical point of view,” with the drones carried inside wooden mobile homes that had been carried into Russia on trucks.
    


            “The drones were hidden under the roofs of the houses, which were already placed on trucks. At the right moment, the roofs were remotely opened, and the drones flew to hit Russian bombers.”
    


            One video purportedly of one attack appears to show drones rising from a truck, as vehicles pass on a nearby highway. Another image shows the roof of the truck on the ground.
    


            The source added that people involved were already back in Ukraine.
    


            Ukraine's operation followed a Russian attack overnight Saturday that involved 472 drones – Moscow's largest drone attack since the war began. It came the same day as a Russian missile strike on a training site used by Ukrainian forces, killing at least 12 people and wounding more than 60 others. It also came soon after two bridges collapsed in Russia's western regions bordering Ukraine in unclear circumstances.
    


            This chain of events comes as Russia and Ukraine are set to return to peace negotiations on Monday. The talks, which will take place in Istanbul, have been strained by uncertainty. US President Donald Trump has expressed frustration around Russian President Vladimir Putin's resistance to advancing the peace talks.
    


            Putin proposed holding “direct talks” in Turkey earlier this month – but never showed up, despite Zelensky agreeing to meet. In the end, the two nations sent low-level delegations to negotiate instead.
    


            A framework from the Ukrainian delegation lists key principles for the talks that include a full and unconditional ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, and the release of hostages and return of abducted children.

MOSCOW, June 2. /TASS/. The candidate of the opposition Law and Justice party Karol Nawrocki has won the second round of the Polish presidential election, gaining 50.9% of the vote after the State Election Commission processed all ballots, the TVP Info channel reported.

Rafal Trzaskowski, candidate of the ruling Civic Coalition and Mayor of Warsaw, received 49.1%.

The State Election Commission said on its website that the turnout of 71.63% was a record for a presidential election in Poland. The previous record of voter turnout stood at 68.23% and was recorded in 1995.

The second round of presidential elections was held in Poland on June 1.

Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has taken a narrow lead in the race to become the next president of Poland, but the final result is too close to call and won't be known until Monday. 

Mr. Nawrocki was projected to win 51 per cent of the vote according to two late exit poll released Sunday night that also took into account returns from several regions. A pair of earlier exit polls had given his centrist opponent, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, a slight lead, although those surveys did not include actual results. 

Ballot counting was expected to continue into Monday, but both candidates claimed victory Sunday night. 

“We won,” Mr. Trzaskowski told supporters at an election night gathering in a Warsaw museum. “This is a special moment in the history of Poland. I am convinced that this will allow us to move forward like a torpedo and focus primarily on the future.”

Mr. Nawrocki, who is backed by the populist Law and Justice party, or PiS, told his supporters that “we will win and save Poland. We have to win tonight and we know that we will.”

Poland's president is largely ceremonial, but oversees foreign policy, heads the military and can block legislation passed by parliament. 

If the two earlier polls are correct, Mr. Trzaskowski's win would be transformative for Poland's centrist government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk and a welcome relief for the European Union. 

It would also be a further rebuke of PiS, which ruled Poland for eight years until the party was ousted by Mr. Tusk's Civic Coalition in October, 2023. 

Mr. Tusk has blamed the current President, PiS supporter Andrzej Duda, for thwarting his legislative agenda, which includes liberalizing Poland's strict abortion laws and unwinding changes to the judiciary introduced by PiS. Mr. Duda was elected in 2015 and 2020, but he couldn't run for a third term. 

Mr. Trzaskowski is staunchly pro-EU. His victory would follow a week after Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan, another pro-EU candidate, won the presidential election in Romania – defeating ultranationalist George Simion, who threatened to weaken the country's role in the bloc. 

“Rafał Trzaskowski's victory will be of great importance for Donald Tusk's government, because it will unblock the legislative paralysis,” said Anna Siewierska, a political science professor at the University of Rzeszow. 

“Trzaskowski's election win will also be a clear strengthening of Poland's European course and, importantly, a guarantee of strong and unconditional support for Ukraine fighting Russia.”

But if Mr. Nawrocki wins, he is expected to block Mr. Tusk's reforms, Prof. Siewierska added. 

“Nawrocki is a staunch critic of the European Union, and many of his statements can be perceived as a real risk of Polexit,” she said, referring to Poland possibly leaving the EU. 

Mr. Trzaskowski, 53, has come to epitomize the modern, outward-looking Poland. 

The son of a jazz pianist, he speaks six languages, attended the University of Oxford and earned a doctorate in political science from Warsaw University where he wrote a thesis on “reforming the decision-making system of the European Union.”

He got involved in politics in 1989, when the country held its first free election since the fall of communism. He was a high school student at the time and campaigned for Solidarity, the trade-union movement that opposed Poland's communist leadership for years.

Mr. Trzaskowski served as a Member of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2013, and held a seat in the Polish parliament from 2015. He was elected mayor of Warsaw in 2018 and re-elected last year.

He has been a divisive figure nationally, and critics say his liberal values and support for causes such as LGBTQ rights has put him out of touch with ordinary Poles. 

The fact that Mr. Nawrocki, a political novice with a checkered background, is leading in late polls reflects the deep fractures in the country. Mr. Nawrocki, 42, ran on a platform that focused on Christian values, reducing immigration and fierce opposition to Mr. Tusk.

Despite his background as a soccer hooligan and a series of salacious allegations that he denies – including claims he procured prostitutes for guests while working as a security guard at a resort and swindled an elderly man out of his apartment – Mr. Nawrocki picked up support by tapping into the disgruntlement many Poles have for Mr. Tusk's government and their uncertainty about Mr. Trzaskowski. 

He also proudly sought the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump, who met Mr. Nawrocki in the White House in May. 

Prof. Siewierska said Poland has always had political divisions but that the polarization has become more pronounced in recent years. 

“This polarization is driven by two opposing narratives. One refers to history, tradition, Christianity, to some mythical greatness of Poland,” she said. 

“The second narrative refers more to the future, the concept of a common Europe, a secular state. These are two different stories, two different sets of values, two different emotions.”

She said both PiS and the Civic Coalition have fuelled the division. 

“In this election campaign, it turned out that for a large part of society, the truth no longer matters.”

A House Democratic lawmaker said that if Democrats retake control of the House of Representatives, they will likely issue a subpoena to former Trump administration special government employee and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Musk, who departed the administration last week in accordance with the expiration of his special government employee status, appeared alongside President Donald Trump in a news conference in the Oval Office on May 30. The tech billionaire played a key role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whose mission is to root out fraud and cut wasteful government spending. So far, it reports it has helped save taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, but aims to raise that to more than $1 trillion.

            • Next witnesses: The jury in Sean “Diddy” Combs' criminal trial has been dismissed for the day. Prosectors are expected to call Eddie Garcia, who worked in security at the InterContinental Hotel, to the stand tomorrow when court resumes. “Jane,” another of Combs' accusers, could testify as early as Wednesday.
    


            • The trial so far: It's the fourth week of testimony, and several witnesses have accused the music mogul of various forms of abuse. Over three days of testimony, “Mia,” a former assistant to Combs who used a pseudonym, described the abuse — verbal, physical and sexual — she said she experienced while working for him.
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Eddie Garcia, who worked in security at the InterContinental Hotel, is expected to take the stand tomorrow morning as prosecutors' next witness in the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs. Prosecutors said they expect to question Garcia for about 90 minutes.
    


            Prosecutor Maurene Comey said forensic video expert Frank Piazza, Combs employee Derek Ferguson and Bryana Bongolan, who previously accused Combs of sexual battery, are likely among the next witnesses to follow Garcia, but the order could change.
    


            Comey said “Jane,” another one of Combs' accusers who is using a pseudonym during the trial, could take the stand as early as Wednesday afternoon. The plan is to get Jane off the stand in plenty of time for an international flight she's scheduled to catch next Thursday, prosecutors said.
    


            Tomorrow, prosecutors in Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal criminal trial are expected to call an InterContinental Hotel employee to testify under an immunity order.
    


            Bringing in a witness under an immunity order could significantly help the prosecution's case against Combs, said Lisa Bonner, an entertainment lawyer and former litigator who is not involved in the case.
    


            The immunity order can indicate “a very reluctant witness coming forward,” Bonner said, adding that “when you are coming in and invoking your right to waive your fifth amendment right and get some type of immunity, that means, ‘Listen, I didn't want to be here and tell the story from the beginning.'”
    


            “Once one comes in under an immunity order, that is a great opportunity for the prosecution to really hone in on the fact that you are here reluctantly, we presume that you're telling the truth and you had something to lose by coming here,” she said.
    


            Bonner added that she thinks that'll be “a great opportunity for the prosecution to score some points with the jury.”
    


Remember: The InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles is where Combs was seen striking and dragging Cassie Ventura during a 2016 altercation, footage of which was previously shown to the jury during Ventura's testimony.
    


            Beverly Hills Hotel employee Sylvia Oken is off the stand. The defense team briefly cross-examined her, and prosecutors didn't have any questions for a redirect-examination.
    


            The jury has now been dismissed for the day.
    


            The jury saw two bills for Sean “Diddy” Combs' hotel stays addressed to an alias associated with his guest profile.
    


            One of them, from May 2015, included a $500 charge for “oil damage.”
    


            Another bill included a $300 charge for cleaning drapes, and a fee for going out to pick up five candles for Combs.
    


            Sylvia Oken, the director of sales and marketing at the Beverly Hills Hotel, said she recalled some reservations made for Sean “Diddy” Combs under the alias “Frank Black.”
    


            Oken said it's common for guests in the entertainment industry to stay at the hotel under an alias. She said the hotel's guest profiles contain both the celebrities' real names and their aliases.
    


            The jury also saw a hotel record that showed Cassie Ventura was listed as an accompanying guest on the reservation. She had full access to the reservation and could charge things to the room.
    


            Sylvia Oken, the area director of sales and marketing at the Beverly Hills Hotel, is on the stand now.
    


            She's a custodial witness for hotel records being admitted as evidence.
    


            Mia, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, has finished her testimony and is now off the stand.
    


            Mia, the former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified she thought no one would believe her if she reported to human resources the physical and sexual abuse she says she endured from the music mogul.
    


            When prosecutor Madison Smyser asked her about speaking to human resources, Mia  referenced a former employee who she said was fired after reporting Combs' abuse of his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura.
    


            “Human resources only punished me unjustly, also fired Kayla for even discussing Cassie's abuse. They wouldn't have believed me and I would've been fired immediately,” Mia said.
    


            Smyser asked Mia what she worried would happen if she disclosed that Combs had sexually assaulted her.
    


            “That I wouldn't be believed. I would be wiped out, I would be abused, fired, and somehow made out to look like I was, I was a crazy person making everything up,” Mia said.
    


            When asked, Mia reiterated her previous testimony that she didn't feel like she could've left her job with Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            “I would've been stripped of any credibility, would've lost — wouldn't have been able to get a job in the same or any industry that I wanted and would've lost anything I knew,” she said.
    


            When she tried to leave her job once, Combs' chief of staff told her to go back, Mia testified.
    


            Mia also testified again that she feared for her physical safety.
    


                    “I just knew his power and his wrath,” she said.
                





            Prosecutor Madison Smyser is going through several of Mia's social media posts that the jury saw during cross-examination.
    


            Mia confirmed that promoting the events and projects in those posts were part of her job.
    


            Smyser asked Mia what Sean “Diddy” Combs did when he thought she wasn't doing her job.
    


            “I would be screamed at, humiliated, made fun of, and my job would be threatened,” Mia said.
    


            Mia confirmed that posting for Combs' birthday was also part of her job, and if she didn't do it she would've been “in trouble.”
    


            Smyser referenced Mia's previous testimony that she created a scrapbook for Combs' birthday because she thought it would make him happy.
    


            “Why did you try to keep the person who abused you happy?” Smyser asked.
    


            “Because when he was happy, I was safe,” Mia said.
    


            Defense attorney Brian Steel has finished his cross examination of the former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs testifying under the pseudonym of Mia.
    


            Prosecutor Madison Smyser is now questioning Mia on re-direct examination.
    


            The jury was dismissed for a brief break.
    


            The attorneys are still in the courtroom discussing some issues regarding Mia's cross examination.
    


            Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said the prosecution will be reordering the upcoming witnesses to accommodate for a custodial witness who has a flight later today because Mia's cross-examination is much longer than expected.
    


            Defense attorney Brian Steel revisited Mia's testimony about the time Sean “Diddy” Combs slammed a door on her arm multiple times.
    


            Mia said that her arm was bruised but she didn't seek any medical treatment. “I wouldn't have been allowed,” she said.
    


            Mia said she didn't scream during the incident, even though it was in painful.
    


            “I was in shock,” she said.
    


            Defense attorney Brian Steel asked Mia a couple of questions about reporting the abuse she allegedly endured by Combs.
    


            The former assistant testified she didn't contact law enforcement about it.
    


            She also said “no” when Steel asked if she ever considered reporting the alleged abuse through a women's shelter, doing so anonymously or asking a third party to report it for her.
    


            Defense attorney Brian Steel asked Mia a series of questions about what she knew about Casandra Ventura's jealousy of other women Sean “Diddy” Combs dated.
    


            Mia said she didn't recall Ventura having specific jealousy of Kim Porter, who Combs shared three children with.  However, Mia said “I'm sure she wasn't thrilled” when Ventura learned Combs was dating other women behind her back.
    


            “He presented to her that they were exclusive,” Mia said.
    


            Defense attorney Brian Steel returned to the messages Mia sent in December 2016 after she learned Revolt Films, the Sean “Diddy” Combs-owned business she was working for at the time, would be shutting down. In those texts, Mia said her life was “over.”
    


                    “My entire world was being ripped away from me immediately,” Mia testified today. “And even if in hindsight that world was awful, I didn't know it at the time.”
                





            Steel asked if she wanted to continue working for Combs and his business at that time.
    


            “I wanted to continue following my dreams. I was finally making real stuff, and I had a separation from him,” Mia said.
    


            “Mia,” a former Combs employee testifying under a pseudonym, has been on the stand since this morning, answering questions under cross-examination about her experience working for Combs.
    


            Mia's testimony, which began last week, details allegations that she was physically and sexually assaulted by the music mogul multiple times during her employment from 2009 to 2017.
    


            This morning, Mia also testified about the control Combs held over her during her employment, saying she was “psychologically” under his grip and “terrified” of him.
    


            Her testimony could help the prosecution's case for a conviction on the sex trafficking charge, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Mark O'Mara, who is not involved in Combs' federal criminal trial, said.
    


            “In order to get the trafficking conviction, you have to show that coercion, that duress … The way that Mr. Combs did everything he did for a particular purpose,” O'Mara told CNN. “So they're bringing in all of these witnesses, including Mia now, to say, ‘This is the environment that Mr. Combs is responsible for and it was an environment of coercion.'”
    


            O'Mara added that prosecutors showing through testimony that “any type of force that has the effect of moving somebody towards a certain decision,” including “economic force” and “emotional force,” is where Mia's testimony becomes relevant.
    


            “She lays out that this was just the way it always was with me and with everybody that I saw with Mr. Combs,” O'Mara added.
    


Remember: Combs is facing two counts of sex trafficking, two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution and one count of racketeering conspiracy during his federal criminal trial.
    


            Mia testified she worked for music icon and social activist Madonna for about eight months after she stopped working for Sean “Diddy” Combs in 2017.
    


            At the time, Mia said she did not think Combs had “blacklisted” her.
    


Context: Mia testified during direct examination last week that she hasn't be able to work because she has severe PTSD.
    


                    “I would have to leave because I would be triggered by really normal situations with like an overwhelming sense of fear of being in trouble,” Mia said of when she tried to work.
                





            She also testified about being scared of Combs and thinking that if she left her job, she would never be able to get a job somewhere else.
    


            Defense attorney Brian Steel suggested that Mia was let go from Sean “Diddy” Combs' companies for alcohol use.
    


            Steel asked, “Isn't it true you were let go for failing to arrive on time and for drinking?”
    


            “Absolutely not,” Mia testified.
    


            Defense attorney Brian Steel asked Mia if she intended to sue Sean “Diddy” Combs, her former boss, based on the sexual assault allegations she has made against him.
    


            Mia testified that wasn't her intention.
    


            The defense attorney also asked Mia is she wanted money based on her testimony at trial. She said no.

President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax-break package.

Financial markets have remained skeptical, as the deficit continues to grow despite Trump's promises to curb spending.

Hey, Elijah. Thanks for submitting this question for AP's Washington Bureau Chief, Anna Johnson. Here's what she said:

Anna Johnson answers the question from a reader: How do you maintain journalistic integrity while covering the administration amid deep political divides and fast-changing events?



U.S. District Judge John Holcomb, who was appointed in 2019 by Trump, ruled that the administration is not providing due process rights to people it accuses of belonging to a Venezuelan gang against which Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law.

Holcomb temporarily halted removals of people in central California targeted under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He joins judges in New York, Texas, Colorado and Pennsylvania in temporarily freezing deportations under the act.

Holcomb did find that Trump's invocation of the act was proper. That's in contrast to some other judges who ruled it cannot be used against a gang.

The FBI says the suspect in an attack in Boulder, Colorado that injured six yelled “Free Palestine” and used a makeshift flamethrower.

Trump says the “horrific” attack in Boulder, Colorado, “WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America” and suggested it was the fault of his predecessor's immigration policies.

In a post on his social media site, Trump wrote, that the suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, “came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy” — even though the details surrounding Soliman aren't entirely clear.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after having entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. B2 is generally a non-immigrant, temporary tourist visa.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired.

Trump is “likely” to talk this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says.

The two leaders are slated to talk as trade tensions have intensified after both nations agreed in May to reduce tariffs for a 90-day negotiation period. But the U.S. is displeased with problems over China exporting critical minerals, while China is frustrated by U.S. efforts to limit their access to advanced computer chips.

Leavitt told reporters that the White House would provide a readout of the call between Trump and Xi.

Pennsylvania's two U.S. senators, Democrat John Fetterman and Republican David McCormick sat on Monday for 30 minutes to take questions from Shannon Bream, anchor of Fox News Sunday, at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston as part of an effort to promote bipartisanship.

They found it easy to agree on certain questions, such as foreign policy, and politely disagreed on others, including President Trump's tax breaks, spending cuts and border security bill.

Fetterman says he won't support cuts to Medicaid and food aid. McCormick stresses the need for tax relief, spending cuts and border security. But he also says they agree that the federal government shouldn't take benefits away from vulnerable people.

Fetterman and McCormick have struck up a friendship following McCormick's victory last November over longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, Fetterman's mentor in the Senate. Fetterman has had something of a warm embrace from Republicans over his ideological split with Democrats on Israel and border policy.

On foreign policy, both men are strong backers of Israel in its war against Hamas and preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, even if it means Israel striking Iran's nuclear facilities to destroy them.

The sequence of events is familiar: A lower court judge blocks a part of Trump's agenda, an appellate panel refuses to put the order on hold while the case continues and the Justice Department turns to the Supreme Court.

Trump administration lawyers have filed emergency appeals with the nation's highest court a little less than once a week on average since Trump began his second term.

The court is not being asked to render a final decision but rather to set the rules of the road while the case makes it way through the courts.

The justices have issued orders in 11 cases so far, and the Trump administration has won more than it has lost.

Among the administration's victories was an order allowing it to enforce the Republican president's ban of on transgender military service members. Among its losses was a prohibition on using an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans alleged to be gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The most recent emergency filing arrived May 27.

The only thing on Trump's schedule today, according to the White House, is lunch with Vice President JD Vance at 1 p.m.

The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that's languished for years.

The visit comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project.

While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that “recognizes Alaska's unique value.”

Conservative legal activist Leonard Leo helped Trump transform the federal judiciary in his first term. He closely advised Trump on his Supreme Court picks and is widely credited as the architect of the conservative majority responsible for overturning Roe v. Wade.

But Trump last week lashed out at Leo, blaming his former adviser and the group Leo used to head for encouraging him to appoint judges who are now blocking his agenda.

Trump's broadsides came after a three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked his sweeping tariffs, ruling that he had overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and levy tariffs on imports from almost every country in the world.

While an appeals court soon intervened and allowed the administration to continue collecting the tariffs while the legal fight plays out, the decision — and Trump's fury at Leo — underscored the extent to which the judiciary is serving as a rare check on Trump's power as he pushes the bounds of executive authority.

China blasted the U.S. on Monday over moves it alleged harmed Chinese interests, including issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and planning to revoke Chinese student visas.

“These practices seriously violate the consensus” reached during trade discussions in Geneva last month, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

That referred to a China-U.S. joint statement in which the United States and China agreed to slash their massive recent tariffs, restarting stalled trade between the world's two biggest economies.

But last month's de-escalation in Trump's trade wars did nothing to resolve underlying differences between Beijing and Washington and Monday's statement showed how easily such agreements can lead to further turbulence.

The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.

Just catching up on the news from the weekend? Here are some of the major headlines:

Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.

“All of this rhetoric about cutting trillions of dollars of spending has come to nothing — and the tax bill codifies that,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. “There is a level of concern about the competence of Congress and this administration and that makes adding a whole bunch of money to the deficit riskier.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the “blatantly wrong claim that the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.”

Retired NYPD Inspector Paul Mauro discusses the recent anti-Israel incidents in the U.S. and the attack in Boulder, Colorado as the country grapples with antisemitic violence. 

One victim from the Boulder, Colorado, suspected terror attack is a Holocaust survivor, according to a government official.

Eight people were injured on Sunday, with one in critical condition, after Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly targeted a pro-Israel peaceful protest aimed at advocating for the release of Hamas hostages. Police said they received reports of a man who was setting people on fire.

Leo Terrell, senior counsel for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, said in a post on X that one of the victims is a Holocaust survivor.

"One of the victims of the Boulder attack was a Holocaust survivor. She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety," Terrell said. "And now, decades later, she's victimized again by a terrorist screaming ‘Free Palestine.' The same slogan another terrorist just screamed when murdering Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim on May 21."

"The attack on this survivor reminds me of the horror of October 7, when Holocaust survivors were murdered and dragged away by Hamas terrorists in Israel," he added.

NEW MUGSHOT RELEASED OF BOULDER TERROR ATTACK SUSPECT MOHAMED SABRY SOLIMAN

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A second group of white South Africans has arrived in the United States under a refugee program announced by the Trump administration, officials and advocacy groups said Monday.

Nine people, including families, arrived late last week, said Jaco Kleynhans, head of international liaison at the Solidarity Movement, a group representing members of South Africa's white Afrikaner minority. The group traveled on a commercial flight to Atlanta, he said.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy said in an email to The Associated Press that “refugees continue to arrive in the United States from South Africa on commercial flights as part of the Afrikaner resettlement program's ongoing operations.”

An initial group of 59 white South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on a chartered flight last month under the new program announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in February. The Trump administration fast-tracked the resettlement of white South Africans after indefinitely suspending other U.S. refugee programs.

The Trump administration said it is offering refugee status to white South Africans it alleges are being persecuted by their Black-led government and are victims of racially motivated violence. The South African government has denied the allegations and said they are a mischaracterization of the country.

Trump has falsely claimed that white South African farmers are targeted in widespread attacks that amount to genocide and are having their land taken away. Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with those baseless claims during a meeting at the White House last month.




Ramaphosa has said the relatively small number of attacks on white farmers are part of South Africa's larger problems with violent crime, which affects all races.

The Trump administration initially said the refugee program was aimed at members of South Africa's Afrikaner minority, who are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers. In new guidance published by the U.S. Embassy last month, applicants must be “a member of a racial minority” in South Africa and “must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.”

There are approximately 2.7 million Afrikaners among South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80% Black. They are not the only white minority. There are around 4.5 million whites in total, including those with British or other heritage.

The U.S. Embassy spokesperson said the U.S. “continues to review inquiries from individuals who have expressed interest to the embassy in resettling to the United States and is reaching out to eligible individuals for refugee interviews and processing.”

While U.S. officials have not said how many South Africans have applied to be relocated, Kleynhans said there have been around 8,000 applications. Another group helping white South Africans apply for refugee status has said tens of thousands have applied.

Live Updates


• Colorado attack: A man used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set people on fire Sunday at a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado, held in support of hostages in Gaza. He injured at least eight people ranging in age from 52 to 88 — including a Holocaust survivor — before being detained.
    


• Suspect identified: The FBI identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman and said he yelled “Free Palestine!” during the attack. He faces both federal hate crime and multiple state felony charges. Soliman is scheduled to appear in a local court this afternoon.
    


• Suspect's history: Soliman had applied for asylum in the US and was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005, sources told CNN. He was in the US illegally, a Homeland Security official said today. The suspect entered the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor and was granted a two-year work authorization in March 2023. That visa expired earlier this year.
    


• Community outcry: Jewish leaders called for action against attacks on their community in the wake of rising antisemitic violence and threats. Less than two weeks ago, two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot dead in Washington, DC, by an attacker who yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested.
    


            Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and acting United States Attorney for the District of Colorado Bishop Grewell will hold a news conference today, according to the Department of Justice.
    


When: 2:30 p.m. local time in Boulder, Colorado (4:30 p.m. ET). It will focus on Sunday's antisemitic attack.
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the attack has been charged with a hate crime, according to an affidavit filed today, in addition to local charges.
    


            The Islamic Center of Boulder condemned the “targeted violence” of Sunday's attack. “Such actions have no place in the Boulder community,” the center said in a statement.
    


                    “Hate and violence oppose our values and are a threat to all Americans,” the statement reads. “We call on our neighbors to focus on supporting the victims of this terrible attack, and to reject those who would use this horrible incident to divide our community.”
                





            The statement also emphasizes the importance of “the First Amendment rights and protections of all people.”
    


            “Every individual and every community has the constitutional right to peaceful assembly and free expression,” the statement says. “These fundamental freedoms must be respected and safeguarded for everyone, regardless of their views or background.”
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in Sunday's attack in Boulder, Colorado, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to an affidavit filed Monday.
    


            He was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin,” reads the affidavit.
    


            President Donald Trump said that the “horrific attack” in Boulder, Colorado will not be tolerated by his administration, in his first comments since yesterday's incident.
    


                    “Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday, nearly a full day after the assault.
                





            The president also said that the incident underscores the need for his administration's crackdown on immigration and said that the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, must “go out under ‘Trump' Policy.”
    


            Soliman was in the US illegally, a Homeland Security official said. He entered the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor and was granted a two-year work authorization in March 2023. That visa expired earlier this year.
    


            “He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under ‘TRUMP' Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” Trump wrote.
    


            Police found 16 additional molotov cocktails in the area where the Boulder attack suspect was spotted, according to multiple law enforcement sources.
    


            The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, arrived in the area of the incident around 1 p.m. local time and lingered there before throwing two incendiary devices, according to multiple law enforcement sources. Soliman was wearing a utility vest over his shirt and was carrying a garden sprayer filled with gasoline, sources said.
    


            Many witnesses said he looked like a gardener, officials added. He used the garden sprayer as the “makeshift flamethrower,” apparently, by spraying gasoline in the direction of the marchers while holding a lighter in front of the stream of fuel, sources said.
    


            Investigators believe Soliman stopped at gas stations in the area before the attack to fill the bottles and the garden sprayer.
    


            Witnesses said that Soliman took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. Soliman was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.
    


            In dispatch audio from the Boulder City Fire Department a person on scene also noted that additional Molotov cocktails were found. “It looks like there is a large box of Molotov cocktails in front of the courthouse,” the official said.

CNN's Sara Smart contributed to this post. 



            The Boulder Police Department have released a mugshot of 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who has been detained and is facing charges related to the attack on members of the Jewish community at an event in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday.
    


            Soliman is expected to appear in court later today.
    


            The weekend attack in Boulder that left at least eight victims injured has left congregants of a local synagogue feeling enraged, vulnerable and sad, Rabbi Fred Greene from Congregation Har HaShem told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


            “My congregants feel wounded,” Greene said. “We have to show up for one another. We have to figure out who's feeling vulnerable and who's feeling angry and respond to them.”
    


            Greene said the weekend's incident is yet another, sad opportunity for the Jewish community to come together and stay resilient, especially on a holy day, Shavuot, which celebrates the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people on Mount Sinai.
    


            “The rhetoric that we hear for months and months is been something of concern for all of us, Greene said. ”Hearing people talk about a globalized, an Intifada, and to think that bringing violence to America's Jewish community is going to help the dignity and save lives of Palestinians is ridiculous and harmful.”
    


            None of the victims in the Boulder attack have died, Boulder Police said in a post on X on Monday.
    


            At least eight people have been reported injured after the attack, ranging in age from 52 to 88.
    


            The suspected attacker was booked into county jail Sunday night on multiple felony charges, including two counts of first-degree murder, though the circumstances around those charges is unclear. CNN has reached out to the District Attorney for more information.
    


            The suspect is expected in court Monday afternoon.
    


            The Jewish community in Boulder is rallying together after an attack that left at least eight people injured, many of whom were older adults, a local leader told CNN.
    


            Elyana Funk, Executive Director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said many of the victims are well known in the community. She talked to a couple of them last night, including one woman who is “healing from horrible burns.”
    


            “She really felt like this happened not just to her, but to the whole community,” Funk said.
    


            A mother and daughter were also injured in the attack, Funk, said.
    


            The mother, “is a Holocaust survivor in her 80's, who's been through certainly enough trauma,” she noted.
    


            In fact, most of those who were injured were older adults, who were walking peacefully, Funk said. The injured range in age from 52 to 88.
    


                    “This wasn't a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who've been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”
                





            The recurring walk is organized in local communities around the globe, and organizers specifically encourage participants not to protest, but rather to keep the gatherings quiet and respectful.
    


            Funk said she's participated in the walk herself, along with her six-year-old son. Now, she says, the walk is on hold, but the community will still find ways to come together.
    


            “The antidote for antisemitism can be Jewish joy, and Jewish community and Jewish connection,” Funk said.
    


            Brian Horowitz was sitting in a cafe having brunch with his family when screams and chaos from an attack at a Jewish community event nearby, interrupted their meal.
    


            Horowitz, who is from Denver, was in the area to show his teenage niece and nephew the University of Colorado campus in hope that they'd enroll there, he told CNN.
    


            Instead, the 37-year-old jumped from the table and ran toward the suspect.
    


            “‘F*** you Zionists. You're killing my people so I kill you,'” Horowitz said he heard the man, now identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman said.
    


            The attacker then singled out people in the plaza saying “'you're a killer, you're a killer,'” Horowitz said.
    


            Horowitz said the attacker then locked eyes with him.
    


            “That's when he looked at me and said you're a killer,” Horowitz, recalled.
    


            Horowitz called 911, he said, and remembers hearing screams from other witnesses, while most of the injured victims were silent.
    


            Not knowing how best to help, he followed the lead of others who grabbed buckets and poured water over people's burns. Horowitz said he found one elderly victim with severe burns to her feet and hands who told him to worry about her friend instead, he said.
    


                    “She was looking at me and saying ‘please help her. Put the water on her,'” Horowitz said. The victim's friend was lying face down on the pavement with severe burns to her calf, the skin barely visible. “She was cool, calm and collected - almost as if she had been there before,” Horowitz said.
                





            Three minutes after Horowitz called emergency services, police arrived and took the suspect into custody, Horowitz said, noting the wait felt like an eternity.
    


                    “It was easily the most horrific thing I've ever seen in my life,” Horowitz said. “There's someone who is outraged enough to go and attack these elderly people who are doing absolutely nothing to provoke it other than walk in silence and meet in a courtyard peacefully. It's unbelievable.”
                


                    Brian Horowitz, witness
                


            Horowitz, who is back in Denver now said after the weekend's incident, he's left to process his own rage and fear.
    


            “I can never in my entire life think of another time where I wish I had a gun on me to try and take this guy out in a safe way for everyone else and myself included rather than rushing this guy and potentially risking my life for that,” Horowitz said. “It's a feeling of helplessness.”
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect charged in the Boulder attack, arrived in the United States in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor, according to multiple law enforcement officials.
    


            He filed a claim a month later, in September, and was granted a work authorization in March, 2023. The authorization expired at the end of March of this year, at which point it appears he remained here illegally, the officials added.
    


More on the incident: After committing the attack, the suspect told police “I did it to avenge my people,” one of the law enforcement officials said.
    


            Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the most senior Jewish member of the House, said that the Boulder, Colorado flamethrower attack was clearly antisemitic.
    


            “Well, it was obviously an antisemitic attack and a latest in a series of antisemitic attacks,” Nadler told CNN. He went on to list the recent shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC and the arson of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's home.
    


            Nadler added that he would like to see an increase in funding for the protection of religious institutions so people can feel more safe.
    


                    “The Jewish community is very on edge and we want the federal government to do more and we'd like to see an increase in the budget for the protection, for the protection of provisions of the law because when someone talks about Israel and attacks Jewish institutions, Jewish people, that's clearly antisemitism,” Nadler said. “The protective law that provides protection for schools and churches and mosques and synagogues. That should be increased because we need more security at all these places of worship and congregation,” he added.
                





            Calls for multiple ambulances, helicopters and for all units to respond can be heard in dispatch audio during the attack in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday.
    


                    “1325 Pearl Street, the courthouse, reports that there is a male with a blow torch setting people on fire,” one official with the Boulder City Police can be heard saying in dispatch audio Broadcastify.
                





                    “There's multiple mixed reports about if people are on fire or not, we're getting lots of 911 calls,” they added.
                





            As the incident continued to unfold, all units were advised to assist with the situation and calls for multiple ambulances and helicopters were made.
    


                    “There was someone who threw two Molotov cocktails, we have multiple injuries, we're sending multiple ambulances,” one official says.
                





                    “What's the nature?” one Boulder City Fire official asks. “Multiple burns, potential terror attack,” another official responds.
                





            Authorities have named Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the accused perpetrator of an attack on a Jewish community gathering in Boulder, Colorado.
    


            Witnesses say the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails into the crowd during a weekly gathering in support of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, law enforcement authorities said. Eight people were injured, ranging from 52 to 88 years old.
    


Here's what to know this morning:



            The suspect charged in the Boulder attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was in the US illegally, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said Monday.
    


            “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin wrote on X.
    


            Soliman was booked in county jail just before midnight, where records show he is charged with multiple felonies. He is expected in court Monday afternoon.
    


            Run for Their Lives is a global run – or walk – event organized by members of the Jewish community to bring attention to the 58 hostages who remain held in Gaza. Of those hostages, 20 are still believed to be alive according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            The Jewish community in Boulder had gathered on Sunday to take part in the activity before Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set people on fire. The FBI said he acted alone and yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.
    


            Attacks on the Jewish community in the US have increased since October 7, 2023. Two Israeli Embassy staff members were shot and killed by a gunman who later yelled “Free Palestine!” while being arrested in Washington, DC, on May 21, authorities said.
    


            One of the victims of Sunday's attack on a group of Jewish community members in Colorado is a holocaust survivor, an individual who was at the march and knows the victim told CNN on Sunday.
    


            Eight people attending the event to support hostages in Gaza, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were injured when a suspect used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set them on fire, according to the FBI. One victim was “very seriously injured,” according to Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn.
    


            A friend of the Holocaust survivor, Chany Scheiner, described her as “an amazing person” when talking to CNN affiliate KUSA.
    


                    “She has spoken at our synagogues as well as other synagogues and schools just about her background and the Holocaust and from her own perspective. She is passionate about standing up for good things and she is an extremely exceptional person. Always a smile on her face. Her life wasn't easy, but she is just a bright light. And anybody who is her friend is a friend for life.”
                





            Scheiner is married to a rabbi at the Boulder County Center for Judaism, KUSA reported.
    


            “Boulder is a beautiful place,” she said. “People are friendly, they're kind, and this was out of left field. This is not something that we ever dreamed would be in our neighborhood or in our backyard. And it's horrific. And we can't wrap our head around it because this is not Boulder.”
    


            People rushed to help in the moments following the Boulder attack, dousing burn victims with water while the suspect was still on a lawn nearby, according to several videos verified by CNN and witness accounts.
    


            In one video, a severely injured woman is seen lying on the ground as bystanders pour water on her. The camera then pans toward the suspect, seen shouting at bystanders while holding bottles of liquid in his hands.
    


            The owner of a local clothing store, Heady Bauer, who did not want to be named, told CNN he and an employee saw big flames out front. As they heard people screaming and shouting, they ran to the scene.
    


                    “There were people on the ground and a bunch of others running over with buckets and bottles and whatever they could carry water in” the store owner told CNN. “Everyone was dumping water on the burned people, especially one woman on the ground who was totally torched from her hair to her legs.”
                





            The store owner described the attacker as “pretty calm, pacing around with the spray bottles that were filled with some sort of flammable liquid.”
    


                    “He would spray the liquid and spread the fire. It was pretty intense, honestly.”
                





            Another witness who arrived on the scene as police were apprehending the suspect described the scene as “big, controlled chaos.”
    


            “All of a sudden all we saw was police cars, a ton of police cars arriving, and then fire trucks and ambulances,” said Ivan. A, who declined to give his full last name.
    


            At the scene of the attack, he saw two injured women being treated by paramedics. One woman had a visible burn mark on her body, he told CNN. “A lot of us did not really comprehend the seriousness of the situation,” Ivan said.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned an attack on a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado and said he prays for the “full recovery of the wounded in the vicious terror attack.”
    


            On Sunday, a man used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack an event in support of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the FBI. The suspect yelled “Free Palestine!” during the attack, the FBI said.
    


            At least eight people were injured, Boulder police said. The attack came on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
    


                    “This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said Monday morning.
                





            Netanyahu said he believes the US will “prosecute the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.”
    


            Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the man authorities have accused of carrying out Sunday's attack on a Jewish community gathering in Boulder, Colorado, was booked in the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to online jail records.
    


            Among the charges is one count of explosives or incendiary devices used during a felony.
    


            Witnesses say the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails into the crowd during a weekly gathering in support of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to law enforcement authorities.
    


            Online records also show Soliman, 45, was booked on two counts of murder in the 1st degree, but the circumstances around those charges are unclear, as authorities have not announced any deaths resulting from the attack.
    


            Soliman also faces two counts of first-degree assault and crimes against at-risk adults or elderly people, the records show. The victims of the attack are between the ages of 52 and 88.
    


            CNN reached out to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office for comment.
    


            Eight people were injured Sunday, including two who were airlifted to Denver-area hospitals, authorities said previously.
    


            Soliman has a court date scheduled for Monday at 1:30 p.m. local time, according to the online jail records, which show he is being held on a bond of $10 million.

Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa., discusses the Russia-Ukraine war, President Donald Trump's tariff policies and the Gaza humanitarian crisis on ‘Fox News Sunday.'

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Monday that he is moving the United Kingdom's military into "war-fighting readiness" to address growing threats from Russia. 

During a visit to BAE Systems'Govan facility, a navy ship-building yard in Glasgow, Scotland, the prime minister laid out "three fundamental changes" to be made in response to the country's strategic defense review. 

"First, we are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces," Starmer said. "When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready. And frankly, to show them that we're ready, to deliver peace through strength." 

‘MAKE NATO GREAT AGAIN': HEGSETH PUSHES EUROPEAN ALLIES TO STEP UP DEFENSE EFFORTS

Starmer continued, "Now Britain has the finest service men and women in the world. We're showing them the respect that they deserve by delivering the biggest armed forces pay rise in 20 years and by pledging today that we will end the hollowing out of our armed forces. "We'll build a fighting force that is more integrated, more ready, more lethal than ever, backed by a stronger strategic reserve, fully trained and ready to mobilize at any time."

The new approach comes as President Donald Trump has warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a "new era" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and "daily cyberattacks," as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out "growing Russian aggression" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming "their reckless actions" for the increased cost of living "hitting working people the hardest." 

"The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War," Starmer said. 

The U.K. government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. 

It's the first such review since 2021. Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of "fighting big tank battles on European landmass" are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace.

The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring "everything we do will add to the strength of NATO."

"As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense, the NATO alliance means something profound, that we will never fight alone," Starmer said. "It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always be NATO first, something that's written through this review. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense."

RUBIO DEMANDS NATO PONY UP, DISMISSES 'HYSTERIA' OVER US ROLE UNDER TRUMP

The third change laid out by Starmer is for the U.K. to "innovate and accelerate at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow as the fastest innovator in NATO." He said such advancements would not mean "replacing people" or hardware, but would rather mean "learning the lessons of Ukraine" and ensuring "every capability we have works seamlessly together."

"Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035," Starmer said. 

The U.K. government said it's expanding the country's armed, nuclear-powered submarine fleet with up to 12 new SSN-AUKUS boats through a partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.

Starmer has already pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, a boost from the current 2.3%, and to eventually get that up to 3%.

GB News noted at the press conference Monday that Starmer hasn't committed to having 3% of the GDP go to defense spending within the next nine years, even as Germany's defense chief warned Russia could invade a NATO ally within the next four years. In his response, Starmer reiterated the U.K. as a "steadfast ally" to Ukraine and said the changes coming as a result of the review would be the best way to deter further conflict. 

The U.K. government will also increase Britain's conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.

Starmer said rearming would create a "defense dividend" of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs – a contrast to the post-Cold War "peace dividend" that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration on Monday renewed its request for the Supreme Court to clear the way for plans to downsize the federal workforce, while a lawsuit filed by labor unions and cities proceeds.

The high court filing came after an appeals court refused to freeze a California-based judge's order halting the cuts, which have been led by the Department of Government Efficiency.

By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the downsizing could have broader effects, including on the nation's food-safety system and health care for veterans. 

In her ruling last month, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston found that Trump's administration needs congressional approval to make sizable reductions to the federal workforce.

The administration initially asked the justices to step in last month, but withdrew its appeal for technical, legal reasons. The latest filing is one in a series of emergency appeals arguing federal judges had overstepped their authority.

Illston's order “rests on the indefensible premise that the President needs explicit statutory authorization from Congress to exercise his core Article II authority to superintend the internal personnel decisions of the Executive Branch,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the new appeal.

Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire ally Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE. Musk left his role last week.




Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, have left their jobs via deferred resignation programs, or have been placed on leave. There is no official figure for the job cuts, but at least 75,000 federal employees took deferred resignation, and thousands of probationary workers have already been let go. 

Illston's order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president's workforce executive order signed in February and a subsequent memo issued by DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management. Illston was nominated by former Democratic President Bill Clinton.

Among the agencies affected by the order are the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Labor, the Interior, State, the Treasury and Veterans Affairs. It also applies to the National Science Foundation, Small Business Association, Social Security Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.

The Supreme Court set a deadline of next Monday for a response from the unions and cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and San Francisco.

Some of the labor unions and nonprofit groups are also plaintiffs in another lawsuit before a San Francisco judge challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. In that case, Judge William Alsup ordered the government in March to reinstate those workers, but the U.S. Supreme Court later blocked his order.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China criticized the U.S. on Monday over moves it alleged harmed Chinese interests, including issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China, and planning to revoke Chinese student visas. 

“These practices seriously violate the consensus,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, referring to a China-U.S. joint statement in which the United States and China agreed to slash their massive recent tariffs, restarting stalled trade between the world's two biggest economies.

But last month's de-escalation in President Donald Trump's trade wars did nothing to resolve underlying differences between Beijing and Washington and Monday's statement showed how easily such agreements can lead to further turbulence. 

The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Trump imposed last month to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.

The Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and non-tariff measures taken against the U.S. “reciprocal tariffs” following the agreement.

“The United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and trade relations,” while China has stood by its commitments, the statement said. 




It also threatened unspecified retaliation, saying China will “continue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”

Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States.

Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and “hopefully we'll work that out,” while still insisting China had violated the agreement.

“The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” Trump posted. “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”

In response to recent comments by Trump, the Commerce Ministry said of the U.S.: “Instead of reflecting on itself, it has turned the tables and unreasonably accused China of violating the consensus, which is seriously contrary to the facts.” 

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the Chinese were “just slow rolling the deal” from Geneva. 

Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Lutnick said the U.S. was “taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation,” adding that Trump would “work it out” with Xi.

The Trump administration also stepped up the clash with China in other ways last week, announcing that it would start revoking visas for Chinese students studying in the U.S.

U.S. campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.

Both countries are in a race to develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, with Washington seeking to curb China's access to the most advanced computer chips. China is also seeking to displace the U.S. as the leading power in the Asia-Pacific, including through gaining control over close U.S. partner and leading tech giant Taiwan.

Witnesses recounted the dramatic scenes after eight people, calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd.

The FBI says the suspect in an attack in Boulder, Colorado that injured six yelled “Free Palestine” and used a makeshift flamethrower.

Several people were injured and some may have been set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said. Police said a man was taken into custody in an attack that the FBI immediately described as an act of terror. Boulder police said there were “several victims” in the attack.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — A man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a group in Boulder, Colorado, that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to court documents filed Monday.

The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group,” the FBI said. Eight people were injured in the attack, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the Justice Department on Monday.

Court records show Soliman was scheduled to appear in state court in Boulder at 1:30 p.m.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder.

In New York, the police department said it upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He's right there. He's throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then “two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Law enforcement found more than a dozen unlit Molotov cocktails near where Soliman was arrested. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. Inside his car, law enforcement found papers with the words “Israel,” “Palestine,” and “USAID,” the affidavit says.

Soliman told investigators that he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients. He drove to Boulder with the devices in his car and stopped along the way for gas, according to the affidavit.

He said in his interview that his goal was to “kill all Zionists,” the FBI said, and that he intentionally targeted the group and knew they they would be assembled on Sunday afternoon.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

The group that was attacked has said it was trying to raise attention to the plight of the Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Authorities said Sunday they believe Soliman acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

State and federal authorities planned to hold a news conference Monday afternoon.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after having entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Public records listed Soliman as living in a modest rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene Sunday.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who'd play with Pruiett's kids in front of their building, share food and hellos. But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him.

“There had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,” said Pruiett, leaning on her doorframe and gazing several feet away at Soliman's apartment. Soliman had never been outwardly political, she said, “he didn't push his views or values on anyone.”

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman's home to come out. Nobody came out, and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett. The raid lasted several hours, she said.

An online resume under Soliman's name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.”

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Sunday attack on eight people in Boulder, Colorado, is an illegal immigrant who entered the United States during the Biden administration and failed to depart when his visa expired, according to a Trump administration official.

Boulder police on Sunday identified Soliman, 45, as a resident of El Paso County, Colorado. On Monday, administration officials confirmed that he lacked immigration status to be in the U.S.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a post to X Monday morning. “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.”

Soliman would have entered the U.S. on a B2, nonimmigrant visa, meaning he was approved to stay in the country temporarily.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the White House did not respond to requests regarding Soliman's country of origin. However, Soliman is reported to be an Egyptian national.

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said Soliman had “illegally overstayed” a tourist visa.

One month after arriving, Soliman reportedly filed an unspecified claim in September 2022 seeking documents to work legally and was granted them in March 2023, according to CNN. His work permit lasted two years.

Soliman was also said to have attempted to enter the U.S. in 2025 but was denied.

Soliman was immediately detained by local police and has been charged with multiple felonies for allegedly using a flamethrower to set people on fire in what is being investigated as a terrorist attack. He is due in court later Monday.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — As the nation's top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s stark comments about children with autism have splintered a community of millions of people who are living with the disorder.

Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.

Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and 2-year-old sister Billie.

At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items.

Lamb said it's unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date — as Kennedy said last month when describing autism — but she also doesn't only view her child's limitations.

“I see where he was going with his comments,” said Lamb, who is also the director of social media at the national organization Autism Speaks. “But I also think that's not how you measure the value of our children's lives. The language we use matters.”

Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst explains the impact of the drone strike on Russian air bases.

Russian and Ukrainian delegations have begun talks in Istanbul, Turkey, on Monday, less than 24 hours after a massive Ukrainian drone attack struck Russian airfields.

The two delegations entered Ciragan Palace in Istanbul alongside a group of senior Turkish officials. It is the second round of peace talks to take place in the three years since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Images from the event show many of the Ukrainian delegation wearing military uniforms, while the Russian group exclusively wore suits. 

Details of the meeting are not expected to be made public until after its conclusion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be meeting face-to-face, however.

Ukrainian forces destroyed 40 aircraft in the drone attack this weekend, which an official says took more than a year to orchestrate. Russia's defense ministry confirmed the attack on Sunday, saying it struck five airfields.

The operation saw drones transported in containers carried by trucks deep into Russian territory, he said. The drones reportedly hit 41 planes stationed at several airfields on Sunday afternoon, including A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M aircraft, the official said.

Moscow has previously used Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-22 long-range bombers to launch missiles at Ukraine, while A-50s are used to coordinate targets and detect air defenses and guided missiles.

A series of explosions also struck bridges in Russia near Ukraine's border on Saturday, though Ukraine has not taken responsibility for the attacks.

Exit polls in Poland's presidential runoff on Sunday showed the two candidates in a statistical tie with the race still too close to call in the deeply divided nation. The results could set the course for the nation's political future and its relations with the European Union. Though the final result was still unclear with the two locked in a near dead heat, both men claimed to have won in meetings with their supporters in Warsaw.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian and staunch nationalist, as its next president in a closely watched vote that signals a resurgence of right-wing populism in the heart of Europe. 

Nawrocki, who is set to take office on Aug. 6, is expected to shape the country's domestic and foreign policy in ways that could strain ties with Brussels while aligning the Central European nation of nearly 38 million people more closely with the administration of President Donald Trump in the United States.

Here are some key takeaways:

Nawrocki's victory underscores the enduring appeal of nationalist rhetoric among about half of the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union, and its deep social divisions. 

The 42-year-old historian who had no previous political experience built his campaign on patriotic themes, traditional Catholic values, and a vow to defend Poland's sovereignty against the EU and larger European nations like Germany.

His win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right — even the far right in recent times.

Far-right candidates did very well in Poland's first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.




As his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms. 

“Poland remains a deeply divided country,” said Jacek Kucharczyk, the president of the Polish Institute of Public Affairs. 

“Although the electoral turnout was highest ever in history of presidential elections, Mr. Nawrocki's margin of victory is very small, which means that half of Poland will be cheering his presidency, whereas half of Poland, the other half, remains deeply worried or even disturbed,” he added.

Nawrocki's presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.

But Tusk's coalition — a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives — has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law. 

Nawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk's agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.

Nawrocki's election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.

Poland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.

Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.

While Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid — particularly support for refugees. 

His rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland's assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki's approach could shift Poland's posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.

The election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk's return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement. 

“This is very bad news for the European Union as well as Poland's key European partners, both Germany and France as well as Ukraine,” said Kucharczyk, the analyst. 

“Mr. Nawrocki is well known for his Eurosceptic stand. He's opposed to deepening European integration and European cooperation. He is also opposed to Ukraine's NATO membership,” he added.

Nawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland's national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy. 

While the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki's symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels' efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.

Though an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions. 

Billions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk's government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.

Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs reacts after a Colorado terror suspect involved in an attack at a pro-Israel event was taken into police custody. 

Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing hate crime, murder, assault and other charges following what the FBI called a "targeted terror attack" in Boulder, Colorado, over the weekend. 

The violence Sunday against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages left eight people, ages 52 to 88, with injuries, including one in critical condition, according to the FBI. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with a weapon setting people on fire. 

Soliman has now been charged with a Hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin. At the state level, Soliman was charged with murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent; murder in the first degree – extreme indifference; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; 1st degree assault – non-family; 1st degree assault – heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

Soliman was also in the United States illegally, Fox News has learned. 

Boulder Police Department confirmed Monday that no victim has died. Soliman was booked into the Boulder County Jail on Sunday evening and remains held on a $10 million bond.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing multiple charges following the incident in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday, June 1. 

"We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado," FBI director Kash Patel said. "Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available." 

Soliman, 45, was arrested and taken to the hospital with minor injuries after his alleged attack on the "Run for Their Lives" group that was gathering on Pearl Street, police said Sunday night. 

The group is a grassroots organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. This particular chapter of the group meets on a weekly basis, police said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.

“All of this rhetoric about cutting trillions of dollars of spending has come to nothing — and the tax bill codifies that,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. “There is a level of concern about the competence of Congress and this administration and that makes adding a whole bunch of money to the deficit riskier.”

The White House has viciously lashed out at anyone who has voiced concern about the debt snowballing under Trump, even though it did exactly that in his first term after his 2017 tax cuts.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened her briefing Thursday by saying she wanted “to debunk some false claims” about his tax cuts. 

Leavitt said the “blatantly wrong claim that the ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill' increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson piled onto Congress' number crunchers on Sunday, telling NBC's “Meet the Press,” “The CBO sometimes gets projections correct, but they're always off, every single time, when they project economic growth. They always underestimate the growth that will be brought about by tax cuts and reduction in regulations.” 




But Trump himself has suggested that the lack of sufficient spending cuts to offset his tax reductions came out of the need to hold the Republican congressional coalition together.

“We have to get a lot of votes,” Trump said last week. “We can't be cutting.”

That has left the administration betting on the hope that economic growth can do the trick, a belief that few outside of Trump's orbit think is viable. 

Most economists consider the non-partisan CBO to be the foundational standard for assessing policies, though it does not produce cost estimates for actions taken by the executive branch such as Trump's unilateral tariffs.

Tech billionaire Musk, who was until recently part of Trump's inner sanctum as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, told CBS News: “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.”

The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add more than $5 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if all of them are allowed to continue, according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.

To make the bill's price tag appear lower, various parts of the legislation are set to expire. This same tactic was used with Trump's 2017 tax cuts and it set up this year's dilemma, in which many of the tax cuts in that earlier package will sunset next year unless Congress renews them.

But the debt is a much bigger problem now than it was eight years ago. Investors are demanding the government pay a higher premium to keep borrowing as the total debt has crossed $36.1 trillion. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury Note is around 4.5%, up dramatically from the roughly 2.5% rate being charged when the 2017 tax cuts became law.

The White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that its policies will unleash so much rapid growth that the annual budget deficits will shrink in size relative to the overall economy, putting the U.S. government on a fiscally sustainable path.

The council argues the economy would expand over the next four years at an annual average of about 3.2%, instead of the Congressional Budget Office's expected 1.9%, and as many as 7.4 million jobs would be created or saved.

Council chair Stephen Miran told reporters that when the growth being forecast by the White House is coupled with expected revenues from tariffs, the expected budget deficits will fall. The tax cuts will increase the supply of money for investment, the supply of workers and the supply of domestically produced goods — all of which, by Miran's logic, would cause faster growth without creating new inflationary pressures.

“I do want to assure everyone that the deficit is a very significant concern for this administration,” Miran said.

White House budget director Russell Vought told reporters the idea that the bill is “in any way harmful to debt and deficits is fundamentally untrue.”

Most outside economists expect additional debt would keep interest rates higher and slow overall economic growth as the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, businesses and even college educations would increase.

“This just adds to the problem future policymakers are going to face,” said Brendan Duke, a former Biden administration aide now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Duke said that with the tax cuts in the bill set to expire in 2028, lawmakers would be “dealing with Social Security, Medicare and expiring tax cuts at the same time.”

Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the growth projections from Trump's economic team are “a work of fiction.” He said the bill would lead some workers to choose to work fewer hours in order to qualify for Medicaid.

“I don't know of any serious forecaster that has meaningfully raised their growth forecast because of this legislation,” said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the Council of Economic Advisers chair under the Obama administration. “These are mostly not growth- and competitiveness-oriented tax cuts. And, in fact, the higher long-term interest rates will go the other way and hurt growth.”

The White House's inability so far to calm deficit concerns is stirring up political blowback for Trump as the tax and spending cuts approved by the House now move to the Senate. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky have both expressed concerns about the likely deficit increases, with Paul saying Sunday there are enough GOP senators to stall the bill until deficits are addressed.

“I think there are four of us at this point” who would oppose the legislation “if the bill, at least, is not modified in a good direction,” Paul said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”

“The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this,” Paul said. 

Four Republican holdouts would be enough to halt the bill in the Senate, where the party holds a three-seat majority. 

The White House is also banking that tariff revenues will help cover the additional deficits, even though recent court rulings cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump declaring an economic emergency to impose sweeping taxes on imports.

When Trump announced his near-universal tariffs in April, he specifically said his policies would generate enough new revenues to start paying down the national debt. His comments dovetailed with remarks by aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, that yearly budget deficits could be more than halved.

“It's our turn to prosper and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly,” Trump said two months ago as he talked up his import taxes and encouraged lawmakers to pass the separate tax and spending cuts.

The Trump administration is correct that growth can help reduce deficit pressures, but it's not enough on its own to accomplish the task, according to new research by economists Douglas Elmendorf, Glenn Hubbard and Zachary Liscow.

Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said additional “growth doesn't even get us close to where we need to be.” 

The government would need $10 trillion of deficit reduction over the next 10 years just to stabilize the debt, Tedeschi said. And even though the White House says the tax cuts would add to growth, most of the cost goes to preserve existing tax breaks, so that's unlikely to boost the economy meaningfully.

“It's treading water,” Tedeschi said.

President Donald Trump said this week he would look into whether pardons are warranted for men convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, reviving national interest in a high-profile case that raises questions on whether FBI malfeasance led to their radicalization and alleged entrapment.

“I did watch the trial. It looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job,” Trump told reporters Wednesday, referencing the convictions of two of the plot's main defendants. In August 2022, Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox were convicted of conspiring to kidnap Whitmer from her vacation home, plotting to destroy a nearby bridge, and hopefully spark a second civil war. Prosecutors described them as anti-government extremists bent on political violence, while defense attorneys argued they were manipulated by a sprawling FBI sting operation involving undercover agents and informants.

The renewed attention has prompted questions about the integrity of the case, which took place during President Joe Biden‘s single term when former Attorney General Merrick Garland was in charge of the DOJ. Julie Kelly, an independent journalist known for her reporting on the Jan. 6 prosecutions, confirmed to the Washington Examiner that she met with newly appointed pardon attorney Ed Martin on Thursday to review alleged flaws in the way FBI agents handled the Whitmer kidnapping case.

“This was just giving an overview of what happened in the Whitmer case. You know, the entrapment operation, how it went down, the timing of it — more importantly, that this represented another instance of the FBI interfering in an election against the president.”

Kelly said she spoke to Martin solely in the context of his second role on the newly formed Weaponization Working Group, a special team formed under Attorney General Pam Bondi to reexamine major federal prosecutions from the Biden administration. “We just sort of talked about it in that context,” Kelly said, “and where to look, what sort of records they might be able to get, so they could start compiling the timeline.”

Kelly emphasized that she did not recommend any specific action regarding pardons. “I was not involved in any pardon discussions. I will not be involved in any pardon discussions,” she said. “This is just related to another example of the political weaponization of the FBI against the president.”

In her conversation with Martin, Kelly said she flagged the heavy use of FBI informants and agents in the sting operation, many of whom played active roles in planning and facilitating the alleged kidnapping plot.

“The number of FBI informants that were embedded in this operation, the undercover agents, what they did when they were introduced to the operation, how they targeted these men, how they organized various events — so they got them stoned and drunk and then recorded them to use as evidence later,” Kelly told the Washington Examiner. “Just the level of granular involvement by the informants and agents, but also how so much of it was dictated from higher-ups, including the handling agents out of the Detroit FBI field office.”

“There's a very strong likelihood that it came from FBI headquarters, because that came out during the trial,” shaded.

The FBI's counterterrorism strategy came under fire during the prosecution of men accused of plotting to kidnap Whitmer, with critics alleging that the bureau's use of informants veered into outright entrapment. At least a dozen confidential informants and undercover agents were involved, not only gathering intel but helping shape nearly every aspect of the plot — from organizing meetings and funding travel to introducing the idea of using explosives. One informant, “Big Dan” Chappel, rose to leadership in the group, while another undercover agent suggested blowing up a bridge to delay police. During surveillance of Whitmer's home, nearly half the people in the vehicles were federal operatives. Defense attorneys argued that their clients were manipulated into fantasizing about violence by the government itself, with one FBI handler even texting Chappel, “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.”

After Republicans won in 2022, the House Judiciary Committee put the Whitmer case on the list of things to examine and investigate, but no hearings were held. 

“This is a lot more volatile case than the Jan. 6 defendants,” Kelly said. “It is a more complicated, complex issue.”

Trump's comments about the case have drawn a sharp rebuke from Whitmer, who claimed Thursday that Trump promised not to issue pardons during a conversation last month.

“I talked to the president about a month ago and he asked me how I'd feel about this, and I said, ‘I think it would be the wrong decision.' And he said, ‘Okay, I'll drop it,'” Whitmer told Michigan Public Radio.

It's unclear if Trump's statement this week indicates a policy reversal, but the comment underscores his broader approach to clemency powers, which he has used aggressively in his second term. 

Kelly said the public deserves more information about how this case was constructed and whether it was politically motivated. “This will be important public-facing work for the weaponization working group: how to explain this to the public. And then seeing, gauging the public's opinion about pardons here,” she said.

Croft and Fox were found only found guilty by a jury of conspiring to kidnap the governor and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction after their first trial ended with a hung jury, in addition to full acquittals for two other defendants, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. 

Jurors agreed with the defense that Harris and Caserta were largely entrapped, casting doubt on the scope and integrity of the government's case. A second trial later led to the convictions of Croft and Fox, with FBI operatives supplying the bulk of the evidence through audio and video recordings — many made while the group was under the influence of drugs or alcohol provided during the operation.

Two other men, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors. Franks testified that FBI operatives encouraged the group to escalate the plan, including discussions about blowing up a bridge to slow down police, which began after agents got the men high. In total, more than a dozen men were arrested in connection with the plot, including eight who were charged in state court with supporting roles such as providing material support for terrorist acts or aiding the conspiracy.

Since returning to office, Trump has initiated reforms aimed at addressing perceived political biases within the DOJ. One of his first major acts included the issuance of pardons and commutations to over 1,500 individuals convicted or charged in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

While Kelly declined to offer a public stance on clemency, she noted that the public is far less informed about the Whitmer case than Jan. 6. 

“It's going to be trickier than the J6 [cases] I think, and more so because the public just is not aware of what happened in this case,” she said.

WHITMER ‘VERY DISAPPOINTED' TRUMP WEIGHING PARDONS FOR KIDNAPPING PLOTTERS

“This is only about the federal indictments and convictions,” Kelly said. “They can't do anything with the guys who are in jail on state charges.”

The White House has not indicated whether Trump will proceed with the pardons, and if any should come, it will likely only be after Martin's team conducts a thorough post-mortem on the controversial case.

Trump wants to blow a $3 trillion hole in the budget. The bond market is saying “no way.”

by  Dylan Matthews

To pass a law in the United States, you need to jump through a lot of hurdles. 

A bill has to first clear a committee in the House or Senate. (In the case of Republicans' tax legislation this year, its components had to clear 11 different committees.) The House Rules Committee has to agree for it to come to the floor for a vote. It has to pass that vote. In the Senate, it has to get 60 votes to beat a potential filibuster, or else obey a set of byzantine rules allowing it to pass with a simple majority.

But another entity gets a vote, an entity not mentioned in the Constitution or in congressional rules or even physically located in Washington, DC. That entity is the bond market, and right now, it is very pissed.

Currently, the US makes up for any budget deficits it incurs by issuing bonds of various durations to cover the difference. It auctions those bonds — essentially IOUs issued by the Treasury Department — on the open market, where investors (banks, hedge funds, foreign central banks, pension funds, etc.) can bid on them. 

To get them to bid, the US has to pay interest on the bond. And when the US borrows a lot, and especially if its fiscal policy indicates that the country may reach a point where it can't pay back what it owes, investors will demand to receive more interest to compensate for the risk of default. That means the US has to pay more every year to service its past debt, and those payments in turn become future debt. If the interest they demand is high enough, the result can be an economic downturn, an upward debt spiral, or both.

While politicians pay attention to all kinds of economic indicators, from the unemployment rate to the stock market, the bond market is a different and more powerful animal. The most famous quote about the bond market's power comes from former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville: “I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” 

History is littered with cases of governments that were forced to abandon policies — or that even fell from power — because the bond market revolted. Just a few years ago in the UK, a mass sell-off by currency and bond traders forced the Tory government to abandon its plans for a massive deficit-ballooning tax cut and axe Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, before then-Prime Minister Liz Truss herself was forced to resign after just 45 days in office. Banks like Citigroup were openly declaring that unless the UK got a different prime minister, the markets would continue to punish it. That is power.

Now, Congress is weighing a reconciliation bill that would increase the deficit by at least $3 trillion over 10 years, and possibly closer to $5 trillion if some of its temporary components become permanent, as seems likely. This is a big increase in America's already substantial debt burden and markets are responding accordingly. Interest rates are heading higher, especially once you adjust for inflation. Countries once infamous for fiscal mismanagement — Greece, Spain, even Italy — can now borrow more cheaply than the United States can.

The US is not the UK; the bond market cannot depose a president the way it can a prime minister, simply because prime ministers are far easier to swap out. But that doesn't mean that the bond market is powerless over US policy. It has the ability to make this tax bill much, much more costly for the US government and economy, and that ability could be decisive in shaping where the legislation goes from here.

The US issues a lot of different kinds of debt, but the kind you should pay closest attention to are 10-year bonds. These reflect the market's views on the medium- to long-run trajectory of the government and economy, whereas 30-day or six-month bonds are much shorter-run indicators. The interest rate that's most informative about government policy and long-run prospects is the “real” rate, adjusted for inflation. If inflation is 4 percent, investors will probably add about 4 percentage points to the real interest rate to make sure their investment doesn't erode in value. The real rate thus reflects how much they expect to earn for essentially lending money to the US government in addition to just keeping up with overall prices.

Here's the 10-year, adjusting for inflation, since the start of President Donald Trump's first term:

In the aftermath of Covid, rates actually went negative after taking inflation into account. This is what's sometimes called the “flight to safety”: In times of crisis, investors often move away from risky assets like stocks and toward reliable, predictable ones, like US government bonds. That drives interest rates down, sometimes even below inflation.

But since 2023 or so, rates have been much higher. There's a saying, popularized by economist Scott Sumner, that one should “never reason from a price change”: Changes in the Treasury interest rate (or the price of borrowing) could be from any number of factors, so it's too simplistic to look at what happened and say “investors decided the US government became a riskier bet.”

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

That said, when Fed economists analyzed the spike that occurred in 2023, they concluded the spike in rates was indeed due to investors reacting to changing economic conditions: The US was issuing more debt, the Federal Reserve was tightening to try to control inflation, and future economic growth in the US was looking sluggish.

Other observers in the bond market have been sounding alarms, mostly citing excessive US borrowing. In 2023, Fitch, one of the three big credit rating agencies that issues risk evaluations of bonds, downgraded US debt, which previously had a perfect AAA rating. On May 16 of this year, Moody's, another of the three, followed suit, amid tax cut negotiations in Congress. Standard & Poor's, the third rater, had already downgraded the US after the 2011 debt ceiling fight, meaning there now isn't a single rating agency giving US debt top marks.

As the 2023 downgrade indicates, this change isn't entirely due to Trump. Covid did a number on the US debt picture, with trillions of dollars in relief measures passed and implemented, and many months of lower revenues due to the 2020 recession. But in January, as Trump prepared to return to the White House, bond analysts were already forecasting higher rates, noting his penchant for tax cuts and lack of seriousness about deficits. On May 20, amid the tax fight in Congress, a batch of 20-year government bonds had trouble selling at auction, sending rates flying higher still. The bond market, it is fair to say, is not pleased with the direction this administration is going.

The nominal (that is, not adjusted for inflation) 10-year Treasury rate has grown from lows of around 3.6 percent in September to above 4.4 percent now. That, on its own, might not sound like a lot: only a 0.8-point increase?

But if you apply even a small increase in interest costs to the tens of trillions of dollars in debt the US government has outstanding, you get a very big number. Case in point: The Congressional Budget Office, as it evaluates Trump and Republicans' tax and spending proposals, is assuming 10-year interest rates of 4.1 percent this year, falling to 3.8 percent over time.

What if, instead, rates stayed higher — at 4.4 percent, say? Even that modest-sounding change would cost the US government $1.8 trillion over the next decade, per the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; for scale, that's about what Trump's more extreme tariff plans are projected to bring in.

A bond market reaction that persistently pushes up rates like this could turn a “merely” $3.1 trillion bill into a $5 trillion bill, raising the price tag by nearly 60 percent, without a single additional dollar in tax cuts or spending. By 2035, the US would be spending $2.1 trillion a year on interest, more than on defense or on Social Security, or on Medicare — some of the biggest portions of the federal budget.

That constrains politicians in both parties quite severely. It makes it harder for Republicans to pass the tax cuts they want, because they now are meaningfully more expensive. Same goes for any deficit-financed spending that Democrats may want.

Some politicians might say, “Who cares? Voters care more about tax cuts than the deficit. Why should it matter to me if some number labeled ‘deficit' goes up?” It may be true that voters can't easily parse the difference between a $1 and $2 trillion deficit. But they can definitely tell when things in their daily lives get more expensive, and higher interest costs will make everything more expensive.

Thirty-year mortgage interest rates move in almost perfect tandem with long-term government bonds, as this chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows:

This makes sense, if you think about it. When a bank issues a mortgage (or buys one from an issuer), it's lending money on a long-term basis in exchange for regular interest payments. That's exactly what an investor does when they buy a long-term government bond. Because mortgage borrowers (that is, homeowners) are typically considered riskier than the US government, they pay somewhat higher rates, but the two rates move together. If the US government starts paying more interest, mortgage borrowers will have to pay more interest too, so that banks lend to them rather than the federal government.

That means that if the bond market sends rates on US debt higher, it's not just more expensive for the government; it's more expensive for anyone who borrows. That means homeowners with mortgages, anyone with credit card debt, anyone with a car loan, anyone taking a student loan, and, perhaps most importantly, businesses taking out loans to build factories or invest in research. Good luck getting a US manufacturing renaissance going with persistently high interest rates driven by high deficits.

The odds are still high that Congress passes some kind of deficit-exploding tax bill. The House passed its version by a single vote, and while some Republican senators have voiced complaints, Republicans' 53-vote majority there means they can afford a few defectors and still pass something. Many of the Trump tax cuts passed in 2017 are set to expire next year, and the political urge to avoid a sudden spike in taxes will probably overwhelm whatever pressure the bond market brings to bear. The bond market is powerful, but Republican hatred of taxes may be more powerful.

But important Republican policymakers are paying attention. House Budget committee chair Jodey Arrington (R-TX) hinted to Politico's Victoria Guida that he thinks the markets may force more budget cuts than his party is inclined to support, saying, “If the bond markets don't think we're serious, I'm not sure it will matter what we do, because they're going to dictate the terms.”

And senators needed to get the package to the president's desk are watching too. “Have you been watching what the bond markets are doing in relation to the one big, beautiful bill?” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) asked. “They're not thinking it's a very big, beautiful bill.”

Trump's second term began with him bringing the richest man in the world to DC, with a promise to slash spending, by trillions a year if Elon Musk had his druthers. Now, Musk is leaving DC in a huff, having not meaningfully cut spending at all and by all accounts disillusioned and frustrated at his failure. But Musk is not the last figure who might try to impose austerity on DC, and while he may have hundreds of billions of dollars, the bond market wields tens of trillions. DOGE was, in retrospect, a bad joke. The bond vigilantes' coming attack may be something much more serious.

PARIS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe's security map.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.

In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron — who they say is “100% aligned” with them on the war — the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing. 

A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West's last chance to choke off the Kremlin's war economy, they said — adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports US Senators warn Russia, as it continues it's war with Ukraine.

“What I learned on this trip was he's preparing for more war,” Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation “bone-crushing” and said it would place Russia's economy “on a trade island.”

“It is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,” he said. 

At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports — targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.




Graham called it “the most draconian bill I've ever seen in my life in the Senate.”

 “The world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,” he said. “We're going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.”

With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach — blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they're crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it's too late.

Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal — a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.

“Putin is playing President Trump,” Blumenthal said. “He's taking him for a sucker.” The senator said Putin “is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.”

Graham added: “We saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He's preparing for more war.”

Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: “I don't know. I'll have to see it.” Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump's advisers.

Graham backed the president's diplomatic instincts but said, “By trying to engage Putin — by being friendly and enticing — it's become painfully clear he's not interested in ending this war.”

Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate — and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office— may help shift the conversation.

“He needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,” he said of Putin.

In Kyiv, the senators said, the war's human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia — calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.

Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. “Putin is a thug. He's a murderer.”

Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.

After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.

“This visit has been a breakthrough moment because President Macron has shown moral clarity in his conversations with us,” Blumenthal said. “Today, he is 100% aligned with that message that we are taking back to Washington.”

Blumenthal pointed to the rare bipartisan unity behind the sanctions bill. “There are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,” he said. “The cause of Ukraine is doing it.”

Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow.

“President Trump said we'll know in two weeks whether he's being strung along,” Graham said. “There will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.”

﻿To save the humanities, we need to rethink our assumptions about AI — and education.

by  Sigal Samuel

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form or email sigal.samuel@vox.com. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I am a university teaching assistant, leading discussion sections for large humanities lecture classes. This also means I grade a lot of student writing — and, inevitably, see a lot of AI writing too. 

Of course, many of us are working on developing assignments and pedagogies to make that less tempting. But as a TA, I only have limited ability to implement these policies. And in the meantime, AI-generated writing is so ubiquitous that to take course policy on it seriously, or even to escalate every suspected instance to the professor who runs the course, would be to make dozens of accusations, some of them false positives, for basically every assignment.

I believe in the numinous, ineffable value of a humanities education, but I'm also not going to convince stressed 19-year-olds of that value by cracking down hard on something everyone does. How do I think about the ethics of enforcing the rules of an institution that they don't take seriously, or letting things slide in the name of building a classroom that feels less like an obstacle to circumvent?

Dear Troubled Teacher, 

I know you said you believe in the “ineffable value of a humanities education,” but if we want to actually get clear on your dilemma, that ineffable value must be effed! 

So: What is the real value of a humanities education? 

Looking at the modern university, one might think the humanities aren't so different from the STEM fields. Just as the engineering department or the math department justifies its existence by pointing to the products it creates — bridge designs, weather forecasts — humanities departments nowadays justify their existence by noting that their students create products, too: literary interpretations, cultural criticism, short films. 

But let's be real: It's the neoliberalization of the university that has forced the humanities into that weird contortion. That's never what they were supposed to be. Their real aim, as the philosopher Megan Fritts writes, is “the formation of human persons.” 

In other words, while the purpose of other departments is ultimately to create a product, a humanities education is meant to be different, because the student herself is the product. She is what's getting created and recreated by the learning process.

This vision of education — as a pursuit that's supposed to be personally transformative — is what Aristotle proposed back in Ancient Greece. He believed the real goal was not to impart knowledge, but to cultivate the virtues: honesty, justice, courage, and all the other character traits that make for a flourishing life. 

But because flourishing is devalued in our hypercapitalist society, you find yourself caught between that original vision and today's product-based, utilitarian vision. And students sense — rightly! — that generative AI proves the utilitarian vision for the humanities is a sham. 

As one student said to his professor at New York University, in an effort to justify using AI to do his work for him, “You're asking me to go from point A to point B, why wouldn't I use a car to get there?” It's a completely logical argument — as long as you accept the utilitarian vision. 

The real solution, then, is to be honest about what the humanities are for: You're in the business of helping students with the cultivation of their character. 

I know, I know: Lots of students will say, “I don't have time to work on cultivating my character! I just need to be able to get a job!”

It's totally fair for them to be focusing on their job prospects. But your job is to focus on something else — something that will help them flourish in the long run, even if they don't fully see the value in it now. 

Your job is to be their Aristotle. 

For the Ancient Greek philosopher, the mother of all virtues was phronesis, or practical wisdom. And I'd argue there's nothing more useful you can do for your students than help them cultivate this virtue, which is made more, not less, relevant by the advent of AI.

Practical wisdom goes beyond just knowing general rules — “don't lie,” for example — and applying them mechanically like some sort of moral robot. It's about knowing how to make good judgments when faced with the complex, dynamic situations life throws at you. Sometimes that'll actually mean violating a classic rule (in certain cases, you should lie!). If you've honed your practical wisdom, you'll be able to discern the morally salient features of a particular situation and come up with a response that's well-attuned to that context. 

This is exactly the sort of deliberation that students will need to be good at as they step into the wider world. The breakneck pace of technological innovation means they're going to have to choose, again and again and again, how to make use of emerging technologies — and how not to. The best training they can get now is training in how to wisely make this type of choice. 

Unfortunately, that's exactly what using generative AI in the classroom threatens to short-circuit, because it removes something incredibly valuable: friction. 

Encountering friction is how we give our cognitive muscles a workout. Taking it out of the picture makes things easier in the short term, but in the long term, it can lead to intellectual deskilling, where our cognitive muscles gradually become weaker for lack of use. 

“Practical wisdom is built up by practice just like all the other virtues, so if you don't have the opportunity to reason and don't have practice in deliberating about certain things, you won't be able to deliberate well later,” philosopher of technology Shannon Vallor told me last year. “We need a lot of cognitive exercise in order to develop practical wisdom and retain it. And there is reason to worry about cognitive automation depriving us of the opportunity to build and retain those cognitive muscles.” 

So, how do you help your students retain and build their phronesis? You add friction back in, by giving them as many opportunities as possible to practice deliberating and choosing. 

If I were designing the curriculum, I wouldn't do that by adopting a strict “no AI” policy. Instead, I'd be honest with students about the real benefit of the humanities and about why mindless AI cheating would be cheating themselves out of that benefit. Then, I'd offer them two choices when it comes time to write an essay: They can either write it with help from AI, or without. Both are totally fine. 

But if they do get help from AI, they have to also write an in-class reflection piece, explaining why they chose to use a chatbot and how they think it changed their thinking and learning process. I'd make it shorter than the original assignment but longer than a paragraph, so it forces them to develop the very reasoning skills they were trying to avoid using.

As a TA, you could suggest this to professors, but they may not go for it. Unfortunately, you've got limited agency here (unless you're willing to risk your job or walk away from it). All you can do in such a situation is exercise the agency you do have. So use every bit of it.

Since you lead discussion sections, you're well-placed to prompt your students to work their cognitive muscles in conversation. You could even stage a debate about AI: Assign half of them to argue the case for using chatbots to write papers and half of them to argue the opposite.

If a professor insists on a strict “no AI” policy, and you encounter essays that seem clearly AI-written, you may have little choice but to report them. But if there's room for doubt about a given essay, you might err on the side of leniency if the student has engaged very thoughtfully in the discussion. At least then you know they've achieved the most important aim.

None of this is easy. I feel for you and all other educators who are struggling in this confusing environment. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some educators are suffering from moral injury, a psychological condition that arises when you feel you've been forced to violate your own values.

But maybe it can comfort you to remember that this is much bigger than you. Generative AI is an existential threat to a humanities education as currently constituted. Over the next few years, humanities departments will have to paradigm-shift or perish. If they want to survive, they'll need to get brutally honest about their true mission. For now, from your pre-paradigm-shift perch, all you can do is make the choices that are left for you to make.

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin joins ICE in Boston as they arrest criminal migrants, including an alleged murderer and child rapists. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reacts to push back to the Trump admin's deportation agenda.

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey took to social media Sunday evening to demand answers after ICE agents arrested a high school student heading to volleyball practice over the weekend.

The student, 18-year-old Marcelo Gomes, is a junior at Milford High School in Milford, Massachusetts. 

In her post, Healey says she is "disturbed and outraged" and that she wants answers immediately explaining why the student was taken into immigration enforcement's custody.

"I'm demanding that ICE provide immediate information about why he was arrested, where he is and how his due process is being protected," she s.

In the post she blames the Trump admin for what she describes as an attempt to create fear.

"The Trump Administration continues to create fear in our communities, and it's making us all less safe," her post states.

In her statement, Healey claims that the student was detained on Saturday without any warning or subsequent explanation provided to state officials.

"Yet again, local officials and law enforcement have been left in the dark with no heads up and no answers to their questions," she said.

The community gathered to protest outside of Milford on Sunday. Hundreds demanded Gomes be set free and that ICE stop harassing members of their community.

DEM GOVERNOR BACKS ICE ARRESTING 'CRIMINALS' DESPITE VOWING TO USE 'EVERY TOOL' AGAINST TRUMP DEPORTATIONS

U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat who represents Milford in Congress, attended the protest and made note on X that Gomes was "enrolled in honors classes, a coaching assistant for girls volleyball [and] player for boys volleyball, and a member of the school band." 

"This administration has its public safety priorities backwards. It pardons cop-beaters from Jan. 6 but detains high-school volleyball players. It makes gun-purchaser background checks harder while pushing for tax breaks to buy silencers for pistols. This reckless behavior does not make the residents of Milford safer, and I stand with the community in support of law [and] order," he wrote.

( Rep. Jake Auchincloss on X)

Milford School District Superintendent Kevin McIntyre says that Gomes' detention is one of many apprehensions to take place in the southern Massachusetts community.

McIntyre says the district cannot take any role in immigration enforcement, but they will "support all of our students and families, including those who are immigrants to the United States."

"They are members of the community, students in our classrooms, athletes that compete representing Milford, musicians, artists, friends, and neighbors. We will do everything in our power to support our students and families during these difficult times," he said in his statement.

Sunday morning was Milford High School's graduation and Healey says a day of celebration has now been tarnished.

"My heart goes out to the Milford community on what was supposed to be a celebratory graduation day," she said.

Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli-American Council, spoke with Fox News Digital about the terror attack on Sunday in Boulder, Colorado.

U.S. lawmakers, Trump administration officials and Jewish groups were among those who condemned the terror attack that left eight people injured in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday, calling it a "monstrous attack" and an "act of vile antisemitism."

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene, after he allegedly set victims on fire as they peacefully rallied on behalf of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman was heard yelling "Free Palestine" and other criticisms of Israel during the attack.

Soliman, an Egyptian national, entered the U.S. in 2022 with authorization but has since overstayed his visa, according to authorities. Local and federal law enforcement continue to investigate the attack.

"My thoughts and prayers go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community," Colorado Democrat Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, said in a statement. "Boulder is strong. We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community."

"As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot," he continued. "Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."

The governor said he is working closely with local and federal law enforcement following Sunday's attack. Colorado Democrat Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is also Jewish, said the attack appears to have been motivated by hate.

Colorado's Democrat Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper both slammed the attack as a display of hate against the Jewish community.

"My thoughts are with the victims of the horrifying terror attack that occurred this afternoon in Boulder," Bennet said. "Hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado."

"Hate of any kind has no home in Colorado," Hickenlooper wrote. "We're monitoring the reports of a horrific terror attack in Boulder this afternoon. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is Jewish, described the attack as a "vile, antisemitic act of terror" and stressed that antisemitism "has no place in America."

"Less than two weeks after the horrific antisemitic attack at the Capitol Jewish Museum in DC — and after two relentless years of surging antisemitic attacks across the country— the Jewish community is once again shattered by pain and heartbreak," Schumer said in a statement. "Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror. Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror."

SHOOTING AT CAPITAL JEWISH MUSEUM HIGHLIGHTS RISING WAVE OF ANTI-JEWISH HATE CRIMES

"When antisemitism is allowed to fester, when it spreads unchecked, and when too many look the other way, history has shown us where it leads: to hatred, to violence, to terror," he continued. "Tonight is Shavuot—a sacred holiday of learning, renewal, and unity. Thousands of Jews around the world will wake up to this horrific news, just as they did after October 7. For many, it's been over 600 days of unrelenting fear and trauma."

Schumer added: "Antisemitism, plain and simple, has no place in America. I am praying for the victims' recovery and am in touch with the FBI as we closely monitor the situation."

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said this "violent, antisemitic attack is heartbreaking and deeply disturbing" and that he is praying for the victims and for law enforcement "to deliver swift justice."

"Terrorist sympathizers have made it clear they will do anything to try and silence the Jewish people and those who support Israel," Johnson wrote. "We CANNOT and WILL NOT let them win."

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the Jewish community in America has once again become the target of a horrific, antisemitic attack."

"As residents of Boulder gathered on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot to raise awareness for the hostages still being held captive in Gaza, the peacefulness of their assembly was shattered," he said. "Our heartfelt prayers are with all of our Jewish brothers and sisters impacted by this unconscionable act of terror, and we thank law enforcement for their swift response. Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed. We stand with the Jewish community today and always."

"Another act of horrific, vile antisemitism and terrorism in our country, as an individual violently attacked a peaceful crowd in Boulder, Colorado, gathered to call for the release of the hostages still held in Gaza since Hamas' terror attacks on October 7, 2023," the Democratic mayor said. "While we see no nexus to NYC at this time, the NYPD is increasing resources at religious sites throughout our city ahead of the sacred holiday of Shavuot out of an abundance of caution. We will not rest until we root out this unacceptable violence and rhetoric from our communities."

Several Trump administration officials condemned the attack and gave updates on the federal investigations.

"We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado," FBI director Kash Patel said. "Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available."

"DHS is monitoring the terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado," Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said. "We are working with our interagency partners, including the FBI, and will share more information as soon as it becomes available. We are praying for the victims and their families. This violence must stop."

Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security advisor, said he is praying "for the victims of the evil and monstrous attack in Boulder, Colorado."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also offered prayers for the victims as they recover from the attack.

"My wife and I and the entire state of Israel pray for the full recovery of the wounded in the vicious terror attack that took place in Boulder, Colorado," he said.

"This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews," the prime minister continued. "I trust the United States authorities to prosecuting the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law and doing everything possible to prevent future attacks against innocent civilians. The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped."

Various Jewish groups also sounded off after the attack in Colorado on Sunday, with Israeli-American Council CEO Elan Carr saying it was a "horrific attack on peaceful demonstrators who were walking in a march to commemorate and demand the release of hostages."

"I'm not suggesting the answer is censorship, but we have to understand that hateful words that demonize Jews prompt people to take violent action and commit murder," Carr told Fox News Digital. "We've seen this over and over and over again, and it happened today, and it happened a few days ago, and if we don't stop this, it's going to happen again. This is an absolute outrage that we have people who are being poisoned by vicious ideology."

The American Jewish Committee said the incident represented "another vile attack against Jews in America."

"Less than two weeks after the horrific murders in D.C., an attacker in Colorado firebombed a group calling for the release of the 58 Israeli hostages who have been held by terrorists in Gaza for 604 days," the group said in a statement. "This hatred is a dangerous poison, and we need everyone to stand up with us against it. Enough is enough."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Boulder, Colorado terror attack suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45.

The suspect accused in a "targeted terror attack" in Boulder, Colorado, where a pro-Israel group was advocating for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages, was in the United States illegally, Fox News has learned.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested and taken to the hospital with minor injuries after his alleged attack on the "Run for Their Lives" group that was gathering on Pearl Street, police said Sunday night. 

The group is a grassroots organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. This particular chapter of the group meets on a weekly basis, police said.

Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa after entering the U.S. during the Biden administration, three Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sources told Fox News.

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa. 

He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 

On March 29, 2023, Soliman was granted work authorization, which was valid through March of this year.

"A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien," White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on X. "He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed."

Soliman was allegedly yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack, which was near the county courthouse on Pearl Street. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with weapon setting people on fire.

The FBI said eight people, ages 52 to 88, were injured and taken to the hospital. One of those victims is considered to be in critical condition.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of "ideologically motivated violence," based on early information, evidence and witness accounts.

The man accused of a fire attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, was charged with multiple counts of attempted murder on Monday in state court as prosecutors asked that a judge order him held on a $10 million cash bond "given the seriousness of the crimes."

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was also hit with a federal hate crime charge by prosecutors, who revealed he confessed that he had planned the horrific assault for a year, and waited until his daughter graduated from school to commit it.

An FBI affidavit filed as part of that federal complaint said there is probable cause to believe the married father of five attacked the demonstrators on Sunday with a makeshift flamethrower because they were supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages still being held by the Palestinian terror group Hamas.

Soliman, 45, is due to appear Monday afternoon in Boulder court to face state charges related to the attack, which left eight people hospitalized with burns and other injuries.

He is charged there with eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation, and another eight counts of attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference. Soliman also faces six counts of first-degree assault on an at-risk victim, two counts of possession of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted possession of an incendiary device.

He is charged in U.S. District Court in Colorado with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.

Prosecutors plan to ask a federal judge to detain Soliman in the federal case without bail.

An affidavit signed by an FBI agent says that Soliman threw "Molotov cocktails into a pro-Israel crowd while yelling 'Free Palestine.' "

The affidavit says that after he was detained by law enforcement, authorities found a black plastic container with a yellow top near the site of the arrest.

In that container "were at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Bell jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles," the affidavit says.

The liquid in those bottles, and a backpack weed sprayer also found nearby, was determined to be 87 octane gasoline, the agent wrote.

Authorities who searched Soliman's 2015 Toyota Prius found a red gas container inside, and "paperwork with the words, 'Israel,' 'Palestine,' and 'USAID,' " which is the acronym for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the affidavit said

"Soliman as placed under arrest and a mirandized interview was conducted by local and federal law enforcement," the affidavit said.

"During the interview, Soliman stated that he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them," the agent wrote.

"He traveled to Boulder, Colorado in his vehicle with the Molotov cocktails and threw two of the cocktails at individuals participating in a pro-Israel gathering. He also stated that he picked up gas at a gas station on the way to Boulder," the affidavit said. "He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead."

"Soliman stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again. He specifically targeted the 'Zionist Group' that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search."

"Throughout the interview, Soliman stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over 'our land,' which he explained to be Palestine," the affidavit said.

"He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack."

Shortly before the federal hate crime charge was revealed, President Donald Trump condemned the attack and blamed former President Joe Biden for a border policy that Trump said allowed entry to the accused assailant.

"Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America," Trump wrote in a social media post.

"He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly," Trump wrote. "He must go out under "TRUMP" Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law."

"This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!"

Soliman was in the United States illegally on an expired work permit, according to the White House.

AI is already taking human jobs, but Google DeepMind's CEO says the disruption will lead to the creation of new, "very valuable" roles.

Speaking at SXSW London on Monday, Demis Hassabis said he expects AI to be a bigger transformation than the Industrial Revolution, but he is optimistic because humans are "infinitely adaptable."

"I think new jobs will appear, new very valuable jobs," he said, adding that AI over the next five to 10 years will "supercharge sort of technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies."

Hassabis said today's children will grow up "AI native" in the way the previous generation did with the internet. However, when it comes to choosing what to study, Hassabis said he would still recommend studying STEM subjects.

He said it's "still important to understand fundamentals" in areas including mathematics, physics, and computer science to understand "how these systems are put together."

Speaking at Google's I/O developer conference last week, Hassabis and Google cofounder Sergey Brin predicted AGI — the moment AI reaches or surpasses human intelligence — will arrive around 2030.

But AI is already rapidly transforming the job market. Some companies are dialling down hiring for roles that can be done with AI, and companies such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google are increasingly using the technology to write code.

While Hassabis said he'd still study STEM subjects, he recommended that people get experience using AI tools.

"I'd also be experimenting with all the latest AI systems and tools and seeing what's the best way of utilising them and making use of them in useful and novel ways, so I would be embracing that and hacking around with those tools," he said.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets ended the first trading day of the week lower.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.1%, France's CAC 40 was lower by 0.2%, and Germany's DAX was off by 0.3%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed marginally in the black, with a 0.02% gain.

President Donald Trump's move to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% is likely to bite wind energy developer Orsted, according to analysts.

The Danish multinational booked a loss of 1.2 billion Danish kroner ($183 million) in its first-quarter results in May after the U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. The company suggested the levy had hit the profitability of its Sunrise and Revolution Wind projects, as it had yet to import wind turbines into the U.S.

"Assuming Orsted have yet to move these equipment into the US in the weeks following the results, the announced 50% tariff is likely to lead to another c.DKK1.2bn impairment in 2Q," said Citi analysts led by Jenny Ping in a note to clients on June 2. "We continue to wait for clarity around the outcome of US/EU tariff negotiation, which Orsted said a 20% tariff could add c.DKK 0.6bn, which has yet to be recognized in its accounts."

The Wall Street bank analysts downgraded the stock to a "Sell" rating, saying "these tariff risks does not help Orsted's equity story."

Sydbank analysts agree that the raised tariff will hurt Orsted, but maintain their "Buy" rating.

"Ørsted is particularly hard hit by the steel and aluminum tariffs because the company does not have a local offshore wind turbine supply chain in the US," said Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank.

"We do not expect the increased tariffs to have an impact on Ørsted's plans to implement the two American projects. However, the tariff increase will again reduce the profitability of Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind compared to Ørsted's original assumptions."

Shares of Sweden's SSAB were 6.36% higher at 2 p.m. in London. The steel producer is "a beneficiary of higher US plate pricing," analysts at Jefferies said in a Monday note, as investors assess the impact of a potential increase in U.S. steel tariffs to 50% from 25% starting Wednesday.

More broadly, the higher tariffs are a headwind for European steel companies which export to the U.S., analysts Cole Hathorn and Tommaso Castello also noted.

However, they continued that higher prices would benefit SSAB's Americas division, which the company says is the largest heavy plate producer in North America.

The mood in equities remains downbeat in Europe, with the regional Stoxx 600 index 0.25% lower at 10:30 a.m. U.K. time as investors eye the potential for escalating U.S.-EU tariffs. Autos stocks on the index are down 1.75%, technology stocks are down 1.2% and household goods are down 1%.

Oil and gas stocks remain on the rise, moving in tandem with higher crude prices after OPEC+ announced a supply hike rate lower than some analysts expected.

The Stoxx aerospace and defense index is 0.45% higher. Germany's Hensoldt has jumped 11.6% after analysts at JPMorgan upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral.

The sector is also getting a boost from U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who outlined a series of new defense spending commitments, including new attack submarines.

Shares of Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk climbed 3% Monday as telehealth platform Hims & Hers is reportedly set to cut 4% of its workforce amid a U.S. ban on copycat weight loss drugs.

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo has been battling a slowdown in sales in its largest market as a drug shortage ruling by the Food and Drug Administration had permitted the rise of cheaper compounded obesity drugs.

The FDA declared the shortage over in February and gave compounding pharmacies until May 22 to cease selling copies of the drug.

The British pound is up 0.7% against the U.S. dollar at 8:45 a.m. in London, nudging it back above the $1.35 level it has largely traded below for the last week.

The euro is 0.75% higher on the greenback, which is suffering as trade tensions escalate.

"Trump's protectionist policies, speculated desire for a weaker [U.S. dollar] and tax bill seem to have accelerated the USD decline of late," analysts at Maybank said Monday.

"Trump's capricious nature may continue to inject volatility in the markets but unlike past episodes of risk aversion, the USD was punished most discernibly as part of the "Sell America" narrative."

European equities are seeing a broadly negative start to the new trading week and month.

The regional Stoxx 600 index is down 0.18%, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX lower by 0.43% and 0.22%, respectively. The U.K.'s FTSE 100, however, pushed 0.08% higher, helped by an 0.57% rise in oil and gas stocks as prices jump.

Autos stocks fell 1.4% amid fears that a slew of recent developments in the Trump tariff story could lead to more stringent tariffs on the sector, particularly after the U.S. president unexpectedly announced a hike in steel duties to 50%. Risk-sensitive technology stocks dropped 1%.

— Jenni Reid

Spot gold prices are up by around 1.5% ahead of the stock market open at $3,337 an ounce, the highest level for a week.

The market safe haven may be holding more appeal as investors ponder whether U.S. President Donald Trump will take even more aggressive tariff action against certain countries and sectors, and as fighting escalates in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Oil prices are also gaining — ICE Brent Crude futures with August expiry are trading 2.29% higher at $64.22 per barrel. Producer association OPEC+ on Saturday announced a supply increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July, similar to its hikes in May and June.

ING strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey said in a Monday note that prices may nonetheless be rallying because there were suggestions the supply increase could have been even bigger.

French pharmaceutical group Sanofi announced this morning that it will acquire Massachusetts-based Blueprint Medicines Corporation for an equity value of $9.1 billion, a move to expand its portfolio in rare immunological diseases.

Key to the deal is the drug Ayvakit/Ayvakyt, which has been approved in the U.S. and EU and is used to treat advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis.

Good morning from London, where futures data from IG suggest stock markets will nudge higher at the open — following declines in France, Germany and Italy.

U.S. tariffs will be in focus yet again this week, after President Donald Trump said Friday that he will double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50% on June 4. The European Union criticized the move over the weekend, saying it undermines wider trade negotiations and will lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

Investors will also be monitoring any developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China, which soured last week. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett suggested Sunday that Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could have a conversation as soon as this week.

China on Monday refuted Washington's claims that it had broken the Geneva trade agreement, instead accusing the U.S. for breaching deal terms, signaling talks between the worlds top two economies have taken a turn for the worse.

Trade frictions between Washington and Beijing have flared up after a hiatus following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng in Geneva, Switzerland, that had led them to suspend most tariffs on each other goods for 90 days.

The Trump administration has ratcheted up export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, while announcing it would revoke visas for Chinese students, drawing ire from Beijing.

War in Ukraine:

Russia and Ukraine wrapped up a second round of talks in Istanbul that failed to bring the two sides closer to ending the war, but laid the groundwork for a new exchange of prisoners.

The Russian delegation handed over peace proposals that include Kyiv surrendering control of territory it still holds in four partially occupied regions, a Ukrainian official said.

Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender said Monday that the Trump administration continues "to make very good progress" on trade negotiations, and it is "close to the finish line on a couple" of deals.

"As long as we continue to make progress, I think you're going to see a lot more deals that are announced prior to that July 9 time frame," Faulkender said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

President Donald Trump on April 9 paused his "reciprocal" tariffs on most U.S. trade partners for 90 days, pushing implementation of the steep levies to early July.

At the time, the Trump administration said it was aiming to close "90 deals in 90 days."

But nearly two months after the April announcement, the White House has so far only announced a deal with Britain.

Nonetheless, top Trump advisors have indicated they do not plan to extend the 90-day deadline.

Faulkender said the White House is looking "to conclude as many of these discussion as we can" before the 90-day pause expires, noting that negotiations "are sometimes complicated."

"We want to see that we reach at least terms of an agreement prior to the expiration of that pause, as long as [trade partners] make progress and demonstrate goodwill, we will continue to make progress towards announcing those deals," he said.

"We look to make announcements and bring some resolution, both to the American people and to markets, as quickly as we can," he added.

Faulkender also said the White House negotiators "continue to make very good progress on a couple of countries that should be imminent."

Major U.S. stock indexes opened lower Monday, weighed down by investor concerns about escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

The monthslong tariff-fueled trade war between the two countries appeared to de-escalate last month, following negotiations in Switzerland. But they flared again last week, when the Trump administration accused China of violating a preliminary trade agreement by slow-walking its pledge to renew exporting critical minerals to the U.S.

China pushed back against Trump's claims on Monday, and countered that the U.S. had undermined the Geneva deal by imposing new restrictions on Chinese student visas, among other measures.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett signaled Sunday that Trump and China's President Xi Jinping could hold a direct talk as soon as this week.

President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week, a senior White House official told CNBC on Monday.

The expected discussion follows a series of flare-ups between Washington and Beijing that threaten to derail a tentative trade agreement that the two economic superpowers reached just weeks earlier.

The two leaders could speak one-on-one "very soon," though probably not today, the official said on condition of anonymity.

U.S. market indexes opened lower on Monday morning, as investors responded to the increasingly confrontational tone of public messages between the U.S. and China.

Trade between the countries — who rely heavily on each others' business — was effectively crushed in April, when Trump ratcheted blanket tariffs on Chinese imports up to 145% and Beijing issued steep retaliatory duties. The two sides agreed to scale back most of those tariffs for 90 days following an initial round of trade negotiations in Switzerland in mid-May.

But each nation has since accused the other of undermining the agreements struck in Geneva.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has accused China of slow-walking renewed exports of critical minerals to the United States, while Beijing has called out Washington for issuing a warning against using Chinese chips.

On Monday, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson accused the U.S. of trying to "unilaterally provoke new economic and trade frictions, increasing the uncertainty and instability in the bilateral economic and trade relations."

Trump administration officials have acknowledged that progress in U.S.-China trade talks has slowed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday that breaking the logjam will "require both leaders to weigh in with each other."

But Trump has vented frustration with China as the roadblocks have emerged. 

"China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Friday. 

"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!" he wrote.

Online sports betting stocks retreated Monday after Illinois lawmakers approved a budget that again raised taxes on wagers, heightening investor alarm that other states could follow suit.

DraftKings dropped 6%, while Flutter Entertainment shares fell more than 2%. The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (BETZ) pulled back by more than 1%.

Both chambers of Illinois' state legislature passed a budget that includes a tax of 25 cents per wager on the first 20 million online sports bets made each fiscal year, rising to 50 cents per bet after.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a statement saying he would sign the budget, according to local news reports.

Truist analyst Barry Jonas called the duties a last-minute surprise, adding that it's the second straight year of the state slapped an unexpected tax on the industry. Under the latest plan, Jonas said Illinois' rate will be among the highest in the country.

Jonas said DraftKings and Flutter's FanDuel should both "certainly" surpass 20 million wagers, meaning they'll face the higher tax rate on a portion of their bets.

But Jonas called the impact for smaller competitors in the market more "modest." Still, shares of MGM Resorts, which owns the BetMGM platform through a 50/50 joint venture with Entain, declined 1.5%. Penn Entertainment, partners in the ESPN Bet platform, shed 0.3%.

Now, Wall Street is left wondering if other states will follow Illinois' lead and try and plug their budget deficits by either adopting or increasing online sports gambling taxes.

Statewide levies on digital sports bets at the start of 2024 ranged from 51% in New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island to 6.75% in states like Nevada and Iowa, according to a report from the Tax Foundation. Only 27 states and D.C. allow online sports betting statewide, according to the nonprofit.

U.S. President Donald Trump surprised markets yet again with an abrupt announcement on Friday that he will hike tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50% on Wednesday.

But while the inflationary impact on U.S. domestic prices is widely expected to be severe, the effect in Europe will be more mixed, according to analysts — with some buyers and manufacturers able to benefit from lower prices.

"This was an absolute surprise. Already steel prices in the U.S. are higher than anywhere else, and it is a net importer which needs to have volumes coming in. All this does is raise prices there," Josh Spoores, head of steel Americas analysis at CRU, told CNBC on Monday.

Canada and Mexico are the biggest exporters of steel to the U.S., with other major sources including Brazil, South Korea and Germany.

The latest tariff news could see steel redirected to other markets such as Europe, Spoores said, putting downward pressure on prices.

"Some manufacturers in Europe might do better building products that are steel intensive at home and exporting them to the U.S. as prices rise there," he continued. "Automotives, construction products and appliances are all products that are going to feel the impact."

He said that, in Europe, steel buyers are potentially winners.

But not all companies are expected to benefit. 

Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, noted in emailed comments that Germany's BMW had separated out the expected impact of different tariffs in its 2024 results and flagged a negative effect — to the tune of "a high three-digit million amount" — from the existing 25% steel and aluminum duties.

BMW shares were 1.8% lower in early afternoon deals on Monday, with the wider European autos sector down 1.8%. Suskin continued that some of the impact of 50% tariffs would be offset for BMW by the recent loosening of autos restrictions by Trump, and also flagged the potential for a future deal between the White House and German automakers.

Danish wind energy developer Orsted could also be negatively impacted, Citi analysts led by Jenny Ping said in a note to clients, because it does not have a local offshore wind turbine supply chain in the U.S.

Trump's latest moves will have a major impact on Europe's steel industry — which is still reeling from the 25% duty imposed in March — according to Kaye Ayub, head of price analysis and forecasts at U.K.-based steel market consultancy MEPS International.

"Steel demand is already low across Europe, eroding prices and domestic steelmaker's profit margins. This has forced many producers to cut production and close plants as they struggle to compete with low-cost steel imports produced in countries where production costs are much lower," she said.

The European Union sharply criticized Trump's announcement over the weekend, threatening countermeasures and arguing that the decision "adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic."

Any curtailment of the 3.89 million metric tons of EU-produced steel that was exported to the U.S. in 2024 due to trade barriers would "likely exacerbate steel oversupply in Europe, applying increased downward pressure to selling prices," Ayub noted.

She agreed that some low-cost Asian-origin steel destined for the U.S. will be diverted to Europe. "Even with the EU and U.K.'s trade defense measures, this could undermine domestic producers' attempts to maintain profitability."

Conversely, U.S. steelmakers may benefit from higher selling prices if further increases now occur, even as costs increase for U.S. manufacturers and stoke inflation, she added.

It remains unclear what Trump's latest jolting of the market could mean for the U.K., which announced the outline of a U.S. trade deal in May but has not yet secured an exemption from steel tariffs.

Gareth Stace, head of industry body UK Steel, said in a statement that domestic steel firms were "fearful that orders will now be canceled, some of which are likely being shipped across the Atlantic."

Overall, Trump's latest announcement adds to the growing headache for almost all businesses as a result of volatile trade policy, said CRU's Josh Spoores.

"I don't expect this to be policy in three months. Even three weeks it's unclear," he told CNBC.

"These tariffs are at such a high level and in the U.S. they will affect a massive community of manufacturers which make a huge contribution to GDP and employment, so there will be lobbying on this."

Campbell's has seen customers prepare their own meals at the highest rate in about half a decade, offering the latest sign of everyday people tightening their wallets amid economic concerns.

"Consumers are cooking at home at the highest levels since early 2020," Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen said Monday, adding that consumption has increased among all income brackets in the meals and beverages category.

Beekhuizen drew parallels between today and the time when Americans were facing the early stages of what would become a global pandemic. It was a period of broad economic uncertainty as the Covid virus affected every aspect of everyday life and caused massive shakeups in spending and employments trends.

The trends seen by the Pepperidge Farm and V-8 maker comes as Wall Street and economists wonder what's next for the U.S. economy after President Donald Trump's tariff policy raised recession fears and battered consumer sentiment.

More meals at home could mean people are eating out less, showing Americans tightening their belts. That can spell bad news for gross domestic product, two thirds of which relies on consumer spending. A recession is commonly defined as two straight quarters of the GDP shrinking.

It can also underscore the souring outlook of everyday Americans on the national economy. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index last month fell to one of its lowest levels on record.

Campbell's remarks came after the soup maker beat Wall Street expectations in its fiscal third quarter. The Goldfish and Rao's parent earned 73 cents per share, excluding one-time items, on $2.48 billion in revenue, while analysts polled by FactSet anticipated 65 cents and $2.43 billion, respectively.

Shares added 0.6% in Monday's. Despite that gain, the stock has tumbled more than 18% in 2025.

Stephen Curry isn't retiring from the National Basketball Association yet, but he's already thinking about new career paths — including broadcasting, team ownership and playing on the PGA Tour Champions.

The Golden State Warriors star spoke to CNBC Sport as part of "Curry Inc.: The Business of Stephen Curry," a television production centered on Curry's career and business ambitions.

CNBC Sport's "Curry Inc.: The Business of Stephen Curry" will premiere on CNBC on Wednesday, June 4, at 9 p.m. ET.

Curry, 37, already has one post-NBA job waiting for him. He's the CEO of Thirty Ink, a mini-conglomerate of businesses including Unanimous Media, the bourbon brand Gentleman's Cut and 7k marketing consultancy. He plans to take a more central role running the business on a day-to-day basis when he retires from professional basketball, he told CNBC Sport.

Still, Curry is thinking beyond his company. He's looking to follow in the footsteps of Michael Jordan, who owned the Charlotte Hornets from 2010 to 2023 — the only former NBA player to hold a majority stake in a team.

"He might be the only one in our generation who has sat in that seat and done it that way," Curry said. "The idea of being a part of an ownership group and the right opportunity that allows me to have an impact on how a franchise should be operated — how you're going after true winning, like we've done here with the Warriors — that's something I'm excited about pursuing. It's interesting. Obviously, as an active player, you can't participate in that level until you're done. So you'll see me in the seat somewhere down the road."

Curry noted that he may not be able to afford majority ownership with rising NBA valuations. The average NBA team is worth $4.66 billion, according to CNBC Sport's official 2025 valuations. 

"Obviously there are levels to this," Curry said.

Curry is an investor in Unrivaled, the women's 3-on-3 basketball league, and has said he also has interest in buying a Women's National Basketball Association team.

Sportico named Curry the second-highest paid athlete in the world last year, earning an estimated $153.8 million between salary and endorsements. Forbes estimates Jordan's net worth is around $3.5 billion.

Curry agreed to a one-year, $62.6 million extension with the Golden State Warriors last year, keeping him under team control until 2027. He made more than $55 million in salary for the 2024-25 season, and he's the first player in NBA history to make $40 million, $50 million and $60 million in a season. He has had the highest base salary in the league since 2017.

Curry has used his venture Unanimous Media to springboard a career in front of the camera. He has appeared in several projects including the Peacock sitcom "Mr. Throwback" and the Apple TV+ documentary "Stephen Curry: Underrated."

Still, he could likely make millions by joining an NBA studio show on NBC, ESPN or Amazon Prime Video when he retires. Curry said he would "for sure" consider a broadcasting job, though he won't rush into it.

"I would be more patient," said Curry, who noted former National Football League quarterback Tom Brady moved directly into the Fox broadcast booth after retirement and his current teammate Draymond Green has been a TNT Sports NBA analyst for years as an active player.

"I think about what would be the right opportunity for me, 'cause anything that I do, I want to be all in on it," Curry said. "Right now, just doing your homework on the different pathways and options that might be available."

Curry said he's also already contemplating a career playing on the PGA Tour Champions, the top tour for former PGA players over 50 years old.

The concept of Curry competing with pros for championships may seem farcical, but he's taking it seriously. It's a long way off — Curry turns 50 in 13 years — but he is a scratch golfer without dedicating his life to playing.

He won the 2023 American Century Championship, an annual celebrity tournament that takes place each summer in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, defeating other current and former professional athletes that are top golfers. Curry shot a final round 72 to win the tournament.

"That would be a fun goal to go after for sure," Curry said. "It's an extremely challenging tour to crack if you're not one of the champion ex-PGA guys that are making that jump after you turn 50. So to do all the qualifying journey and all that — I'm pretty sure I'll try it. I've seen guys who are preparing themselves to do the same thing."

In this article

Major steel stocks jumped Monday after President Donald Trump hiked tariffs tied to the metal.

Shares of mining company Cleveland-Cliffs popped roughly 22% following the announcement, while Steel Dynamics jumped more than 13% and Nucor was up more than 12%. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) rose more than 3%.

Trump said Friday at a Pennsylvania rally he would double tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, a move that inflamed trade tensions again and drew criticism from global partners.

"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% — the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States," Trump said.

Europe responded to the higher tariffs by saying on Saturday that Trump's plan "undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution" and that "the (European Union) is prepared to impose countermeasures."

Trump on Friday also hailed what he called a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Japanese steel giant Nippon Steel.

He promised during the rally that U.S. Steel would be "controlled by the USA" and that no layoffs would occur. But Trump has refrained from calling the deal a merger, previously saying the "partnership" will create at least 70,000 jobs in the U.S. economy.

Elon Musk said the White House DOGE office was treated unfairly by its critics and became a "whipping boy for everything."

Musk was speaking to CBS in an interview that aired on Sunday when he was asked about the backlash he faced over his work at the cost-cutting outfit.

"It was a bit unfair because, like, DOGE became the whipping boy for everything," Musk said.

"So, if there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE. I've had people think that, like, somehow DOGE is gonna stop them from getting their Social Security check, which is completely untrue," he continued.

The Trump administration said in March that it "will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits." This clarification came after Musk called Social Security "the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time" in an episode of "The Joe Rogan Experience," which aired in February.

Musk told CBS he is a "proponent of smaller government, not bigger government."

President Donald Trump announced in November that Musk would co-lead DOGE with Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk became the sole leader of DOGE after Ramaswamy left the cost-cutting outfit in January.

Musk served as DOGE's leader from January to May. He announced his departure from DOGE on Wednesday, concluding his 130-day stint as a special government employee.

During his tenure, DOGE tried to slash government spending by shutting down foreign aid programs and laying off thousands of federal workers. The cuts sparked boycotts and protests against Tesla, Musk's EV company.

The blowback Musk faced alarmed investors as well, who repeatedly told him to focus on Tesla. Last month, Musk told investors in a Tesla earnings call that he would be scaling down his involvement with DOGE to spend more time on Tesla.

Musk, however, told CBS that he will still be working on DOGE, albeit on a part-time basis.

"DOGE is going to continue, just as a way of life, and I will have some participation in that. But as I've said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point," Musk said.

Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Uber's chief product officer has one AI tool on his to-do list.

In an episode of "Lenny's Podcast" released on Sunday, Uber's product chief, Sachin Kansal, shared two ways he is using AI for his everyday tasks at the ride-hailing giant and how he plans to add NotebookLM to his AI suite.

Kansal joined Uber eight years ago as its director of product management after working at cybersecurity and taxi startups. He became Uber's product chief last year.

Kansal said he uses OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini to summarize long reports.

"Some of these reports, they're 50 to 100 pages long," he said. "I will never have the time to read them."

He said he uses the chatbots to acquaint himself with what's happening and how riders are feeling in Uber's various markets, such as South Africa, Brazil, and Korea.

The CPO said his second use case is treating AI like a research assistant, because some large language models now offer a deep research feature.

Kansal gave a recent example of when his team was thinking about a new driver feature. He asked ChatGPT's deep research mode about what drivers may think of the add-on.

"It's an amazing research assistant and it's absolutely a starting point for a brainstorm with my team with some really, really good ideas," the CPO said.

In April, Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, said that not enough of his 30,000-odd employees are using AI. He said learning to work with AI agents to code is "going to be an absolute necessity at Uber within a year."

Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

On the podcast, Kansal also highlighted NotebookLM, Google Lab's research and note-taking tool, which is especially helpful for interacting with documents. He said he doesn't use the product yet, but wants to.

"I know a lot of people who have started using it, and that is the next thing that I'm going to use," he said.

"Just to be able to build an audio podcast based on a bunch of information that you can consume. I think that's awesome," he added. Kansal was referring to the "Audio Overview" feature, which summarizes uploaded content in the form of two AIs having a voice discussion.

NotebookLM was launched in mid-2023 and has quickly become a must-have tool for researchers and AI enthusiasts.

Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former director of AI and OpenAI cofounder, is among those who have praised the tool and its podcast feature.

"It's possible that NotebookLM podcast episode generation is touching on a whole new territory of highly compelling LLM product formats," he said in a September post on X. "Feels reminiscent of ChatGPT. Maybe I'm overreacting."

Seven years ago, Mike Holp was riding through the streets of Austin as a food delivery worker, earning between $15 and $20 an hour.

He lived just outside downtown in a shared rental with three roommates. Even with a computer science degree, the tough competition made it hard for him to get the tech job he'd hoped for.

"Basically, the only thing that I could find to do to pay expenses was to deliver food on my bike," Mike Holp, now 38, a digital creator, told Business Insider.

Each day blurred into the next as he worked long hours just to cover rent, only to repeat the same grind the following month. It was a relentless cycle, and the lifestyle started to wear him down.

He felt disillusioned, and the rising cost of living wasn't helping his situation.

"At that point, I was like: 'What am I doing all this for? Just to get by?'" Holp said.

His life in Austin didn't feel sustainable, and he knew he had to get out.

In 2019, with money saved from delivering food and working real estate photography gigs on the side, Holp bought a one-way ticket to Asia.

After a brief stint in Bali and then Singapore, Holp decided to make Thailand his next stop.

He spent time living in different parts of Thailand, including Chiang Mai — where he met his now fiancée, Mary. She was on vacation at that time but was based in both Bangkok and Koh Samui for work.

Wanting to be closer to her, Holp decided to move to Samui because he preferred its slower pace over the bustle of the Thai capital.

House hunting was fairly easy: He found their first home on Facebook Marketplace. It was a one-bedroom house in Lamai, a laid-back area along the southeastern coast of the island. Rent was 9,000 Thai baht a month.

After three years in that house, it was time for a change. His fiancée had left her previous job and now works at a school, and they wanted to live close by. They're still in Lamai but in a bigger one-bedroom property that costs 20,000 Thai baht, or about $600, each month.

"It's a modern village-style home. It's on a raised platform, about 12 feet off the ground, so if there's any flooding, we don't have to worry about that," Holp said.

Though Holp has learned a little bit of Thai, the good thing about Samui, being a tourist destination, is that many locals can speak and understand basic English, he said.

It was also fairly easy for him to connect with new people.

"There's a large Facebook group called Koh Samui Expats — they've got about 40,000 people in there," Holp said. "And I'm actually a moderator in that group, so that helps to meet people."

Holp said his life in Samui is "completely different" from that in Austin.

He starts his mornings by dropping off his fiancée at work. After that, it's time for a walk along the beach and a quick workout session at an outdoor gym on a tiny islet linked to the Samui mainland by a wooden bridge.

Post-workout, it's time for a coffee at a nearby café before he heads home to start work for the day. Apart from creating content for his own social pages, Holp also runs a photography business and a consulting business that helps others relocate to Thailand.

"I have a flexible schedule," he said. "It's just a much more carefree, relaxed lifestyle compared to Austin."

The fact that he's no longer in the rat race also means he has the time and energy to spend on his hobbies, such as exploring the island on his bike and meeting with friends.

The lower cost of living in Thailand helps, he said.

"It frees up my time so that I can focus on passion projects like the YouTube channel, and I don't have to worry about just paying rent all the time and stressing out," he said.

Holp said he and his fiancée typically spend between 50,000 and 60,000 Thai baht, or about $1,500 and $1,800, a month.

"We sometimes cook at home, but the meals are usually very affordable here, so going out to eat is very easy," Holp said.

Their weekly grocery run costs about 2,000 Thai baht, and it's also fairly easy to find international brands and products at the larger stores, he said.

"Even going to the grocery store, you can get 30 eggs for five bucks," he added.

Holp estimated a comparable lifestyle for two in Austin would cost about five times as much.

A 2025 SmartAsset analysis based on data from MIT's Living Wage Calculator found that a single person needed to earn at least $101,587 annually to live comfortably in Austin.

The average rent in Austin is $2,000, according to the latest May data from Zillow Rentals.

Holp said he loves the warm weather and the friendliness of the locals. He also feels very safe living in Samui.

"I don't even really have to worry about locking the door, whereas back in Austin, I probably have to worry about how somebody might break in and rob me," he said.

He hasn't been back to the US in five years, not even to visit. There isn't much that he misses anyway.

"There's a big car culture in the US. I do kind of miss driving a car around here. I just use the motorbike for everything since it's really easy to get around the little roads and stuff," he said.

"But I can't think of much that I really miss about the US other than my family, obviously, and friends. That's about it," he added.

Meta (META) shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to add bitcoin BTC$105,034.70 to the company's balance sheet, according to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.



Just 3.92 million votes supported the measure, while nearly 5 billion were cast in opposition. The idea was put forward in January by Ethan Peck, a bitcoin advocate who works as the bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive.



Peck's proposal called for Meta to move a portion of its $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. He argued that the tech giant should treat bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to weather monetary policy uncertainty.



The campaign was not limited to Meta. Peck also targeted Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) with similar proposals, filed on behalf of the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). Microsoft shareholders recently voted against the plan. Amazon has not yet held a vote.



Though Meta doesn't hold crypto on its balance sheet, the company has dabbled in blockchain before. In 2019, it announced Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That effort collapsed in 2022 after regulatory backlash and internal struggles, rebranding briefly as Diem before being shut down.



Meta's broader crypto strategy remains unclear. While its metaverse ambitions prompted the 2021 rebrand from Facebook to Meta, the company has pulled back on that vision in recent months. Still, earlier this year, reports surfaced that Meta was exploring the use of stablecoins to manage payments across its family of apps.



Shares of the company were up 3.5% on Monday, trading at $670.09 a piece.

 Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao proposed launching a dark pool perpetual DEX to protect large traders from front-running and MEV attacks. 

Update (June 2 at 3:33 pm UTC): This article has been updated to incorporate comments from Li.Fi's Philipp Zentner and StealthEX's Maria Carola.

Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao proposed creating a dark pool perpetual swap decentralized exchange (DEX) to prevent market manipulation.

In a June 1 X post, Zhao said that he has “always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX.”

“The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations,” he said.

Zhao added, “If you're looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you generally wouldn't want others to notice your order until it's completed.” This is to prevent front-running and maximum extractable value (MEV) bot attacks, which can result in increased slippage, worse prices and higher costs.

His comments follow the liquidation of nearly $100 million in Bitcoin long positions on Hyperliquid reportedly held by a trader known as James Wynn. The event, which occurred after Bitcoin fell below $105,000, sparked claims on X that some users had coordinated to “hunt” Wynn's liquidation.

One X user claimed that Tron co-founder Justin Sun showed interest in participating, but the claim remains unconfirmed. He also went so far as to invite Eric Trump, the son of the United States' President Donald Trump, to the group.

Zhao said that “large traders in TradFi use dark pools, often 10 times bigger” than traditional, transparent pools. Dark pools are private trading venues where large orders are hidden from public view until after they are executed.

This prevents front-running, slippage and MEV attacks by concealing order size, price and intent. Still, implementing decentralized dark pools would require complex systems such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) or delayed settlement mechanisms.

Philipp Zentner, founder and CEO of the decentralized exchange Li.Fi, told Cointelegraph that decentralized dark pools “replace the human broker with cryptography.” He cited several protocols that already use this type of system. According to Zentner, the Arbitrum-based protocol Renegade encrypts every order with multiparty computation (MPC) and then posts a zero-knowledge proof so Ethereum can verify settlement without seeing the raw book. Similarly, Penumbra, which operates in the Cosmos ecosystem, conducts sealed-bid batch auctions; only the net flow becomes public, and a ZK circuit proves fairness. 

Maria Carola, CEO of instant exchange StealthEX, told Cointelegraph that “the fundamental challenge in building a dark pool-style perp DEX is achieving both privacy and verifiability.” She noted that ZK-proofs and encrypted order matching are promising avenues for development. She added:

0xAw, lead developer at Base decentralized exchange Alien Base, told Cointelegraph that implementing dark pools is not technically challenging. Still, doing it well is not as easy:

Furthermore, the obstacles are not just technical in nature. Carola highlighted that “launching an onchain dark pool, especially for perpetuals, enters a complex regulatory landscape.”

Zhao argued that privacy is particularly important in derivatives markets. He said public visibility of liquidation levels exposes large traders to coordinated attacks that could force premature liquidation:

The Binance co-founder admitted that there are counter-arguments to such designs, with the added transparency potentially allowing market makers to absorb large orders. He said that this is “possibly true.”

“I won't get into an argument on which is right or wrong. Different traders may prefer different types of markets,“ he said.

StealthEX's Carola added that “opacity is a double-edged sword,” noting that it reduces front-running, but “also obscures manipulation attempts, especially in a leveraged environment.” “To address this, a ‘dark' perp DEX must implement adaptive risk engines and behavioral anomaly detection, ideally with cryptographic accountability baked in,“ she said.

Zhao concluded by encouraging developers to launch an onchain dark pool decentralized exchange with perpetual swaps. He said this could be achieved “either by not showing the orderbook, or even better, not showing deposits into smart contracts at all, or until much later.”

Shares in SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm and affiliate network operator, are down more than 38% since the market opened, despite the company finalizing an investment round to help it acquire up to $425 million in Ethereum. 

The company, which last week announced plans to create an Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury, saw its shares surge as high as $124, after trading at $6 as recently as May 23. 

After closing at $76.70 on Friday, SharpLink shares—which trade with ticker SBET on the Nasdaq Exchange—are trading at $47.16, down more than 38% since open and a whopping 62% down from last week's peak.

On the other hand, the stock price is still up 1,162% over the past month.

With the conclusion of its $425 million round, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin became chairman of SharpLink's board of directors. Consensys led the private placement round, funded in both fiat currency and ETH, which also included participation from prominent crypto investors like Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, Electric Capital, Arrington Capital, GSR, and ParaFi Capital.

(Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

The company's newly established treasury pivot makes it the latest in a series of publicly traded companies adopting digital asset treasuries, a move popularized by the Bitcoin-stacking Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and outspoken co-founder Michael Saylor.

Those companies range from DeFI Development Corporation (formerly Janover), an AI-powered real estate platform that has built nearly a $100 million Solana treasury, to President Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group, which recently raised $2.4 billion to buy Bitcoin. 

SharpLink, though, is the most notable company to focus on acquiring Ethereum, crypto's second largest asset by market capitalization. The firm's Monday press release announcing the finalization of the funding says it will become the largest publicly traded holder of ETH.

ETH has been the butt of many jokes over the last year, especially as it has underperformed competing layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Solana—but some optimism is growing for the asset following a price surge in May following the Pectra network upgrade.

Last week, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes told Decrypt that he believes ETH could touch $4,000-$5,000 in 2025, potentially making a new all-time high in the process as the “most hated layer-1.” Plus, analysts from Bernstein have indicated a growing interest in underlying networks where stablecoins have a major presence, a metric ETH dominates with more than 51% of stablecoin market share, per the firm's investment note. 

ETH is up 0.9% in the last 24 hours and is the best-performing coin in the top 10 by market cap over the last week, according to CoinGecko, dropping just 0.7% in that time to $2,532.

This article draws on insights from a joint report by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and Chainlink, exploring how blockchain-based identity systems can enhance trust and efficiency in global financial services.

Digital assets are rapidly reshaping the financial landscape, from tokenized assets and onchain funds to the continued growth and development of decentralized finance (DeFi). But as capital flows increasingly migrate to blockchains, one critical standardization issue remains unresolved: digital identity verification. This process is critical to both traditional finance and the still-burgeoning digital asset industry, yet it lacks an efficient, scalable, and secure solution.

In traditional finance, verifying the identity of legal entities is a prerequisite to virtually any institutional financial activity. Whether opening a bank account, trading in public markets, or investing in a fund, legal entities must prove who they are, and this requirement remains fundamentally important when interacting with digital assets. If anything, the complexity multiplies when interactions occur across multiple blockchains, jurisdictions, and financial instruments.

A recent survey by Fenergo on Know-Your-Customer (KYC) practices revealed that financial institutions across the UK, U.S., and Singapore dedicate approximately a third of their compliance budgets specifically to KYC activities. Globally, financial firms employ an average of 1,566 staff members for AML and KYC tasks, incurring an onboarding expense averaging $2,598 per customer. According to Fenergo, these costly and inefficient onboarding procedures have caused client attrition for 67% of banks and 74% of asset managers. These figures highlight the limitations of current identity frameworks and the rising need for scalable, verifiable alternatives—precisely the role Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) are designed to play.

What is an LEI?

The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities participating in financial transactions. It connects to validated reference data about the entity, such as its legal name, ownership structure, and jurisdiction.

Born out of the 2008 financial crisis, the LEI was created to improve transparency in markets after the collapse of Lehman Brothers revealed major gaps in how entities were identified and linked. Without a standard to map exposure, regulators and counterparties struggled to assess systemic risk.

Today, LEIs are required in more than 250 jurisdictions for activities like derivatives trading and securities issuance. Over 2.7 million LEIs have been issued globally. The global LEI system is governed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), a not-for-profit organization established by the Financial Stability Board to ensure transparency and open access to trusted entity identification data.

From LEIs to vLEIs: Bringing organizational identity onchain

The LEI standardized organizational identity in traditional finance—but the process remains offchain and of little use in real-time interactions with blockchain-based assets. The verifiable LEI (vLEI), developed and governed by GLEIF, can be connected to blockchains via the Chainlink Platform. Bringing vLEI onchain has the potential to reshape the traditional finance industry's involvement in onchain financial activities by building confidence and clarity through standardization.

The vLEI uses cryptographic technology to prove the authenticity of an entity's identity and credentials in real time. It renders traditional LEI data as a verifiable credential—a tamper-evident, machine-readable identity asset that can be validated across platforms, including blockchains. Once an organization has an LEI, a qualified issuer can generate a vLEI credential tied to a wallet or smart contract address. This can include role-based credentials—proving, for instance, that a CFO has authority to approve a transaction. 

Both GLEIF's work on global digital organizational identity and blockchain infrastructure built by Chainlink, the standard for onchain finance, support identity systems that are secure, work across different platforms, and easily connect with existing systems. GLEIF's vLEI enables organizations to prove their identity off and onchain, while Chainlink's technology enables firms to verify identity without exposing sensitive information and make identity portable across multiple blockchains and legacy systems.

Now, when that organization transacts—subscribing to a fund, issuing an asset, or joining a liquidity pool—counterparties can validate its identity with full cryptographic assurance.

The vLEI addresses key challenges:

Just as Chainlink has helped proof of reserves and net asset value (NAV) become foundational data points in digital assets, GLEIF's vLEI can serve as a foundational identity primitive—enabling secure, transparent participation in onchain markets.

Unlocking trust in digital asset transactions

Digital assets are programmable. They can move fast and span multiple networks. But without trusted identity standards, they operate in a vacuum of verification. This, in turn, creates additional friction for asset managers, fund administrators, and institutional investors looking to engage more fully with blockchain-based markets.

Bringing LEIs onchain through vLEIs bridges that gap by enabling organizations to assert their legal identity within blockchain environments in a cryptographically verifiable way. It ensures that tokenized assets can be held, traded, and managed by known organizations under known authorities.

Larry Fink, BlackRock

As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink noted in his 2025 letter to investors: 

“One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs — provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification.”

For digital assets to achieve their full potential—as a new layer of global financial infrastructure—digital identity must not only meet but exceed the expectations of the traditional financial industry and global regulatory bodies. vLEI shows real promise in addressing this need.

Blockchain-enabled identity in financial services

Blockchain-enabled identity offers a new approach: rather than uploading documents or manually validating entities, organizations can rely on cryptographic proofs tied to a digital identity. These proofs can be shared across platforms and verified instantly, without exposing sensitive underlying data. Chainlink's infrastructure can help facilitate this process by enabling secure delivery and validation of identity proofs across diverse blockchains, supporting greater interoperability across the digital asset ecosystem.

Chainlink can make digital identity portable, secure, and interoperable. Whether issuing tokenized funds or accessing cross-chain liquidity pools, validating counterparties in a standardized, tamper-proof way is a game-changer.

To realize this opportunity, the industry needs a common identity language—one that bridges traditional finance and digital assets. Regulatory initiatives like the EU's European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) are already exploring decentralized identity as a trust layer for digital ecosystems, reinforcing the momentum behind this shift. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and its digital platform-agnostic evolution, the verifiable LEI (vLEI), offer a promising foundation for building that shared identity standard.

All signs point toward a future where institutional-grade identity standards are a prerequisite for the next phase of financial innovation. Organizations like GLEIF are working to ensure that these identity standards remain open, globally recognized, and usable across both traditional and blockchain-based systems, with Chainlink enabling secure interoperability across blockchains and legacy systems.

The US Department of the Treasury has taken action against Funnull Technology Inc. for enabling massive pig butchering crypto scams. This move targets the backbone of fraudulent virtual currency investment platforms, aiming to protect Americans from billions in losses.

The US government has taken a major step to fight online financial scams, particularly those involving cryptocurrency. On May 29, 2025, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced strict financial penalties (sanctions) against Funnull Technology Inc.

This Philippines-based company and its administrator, Liu Lizhi, are accused of providing the essential tools and support for a huge number of fake online investment schemes. These widespread frauds, aka pig butchering scams, have already caused Americans to lose billions of dollars, and the government's action aims to stop these criminals by cutting off their financial lifelines.

Pig butchering refers to a sophisticated type of scam where criminals build trust with victims, often through social media or dating apps, over an extended period. Once a relationship is established, the scammers convince victims to invest in fake virtual currency platforms, promising high returns.  Victims are led to believe their investments are growing, only to find they cannot withdraw funds, and the scammers disappear, taking all their invested money.

Reportedly, in 2024, US citizens lost billions of dollars to these scams, with Funnull-linked operations being responsible for over $200 million in reported losses. The average individual loss for victims linked to Funnull's network was over $150,000.

Reportedly, Funnull Technology Inc. was a key player in fraudulent activities by buying large numbers of IP addresses from global cloud service providers and selling them to cybercriminals. This allowed them to create fake websites that resembled legitimate investment platforms. Funnull also provided web design templates and used domain generation algorithms to create similar website names.

In 2024, Funnull acquired web development code and used it to redirect visitors to scam and online gambling sites, some connected to Chinese criminal money laundering. Liu Lizhi, a Chinese national, managed Funnull's daily operations, overseeing tasks like assigning domain names for fraud, phishing, and illegal gambling sites.

OFAC's sanctions included two cryptocurrency addresses, Ethereum and TRON, likely used for Funnull's services. These addresses are linked to other illicit financial activities, including Huione Pay, a company identified by FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) as a primary money laundering concern. The FBI has issued a cybersecurity advisory (PDF) to help the private sector identify and remove websites linked to Funnull.

As a result of these sanctions, all property and assets of Funnull and Liu Lizhi within the United States or under US control are blocked. Additionally, US individuals and companies are prohibited from doing business with them and any entity owned 50% or more by Funnull or Liu. The public is encouraged to report any online scams or illegal activities to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).

A joint blog from John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, and Nikhil Rathi Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

From AI to digital ID, data-driven technologies are transforming financial services. And how we harness these technologies is key to delivering the Government's mission on growth.   

But innovation only succeeds when it's underpinned by confidence to try new ideas, trust, and a joined-up regulatory approach even where it is challenging to provide clarity with the frontiers of technology moving fast.  

That's why the FCA and ICO are working closely together to support firms navigating data protection and financial regulation in a way that helps them innovate confidently. 

Done right, regulation isn't a brake on innovation. It's a bridge, connecting creativity with public trust. With the right approach, regulation becomes an enabler, providing the certainty firms need to invest, experiment, and grow responsibly. 

The FCA and ICO frequently collaborate to make it easier for firms to navigate UK financial and data protection regulations. 

In 2023, we clarified that data protection rules don't prevent banks from telling customers about better savings deals. Since then, firms have significantly ramped up their communications, with over 100 million savings messages sent out. A small change, but a big impact. 

Similarly, we engaged firms to bust myths about barriers to sharing data between organisations and sectors in order to prevent, detect and investigate scams and fraud. More regulatory clarity, more people protected.  

Our cooperation extends to the services that we provide to innovators – ensuring that whether firms enter the FCA's AI Lab or the ICO's Regulatory Sandbox, they can have confidence that they are getting joined-up regulatory positions. 

Through the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF), our partnership continues to grow – for example through the pilot of the AI and Digital Hub alongside Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority. The DRCF is actively reviewing the pilot project and developing its refreshed offer for innovators.  

When we are made aware of challenges firms face, we look to take action. The FCA's latest joint AI survey with the Bank of England showed 85% of the 118 financial services firms surveyed were currently using or planning to use AI. 33% of firms cited data protection as a constraint on AI adoption and 20% cited FCA regulations.  

That's why we hosted a roundtable on May 9 with industry leaders to better understand the challenges firms face when deploying AI, and to explore how we can support responsible innovation and personal information use.  

What came through was very little about specific regulations standing in the way of innovation.  

Rather firms understand the broad rules, but many – especially smaller ones – want clearer examples of ‘what good looks like' in practice and more opportunities for engagement to build confidence in trying new technologies.  

So what are we doing about it? The ICO has already published extensive guidance on AI. To support good practice into the future we will be developing a statutory code of practice for organisations developing or deploying AI and automated decision making – enabling innovation while safeguarding privacy. We will also be helping firms to develop, test, and evaluate AI as part of the FCA's AI Lab.  

The FCA plans to host a roundtable with smaller firms later this year to better understand challenges around AI adoption. The new DRCF workplan also commits regulators to develop our collective understanding of how one another's regulatory regimes might apply to AI – including agentic AI systems - and work to identify and resolve any points of conflict.  

Firms are concerned about who holds responsibility when AI tools are developed by third parties, particularly when they make automated decisions that impact their customers or when things go wrong. This can lead to reluctance, especially under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime.  

As part of the ICO's consultation series on generative AI, the ICO published detailed analysis on allocating controllership across the generative AI supply chain. The FCA has also provided information on the responsibility of firms when seeking to adopt generative AI.  

We know some firms have been able to move forward with confidence in line with their risk appetite, while others find these to be complex issues. We will continue to work together and with other regulators in the DRCF to explain our expectations, while recognising many choices are about firms' own risk appetites and choices.  

Some firms simply aren't aware of the tools and services already available including the Digital Sandbox, Supercharged Sandbox and AI Live Testing within the FCA's Innovation Hub. The ICO also offers the Innovation Advice Service, Regulatory Sandbox and Innovation Hub under its Innovation Services.  

We're increasing visibility of these services and signposting practical help.  

The DRCF workplan also notes how we will be cooperating over the coming year to support regulatory clarity for financial services firms. This includes continued engagement on the Consumer Duty and its intersections with data protection, supporting the development of open finance data sharing, sharing insights on scams and fraud mitigation efforts and convening a DRCF symposium on digital ID.  

The message from industry was clear: regulation is not the main blocker to innovation but uncertainty and lack of familiarity are. We want to reduce that uncertainty. We can support in building familiarity, while firms themselves are also developing their capabilities. All this means being clearer, more joined-up, and more visible with the support we offer.  

But this isn't something regulators can do alone. We need firms and trade bodies to keep talking to us – not just when there's a problem, real or perceived, but earlier in the innovation journey.  

We can help firms do things differently. But we need their insight to do things better. 

With regulatory agility and confidence to innovate and invest in new technologies, businesses will provide the UK with the fuel to power economic growth.

The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) has agreed to form a technical committee to draft a framework for digital and virtual assets, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday.

The PCC was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country's financial landscape.

According to a press release by the finance ministry, the meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and attended by PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, governor of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and government officials.

“The meeting focused on the draft regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets in Pakistan, aiming to align with international standards and evolving technological trends,” the press release said.

It added that the participants discussed options for establishing “an autonomous regulatory authority to oversee and regulate the digital finance and crypto ecosystem in the country”.

“It was agreed to constitute a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, Law Division, and IT & Telecom Division,” the ministry said, adding that the committee will review the draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure to be reviewed by the PCC in the next meeting.

The press release said that the PCC members gave valuable input for “a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment” which aims to promote “responsible blockchain adoption, safeguarding investors, and advancing financial inclusion”.

The finance minister appreciated the contributions of all stakeholders and reaffirmed the government's commitment to creating a “future-ready financial infrastructure that supports innovation while maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance”, it added.

 
 


Last week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance held a meeting, where PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations. Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that the ban on cryptocurrency was still in place across Pakistan, stressing the need for its regulation during the meeting.

The same day, Saqib had unveiled the country's first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.

Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal. However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.

In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.

Michael Saylor during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Turns out, buying Bitcoin to boost your share price might not be the corporate panacea that it once seemed.

In recent weeks, companies such as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., have announced plans to use their cash — sometimes borrowed — to plow into Bitcoin, joining a growing list of firms adopting an approach pioneered by Strategy's Michael Saylor.

Stablecoin protocol USDT0 is giving tokenized gold a crypto native spin, aiming to make the world's oldest stores of value compatible with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

The platform is introducing the XAUT0 token, which builds on Tether Gold (XAUT) but integrates an omnichain architecture to expand its utility for trading and as collateral on lending protocols. The token uses LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard to move seamlessly across blockchains without relying on bridges or wrappers.

Tether's XAUT corresponds to one troy ounce of gold stored in a Swiss vault, linked to a specific bar meeting London Bullion Market Association standards. It's also redeemable for physical gold.

The new offering follows the protocol's first offering USDT0, a unified liquidity layer for Tether's USDT stablecoin that's available on ten blockchains including Arbitrum, Optimism and Kraken's Ink. Since launching earlier this year, the token ballooned to a $1.3 billion circulating supply.

"I am a big bitcoin BTC$104,750.42 guy myself," Lorenzo R., co-founder of USDT0 told CoinDesk in an interview. "But I also like gold and would love to have an easier and more straightforward way to acquire and actually be able to use it in my everyday life."

"We are still very early when it comes to actual integration of real-world assets and commodities into DeFi protocols," he added.

The token's first deployment will occur on The Open Network (TON), the blockchain powering popular messaging app Telegram's crypto features. Telegram users will be able to buy and use the gold-backed token directly within Wallet in Telegram, potentially introducing the tokenized asset to millions of users. TON was originally developed by Telegram, then continued as an independent operation after settling a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020.

A broader promotional rollout of XAUT0 to more blockchains is planned for Q3 this year.

"There are multiple chains that we're going to be launching on, and some of these chains are going to have more DeFi spin to it," Lorenzo R. said.

Derivatives trader James Wynn emerged out of the woodworks a few weeks ago, flaunting 9-figure bitcoin positions on HyperLiquid as he went on a seemingly undefeatable run that culminated in around $100 million worth of profit.

But that run, as is often the case with highly-leveraged crypto derivative trading, came to a shocking end — Wynn liquidated his entire account despite BTC only moving by a couple of percent.

"I've decided to give perp trading a break," Wynn wrote on X after the final blow up. "Its been a fun ride. Approximately $4 million into $100 million and then back down to a total account loss of $17.5 million."

Wynn's story is nothing new. In 2021, for instance, the industry saw the public rise of Alex Wice — a poker player turned derivatives trader — that also lost $100 million after making huge bets with leverage. And even in 2017, in the BitMEX trollbox days, pseudonymous figures like SteveS and TheBoot used to boast about their 10s of millions in profit and loss before forever fading into obscurity.

Cryptocurrency derivatives can be an incredibly useful tool; if a trader holds 500 BTC ($52 million) and believes the market will go down, they can hedge their position by going short -- reducing exposure without having to sell their spot assets, which in itself could cause slippage or front running.

An array of delta neutral strategies can also be employed like the classic basis trade that became popular amongst institutional traders on the bitcoin CME futures market, which involve simultaneously going long and short to harvest the funding rate as a yield.

But issues begin to form when crypto traders, the majority of whom are inexperienced retail traders, use platforms that offer up to 100x leverage.

Imagine a newcomer had $5,000 in trading capital, sure, they could make a few intraday trades and make $50 or $100 per trade, but if they used 100x they could make $50,000 per 10% move. This is the slippery slope of gambling-induced emotional trading that many fall into.

Data from NewTrading shows that just 3% of day traders make a profit and 1% do so consistently. And the game becomes even tougher when, in this case, traders are opening positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

James Wynn's downfall came in part due to his inability to deal with the emotional swings of trading, but also the sheer size of his positions.

Wynn would often post about getting partially liquidated and re-opening the position at a worse break-even point. This is indicative of a trader out of his depth through over-leverage. As Wynn used in some cases 40x leverage, his liquidation point left no margin for error, this meant that astute traders or trading firms could hunt his liquidation point and force him into an impulsive trade.

HyperLiquid is a relatively liquid derivatives venue, it has millions in market depth within 1% of an asset's price but it does not have hundreds of million, which was required to absorb Wynn's leveraged positions. 

In reality, Wynn's trade thesis was based around the Bitcoin Las Vegas event and any potential announcements that could lift bitcoin above a new record high. If this came into fruition, Wynn would have had hundreds of millions in unrealized profit, but unfortunately in his case, bitcoin began to slump during the conference as speeches from Michael Saylor and Ross Ulbricht failed to spark any upside momentum.

The lack of volatility and Wynn's insatiable appetite to keep betting led to him getting chopped out of the market. His losses became so notable that one trader decided to counter trade every position by going short at the same time as Wynn went long, this trader made $17 million, according to Lookonchain.

As the sun finally set on Wynn's derivatives journey he announced he was "going back to the trenches" to trade meme coins, of course.

	Mediawan Kids & Family, the youth content arm of the European powerhouse that owns Plan B, See-Saw Films and Chapter 2, has struck a deal with Claynosaurz Inc., the company behind the viral NFT brand. Together, they'll co-produce an animated series based on the digital-native franchise.


	The series, running 39 episodes of seven minutes each, underscores the strategy deployed by Mediawan Kids & Family to partner up with up-and-coming talent from the creator economy and develop original transmedia projects.

	Aimed at children aged 6 to 12, the comedy-filled series will follow the adventures of four dinosaur friends on a mysterious island. Jesse Cleverly, the award-winning co-founder and creative director of Mediawan-owned, Bristol-based banner Wildseed Studios, is on board as showrunner. 




			Popular on Variety		







	Claynosaurz, created in 2021 by Nicholas Cabana, Dan Cabral and Daniel Jervis (former VFX artists at Sony Pictures, Animal Logic and Framestore) has already garnered over 450 million views and 200 million impressions across digital platforms, as well as an online community of over 530,000 subscribers with its humorous short videos. The brand has won 11 Collision Award, as well as a Webby Award.


Julien Borde, Mediawan Kids & Family president, told Variety that the series will likely be the first of its kind and addresses a demand from buyers for content that “comes with a pre-existing engagement and data.” 


	“I think it's the very first time a digital collectible brand is expanded into a TV series so it's a milestone, not just for Mediawan Kids & Family but for the industry,” Borde said. The project also allows the company to keep up with its mantra to “empower talents all around the world,” the veteran youth content exec said, adding that the Claynosaurz team “are really into animation, have done fantastic shows in the past and are trying to do things a different way.” Borde also said the show is part of Mediawan Kids & Family's ambition to diversify and build a new line-up of premium content coming from different platforms. 

	











	Cabana said he created Claynosaurz with a “group of artists from all sorts of studios, including Illumination, Dreamworks, Sony, Disney and Ubisoft.” Having entered the market through collectibles and NFTs gave them the opportunity to monetize early in their development cycle and focus on building the characters rather than building long-form content, he said. The way they “flipped the traditional model” and “built the IP directly with fans” felt right because they could “prepackage the brand within the audience” at a time when it's “tough for large studios to take a risk on nascent brands if they're not proven or battle-tested,” Cabana said.


	When Mediawan approached them, they “immediately understood the tone, warmth and irreverent humour that define Claynosaurz, and share our belief that great franchises can emerge from unexpected places,” Cabana said. He noted that “this type of community-driven development isn't just different, it's necessary.” 


	The series will aim at getting the digital franchise to an even wider audience with “hyper relatable” content, while keeping the comedy-driven, quirky DNA of the hit IP, Cabana said. He also explained how the banner will test creative ideas on social media and “treat it as our test kitchen” to “find out what's sticking and what's not sticking,” he said. 


	The show will launch on Youtube and will be available for licensing by traditional TV channels and platforms. Nicolas Fisch, who is producing the series for Mediawan Kids & Family, said Claynosaurz's creative teams and Mediawan's will come together in a writers room. 


	Katell France (“Vic the Vicking”) at Method Animation (“The Little Prince”), a Mediawan label, is producing the show with Cabana at Claynosaurz.


	Mediawan was at the Cannes Film Festival this year with the animated feature “Marcel et Monsieur Pagnol” directed by Sylvain Chomet (“The Triplets of Belleville”).

Cryptocurrency is a growing sector in finance, influencing how we approach financial systems and investment opportunities. Each digital asset in the market has its own features and potential. But with thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence, knowing which ones might be right for you can be a challenge.

Whether you are new to digital assets or just looking to stay informed in the global financial conversation, understanding the more prominent cryptocurrencies can provide perspective on how the space is developing. 

Here are the top 15 digital assets that stand out for their market value, innovation, and adoption potential.

2 / 17

Classified as a stablecoin — a type of cryptocurrency intended to maintain a consistent value — DAI is designed to minimize volatility through smart contracts (digital contracts stored on a blockchain) that adjust for supply and demand. It's governed by the MakerGAO protocol and backed by overcollateralized cryptocurrency assets, meaning the value of the collateral backing the crypto is always higher than the total value of the issued DAI. 

The goal of DAI is to maintain a ratio of 1 DAI to $1 USD. DAI is generally more stable than other cryptocurrencies, but it may fluctuate during times of market stress. DAI is widely used in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem — a system of financial applications built on blockchain technology that allows users to borrow, lend, trade, and earn interest without relying on traditional banks. It appeals to those who value decentralization and transparency.

3 / 17

Tronix is the native cryptocurrency of the TRON blockchain platform. It gives users more control over their data and enables developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) — programs that run on a distributed network of computers rather than a central server. This decentralized approach often increases security and user control.

After purchasing TRX through a cryptocurrency exchange, you can use it to tip content creators and purchase games and apps on platforms built on the TRON network.

4 / 17

The SHIB cryptocurrency started as a meme-based joke, but it quickly became popular among crypto investors because of its community-driven nature and viral appeal. It was created by an anonymous figure known only as “Ryoshi” to compete with Dogecoin, Elon Musk's favorite memecoin. It enticed buyers and captured attention with its playful mascot. SHIB also immediately stood out because it was one of the first to be controlled by community members who could actively participate.

5 / 17

Like DAI, USDC is a stablecoin designed to keep the value of one unit as close to $1 USD as possible. The biggest difference between the two is that USDC is backed by fiat currency, government-issued money not backed by a physical commodity like gold and silver, which includes U.S. government securities and cash. 

USDC originally launched on the Ethereum blockchain but is now available on multiple platforms, including Polygon, Base, and Avalanche, increasing its accessibility across crypto ecosystems.

6 / 17

Tether Limited introduced its cryptocurrency several years before USDC, DAI, and other stablecoins entered the market. Like USDC, Tether is pegged to the U.S. dollar, so its value remains stable over time. USDT is available on more than a dozen platforms, so it has a relatively high trading volume compared to other stablecoins.

7 / 17

Instead of facilitating individual transactions, Ripple's XRP gives banks and other financial institutions a faster, more secure way to transfer money across borders. Another difference between XRP and other digital currencies is that it provides liquidity and converts one fiat currency to another. For example, XRP can be used to convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan in Ripple's cross-border payment system.

8 / 17

Polygon isn't a separate network — it's a sidechain or scaling solution designed to work alongside Ethereum. Because of its popularity, Ethereum can be slow and costly. High transaction fees make it difficult for users to earn a return on small investments. Polygon helps by processing transactions off the Ethereum chain, reducing costs and preventing delays. MATIC, Polygon's native token, can be used for purchases, staking rewards on your crypto balance, and voting on proposed network upgrades.

9 / 17

Developed by Ava Labs, the Avalanche network offers a faster and more scalable alternative to Ethereum and other high-traffic blockchain platforms. AVAX, its native token, is used for staking (earning rewards), transactions, and trading. What makes the Avalanche network stand out is its eco-friendly design. AVAX uses less energy than proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, appealing to investors who want to trade crypto while minimizing their carbon footprint.

10 / 17

Telegram, a cloud-based messaging service, originally developed the Telegram Open Network (TON) with the intention of launching a cryptocurrency known as Gram. The company raised more than $1 billion in a private token sale, but had to abandon its plans when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit alleging that Telegram raised the funds by selling unregistered securities.

After Telegram withdrew from the development and launch of the TON blockchain and Gram token, the project continued to develop under the name “The Open Network” and became community-led. Telegram continues to allow its users to send TON cryptocurrency directly within the messaging app, despite no longer controlling the project.

11 / 17

Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus created Dogecoin as a satire to highlight the volatility of the early cryptocurrency market. While it started off as just a memecoin, DOGE gained traction, becoming a viable alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Elon Musk further boosted DOGE by frequently referencing it on social media, and eventually using its ticker symbol as the shorthand for his Department of Government Efficiency. Like other cryptocurrencies, DOGE can be used for online tipping, charitable donations, investing, and quick, low-cost payments.

12 / 17

Named after Ada Lovelace, a mathematician whose work helped make modern computer programming possible, ADA is the native coin for the Cardano platform. While Cardano supports smart contracts, it doesn't consume as much energy as other blockchain platforms, giving users a more sustainable option. Cardano also uses a unique proof-of-stake system to validate transactions, making the platform more secure and scalable.

13 / 17

The Solana platform offers the same basic functions as other blockchain platforms, but with faster transaction speeds. You can send money to someone thousands of miles away in seconds. Solana's founders also wanted to keep fees low, making the platform highly attractive to users who want to make small payments rather than deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars.

14 / 17

Developed by Binance, one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, BNB enables users to earn rewards, send payments, play games, and cover transaction fees. One reason for BNB's popularity is that Binance regularly burns a portion of its digital tokens, reducing supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining cryptocurrency.

15 / 17

Less than a year after Ethereum launched, hackers stole $50 million from the DAO, one of the network's largest decentralized apps. The theft led to a split in the Ethereum community and resulted in the creation of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Despite this, the platform's momentum stayed strong, and developers continued to use Ethereum to build decentralized applications and make payments, which resulted in unprecedented growth. Ethereum has even been able to reduce its energy consumption by switching from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system — a move that began with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.

16 / 17

As the original digital payment token introduced to the public in 2008, Bitcoin is used by investors and consumers for value exchange — trading digital assets for other assets — and purchases. 

Developed by an anonymous group or individual using the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto,” BTC is one of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrencies. This worldwide cryptocurrency is open source, meaning it isn't owned by any one person and everyone can use it. 

It was also one of the first cryptocurrencies to receive support from major companies, including Tesla, PayPal, and Microsoft. Since its launch, Bitcoin has undergone several updates, making it faster, more efficient, and more scalable.

Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, has introduced a new structured bond that tracks the price of bitcoin BTC$104,470.02 and the dollar-to-ruble exchange rate.

Initially available over the counter to a limited pool of qualified investors, the bonds let holders earn based on two variables: the future performance of BTC in U.S. dollars and any strengthening of the dollar relative to the ruble.

Investors can access these instruments without opening a crypto wallet or using foreign crypto exchanges, with all transactions being processed in rubles within Russia's “legal and infrastructure systems.”

The bank plans to list similar structured products with cryptocurrency exposure on the Moscow Exchange, according to a recent announcement.

Sberbank, per the announcement, is also launching a bitcoin futures product via its SberInvestments platform on June 4, aligning with the launch of the product on the Moscow Exchange.

The announcement comes just after the Bank of Russia said financial institutions in the country can offer cryptocurrency-linked instruments to qualified investors.

Silver Spring, Maryland--(Newsfile Corp. - June 2, 2025) - BTCS Inc. BTCS ("BTCS" or the "Company"), a blockchain technology-focused company, today announced the acquisition of 1,000 Ether (ETH) for approximately $2.63 million. This acquisition was primarily acquired from Crypto.com Exchange, Crypto.com's institutional-grade offering.

SharpLink's $425M private placement transforms it into the largest publicly-traded ETH holder, representing institutional blockchain adoption with strategic industry backing.

SharpLink Gaming's $425 million private placement marks a watershed moment for institutional Ethereum adoption. This transaction, led by Consensys Software Inc. alongside major crypto venture firms like ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, and Galaxy Digital, positions SharpLink to become the largest publicly-traded ETH holder globally—a significant milestone for both the company and the broader digital asset ecosystem.

The appointment of Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO, as Chairman signals extraordinary legitimacy to this strategic pivot. This isn't merely a funding round; it represents a fundamental transformation of SharpLink's treasury strategy, embracing ETH as its primary reserve asset while maintaining its core business in performance-based marketing for gambling industries.

What's particularly notable is the comprehensive ecosystem support. The company has established Asset Management Agreements with ParaFi and Galaxy Asset Management to oversee its Ethereum strategy, indicating sophisticated management of these digital assets. SharpLink plans to participate in protocol-level activities like staking and DeFi mechanisms, potentially generating additional yield on its holdings beyond simple appreciation.

This move represents one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies adopting a significant Ethereum treasury strategy, following a path similar to what companies like MicroStrategy pioneered with Bitcoin. The transaction's structure—combining both fiat and ETH funding—demonstrates flexibility in capital formation that bridges traditional finance with digital asset ecosystems.

For the broader market, this signals growing institutional comfort with Ethereum as a treasury asset class, potentially paving the way for other public companies to follow suit. The participation of SharpLink's own executives in the placement further demonstrates internal confidence in this strategic direction.

SharpLink will use the net proceeds to launch its treasury strategy focused on Ethereum, becoming one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to take this step.

MINNEAPOLIS, June  02, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) (“SharpLink” or the “Company”) today announced the closing of a $425,000,000 private placement (funded in a combination of fiat and ETH) led by Consensys Software Inc. and other investors to help SharpLink implement the largest Ethereum treasury strategy in the public markets. Joseph Lubin, Founder and CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum, became Chairman of the board of directors of the Company upon the closing of the transaction.

The offering included participation by prominent crypto venture capital firms and infrastructure providers such as ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital, Arrington Capital, Galaxy Digital, Ondo, White Star Capital, GSR, Hivemind Capital, Hypersphere, Primitive Ventures, and Republic Digital among others, including Rob Phythian, SharpLink's CEO, and Robert DeLucia, SharpLink's CFO.

This announcement marks a key milestone in SharpLink's growth strategy. The transaction enables the Company to adopt ETH, the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain, as its primary treasury reserve asset, while also continuing to focus on its core business operations. Ethereum powers the majority of stablecoin payments, tokenized assets, and decentralized financial applications. SharpLink's direct ETH treasury position will allow for access to protocol-level activities, such as staking and decentralized finance mechanisms, which are native to the Ethereum network. SharpLink has entered into Asset Management Agreements (AMAs) with ParaFi and Galaxy Asset Management to support the oversight of its Ethereum Treasury strategy alongside the Company's management team.

Rob Phythian, CEO of SharpLink stated, “We believe that this is a powerful partnership combining SharpLink's deep capital markets experience with Consensys' leadership in both technological innovation and its role in building the Ethereum ecosystem. This marks a pivotal moment for SharpLink – one that underscores our commitment to innovation and long-term growth. With this investment, we're not only strengthening our affiliate marketing business, but also pioneering an Ethereum-based treasury strategy by a Nasdaq-listed company.”

Joseph Lubin, Founder and CEO of Consensys, Co-Founder of Ethereum and Chairman of SharpLink's board of directors stated, “At Consensys, we believe Ethereum has proven itself over the past decade as a resilient, programmable decentralized trust foundation, supporting both institutional and public applications. This partnership with SharpLink represents more than just a financial milestone: it reflects the growing recognition across capital markets that programmable assets like ETH play an important role today in how value, trust, and financial systems are structured globally. I am pleased to join as Sharplink's Chairman of the Board of Directors in adopting Ethereum's open, secure, and scalable infrastructure, which is already being used across institutional and decentralized applications.”     

A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners acted as the sole placement agent in connection with the offering.

The offer and sale of the foregoing securities was made in a private placement in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirement of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the securities offered in the private placement may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws. Concurrently with the execution of the securities purchase agreements, the Company and the investors entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) registering the resale of the shares of common stock.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.

 Bitcoin fell 11% from its $111K all-time highs as traders say BTC price could drop to $97K if key support levels don't hold amid rising trade tensions. 

Key takeaways:

The emergence of a bear flag on the four-hour chart projects a Bitcoin price drop to $97,000.

Traders say BTC price may drop as low as $85,000 if key support levels are broken, including the $100,000 psychological level and the yearly opening at around $92,000.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price is forming a classic bearish pattern on lower time frames, triggering fears that a breakdown could lead to a drop toward $97,000.

Bitcoin's price action has formed a textbook bear flag pattern on the four-hour chart, a bearish continuation setup formed when the price consolidates upward in a parallel channel after a sharp downward move.

In Bitcoin's case, the flag began forming after BTC bottomed at nearly $103,100 on May 31. The consolidation persisted over the weekend, with the price continuously retesting the support line of the flag.

The bearish continuation will be confirmed once the price breaks below the lower boundary of the flag at $104,800. The pattern's projected downside target is now sitting near $97,690, measured after adding the height of the initial flagpole to the breakout point.

Momentum indicators, including the relative strength index (RSI), are also supportive, with the RSI currently at 44, suggesting that the market conditions still favour the downside.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the BTC/USD pair has dropped 6.3% from its all-time highs above $111,000. 

While BTC price closed 11% higher in May, traders are questioning which direction the price might take moving forward. The month of June has historically produced mixed results with an average of 0.3% losses.

For crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades, the mid-range at $99,600 and the previous all-time high at $108,000 are crucial levels to watch during the first week of June. 

“I think there's a good chance that the first week is likely a move that can be faded upon seeing the first signs of local reversals” at either of these points, the trader said in a June 1 post on X.

An accompanying chart showed that a break above $108,000 would see the BTC/USD pair rise toward its $111,900 all-time high, where it would likely meet strong resistance, occasioning a drop back into the range. 

Similarly, a break below $99,600 would see the pair drop lower before finding solace from the 200-day simple moving average at $97,600. 

“BTC looks like it has started a larger correction, which is likely to take it into the 2nd week of June,” said fellow analyst AlphaBTC in a June 2 post on X.

According to the analyst, a breakdown of the bear flag in the four-hour timeframe could see Bitcoin's price drop toward the $102,000 demand zone. Losing this support would bring the yearly open above $92,000 into the picture.

“The question will be what happens at around 92K?” AlphaBTC asked, adding that if it provides a buying opportunity, BTC could rebound from here to initiate a sustained recovery into price discovery.

Conversely, if tariff tensions continue, BTC may drop further toward $85,000, as shown in the chart below.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin traders are analysing the weekly and monthly closes for cues as to where BTC price action may be headed next, with the psychological levels at $100,000 and $97,000 remaining key areas of interest.

New research from Colorado State University and Cornell University shows that the presence of solar panels in Colorado's grasslands may reduce water stress, improve soil moisture levels and -- particularly during dry years -- increase plant growth by about 20% or more compared to open fields.

The findings were published in Environmental Research Letters this week. The paper outlines the potential benefits and challenges when photovoltaic (PV) arrays are located in grassland ecosystems. The findings are particularly relevant when considering drought in the arid west and the potential for future climate change.

While solar power systems are a key source of renewable energy, they reduce the amount of sunlight available for plant growth, which could impact these complex ecosystems in ways that reduce the wildlife they support, the carbon they store and the amount of forage they produce for livestock grazing. The work, based on four years of data from an agrivoltaics solar facility in Longmont, Colorado, represents the first effort to field test how co-locating solar and grasslands changes those dynamics.

Colorado's semi-arid grasslands often need more water than is available through precipitation in each season.

The team found that plants beneath and around the solar systems in that environment benefited from partial shading and additional water that collects on panels -- aiding in their fight to survive during the harsh summer months. They found that during a dry year, grass growth on the east side of panels was up to 90% more productive in some cases than the neighboring open site. During wet and normal years, this positive grass production response was reduced, but the east side of the panels still saw more grass production than the control site.

Cornell Postdoctoral Research Associate Matthew Sturchio is an author on the paper along with CSU University Distinguished Professor Alan Knapp. Sturchio was previously part of Knapp's team in the Department of Biology, and he is still an affiliated researcher at CSU.

Sturchio said the results demonstrate the potential of solar land use synergies in grasslands that support both needed renewable power generation and ecosystem stability.

"There have been several studies reporting improved plant and water relations from solar arrays," he said. "However, this is the first analysis that shows how that pattern becomes more pronounced with increasing aridity or dryness like we see in Colorado.

"The most important takeaway here is that even though this solar array was designed to maximize energy generation -- not to promote beneficial environmental conditions for the grasses grown beneath -- it still provided a more favorable environment during a dry year."

Sturchio said those gains could increase if panels were instead designed to maximize their benefits depending on conditions. That may include changing their position to provide shade when air temperatures rise or configuring them to let more light in during key parts of the growing season.

"With small changes in array design, configuration and management, we may even realize untapped benefits, particularly those related to water use," he said.

The paper is part of ongoing research by the pair into agrivoltaics: a dual use approach where solar power infrastructure is designed and placed to also support livestock grazing or pollinator habitats in parallel. Those agricultural options don't require irrigation or machinery. However, because of their heavy reliance on rain to support plant growth, research like this is needed to understand how the addition of panels changes the environment overall.

Knapp and his lab have been studying grasslands at CSU for decades, focusing primarily on how they cope with chronic water stress and drought. He said research in the paper focuses on perennial C3, "cool season" grasses that prefer wetter conditions. The next step will be to study the more common C4 grasses found in the plains of Colorado. Those plants flourish in warmer conditions with lots of sunlight.

"Those grasslands are even more water-limited than the ones we used in this study. Thus, we expect the capability of solar arrays to mitigate water stress may be even greater," Knapp said.

Sturchio added that solar panels may even provide an opportunity to restore grassland ecosystems by promoting diverse plant communities. He said building solar facilities in ecosystems that could benefit from their strategic placement is an obvious win-win.

"We hypothesize that grassland restoration in arid and semi-arid regions could benefit not only from the favorable conditions in solar arrays, but also from the environmental heterogeneity created by panels," he said. "We are excited to test the functional underpinnings of that idea at the newly constructed Shortgrass Ecovoltaic Research Facility in Nunn, Colorado, very soon."

Some websites have been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of bot traffic. Credit: Marco VDM/Getty

In February, the online image repository DiscoverLife, which contains nearly 3 million photographs of different species, started to receive millions of hits to its website every day — a much higher volume than normal. At times, this spike in traffic was so high that it slowed the site down to the point that it became unusable. The culprit? Bots.

These automated programs, which attempt to ‘scrape' large amounts ofcontent from websites, are increasingly becoming a headache for scholarly publishers and researchers who run sites hosting journal papers, databases and other resources.

Open-source AI chatbots are booming — what does this mean for researchers?

Much of the bot traffic comes from anonymized IP addresses, and the sudden increase has led many website owners to suspect that these web-scrapers are gathering data to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as chatbots and image generators.

“It's the wild west at the moment,” says Andrew Pitts, the chief executive of PSI, a company based in Oxford, UK, that provides a global repository of validated IP addresses for the scholarly communications community. “The biggest issue is the sheer volume of requests [to access a website], which is causing strain on their systems. It costs money and causes disruption to genuine users.” 

Those that run affected sites are working on ways to block the bots and reduce the disruption they cause. But this is no easy task, especially for organizations with limited resources. “These smaller ventures could go extinct if these sorts of issues are not dealt with,” says Michael Orr, a zoologist at the Stuttgart State Museum of National History in Germany.

Internet bots have been around for decades, and some have been useful. For example, Google and other search engines have bots that scan millions of webpages to identify and retrieve content. But the rise of generative AI has led to a deluge of bots, including many ‘bad' ones that scrape without permission. 

This year, the BMJ, a publisher of medical journals based in London, has seen bot traffic to its websites surpass that of real users. The aggressive behaviour of these bots overloaded the publisher's servers and led to interruptions in services for legitimate customers, says Ian Mulvany, BMJ's chief technology officer.

Other publishers report similar issues. “We've seen a huge increase in what we call ‘bad bot' traffic,” says Jes Kainth, a service delivery director based in Brighton, UK, at Highwire Press, an Internet hosting service that specializes in scholarly publications. “It's a big problem.”

The Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) reported in April that more than 90% of 66 members it surveyed had experienced AI bots scraping content from their sites — of which roughly two-thirds had experienced service disruptions because of them. “Repositories are open access, so in a sense, we welcome the reuse of the contents,” says Kathleen Shearer, COAR's executive director. “But some of these bots are super aggressive, and it's leading to service outages and significant operational problems.”

One factor driving the rise in AI bots was a revelation that came with the release of DeepSeek, a Chinese-built large language model (LLM). Prior to that, most LLMs required a huge amount of computational power to create, explains Rohit Prajapati, a development and operations manager at Highwire Press. But the developers behind DeepSeek showed that an LLM that rivals popular generative-AI tools could be made with much fewer resources, kickstarting an explosion of bots seeking to scrape the data needed to train this type of model.

Sustainability may be an unavoidable feature of advanced civilizations, making advanced technology “indistinguishable from nature.”

For more than 40 years, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) organization has turned its gaze toward the cosmos in search for an answer to one of humanity's greatest questions: Are we alone? Often taking the form of the “Fermi paradox”—a 75-year-old thought experiment that explores why there are so many worlds, yet seemingly no alien civilizations—this grand question has inspired a lot of possible solutions. Maybe life is much rarer than we imagine? Maybe it's incredibly difficult to evolve into a modern civilization like ours? Or maybe aliens are speaking in a language we simply don't understand. 

However, there's one possible solution that eerily speaks to our current moment. Known as the “Sustainability Solution,” this idea posits that endless economic growth may simply be impossible to sustain, so alien societies either adapt by creating sustainable civilization in harmony with their host planet, or they simply die out. First proposed by Pennsylvania State University scientists Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum in 2009, the “Sustainability Solution” suggests that if aliens do exist, they likely wouldn't create the technosignatures we often attribute to advanced civilizations, such as Dyson Spheres or interstellar spacecraft. Instead, these structures (part of the “technosphere”) would blend with the natural world, making them difficult to distinguish.

In a new study uploaded to the preprint server arXiv, New York University researcher and philosopher Lukáš Likavčan revitalizes this solution to the Fermi paradox as a lens through which to view humanity's own development. The paper re-conceptualizes technology, history, and sustainability on a planetary scale. 

“The ecological limits constrain the topology of viable planetary histories to those evolutionary trajectories where the technosphere successfully folds back into the biosphere,” Likavčan wrote. “The major result of this reconceptualization is the problematization of the analytical import of technosphere as a category denoting some new geological layer—it seems to be more of a transitory armature of the biosphere's evolution and less of an emerging permanent layer.”

Humans play a strange, transitory role in this conceptualization. Of course, being primates, we are of the biosphere. But our creations—at least, as argued by this theory—become part of the theoretically detectable technosphere (whether this region is a permanent fixture or a temporary arm of the biosphere is up for debate). Drawing on a sample size of one (i.e. human civilization), it's easy to think that progress will continue unabated until we become masters of our own Solar System and beyond. However, as Haqq-Mistra and Baum originally stated in 2009, this “Sustainability Solution” questions the assumption of the unimpeded exponential growth of such civilizations. 

“It is still possible that slower-growth ETI civilizations exist but have not expanded rapidly enough to be easily detectable by the searches humans have yet made,” the original authors wrote. “It is also possible that faster-growth ETI civilizations previously expanded throughout the galaxy but could not sustain this state, collapsing in a way that whatever artifacts they might have left have also remained undetected.”

Additionally, Likavčan's idea of “folding back into the biosphere,” means that advanced civilizations might instead create technologies that are essentially biological in nature in order to remain in balance with their finite resources. To support this point, Likavčan quotes Canadian sci-fi author Karl Schroeder, who wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature,” itself a reformulation of sci-fi Arthur C. Clarke's famous words that compared technology to magic. This could also explain why we haven't found civilizations while looking for technosignatures alone. 

Magic or no, the nature of the Fermi paradox makes it a “we won't know until we know” kind of question. But the exploration of possible solutions can also provide a valuable lens through which to value our own society, its future perils, and how we might—against all odds—survive long enough to one day solve this perplexing question.

These ‘Real-Life Mermaid' Divers Have Remarkable Underwater Abilities—and Genetics

The Haenyeo, an all-female group of divers on South Korea's Jeju Island, spend much of their lives underwater without equipment—a “superpower” that may be written into their DNA

Often likened to mermaids in media reports and popular culture, South Korea's famed Haenyeo (“sea women”) spend much of the day underwater, diving without scuba gear to collect abalone, octopus, kelp and other prized seafood. Admired both culturally and scientifically, they have been plunging into the frigid waters of Jeju Island since as early as 503 C.E.

Now, for the first time, a study has found both genetic adaptations and training effects that are unique to these women and could explain how the Haenyeo withstand the intense physical stresses that come with continuous diving. The findings, published in Cell Reports, zero in on specific genetic features of the Haenyeo that allow the bodies of these divers to more efficiently control blood pressure, for example. The researchers hope closer investigations into such genetic traits could inform future approaches to certain disorders or illnesses in the general population.

“The Haenyeo are really like superhumans,” says Melissa A. Ilardo, senior author of the study and an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Utah. “You cannot watch the Haenyeo dive and not think these women have superpowers.”

It's easy to see the Haenyeo as enigmatic. For centuries, they have conspicuously maintained their own culture and style. They sport unique broad-rimmed sun visors and tattooed eyebrows, and their skin is tanned and weathered by a lifetime of wind and saltwater. After Haenyeo divers age past their diving years, they still stick close to the sea and work along the shoreline, often tying a cushion to their backside to rest on as they lay kelp out to dry. They have kept their tradition afloat through Japan's decades-long occupation of the Korean Peninsula, massacres under dictatorships and relentless industrial development. And the new study suggests that there might even be a ring of scientific truth to “superpower” analogy.

“Given that [the Haenyeo] have this unique culture, unique language—all these things that are so different—it seems obvious that there would be some genetic differences,” Ilardo says. “But that wasn't something that had ever been investigated.”

Ilardo, who studies genetics of medically resilient humans around the world at her aptly named Superhuman Lab, had previously examined the physiology of a diving people called the Bajau in Southeast Asia. Her team found the Bajau had an extra large spleens that could store additional oxygenated blood for lengthy dives.

“If one group of divers had evolved to dive, then maybe others have as well,” Ilardo says. The Haenyeo—with their long diving history—stood out to the crew at the Superhuman Lab as another population that could have developed diving advantages.

“What's interesting about studying populations who have lived in a particular environment for many, many generations is that if there's been a selective pressure in that environment, you can look at their genomes and start to pull out regions that appear to be essential for their survival,” explains Tatum Simonson, a geneticist at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the new study. Those essential genetic irregularities are “probably linked to some aspect of physiology that has been beneficial over time in that environment.”

For the new study on the Haenyeo, the Superhuman Lab collaborated with physiologists from South Korea to simulate the effects of submersion on the divers themselves, compared with non-Haenyeo Jeju residents and mainland South Koreans. Participants laid on their stomach with their head over a bowl of cold water, periodically plunging their face under while the researchers measured how their reflexive submersion responses changed their heart rate and blood pressure.

The participants were all from the same country, yet they showed striking differences in these changes. Ilardo thinks that could be a direct result of natural selection. For example, “sleep apnea—which is kind of like unintentional diving in your sleep [in that it reduces oxygen availability]—increases the risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy,” she explains, adding that these can include preeclampsia (a pregnancy complication that can dangerously raise blood pressure). The Haenyeo are known to continue diving while pregnant, she notes. “If diving is increasing [a Haenyeo diver's] risk of preeclampsia, that could take out an entire generation,” Ilardo says.

But the Haenyeo aren't known to have a particularly high risk of hypertensive pregnancy disorders, and they have obviously birthed many generations of babies. Ilardo's research suggests it's likely that a gene allowing for better regulation of blood pressure has been passed down through the years.

Interestingly, the team found that all Jeju residents—even those without a Haenyeo family member—had a similar genetic variation that suppressed a reflexive blood pressure increase when diving. This suggests that the variation may have naturally spread throughout the island. It would also support Jeju's surprisingly low stroke death rate, which is around 24.3 per 100,000 for not just the Haenyeo but all of the island's residents—lower than the mainland city of Seoul's rate of 25.7 per 100,000 and the U.S.'s rate of 37 per 100,000.

But Ilardo notes that some physiological differences, such as heartbeat changes, were unique to the Haenyeo. During the face-dunking experiment, Haenyeo participants' heart rates slowed by 50 percent more, on average, compared with nondiver Jeju residents. This helps their bodies manage oxygen circulation through their bodies during a long dive, letting them “spend that resource as frugally as possible,” Ilardo says. She adds that this acquired trait could also develop in nondiver individuals who are not from Jeju Island. While the study did not test participants' cold tolerance, that is something the Superhuman Lab is planning to investigate in future work with the Haenyeo.

Researchers can learn vital lessons about human evolution from such unique adaptations, says Ben Trumble, an Arizona State University biologist who specializes in human biology and was not involved in the new study. Cataloging the lifestyle and genes of special populations such as the Haenyeo could inform research into areas such as precision medicine, which requires a specialized understanding of how certain genetic variations translate into physiological traits, Trumble explains.

“We're absolutely allowed to plagiarize from natural selection” in approaching health care, he says. “How natural selection solves a particular problem with a particular gene can give us clues for developing new drugs to treat some of the problems that people have in our society today.”

Studies such as Ilardo's take the “first step” toward medical applications, Trumble says, although he and Simonson believe any actual drugs that could emerge from such research will probably take longer to develop. In any case, Ilardo says, being able to pinpoint the genetic cause behind certain populations' remarkable abilities could offer remarkable solutions in medical genetics.

“I was just blown away by how amazing [the Haenyeo] are, how strong they are and how they balance that with this kindness and sensitivity and femininity,” Ilardo says. “I think by focusing on what makes the population special and unique..., it brings a health focus instead of a disease focus [to medical genetics research]. And it's certainly a much more fun way to do the science.”

And it'll take you less than two minutes.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

We've seen electric automakers attempt swappable battery packs with varying levels of success. However, the battery experts at Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited are collaborating with Chinese automakers to develop a standard that enables a new battery to be swapped with a depleted battery in just a minute and a half. The technology is promising enough that it's already being tested in a small-scale pilot program at the time we're writing this.

Unfortunately, it appears that CATL's Choco Swap technology will require a subscription to gain access. Once you've ticked the right boxes—and it comes time to charge up—you'll drive to the nearest Choco Swap station, where the battery pack is dropped out from under the car and swapped for a fully-charged replacement. As you'll see above, the technology is surprisingly simple. 

When we said the next-gen battery-swappable car already exists, we should clarify that it's not what we'd call a sportscar. A fleet of 1,000 Changan Oshan 520s, a four-door taxi cab, were the first to arrive with a 56 kilowatt-hour battery. It costs $23,000 and it's actually pretty brilliant. Along with its removable battery, the Oshan can also be plugged in like a conventional EV. It didn't take us long to realize that these swappable batteries are the perfect solution for fleet vehicles like taxi cabs—at least in areas that still use them. Less downtime to charge means more time working and, well, making money.

Each vehicle is fitted with CATL's Choco-SEB battery, named for its chocolate-bar-like appearance. It's currently available in two different form factors: one for smaller vehicles like the Changan, and another larger size for commercial “A- or B-Class” vehicles. For context, CATL has already helped Chinese automakers release 10 different “Choco Swap” compatible vehicles.

First and foremost, charging a battery is best done slowly. Your automaker might not tell you, but charging—especially fast charging—produces a lot of heat. And that can potentially decrease your battery's lifespan. 

Information regarding the charging and distribution of the “spent” batteries remains sparse, but the Choco system would theoretically allow much more time to recharge them. This would allow the batteries from the discard pile to be charged much slower than many of the existing rapid charging solutions we have at the moment. And that's good news, as slow charging promotes battery longevity. 

One of the biggest questions that came up for us is what EV owners should do if they merely need to top up their battery before a road trip; what if you theoretically had 65-percent charge and wanted to top up to 100 before you set off again? Is it really worth the hassle to swap in an entirely new battery? Thankfully, that's why vehicles like the Oshan 520 can be charged just like many of the other EVs on sale today. 

It's all too easy with these new and exciting technologies for stories to claim that it “makes the gas station obsolete” or “change the EV game” forever. While we admire that it's a brilliant innovation, we should clarify that it isn't perfect. Along with many unanswered questions about logistics, the fact remains that automakers still can't decide on one single charging standard. We don't disagree that the new battery swap technology is fast, but we do wonder about other factors including how much it will cost, how much demand there will be, vehicle compatibility, and what happens if the new battery doesn't work. 

CATL states that it's already operating 34 battery-swap stations in Chongqing, China, with plans to have 50 stations by year's end. Looking at the bigger picture, the Chinese battery giant is targeting a rollout of 1,000 swap points across China in the same timeframe—end of 2025. As of right now, Chinese automakers GAC, Chery, NIO, FAW, and BAIC, are also looking to adapt to the new standard.

A clinical trial using engineered immune cells to hunt cancer cells has reported impressive results for solid tumours, a type of cancer that is difficult to treat. Compared with standard treatments, the immunotherapy lengthened survival of people with cancer1.

The phase II clinical trial in China tested chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in people with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, which are solid tumours. To create CAR-T-cell therapies, T cells are collected from a person with cancer and tweaked to produce proteins that target cancer cells. The T cells are then infused back into the same person. CAR-T-cell therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but has been most successful against blood cancers.

“Solid tumours generally don't respond well to CAR-T-cell therapy,” says Lisa Mielke, a cancer researcher at the Olivia Newton John Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg, Australia. The trials are among the first in which CAR-T-cell therapy has had promising results against solid tumours. They provide “evidence that there is potential for CAR T cells to be further optimized for future treatment of patients with solid tumours”, adds Mielke.

The treatment, called satricabtagene autoleucel (satri-cel), targets CLDN18.2, a molecule expressed in large quantities in gastrointestinal tumours.

The trial included 156 participants, aged 18–75, who had received at least two unsuccessful treatments for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer and had tumour-tissue samples that were positive for CLDN18.2. Satri-cel was given to 88 people up to 3 times over the study period, along with a regimen that removed non-specific immune cells to make the treatment more effective. The remaining 52 people formed the control group, receiving standard therapies such as nivolumab, paclitaxel or rivoceranib.

Of the people treated with satri-cel, 35% responded to it, compared with just 4% of people receiving standard care. Those receiving CAR-T-cell therapy also lived an average of 2.4 months longer and were 31% less likely to die than the people in the control group.

Metrics details

Governments in many European countries have high hopes for cheap green hydrogen (H2) from Africa to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. Using geospatial levelized cost models, this study evaluates the economic feasibility of exporting green H2 in the form of ammonia from Africa to Europe under four realistic financing scenarios by 2030. Our findings suggest that without European policy interventions, green H2 from Africa remains prohibitively expensive with least costs from €4.2 kgH2−1 to €4.9 kgH2−1 depending on the interest rate environment. Using de-risking policy, we identify 214 locations in six African countries that may be competitive in the current interest rate environment, yet many of these face a challenging security situation casting doubt on long-term investments. Under optimal policy and interest rate scenarios, we find a least cost of €3.2 kgH2−1 in Mauritania by 2030. Overall, de-risking and strategic location selection are key to make African green H2 exports competitive on the global stage.

In 2022, 99% of hydrogen (H2) was produced using fossil fuels1. This ‘grey' H2 mainly serves demand from the refining and industrial sectors. Achieving net zero requires a change to ‘green' H2 using renewable energy to meet current demand at low emissions and to decarbonize further hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel production1. Decarbonizing such hard-to-abate sectors is projected to cause an almost sixfold increase in global H2 demand by 20501.

However, deploying green H2 at scale will require market-competitive costs. As of 2022, green H2 constituted a mere 0.1% of global H2 production1, with costs 2–3 times higher than grey H2 (refs. 2,3). To become competitive, technical and operational cost reductions could be pursued, projected at up to 85% through lower-cost renewable electricity, reduced electrolyser costs, enhanced electrolyser efficiency and optimized operating hours2. Additionally, shifting green H2 production to more cost-efficient locations with better availability of renewable energy, including overseas4,5, could increase its competitiveness against other types of hydrogen production.

The European Union explicitly supports the creation of green H2 export markets and aims to import 10 megatons (MT) of green H2 to support decarbonization6. Over 70 potential supply regions, many in Africa7 due to often abundant renewable energy, have been identified, and bilateral agreements have already been signed, for example, between the European Union and Namibia8. African countries have started implementing domestic H2 policies too, with countries such as Namibia, South Africa, Morocco and Kenya developing strategies focused on export9.

Geospatial modelling including variable capital expenditure (CAPEX) or energy cost10 is commonly used to inform policymakers on the economic viability of different green H2 (ref. 11) production locations. We complement the available green H2 cost estimates for the African continent, such as H2Atlas Africa12, in at least three substantive ways. We provide spatially more comprehensive and more precise results for 10,300 locations across the entire continent. We base these on realistic demand scenarios, and we do so in a transparent and replicable way. Yet, irrespective of the granularity, these models typically use a uniform financing cost or cost of capital (COC) set to 4–8% (refs. 10,13,14), which is problematic as energy infrastructure research indicates large variations in COC across Africa15. The few studies that account for these variations leverage data from the oil and gas sector16 or country-specific ratings17,18,19, which do not adequately represent the specific risks associated with green H2 investments and lack empirical calibration. Consequently, current modelling risks producing overly optimistic green H2 levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) estimates for export from African countries due to inaccurate representation of their investment and policy environments20. Given the existing north–south disparities regarding decisionmaking power and future visions for the sector21, this is ever more concerning because it could result in unviable infrastructure investments and stranded assets without development benefits in African countries.

To tackle this issue, here we estimate COC across potential green H2 exporters in Africa for four realistic financing scenarios and use these to calculate LCOH. Differentiating COC by country, financing structure and interest rate environment—verified through expert interviews—we optimize green H2 production locations using GeoH2 (refs. 13,14), a geospatial least-cost model that optimizes production, transport, storage and conversion using granular spatial data. On the basis of an overview of currently planned projects, we model the case of ammonia production, which is shipped and reconverted to H2 in Europe. For simplicity, we choose Rotterdam as the entry port, and we exclude the possibility of pipeline construction or refurbishment for transport to Europe as we analyse the cost of projects to be operational in 2030. A flowchart in Supplementary Fig. 9 depicts the process, which is described in Methods.

To understand the status of green H2 development throughout the African continent, we identified all projects planned to be operational by 2030. We restricted the analysis to African countries with port access, as landlocked countries would need to negotiate agreements to secure transportation to ports, introducing further complexity and uncertainty. Somalia and Libya are excluded due to political instability, and small island states are excluded due to infrastructure and space constraints, resulting in a sample of 31 countries (Methods). Thirty-four projects are found across seven countries (Fig. 1), 89% of which are either at concept or feasibility stages. Two of the projects have reached a financial investment decision and are under construction, and only one small-scale project (that is, 3.5 MW) in South Africa is operational. Planned project sizes vary from 3.5 MW to 6.9 GW. Whereas Egypt and South Africa have numerous smaller projects planned, Mauritania has three large projects planned, totalling 7 GW of capacity. This includes giga-scale projects Nour and Aman, two of the largest green H2 export projects planned globally22,23.

a, Number of projects by project status (bars) and the sum of planned capacity by country (bar labels). b, Share of planned standardized electrolyser capacity. Only projects planned to go online by 2030 are included. Projects can have more than one end use; hence, shares in b add up to 112%. Information on local versus export end use is unavailable. Note that capacity figures were not available for two planned projects in Mauritania and Morocco. Methods provide data sources and details on sample selection. Data as of December 2023. FID, final investment decision.

Figure 1 shows that 74% of planned electrolyser capacity is intended for ammonia (NH3) production. NH3 offers advantages as a H2 carrier for long-distance transport, including higher volumetric energy density compared to gaseous or liquid H2, and avoiding the boil-off rate of liquefied H2 (refs. 24,25). Moreover, unlike gaseous or liquid H2, international trade networks for NH3 are well established, so existing port facilities and trade routes can be utilized for shipping. Finally, the 2024 H2Global auction for African green H2 to be exported to Europe has resulted in a winning bid from an Egyptian project shipping NH3 to Rotterdam, illustrating the practical relevance of the case. For the remainder of this Article, we therefore analyse the economic viability of exporting green H2 by producing NH3, maintaining this state for transport and shipping and converting NH3 to H2 upon import. This excludes the consideration of other shipping carriers, such as liquid organic hydrogen carriers or methanol (CH4), as the intent of this work is not a comprehensive cost modelling of different theoretical options but providing guidance on the expected cost competitiveness of green H2 exported from African countries to Europe by 2030.

To date, only three green H2 deals have reached financial closure on the African continent, as shown in Fig. 1. Consequently, it is impossible to draw on empirical data regarding the COC for green H2 projects across African countries. Therefore, we developed four financing scenarios shown in Table 1, estimated the COC for each and triangulated the approach through 12 semi-structured expert interviews conducted in February–September 2023 (Methods). The scenarios are defined based on two dimensions: the general interest rate environment (reflecting the risk-free rate) and the policy environment. On interest rate, we depict an investment-friendly world with low interest rates reflective of the time after the financial crisis in 2008 (2009–2013) and a cash-constrained world with high interest rates reflective of the most recent full year of data available (August 2023–July 2024; Methods). For policy, we contrast a de-risked scenario, where European policymakers issue a complete price and off-taker guarantee to lower investment risk, with a commercial scenario, where investment risk lies entirely with the project sponsor. The COC in the de-risked scenario differs by country despite identical offtake guarantees because, based on expert interviews, we assume projects require insurance against expropriation and war by the World Bank Group (Methods provide operationalizing scenarios). As such, the COC can be understood as an aggregate financial metric, which includes underlying techno-economic and socio-political risks. Contrary to many existing reports12, which calculate the cost of green H2 first and then incorporate risk as a qualitative contextual factor, this approach allows us to consider these risks and their variance by country explicitly in the modelling of the cost of green H2 via the COC.

Figure 2 shows the calculated COC for green H2 projects by country, including investment into dedicated renewable generation and transport infrastructure, for scenarios 1 and 2. These are most representative of the current macroeconomic environment where interest rates are relatively high (Methods), and they illustrate the de-risking effect of offtake guarantees by European governments. Data on scenarios 3 and 4 are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1.

a, COC for a private commercial and a public de-risked scenario in a high general interest environment (scenarios 1 and 2). b, Average COC for all scenarios. Country COC for a low interest rate environment is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Country differences result from different investment risks based on default spreads, whereas differences between policy scenarios—commercial versus de-risked—are the result of different sources of capital and premia (Methods). Excludes landlocked countries and Libya and Somalia (Methods).

Figure 2 shows the large variance in commercial COC across the sampled countries, from 26.5% in Sudan to 10.6% in Morocco with an average of 15.5%. It also shows that de-risking projects has two effects. First, it lowers the COC for all countries to 9.0% on average (a 42% reduction). This improves the economic viability of green H2 substantially as shown in subsequent analyses (Figs. 3–5). Second, de-risking reduces the variance of COC across countries. Whereas in the commercial scenario, COC varies by 15.9 percentage points across countries, this variance reduces to 1.9 percentage points in a de-risked scenario. Hence, de-risking acts as a leveller, bringing green H2 costs across different countries much closer together.

Each violin plot shows the distribution of LCOH for imports from all modelled locations to Rotterdam. The width of the violin indicates the density of the distribution. Scenarios are defined as shown in Table 1. The orange line represents the cost of producing green H2 in Rotterdam by 2030 as described in Methods; the green line shows green H2 least cost realized in the European Hydrogen Bank auction closed in February 2024 with production scheduled to start in 2029 at the latest (Supplementary Table 6). Colours indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of green hydrogen produced in Rotterdam. Note that violin plots are fizzy at the end points, which exceed the minimum/maximum of the distribution. Supplementary Fig. 8 provides a boxplot for clear minimum/maximum values. The dotted line on the colour bar denotes the mean modelled cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam across the four scenarios. Dashed black lines within the violin plots indicate the median, and dotted black lines indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles. Supplementary Table 2 provides exact values. Excludes landlocked countries and Libya and Somalia (Methods).

The orange line represents the cost of producing green H2 in Rotterdam by 2030 as described in Methods. Colours are on the same scale as in Fig. 3 and indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam, yellow is near the European cost and red is likely to be uncompetitive. Dashed black lines within the violin plots indicate the median and dotted black lines indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles. Supplementary Fig. 2 details scenarios 3 and 4.

The detailed map costs shown are for scenario 2, cash-constrained de-risked. Supplementary Fig. 4 details scenario 1. Supplementary Fig. 3 provides continent maps for scenarios 3 and 4. Countries are not shown to scale to improve readability; each hexagon is the same area across all sub-figures. Colours indicate the cost competitiveness with European green H2 projects, where blue is ‘in the money' compared to the cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam, yellow is near the European cost and red is likely to be uncompetitive. The dotted line on the colour bar denotes the mean modelled cost of hydrogen produced in Rotterdam across the four scenarios. Stars denote planned projects, as listed in Fig. 1. Triangles denote the respective port of the country. Basemaps from GADM.

Finally, the absolute de-risking effect amounts to 6.5 percentage points, irrespective of the interest rate environment (Fig. 2b), which translates into a relative reduction of 42–52% depending on the interest rate scenario. Hence, the policy effect of 6.5 percentage points exceeds the difference between the two interest rate scenarios of 3 percentage points, and the combined difference of policy and interest rate environment amounts to a staggering 9.5 percentage points (average difference between scenarios 1 and 4).

The GeoH2 model is employed to calculate the LCOH achievable in each country by optimizing location-specific production, transport, storage and conversion. The greenfield cost of NH3 production from renewable electricity is modelled for 10,300 hexagons (~1,770 km2 each) covering the 31 sample countries (Methods). A plant size of 300 MW, the median size of African projects with a planned operation by 2030, is modelled (Fig. 1). Hourly solar and wind data are used to optimize solar PV, onshore wind, battery storage, electrolysis, H2 storage and NH3 storage, subject to realistic technical constraints (Methods). As we consider plants to be operational by 2030, we focus on shipping to Europe (that is, Rotterdam) rather than pipeline transport, a potential option for North African countries. Given the recent results of H2Global auctions, shipping is confirmed to be the most realistic option for North African countries, such as Egypt, too. We assume the NH3 is transported from the production location to the closest domestic port and shipped to Rotterdam, where it is converted into green H2. Pipeline and trucking transport to the port are considered; the cheapest option is selected for each hexagon. Shipping costs to Rotterdam are calculated per distance based on the literature (Methods). LCOH is calculated for each hexagon using country-specific COC values (for example, as in Fig. 2) for the four scenarios in Table 1. The results are contrasted with a European green H2 cost estimate inferred from our model and triangulated with values from literature.

Figure 3 shows the resulting LCOH distribution across the sampled coastal African countries under each financing scenario. In a high interest environment (scenarios 1 and 2), least costs for green H2 exported from Africa are €4.9 kgH2−1 without policy support and €3.8 kgH2−1 when fully de-risked by European governments. In a low interest environment (scenarios 3 and 4), these costs come down to €4.2 kgH2−1 and €3.2 kgH2−1, respectively. Recent auction results from H2Global point to a price of green H2 around €4.5 kgH2−1 for de-risked delivery to Rotterdam from 2027 until 203326, well in line with our results. Our results also demonstrate the importance of de-risking, which reduces least costs by €1.1 kgH2−1 and median costs by €3.9 kgH2−1 (average between high- and low interest environment).

The lowest achievable costs in the sampled African countries are roughly in the range of estimates for European green H2 by 2030, around €3–5 kgH2−1 (Methods), demonstrating that achieving cost competitiveness with European green H2 will be challenging. In the current high interest macroeconomic environment, cost-competitive production (that is, below costs in Rotterdam estimated at €4.67–4.75 kgH2−1 with slight variations according to scenarios; Methods and Supplementary Table 2) is unattainable without de-risking. With de-risking, only 2.1% of all studied locations are economically competitive (Supplementary Table 2 and compare Fig. 4). These are situated in Algeria, Kenya, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia and Sudan. In a low interest rate environment, the proportions of locations reaching cost competitiveness without de-risking remains minimal at 0.5% (11.0% with de-risking). We find no location competitive with the first round of auction results by the European Hydrogen Bank, which yielded a lowest bid of €2.8 kgH2−1 in Spain (Supplementary Table 6).

De-risking not only increases the number of cost-competitive African locations but also narrows the cost distribution substantially across countries. Costs range from €4.9–22.8 kgH2−1 without de-risking in the current macroeconomic environment but only from €3.8 to €12.0 kgH2−1 with de-risking. Irrespective of the interest rate environment, the lowest-cost locations for green H2 production without de-risking are mainly in Morocco and Algeria, due to their relatively good institutional quality, exceptional wind resources and relative proximity to Rotterdam. With de-risking, the lowest-cost locations shift to Mauritania with a few in Algeria and Namibia. Whereas Mauritania shares Morocco's advantages in wind resources and proximity to Europe, it has lower institutional quality, reflected in its higher COC compared to Morocco (that is, 13.6% versus 10.6% without de-risking, 8.6% versus 8.1% with de-risking).

To further clarify spatial cost variance, Fig. 5a,b maps continent-wide LCOH for scenarios 1 and 2 alongside planned project locations (Supplementary Fig. 3 for scenarios 3 and 4). It also shows detailed LCOH for countries with planned projects above 1 MW for scenario 2 (Fig. 5c–i and Supplementary Fig. 4 for scenario 1). Most low-cost regions are north of the Equator, with some in the Southern Hemisphere. Equatorial costs are high due to moderate wind resources and consistent cloud cover, increasing renewable energy cost and thus LCOH. We identify least-cost green H2 production locations in the Western Sahara (modelled as part of Morocco, the authors make no statement about its political status), Mauritania, Central Algeria, at the Sudanese–Egyptian border and Lake Turkana's shores at the Kenyan–Ethiopian border. Some coastal areas in Namibia and South Africa also exhibit low costs as shown in Fig. 5h,i.

To increase the number of cost-competitive African green H2 production locations, cost drivers and cost-reduction levers must be identified. To this end, a detailed cost breakdown for the least-cost green H2 location by country is provided in Fig. 6. This figure shows that the lowest LCOH is achieved by leveraging excellent onshore wind resources, which facilitate lower-cost green H2 production than solar photovoltaics (PV) systems due to their more consistent electricity output. Scrutinizing the temporal optimization results, we find that NH3 and compressed H2 storage are used to balance intermittent renewable energy generation and demand more cost competitively than battery storage in all examined countries' least-cost production locations (Supplementary Fig. 5). Nevertheless, more consistent wind resources reduce the expenditure required for any form of storage, driving down costs.

Cost for the least-cost location in each country under scenario 2, cash-constrained de-risked. Supplementary Fig. 6 shows scenario 1. ‘Other' contains costs for H2 compression and decompression, trucking transportation, battery interface, Haber–Bosch process, H2 fuel cell and a ramping penalty. Excludes landlocked countries and Libya and Somalia (Methods).

Figure 6 also shows that renewable energy investment constitutes the largest cost component for all countries. This points to two levers for cost reductions. First, lowering renewable energy costs would directly reduce the cost of green H2. This could potentially enhance the cost competitiveness of African green H2 exports, depending on concurrent impacts on European electricity prices, as these would probably move too if renewable energy costs shift drastically. Note that we currently consider a Rotterdam reference case using grid electricity. If contrasted with a newly built renewable energy production facility, wind energy cost changes would only affect the relative cost advantage to the extent that African projects face a higher COC and therefore benefit from a CAPEX reduction slightly more. Secondly, efficient de-risking (that is, maximally reducing the COC) can lower COC-intensive investments into renewables and consequently green H2 costs. Whereas movements in the general interest rate would affect the cost competitiveness of African projects compared to European ones only to the extent that African projects are more capital intensive because they require greenfield renewable energy, strong de-risking would improve the cost competitiveness of African projects directly. Finally, shipping costs are shown to have a marginal impact on LCOH. This suggests that potential economies of scale in NH3 shipping or repurposing existing pipelines from northern Africa to southern Europe may not notably enhance cost competitiveness of African green H2. On the upside, it indicates that uncertainties around NH3 shipping costs should not constitute a major impediment to planning green H2 export projects in African countries. We conduct a sensitivity analysis shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 where we vary the most important and most discussed input costs (that is, wind, solar PV and electrolyser CAPEX) by ± 20% for each financing scenario, indicating that a combination of wind and electrolyser CAPEX reductions could lower costs by roughly €0.5 kgH2−1 depending on the scenario. We note that battery storage costs may also decrease substantially making solar PV a more viable electricity source by powering the electrolyser at night (compared with Supplementary Fig. 5). However, for the purpose of this analysis, we subsume this effect into the modelled cost decrease of solar PV, which yielded minimal benefits as shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Our findings indicate that using African green H2 to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors in Europe might be unrealistic without de-risking from European countries, at least in the near-term. In a commercial scenario, green H2 from Africa is not cost competitive by 2030. With de-risking, several locations (2.1% of all studied) become cost competitive, yet questions around the economic feasibility of large infrastructure projects in many of these locations remain, as they face challenging localized security situations. Notwithstanding these challenges, de-risking is probably necessary to develop a market with a sufficient portfolio of potential locations, and future research is required to assess the potential for improved competitiveness beyond 2030.

Results also illuminate potential issues beyond cost that could hinder investment. First, many low-cost locations are in regions that are either politically contested or encounter relatively regular flares of armed conflict where the UK and German governments advise against travel. These include Western Sahara (partly), Central Algeria (border areas), the Sudanese–Egyptian border (entire Sudan) and the Kenyan–Ethiopian border (border areas in Ethiopia)27,28. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or off-taker guarantees are probably unavailable in these areas, limiting de-risking potential. While beyond the scope of this paper, future analyses could consider investment risk variations within countries, including in specific regions with severe political instabilities. Second, the size of the planned investments relative to the GDP raises questions on feasibility. For example, as of 2021, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Mauritania is roughly US$10 billion; however, the planned green H2 project Aman is estimated to require an investment of US$40 billion, four times the country's GDP29,30. This situation is concerning as many African countries face massive foreign debt burdens31. Third, whereas we find that wind resources are critical to low-cost green H2 production, local expertise to install this wind capacity may be insufficient. For context, there were 7.7 GW of installed wind capacity on the continent in 2022 (versus 12.5 GW of solar PV)15; meanwhile, wind plants on GW scale will be needed for each H2 production site (for example, up to 1.6 GW in Morocco), requiring massive upskilling efforts. Finally, some low-cost locations, such as those near the Red Sea or the river Nile in Egypt, may also face challenges of water insecurity potentially disrupting consistent production. Whereas water costs are considered in GeoH2, the potential for water depletion and associated conflict risks are not at present.

African countries will face global competition for cheap green H2 production from countries such as Chile32, Oman33 and Saudi Arabia1 with plans to expand production of H2 and downstream products (for example, iron). These countries have the domestic financial resources to fund infrastructure development, institutional frameworks to attract large international private investment and strategic locations along major international trading routes. European countries such as Spain also offer favourable H2 production costs, low COC and proximity to demand locations17. Tailored de-risking support from international organizations, such as the World Bank or the United Nations Development Program34,35, may therefore be necessary for African nations to compete. The use of such support tools should be contingent on the provision of benefits of green H2 production for local economies beyond export revenues only.

Similarly, African countries should consider such benefits in bilateral negotiations with prospective green H2 importers. Considering the prospects for local industrial use of green H2 (for example, in creating value-added downstream products) when designing policy support schemes may favour countries such as Morocco, Egypt, South Africa or Kenya, in contrast to Mauritania or Namibia, as the latter exhibit less fitting industrial pre-conditions, which are relevant for the successful implementation of green H2 production value chains36. African countries could also strike intra-continental agreements concerning the optimal production, use and trade of green H2, which may necessitate modelling costs for countries that are excluded in the present analysis. International organizations may consider de-risking local use in such cases. Whereas potentially more challenging, such multi-use projects may improve developmental impacts and avoid neo-colonial extractive patterns of excessively large, export-only projects—a risk evident in planned projects. Comprehensive plans for economic development around green H2 production will be crucial to ensure a beneficial industry for decarbonization in Europe and development in Africa alike.

As described in the flowchart in Supplementary Fig. 9, we start by describing the sample. We model the LCOH for all African countries with access to ports, excluding landlocked countries, due to the logistical and infrastructural complexities that hinder H2 export from these areas. Further, Somalia and Libya are excluded from our analysis given that in the past 5 years, both countries were in the bottom 5% of the World Bank Governance Indicators in terms of political stability37. It is therefore likely that investors would refrain from any project in these countries, irrespective of the theoretical COC. Finally, we exclude small island states such as Cape Verde or Mauritius from our analysis due to space and infrastructure constraints. This yields a list of 31 African countries for our sample, which constitutes 85% of total African GDP38.

To collect planned green H2 projects, we use the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Hydrogen Database, which lists 1,991 H2 projects as of December 202322. Of these, 66 projects are located in our sample countries and plan to produce H2 from electrolysis using renewable electricity from either wind or solar. Note that our scope excludes two projects in Zimbabwe, one of which was decommissioned in 2015, and one project in Niger. We further restrict our sample to projects planned to go online by 2030 for two reasons. First, announced projects with live dates beyond 2030 are probably speculative, and it is difficult to assess the credibility of the plans. Second, the COC and several other cost factors, such as the cost of renewables or the cost of NH3 shipping are changing over time, making cost projections beyond 2030 difficult.

The final green H2 project sample consists of 34 projects, for which we include the project's development status, planned first year of operation, designated end-use applications and size in standardized electrolysis capacity as calculated by the IEA in MW H2 output (LHV) for all Power-to-X projects (Supplementary Table 3)22. We use the median planned capacity of 60.6 kt H2 yr−1 as the green H2 demand for the LCOH modelling. Capacity affects the LCOH via economies of scale (for example, in the electrolyser) and space constraints as larger projects need more space, mainly for renewable energy build-out.

Between February and August 2023, F. Schneider and F. Egli conducted 12 virtual exploratory expert interviews with 13 representatives to inform the financing scenarios shown in Table 1. Because green H2 projects at scale are currently hypothetical on the African continent, the interviews served to understand the planned financing structures. All interviews followed the same question guide provided in a slide deck to interviewees. Interviewees were sampled from organizations that would probably be involved in financing deals if de-risked by European policymakers. Early interviewees were contacted using the researchers' network and subsequent ones via snowball sampling. Systematic sampling is impossible because few experts globally can comment on the planned financing structures. Note that interviews only served to triangulate our COC estimation approach, which is based on peer-reviewed literature. Hence, we are less concerned about potential sampling biases regarding gender or region. Interviews took place under Chatham House rules, and consent to use provided information in research was obtained at the beginning together with shared information on the research project in the form of a slide deck. No personal information beyond participants' names and affiliations was obtained and interviewees are listed anonymously only. An overview of the interview sample is provided in Supplementary Table 4.

The COC is the price that a profit-maximizing capital provider demands for investing equity into a project or issuing debt (for example, loans) for a project. The COC increases with the risk for an investor of being unable to recoup their investment, for example, due to uncertain policy environments or novel risky technologies. In financial economics, it is common practice to decompose the COC into a risk-free rate (reflecting the time value of money) and a risk premium (reflecting the investment-specific risk). The latter typically differs between countries, technologies and over time39. A standard project-level specification of the COC is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), where capital is sourced from equity and debt financing. The WACC reflects the costs of obtaining debt and equity financing, respectively, and the share of each type within the total capital budget. In line with the literature39, a standard notation ‘vanilla-WACC' (no consideration of potential tax deductions for debt payments) can be defined as follows:

where \({K}_{{\mathrm{e}},{{i}}}\) and \({K}_{{\mathrm{d}},i}\) denote the cost of equity and the cost of debt, respectively, for investments in a specific country i. \(E\), \(D\) and \(V\) denote total equity, debt and capital; the debt share is denoted as \(\frac{D}{V}\). As we model the case of exporting green H2 from Africa to Europe, it is uncertain which entities would be liable to pay tax where and we do not consider a country-specific tax rate. We use the terms COC and WACC interchangeably in this paper, focusing on COC in the main text for simplicity. In the absence of a track record for the financing of green H2 projects globally and certainly in Africa, we define four financing scenarios to model the COC based on insights from the finance literature and expert interviews (Table 1, main text).

Across all financing scenarios, we use a separate COC for the plant investment encompassing H2 production facilities (for example, the electrolyser), the renewable energy generation assets and the supporting infrastructure encompassing roads, pipelines and so on. The risk-free rate \({r}_\mathrm{f}\) is based on two indicators: a long-term risk-free bond, commonly depicted with the 10-year US treasury bond yield and an overnight interbank rate reflecting the current interest rate environment, commonly depicted with the Effective Federal Funds Rate (FFR). In line with previous work40, we estimate \({r}_\mathrm{f}\) for a high and a low interest rate scenario to account for the fact that the interest rate environment has a large impact on the cost of renewables. We set \({r}_{\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{low}}}\) to 2%, which is reflective of the 5-year average of the 10-year treasury bond in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 between 2009 and 2013 (2.68%), considering the FFR was substantially lower during that period (0.14%)41,42. Conversely, \({r}_{\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{high}}}\) is set to 5%, which is representative of the high interest environment over the last year (August 2023–July 2024) at the time of writing. During this period, the average 10-year US treasury bond yield stood at 4.33% and the FFR at 5.33% (refs. 41,42). In this Article, we therefore consider the high interest rate environment (Table 1) to be representative of the status quo. The share of debt in total financing, \(\frac{D}{V}\), is assumed to be 75% across all scenarios18.

We model a commercial scenario in both interest rate environments (Table 1, main text). For these commercial scenarios 1 and 3, we define the cost of debt to reflect lending to a large infrastructure project in a specific country. Namely, we add a country default spread to reflect country risk43 (\({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\)) and a lender margin (\({L}_\mathrm{m}\)), which we set to 2% in line with the literature15,44,45, to reflect infrastructure risk. The country default spreads are reflective of country risk at the time of writing in 2023. The cost of debt for the plant is therefore given by:

Similar to the cost of debt, the cost of equity contains a country mark-up. Furthermore, we add an equity risk premium and a technology premium to reflect the additional risk of equity compared to debt and the risk of green H2 investments, as there is a very limited track record. The cost of equity for commercial scenarios was calculated as follows:

where ERP is the equity risk premium of a mature market, set to 5% in July 202343. \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) varies by country i and accounts for the return that investors require as compensation for the risk of an investment in a publicly listed company in each country. In addition, the technology premium (Tp) reflects that green H2 is a relatively immature technology with a limited track record of successfully constructing large-scale projects. Following a recent IRENA report15, Tp is set to 3.25%, reflecting an investment premium for novel technologies. Because ref. 43 does not provide \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) and \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) for Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Djibouti and Mauritania, \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) is obtained using Wikiratings as described in Supplementary Table 5. Thereafter, \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{{\mathrm{Host}}_{i}}\) is calculated following the approach suggested by ref. 43.

Finally, we assume that any supporting infrastructure will be financed by a project's host government at its sovereign rate. Consequently, the COC for infrastructure is given by:

For the de-risked scenarios 2 and 4 (Table 1, main text), we model a situation where a green H2 project on the African continent benefits from access to below-market terms financing due to an offtake guarantee from a western European government entity. This assumption follows developments driven in particular by Germany, which has established diplomatic relations to support the transition of current fossil fuel exporting nations such as Angola or Nigeria to a decarbonized energy export industry by substituting fossil fuel exports at least partially by H2 (ref. 46). Moreover, Germany has recently announced a joint declaration of intent with the Netherlands to implement a joint tender under the H2Global Instrument, offering 10-year purchase agreements to suppliers to kick-start the emergent European green H2 import market47. Finally, Germany has signed further bilateral partnership agreements with countries such as South Africa48, Namibia49 and Kenya50.

In these scenarios, the cost of debt can be represented as follows:

where \({\mathrm{CDS}}_{\mathrm{WesternEU}}\) represents the average default spread of a western European country weighted by its GDP, where western Europe includes Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom43. In July 2023, this amounted to 0.96% (ref. 43). Despite the offtake guarantee, certain risks, such as the risk of expropriation or war, will remain. Consequently, we assume that in scenarios 2 and 4, investors will seek insurance against such political risks, which could disrupt operations or damage assets. Informed by the expert interviews and because private political risk insurance is not available in most countries in our sample, we assume political risk insurance by the World Bank Group's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). \({\mathrm{MIGA}}_{{\mathrm{expr}}_{i}}\) and \({\mathrm{MIGA}}_{{\mathrm{war}}_{i}}\) represent the price for obtaining such coverage for war and expropriation risk. As the MIGA pricing is confidential, we develop a heuristic to approximate the pricing based on reports and the expert interviews. Reference 51 states that the price per MIGA risk ranges from 0.5% to 1.75% of the total sum insured, depending on the country and project risk. Assuming that in a de-risked scenario, only country risk will remain as the project is fully de-risked, the distribution of in-sample country risk, reflected by the credit default spread provided by ref. 43 can be mapped onto the pricing range indicated by ref. 51. Formally, the approach can be represented as follows:

where \(x\) is the percentile of the default spread of a country based on ref. 43, \(g\left(x\right)\) returns the percentile of the CDS in the sample distribution and f() maps the percentile to the corresponding percentile of the MIGA pricing range51.

The cost of equity was calculated as follows:

where \({\mathrm{CRP}}_{\mathrm{WesternEU}}\) reflects the average equity country risk premium in Western Europe weighted by GDP. In July 2023, this premium was 1.37% (ref. 43).

Finally, we assume that infrastructure in the de-risked scenarios is either financed by the host government, that is, as in the commercial scenarios or financed by the project sponsor backed with an offtake guarantee from a western European government. We therefore define the COC for infrastructure investments in the de-risked scenarios as the minimum of the host government's sovereign rate \({\mathrm{WACC}}_{\mathrm{commercial},\mathrm{infra}}\) and the de-risked COC based on \({K}_{\mathrm{e},i,\mathrm{derisked},\mathrm{plant}}\) and \({K}_{\mathrm{d},i,\mathrm{derisked},\mathrm{plant}}\). A detailed breakdown of how the COC components were obtained and the corresponding data sources are provided in Supplementary Table 5.

The GeoH2 optimization model is used to calculate the lowest possible cost of H2 achievable throughout each country, assuming an electrolyser lifetime of 20 years. Electrolyser lifetimes are subject to some uncertainty, but do not have a major impact on LCOH52 and most importantly for this analysis, affect the LCOH in European and African countries alike except for a small penalty for Africa-based production due to higher financing costs on the CAPEX. The model tessellates the country into hexagons and calculates the costs to (1) produce the specified quantity of green H2 (or here green NH3) in each hexagon, (2) convert it to the required state for transport and (3) transport it to a specified demand location. In each hexagon, a cost-optimal off-grid H2 plant powered by PV and wind turbines is designed to meet the specified demand. The electrical infrastructure (that is, PV, turbines, battery storage) and plant infrastructure (that is, electrolyser, NH3 storage, compressed H2 storage) are sized for cost optimality using site-specific, hourly weather data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 dataset53. Here data for the duration of 2022 are used. The Corine Land Cover54 and OpenStreetMap55 datasets are used to constrain land availability in each hexagon, and country boundary base maps are from GADM, which allows free academic re-use. The costs to transport the H2 to port are calculated for both road transport (that is, trucking) and pipeline transport, including construction of necessary infrastructure. Water costs for either desalination or freshwater processing are included as applicable—however, no limit is placed on water consumption to avoid depletion in either case. Cost parameters used in the modelling are available in Supplementary Table 1 and harmonized to 2023 euros using average annual US$/€ exchange rates from the Economic Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and an annual average of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices from Eurostat. Further details on the GeoH2 model implementation are available in the model descriptor14.

The model is applied to each country in the project sample. A demand of 60.6 ktH2 yr−1 is simulated at each country's main port. This demand is assumed to be met in the form of green NH3 (that is, 341.4 ktNH3 yr−1) due to its cost advantages in shipping and to be temporally uniform (that is, evenly spaced truck pick-ups throughout the year or a consistent pipeline flow rate). As NH3 is utilized as a transport vector, we build on the ammonia trade literature. A first stream of this literature investigates green ammonia costs in/from specific countries56,57 and trading routes58 whereby a second stream of literature looks at global ammonia trade. Reference 59 applies a global optimization model to locate optimal ammonia production sites, however the site selection is based on a previous paper and planned projects, considering a total of 112 sites. Such models are great to assess the cost competitiveness of planned projects; however, they cannot compare these to alternative possibilities as we do for the African continent. Finally, ref. 60 applies a geospatial model in 28 countries with a less granular resolution within country and abstracting from water costs and transportation options to port (pipeline vs trucking), which are included in this paper. Hence, whereas the key contribution of this paper is the inclusion and comparison of different financing and policy scenarios and the explicit calculation of the cost differentials for the entire African continent, we also apply a state-of-the-art bottom-up model, which can serve to improve within-country cost comparisons.

Country-specific figures are used for energy prices, heat prices and interest rates. Level-four H3 hexagons61 are used to define the spatial resolution. Land availability is constrained such that H2 production and associated generation are not permitted to be built on wetland, built-up areas, water bodies or within 250 m of coastlines or protected areas. PV is additionally not permitted to be built on agricultural land. Whereas elevation is not considered as an exclusion criterion here due to data constraints, future work may also wish to exclude high elevations or steep slopes. All maps are based on the authors' own analysis of publicly available input data. Note that this work leverages a model of the Haber–Bosch process in plant optimization in place of the H2 production process available in the standard GeoH2 model14. This variant of the codebase is made available on GitHub (Code Availability).

To account for shipping costs, the sea distance from each of the exporting ports to Rotterdam is first calculated using the ShipTraffic website62. Previous work has estimated the cost of shipping NH3 over a distance of approximately 13,800 km to be €0.39 kgH2−1 (ref. 13). Following ref. 24, shipping cost projections depend approximately linearly on transport distance. Consequently, we scale this estimate linearly to km, resulting in our cost parameter of €0.00003 kgNH3−1 km−1, which we multiplied with each of the obtained distances from the African port to Rotterdam. Implementing this approach yields a shipping cost range of €0.09 kgH2−1 (Morocco)–€0.44 kgH2−1 (Mozambique), in line with other estimates in the literature, according to which shipping could add up to €0.46 kgH2−1 by 203063.

The interest rates for Rotterdam are obtained following the same approach as for all other countries described in Methods and following previous work, heat costs of €0.06 kWh−1 are assumed for converting NH3 to H2 (ref. 13). Note that the cost of this process is subject to some uncertainty because it does not yet exist at scale. Electricity costs are assumed to be €0.1 kWh−1 and are calculated as the combination of the average price of Dutch Power Base futures64 and the price of a guarantee of origin for renewable electricity. At the time of writing, Dutch Power Base futures are available until October 2028, and the average price obtained is €0.097 kWh−1. Ideally, we would base our calculation on a Dutch Power Base future that matches our modelling period of 20 years. As this is not available, we took the longest available market-based future as input for our simplified model in Rotterdam using constant electricity prices. Moreover, future prices reflect the current interest rate environment; hence, we deem our Rotterdam costing most representative for scenarios 1 and 2, on which all results in the main text are based and suggest some caution when using it for scenarios 3 and 4. On the basis of grey literature65, an average price of a guarantee of origin of €0.055 kWh−1 by 2030 is assumed. Whereas Rotterdam serves as our comparison case, the resulting electricity cost is deemed representative of the European Union as a whole, given that historically, Dutch wholesale electricity prices were strongly correlated with German wholesale electricity prices, and the Dutch wholesale price roughly represents the average wholesale electricity price in Europe66.

Our modelling excludes two cost components: namely, (1) costs associated with upgrading ports to enable large-scale NH3 shipments and (2) costs for last-mile distribution in Europe. Both would require detailed information (that is, on port design and demand locations respectively), which is beyond the scope of this analysis. Furthermore, our model does not account for potential cost reductions in onshore wind, solar PV, electrolysers and battery storage that may occur by the year 2030. Such cost decreases will not only reduce the cost of green H2 projects in Africa but may also influence renewable deployment in Europe and, therefore, European wholesale electricity prices. As such, the net effect on the cost competitiveness of African green H2 exports vs European green H2 production remains inconclusive.

Finally, we calculate the LCOH in Rotterdam to create a European cost benchmark. We use the same assumptions for electricity and heat costs as mentioned above to model LCOH for green H2 produced in Rotterdam using grid electricity due to space constraints for renewable energy. Due to the absence of renewable energy investments, these projects are much less capital intensive, and variations in the COC, therefore, are less important for LCOH. Note that recent auctions by the European Hydrogen Bank have yielded winning projects using grid electricity and/or greenfield renewable energy. Here we consider the former case only, whereas future research could model European least costs more comprehensively by considering all locations in Europe with their respective transport costs to demand centres. We calculate an LCOH for production in Rotterdam for each financing scenario shown in Table 1 and obtain an LCOH of €4.74 kgH2−1 for scenario 1, €4.72 kgH2−1 for scenario 2, €4.69 kgH2−1 for scenario 3 and €4.67 kgH2−1 for scenario 4 (Supplementary Table 2). Because large green H2 production plants do not currently exist, cost estimates are not commonly available, but several reports have tried to estimate costs. These are broadly in line with our costs; for example, Aurora Energy Research estimates the least-cost LCOH in Germany by 2030 between €3.9 and €5 kgH2−1 (ref. 67). Other research reports even lower 2030 costs for Germany of US$3.1 kgH2−1 in a baseline scenario and US$2.7 kgH2−1 in an optimistic scenario68, which is roughly the range where the IEA Global Hydrogen Review places North-Western European green H2 costs by 2020 (€3.1 kgH2−1) (ref. 1). Other European locations, such as Spain, with more favourable renewable energy sources and similarly favourable financing costs, may reach even lower costs by 2030 at €2.7 kgH2−1 as estimated by the Hydrogen Council and McKinsey69. These costs have been confirmed by the results of the recent European Hydrogen Bank auction yielding a lowest bid in Spain at €2.8 kgH2−1. For the four other countries where least costs were disclosed, they ranged from €4.6 kgH2−1 in Norway to €7.6 kgH2−1 in the Netherlands (Supplementary Table 6). Note that we prefer comparing our results to realized costs as comparisons across studies with different methodological approaches, spatial resolutions, geographical and technological scopes and policy cases considered are difficult (Supplementary Table 7). A thorough comparison of different studies on the subject would require a separate review article with a methodological approach to render comparisons meaningful.

Metrics details

Existing research links standard bicycle lanes with increased levels of bicyclist commuting. Here we question how newer facility types fare relative to standard bicycle lanes. Using 6 years of longitudinal data across 14,011 block groups in 28 US cities, we find that block groups that installed protected bicycle lanes experienced bicycle commuter increases 1.8 times larger than standard bicycle lane block groups, 1.6 times larger than shared-lane marking block groups and 4.3 times larger than block groups that did not install bicycle facilities. Focusing on mileage, protected bicycle lane mileage installed was significantly associated with bicycle commuter increases 52.5% stronger than standard bicycle lane mileage and 281.2% stronger than shared-lane marking mileage. The results suggest that lower-stress bicycle facilities—such as protected bicycle lanes—are significantly associated with larger increases in ridership at the block-group level compared with higher-stress facilities such as standard bicycle lanes and shared-lane markings.

‘Build it, and they will come' has long been repeated by cities seeking to promote sustainable mobility and increase bicycle ridership via the installation of bicycle infrastructure. Early cross-sectional research into this topic by Nelson and Allen found a significant association between additional miles of bicycle pathways per capita and increased bicycle commute mode share across 18 US municipalities, including several small college towns1. Dill and Carr assessed a more uniform set of 43 large US cities and found bicycle commute mode share to be positively and significantly associated with the presence of bicycle lanes2. Additional research has confirmed the positive relationship between bicycle lanes and bicycle ridership, especially for facilities that are part of a connected bicycle network3,4,5.

The above research establishes a link between standard bicycle lanes (SBLs) and bicycle commuters, but there is an immediate need to expand beyond SBLs to account for increasingly popular bicycle facility types such as protected bicycle lanes (PBLs), buffered bicycle lanes (BBLs) and shared-lane markings (more commonly referred to as sharrows; SHRs)6,7. While surveys have shown that potential riders' stated preferences are for lower-stress bicycle facilities such as PBLs8,9, few studies have explored whether that preference translates to ridership. Existing research exploring ridership relative to newer bicycle facility types has consisted of limited geographic range (typically a single corridor or single city) and/or has examined individual bicycle facility types as opposed to a holistic study that compares all bicycle facility types10,11,12,13.

Moreover, the cross-sectional nature of the above papers introduces another research question: are bicycle facilities causing the high levels of bicycle commuting observed, or are bicycle facilities being installed in areas with high preexisting levels of bicycle commuting? Cross-sectional studies make it difficult to substantiate causality14, so a longitudinal study comparing changes in bicycle facilities over time with changes in ridership over time may provide insight into the above research question.

With this Article, we present a holistic examination of the relationship between different on-road bicycle facility types and bicycle commute ridership. More specifically, we collected 6 years of longitudinal bicycle facility installation data across 14,011 block groups in 28 US cities. For each facility type, we then explored bicycle commuting changes while controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) and built environment factors via three complementary analyses.

The first two analyses—analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and difference-in-difference (DID)—designated block groups based on the lowest-stress bicycle facility installed in each block group between 2014 and 2019 (block groups could also be designated as ‘None' if there were no bicycle facilities installed during the period). The ANCOVA explored changes in the number of bicycle commuters, whereas the DID explored changes in bicycle commute mode share. The third analysis—a multivariate regression—explored changes in the number of bicycle commuters while simultaneously accounting for the length of every bicycle facility type installed in each block group between 2014 and 2019. From lowest stress to highest stress, the bicycle facility types studied were PBLs, BBLs, SBL and SHRs.

The results from the first analysis—using ANCOVA at the block group level of geography—suggest that, after controlling for SES and built environment characteristics, block groups that installed PBLs experienced the largest increases in the number of bicycle commuters (Table 1). More specifically, block groups that installed PBLs, which we designated as PBL block groups, saw increases in the number of bicycle commuters that were 1.9, 1.8, 1.6 and 4.3 times larger than block groups whose lowest-stress bicycle facility installed was a BBL (BBL block groups), SBL (SBL block groups), SHR (SHR block groups) or ‘None' (that is, block groups that installed no bicycle facilities), respectively. Block groups of all bicycle facility types had significantly larger increases in bicycle commuting than block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed. There were, however, no significant differences between the BBL, SBL and SHR block groups.

For the second analysis, we tested the same block group data using a DID approach, comparing changes in bicycle commute mode share in each facility type's block groups with changes in block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed. This time, the BBL block groups experienced the largest increase in bicycle commute mode share (Fig. 1). Although PBLs were installed in block groups with the highest extant levels of bicycle commuting, the PBL block groups still experienced the second largest increase in bicycle commute mode share in the after period. Interestingly, the initial bicycle commute mode shares in the SBL block groups were similar to the BBL block groups, yet bicycle commute mode share growth was 42.2% stronger in the BBL block group than in the SBL block groups. SHRs also tended to be installed in areas with higher extant levels of bicycle commuting, but the SHR block group bicycle commute mode share increase was 30.4% weaker than the increase experienced in PBL block groups. Block groups for all the bicycle facility types experienced bicycle commuting growth between 60% and 220% stronger than block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed (see all DID P values reaching 95% statistical significance in Fig. 1).

Solid lines are actual changes in bicycle commute mode share; dashed lines are estimated changes had facilities not been installed.

The third analysis—a multivariate regression—also explored longitudinal changes in the number of bicycle commuters by block group but simultaneously accounted for the mileage of all bicycle facility types installed between 2014 and 2019 while controlling for SES and built environment factors. The installation mileage of PBLs and BBLs had especially strong and significant relationships with increases in bicycle commuters at the block group level (Table 2). For an average-sized block group with average characteristics (that is, a commuter population of 687.2 commuters and a land area of 0.57 square miles), each additional mile of PBLs was significantly associated with 11.9 more bicycle commuters per block group and each additional mile of BBLs was associated with 14.0 more bicycle commuters per block group. Installation mileage of SBLs had a significant and positive relationship with bicycle commuters but was only 35–44% as strong as PBLs or BBLs. In other words, each additional mile of SBLs was associated with 6.9 more bicycle commuters per block group. The installation mileage of SHRs did not have a significant relationship with changes in ridership.

Results suggest that (1) cities that wish to encourage more biking activity seem justified in installing bicycle facilities toward that end, and (2) lower-stress bicycle facilities—such as PBLs and BBLs—tend to be significantly associated with larger increases in ridership at the block group level than higher-stress bicycle facilities such as SBLs and SHRs. While SHRs correlated with increased bicycle commuting relative to no new bicycling infrastructure in the initial ANCOVA analysis, the shift became weaker once accounting for extant levels of bicycle commuting in the second DID analysis, and then insignificant once other bicycle facilities were accounted for in the third multivariate analysis.

The results can be interpreted as a general validation of stress-based planning tools such as bicycle level of traffic stress15. Agencies have widely adopted bicycle level of traffic stress to assess their bicycle networks, frequently endeavoring to provide connected bicycle networks with the lowest possible stress level. This Article's findings support this approach; cities that seek to boost bicycle commute mode shifts should focus on implementing low-stress bicycle facilities if they want to best facilitate the sizable population of less-confident potential riders16. Although higher bicycle mode share is not necessarily an end in itself, it could help cities to lower fuel consumption, emissions and transportation costs while providing more mobility options to a greater percentage of the population along with better health outcomes and better safety for bicyclists and nonbicyclist road users alike17,18.

Future research might examine various PBL characteristics in further depth such as the amount of separation, type of protection, and vehicle volume or speed of the adjoining roadway to examine their impacts on bicycle ridership. For example, do PBLs on large roadways with high vehicle volumes and speeds have less impact on potential ridership? Future research might also account for each facility's place in the wider bicycle network to understand whether isolated lower-stress bicycle facilities are as impactful as connected lower-stress bicycle facilities. Furthermore, as different ages or genders may be more or less sensitive to different types of bicycle infrastructure, future work might explore how facility types are correlated with age or gendered ridership. Future research might also explore how quickly different bicycle facility types encourage additional ridership and for how long that additional ridership may last.

As cities' commitments to promoting sustainable transportation through biking continue to evolve with more mature bicycle facilities and expanding bicycle networks, results of this study suggest more nuance to the old mantra ‘Build it, and they will come' by unveiling a link between lower-stress bicycle facilities and larger increases in bicycle commuting.

We first identified high-bicycling cities with more than double the national average of bicycle commute mode share using 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. Next, each high-bicycling city needed a logical paired comparison city that had substantially lower levels of bicycle commute mode share but similar population, geographic location, climate and function. Our final city selection resulted in 14 high-bicycling cities and 14 paired comparison cities. To match the smallest ACS commute mode share geography, we conducted this study at the block group level.

Our dependent variables were related to bicycle commuting and obtained from the ACS. The ACS asks respondents how they usually traveled to work during the previous week. The ACS does not provide an option to record linked trips. The respondent is instead asked to select the one mode that was used for most of their commuting distance. Bike-to-work commuting has proven to be a strong proxy for overall levels of bicycling activity (Spearman ρ of 0.53) and especially strong for large central metro areas and medium metro areas such as those explored in this Article (Spearman ρ of 0.58 and 0.57, respectively)19.

For the first and second analyses—ANCOVA and DID—each block group was designated as its lowest-stress bicycle facility type installed between 2014 and 2019 while the multivariate regression analysis simultaneously accounted for the mileage of every bicycle facility type installed between 2014 and 2019 for each block group. We manually derived the installation month of every bicycle facility in our study cities using historic bicycle maps, interviews with city employees, historic satellite images from Google Earth, and historic Google Street Views. If a bicycle facility transitioned to a different facility type at a midblock location (for example, a PBL transitioned to a SBL at a midblock location given road width restrictions), we specifically accounted for the location and length of each distinct facility type. As SHRs consist of individual pavement markings without any longitudinal markings, we designated any road segment that had SHRs at consistent spacing along the segment as having that facility type. If the SHRs ended at a midblock location, we ended the facility type at that location.

We obtained a variety of SES covariates from 2016 5-year ACS estimates and built environment covariates from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Smart Location Database (SLD) representative of conditions in 2017 and 2018. After removing variables that introduced multicollinearity based on a Pearson's correlation analysis, our final covariates were the number of commuters (from the ACS), proportion of population with a bachelor's degree (from the ACS), population density (from the SLD) and road density (from the SLD).

We first ran an ANCOVA test to understand whether block groups that installed different types of bicycle facility experienced distinct changes in bicycle commuting. Because past research identified that potential riders are more willing to try lower-stress bicycle facilities, we designated each block group as the lowest-stress facility that was installed in the block group between 2014 and 2019, regardless of whether or what type of bicycle facility was present on the roadway previously8. The dependent variable was the change in the number of bicycle commuters between 2013/2014 and 2018/2019 (two years were averaged because of relatively high variability in bicycle commuting numbers), and we controlled for all the covariates detailed above.

The second DID analyses on the block group level allowed us to understand whether increases in bicycle commuting were following extant trends or whether the changes in bicycle commuting were statistically associated with the installation of different bicycle facility types. For each bicycle facility type, we first derived a bicycle facility type dummy variable where each block group's lowest-stress bicycle facility type installed between 2014 and 2019 was designated as 1 and block groups with no bicycle facilities installed between 2014 and 2019 were designated as 0. We also created a time dummy variable where the before period (2010/2011 to 2013/2014) was designated as 0 and the after period (2013/2014 to 2018/2019) was designated as 1. We derived a DID interaction variable by multiplying the treatment and time dummy variables. The dependent variable was the change in bicycle commute mode share between 2014 and 2019 as a continuous variable. We derived linear regressions using the lm command in R to compare the change in bicycle commute mode share between 2014 and 2019 for the block groups of each bicycle facility type relative to block groups that had no bicycle facilities installed.

We then conducted a multivariate linear regression for the third analysis using R's lm command to understand the relationship between the mileage of bicycle facilities installed between 2014 and 2019 (the independent variable) and changes in the number of bicycle commuters (the dependent variable, which was normally distributed), controlling for the covariates identified above. We converted the independent variables and covariates to z scores so the coefficients could be directly compared.

Black Death Plague That Killed Millions Became Less Fatal because of This Genetic Tweak

Reducing the copies of one gene in the bubonic plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, made it less deadly but potentially more transmissible

A small genetic change makes the bacterium that caused the plague less fatal but possibly more transmissible, allowing for greater disease spread in smaller populations, a study in Science reports.

The bacterium Yersinia pestis caused the Black Death — killing up to 50 million people in the mid-fourteenth century — as well as an earlier plague across the Mediterranean in the sixth century ad . The bacteria still circulate in low levels in parts of the United States, Africa and Asia, and are typically transmitted to humans by infected fleas carried by rats or other rodents.

Previous research found that some strains of Y. pestis had reduced amounts of pla, a gene associated with disease severity, but it was unclear why, says Ravneet Sidhu, a palaeogeneticist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and a co-author of the latest work. “Our findings in this study characterize a case in which a pandemic-causing pathogen has independently evolved to cause what we believe is a slightly weaker form of the disease,” she says.

To understand the impact of the genetic change, the team infected mice with modern strains of Y. pestis that had normal levels of pla , had reduced levels of the gene or were unable to express it at all. When the bacteria were injected beneath the skin to mimic the form of plague that affects lymph nodes, mice infected with the reduced- pla strain lived for almost two days longer than did those infected with the normal strain. Mortality also decreased from 100% with the normal strain to 85% with the reduced- pla strain. However, when the team infected mice intravenously or through the nose to mimic blood- or lung-based infections, the pla -reduced strain was as fatal as the normal strain.

The team also looked at the genomes of ancient and modern strains of Y. pestis to find out how prevalent pla depletion was. Between 30% and 50% of ancient strains obtained from previously published studies showed signs of depletion, as did three modern strains, isolated from a human and two rats in 1994. Wanting to understand why pla was depleted, the researchers analysed the genetic data from these ancient and modern strains. They found that the reduction was caused by deletion of a 2,100-base-pair-long region of DNA containing the pla gene in one region of the genome, and the integration of a DNA molecule called a plasmid carrying the gene into other regions.

Sidhu says the team hypothesized that pla depletion occurred because repeated outbreaks of the plague decreased the density of rodent populations. Increasing the time for which rats were infectious would have given them more time to travel between fragmented populations, increasing the chance of them spreading the disease, she adds.

The findings show how small genetic changes can have significant effects on pathogen transmission, says Francesca Short, a microbiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “This isn't even a deletion of a gene,” she adds. It is a dosage change that has emerged multiple times in history, and the authors have plausibly linked that change to reduced virulence and potentially increased transmission, Short says.

Sidhu is hesitant to extrapolate the findings on Y. pestis to other pandemic-causing pathogens, such as the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, because it is likely that the genetic change was favourable only at the end of outbreaks, when the more fatal strain was unable to survive. “In reality, to understand how other diseases behave, we require specific research into those diseases from multiple fields, including theoretical and experimental evolution,” Sidhu adds.

AI Found a ‘Magic Potion' That Can Bring Dead Batteries Back to Life

Electric vehicles leave behind mountains of dead lithium-ion batteries. A new “injection” brings them back to life

A team of researchers in China has found a way to bring dead lithium-ion batteries back to life, potentially reducing both the amount of waste that's quickly piling up from spent electric vehicle (EV) batteries and the need to produce as many new ones.

“The team's work is revolutionary because it provides a new idea to reuse end-of-life batteries,” says Jiangong Zhu of Tongji University in Shanghai, who researches battery use in EVs and was not involved in the new study, which was published recently in Nature.

The amount of spent lithium-ion batteries that need disposal is expected to soar from an estimate of 900,000 metric tons this year to 20.5 million metric tons by 2040, according to a report released by the United Nations Development Program last September. As the world's leader in deploying EVs, China is already handling 2.8 million metric tons of retired cells ever year, according to Huang Jianzhong, chairman of China Electronic Energy Saving Technology Association, a government-approved trade body.

With consumer markets and waste piles both growing rapidly, Yue Gao, a chemist at Fudan University in Shanghai, and his colleagues anticipated a rising demand for longer-life lithium-ion batteries.

An EV battery usually reaches the end of its lifetime, or when its capacity drops below 80 percent of its original level, after about eight to 10 years. The battery accounts for around 40 percent of the cost of the entire vehicle.

Gao and his colleagues wanted to find a molecule that could replenish a dead cell by infusing it with lithium ions. But “we had no idea what kinds of molecules could do that job or what their chemical structures would be, so we used machine learning to help us,” says Chihao Zhao, a Ph.D. student at Fudan University, who is a member of Gao's team but was not a co-author of the new study.

Lithium ions were restored to a spent battery pack by injecting an electrolyte solution.

The researchers used an artificial intelligence model trained on the rules of chemistry. They fed it a database of electrochemical reactions and had it look for molecules that would meet their requirements, such as dissolving well in an electrolyte solution and being relatively cheap to produce. The model recommended three candidates, and the team identified one of them, a salt called lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3), as ideal.

The researchers tested this lithium-ion salt by dissolving it in an electrolyte solution, which allows ions to pass between a cell's positive and negative terminals. Gao likens this to giving a human patient an IV. “If we can give an injection to a sick person to help them recover,” he says, “why can't we have a magic potion for drained batteries, too?”

Gao and his colleagues found that the chemical mixture could significantly prolong the lifespan of a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cell. An LFP battery that powers an EV can typically be charged and then discharged about 2,000 times before it is considered “dead” (when its capacity is below the 80 percent mark). By adding the electrolyte whenever the battery neared that threshold, the team was able to restore most of the cell's capacity each time—and it carried on working almost as well as a new battery. By the end of the experiment, the cell regained 96 percent capacity after nearly 12,000 charge-discharge cycles.

A follow-up experiment showed the method also worked on NMC (nickel, manganese and cobalt) lithium-ion batteries, Gao says.

Fudan University is currently working with China-based battery-material maker Zhejiang Yongtai New Material to commercialize the method, according to a social media post published by Yongtai. Gao envisions a widespread system of “battery-boosting stations” where EV owners will be able to bring dead power sources to be rejuvenated.

The idea is “promising,” says Chenguang Liu of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in China, who researches battery materials and was not involved in the study. But he cites a few challenges. For example, the method will need to be made compatible with various battery chemistries—and the safety of the revived cells must be tested.

And EV power comes not from a single, simple cell but from a battery pack that can comprise hundreds or even thousands of cells, along with heat-control systems and other components. “We have only conducted experiments on cells, and we need to find a way to apply it onto a whole battery pack,” Gao says.

His team's method is the closest thing yet to a “direct-recycling process” for EV batteries in China today, says Hans Eric Melin, an analyst of battery reuse and recycling and managing director of Circular Energy Storage, a London-based consultancy. (In China, some degraded EV batteries are currently used to power other products that require lower energy outputs, such as electric mopeds and energy storage stations. Others are crushed and shredded into industrial waste called “black mass,” from which valuable raw materials, such as lithium and graphite, can be harvested.)

Melin believes there could be commercial opportunities for the researchers' proposal—though he says the market is likely to be small because the lifespan of an EV battery can be as long as 15 years. It will also require battery packs that are designed in a way to allow for injections of the electrolyte, he notes.

“The question,” he adds, “is whether the benefits are worth it if [the required changes] in some way interfere with other design aspects necessary for the battery's performance.”

Ends of the Earth: Journeys to the Polar Regions in Search of Life, the Cosmos, and Our Future Neil Shubin Dutton (2025)

On his first fossil-hunting expedition to the Arctic regions of Greenland in 1988, evolutionary biologist and science writer Neil Shubin felt utterly disoriented. It was daylight around the clock, with the sun sweeping a great ellipse across the sky. Life's rhythm was determined not by light, but by sound; glacially fed rivers roared at midday but, by 3 a.m., had faded to quiet trickles.

As the Arctic and Antarctica grow warmer, the fragile window available to us for understanding these icy outposts and the planetary processes they control is rapidly closing, writes Shubin in Ends of the Earth, an ambitious and far-reaching introduction to the polar regions. He explores polar science through the work of leading researchers and examines broader issues, such as how melting ice is beginning to expose microorganisms previously unknown to science.

Climate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice

Climate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice

He weaves his own story, and those of his collaborators, into a broader narrative that touches on geopolitical issues and the lives of pioneering explorers. The book is packed with information, such as the fact that the polar ice caps have existed for only about 10% of Earth's history. The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, and the species' migration out of Africa, occurred at a moment when Earth's physical geography — its coastlines, islands and ocean levels — was defined by “the amount of water locked in polar ice”, Shubin writes.

And that is the book's key insight. The polar regions drive global climate, environmental dynamics and even human evolution — and have done so for millions of years. This helps to explain why the poles are so crucial to policy debates about climate change. The permafrost holds 1,500 billion tonnes of carbon — about twice the amount in the atmosphere.

A second point highlighted by the author is the unique value of the polar regions for scientific discovery, owing to their extreme and unusual physical conditions. For example, Antarctica's dry, stable air and vast ice sheets make it one of the best places on Earth to collect interstellar dust, which settles and is preserved in the snow.

The layered structure of polar ice acts as a natural archive of Earth's climate history, allowing scientists to reconstruct past temperatures. And the polar regions host extraordinary forms of life. Ecosystems in Antarctic subglacial lakes — buried some 3 kilometres beneath the ice — might have evolved in complete isolation for millions of years, and some microbes in the pitch-dark conditions can metabolize minerals to survive. Research into these habitats can offer rare insights into life in extreme environments, Shubin writes.

However, by focusing so much on ice sheets, the author unintentionally reinforces the idea that the polar regions are defined by glacial ice. This might apply to Antarctica, a whole continent covered by ice, but is not true of the Arctic, whose landscapes include tundra and, by most reckonings, forests. Much of that region remained unglaciated even in the last ice age.

Shubin notes how a definition of the Arctic is elusive. It has been framed over the centuries by various markers, including the northern tree line, the Arctic Circle and political or cultural boundaries. Yet, in the book, the Arctic is widely portrayed mainly as Greenland and the heavily glaciated high Arctic archipelagos — regions that most resemble Antarctica.

Metrics details

Higher habitual intakes of dietary flavonoids have been linked with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic disease. Yet, the contribution of diversity of flavonoid intake to health outcomes remains to be investigated. Here, using a cohort of 124,805 UK Biobank participants, we show that participants who consumed the widest diversity of dietary flavonoids, flavonoid-rich foods and/or specific flavonoid subclasses had a 6–20% significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we report that both quantity and diversity of flavonoids are independent predictors of mortality and several chronic diseases, suggesting that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity is better for longer-term health than either component alone. These findings suggest that consuming several different daily servings of flavonoid-rich foods or beverages, such as tea, berries, apples, oranges or grapes, may lower risk of all-cause mortality and chronic disease.

Flavonoids are (poly)phenolic compounds that occur abundantly in the human diet1. Sources are quite diverse, ranging from fruits and vegetables to nuts and legumes, as well as wines and teas2. A wide range of flavonoids are found in foods and beverages, and these can be classified into several subclasses including flavonols, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavanones and flavones1. Following their consumption and absorption, flavonoids—through their downstream metabolites—have the potential to improve human health1. Since the early 1990s3, numerous prospective cohort studies have observed that a higher habitual consumption of several flavonoid subclasses is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality4,5,6, cardiovascular disease (CVD)2,7, type 2 diabetes (T2DM)8,9, cancer10, respiratory disease11 and neurodegenerative disease12,13. Due to variations in their chemical structure, bioavailability and metabolism, different flavonoid compounds exert a range of biological effects14. Among these, some of their most widely recognized activities include anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects, which are fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of many chronic diseases15. Additionally, flavonoids exhibit more specific protective functions, including promoting endothelial integrity and function16, crucial for cardiovascular health, and anti-senescence effects17 that may delay age-related tissue deterioration, in addition to antiproliferative activities18 that contribute to cancer prevention. These represent just some examples of the many mechanisms through which flavonoids exert their beneficial effects across diverse chronic conditions1,15.

Because different flavonoid compounds can exert different biological benefits, we hypothesized that consuming a higher diversity of dietary flavonoids may afford better health protection than consuming a low diversity of flavonoids. However, to date, no prospective studies have considered the impact of consuming a higher diversity of dietary flavonoids on the risk of all-cause mortality or major chronic disease. In several research fields, including in the assessment of gut microbial diversity19,20,21, the diversity of a system can be calculated using Shannon's equation for entropy22 converted to Hill's effective numbers23,24. Using this approach, we can determine the diversity of flavonoid intake, accounting for both the variation (or number of different flavonoids consumed) and their distribution of intake (wherein those flavonoids consumed in smaller amounts relative to others are weighted less). The aims of this study, therefore, were: (1) to estimate diversity of flavonoid intake across levels of total dietary flavonoids, individual flavonoid subclasses and flavonoid-rich foods, and then examine their associations with the risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of chronic disease including CVD, T2DM, total cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease; and (2) to assess the potential benefits of consuming both a higher quantity and a wider diversity of flavonoid intake on the risk of these outcomes in participants from the UK Biobank.

In this cohort of 124,805 UK adults, aged ≥40 yr (median [Q1–Q3], 60.2 [53.0–65.2] yr; Q, quintile), ~56% (n = 69,674) were female and most were non-smokers (>90%; n = 115,961) (Table 1). Around 60% (n = 75,111) of participants were either overweight or obese (Table 1). At baseline, ~4% (n = 5,162) had diabetes (type 1 or 2), ~25% (n = 32,877) were hypertensive and ~15% (n = 19,827) had high cholesterol. Over a range of 8.7–10.6 median years of follow-up for the different outcomes (maximum, 11.8 yr), there were 5,780 deaths, 6,920 CVD cases, 3,421 T2DM cases, 9,441 cancer cases, 12,945 respiratory disease cases and 1,921 cases of neurodegenerative disease. Participants had a median flavonoid intake of 792 mg d−1 (range, 0.05–3,611 mg d−1), which was comprised of a wide diversity of an effective (Hill) number of 9.4 flavonoid types per day (range, 1.8–19.0) (Fig. 1). Flavan-3-ols were the main subclass contributing to total flavonoid intake, accounting for 87% of consumption. Anthocyanins, flavonols and flavanones each contributed ~4.5% of total flavonoid intake; <1% was from flavones. Tea (black and green) was the main source of total flavonoid intake (67%), followed by apples (5.8%), red wine (4.7%), grapes (1.9%), berries (1.9%), dark chocolate (1.2%), oranges and satsumas (1.1%) and orange juice (1.1%), which collectively comprised ~85% of total intake; numerous other food sources contributed to the remaining intake (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Overall, those with a higher quantity of flavonoid intake tended to have a lower diversity (r = −0.44), although this varied for individual subclasses (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Compared to participants with the lowest diversity, those with the highest diversity had a better distribution of flavonoid intake, consuming more anthocyanins (for example, malvidin, cyanidin), flavanones (for example, hesperidin, naringenin) and proanthocyanidins (for example, dimers to polymers) relative to thearubigin, a compound derived exclusively from tea, and which dominated intake in those with the least diverse consumption (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). Analysis of flavonoid-rich foods showed those with the lowest diversity consumed mostly tea, and those with the highest diversity consumed relatively more berries, apples, grapes, red wine and oranges (Supplementary Table 4). Those with the highest flavonoid diversity were more likely to be female, older, have a lower body mass index (BMI), be more physically active and have a higher education and were less likely to be current smokers (Table 1).

The dotted areas represent each diet, where each circle is an individual flavonoid and each colour is a different flavonoid (corresponding to the colours and distribution on the bar charts). Data from participants with ≥2 Oxford WebQ dietary questionnaires (n = 124,805).

Following mutual adjustment, and after accounting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, dietary and medical risk factors, both the quantity and diversity of total dietary flavonoid intake were independently associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and several chronic diseases (model 5; Fig. 2). Holding the quantity of flavonoid intake constant, participants with the highest (compared to lowest) diversity (Q5 versus Q1), characterized as consuming an additional 6.7 effective flavonoid types per day, had a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)), 0.86 (0.78, 0.95)), a 10% lower risk of CVD (0.90 (0.82, 0.98)), a 20% lower risk of T2DM (0.80 (0.70, 0.91)), an 8% lower risk of total cancer (0.92 (0.85, 0.99)) and an 8% lower risk of respiratory disease (0.92 (0.86, 0.98)); no association was observed for neurodegenerative disease (model 5; Table 2 and Fig. 2). For quantity of flavonoid intake, when holding diversity constant, participants in the second quintile (median intake, ~500 mg d−1), were at a 16% (0.84 (0.78, 0.92)), 9% (0.91 (0.84, 0.98)), 12% (0.88 (0.79, 0.98)) and 13% (0.87 (0.83, 0.92)) lower risk of all-cause mortality, CVD, T2DM and respiratory disease, respectively, compared with those in Q1 (median intake, ~230 mg d−1 (model 5; Table 2)). At higher levels of exposure, these HRs remained relatively constant, except for T2DM, for which the lowest risks were observed for those in Q5 (0.75 (0.66, 0.84)). The lowest risks for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases were seen in Q5 (median intake, ~1,400 mg d−1), reaching an 8% (0.92 (0.85, 0.99)) and 20% (0.80 (0.68, 0.94)) lower disease risk, respectively, compared with Q1 (model 5; Table 2 and Fig. 2). In general, progressive adjustment for participant demographics (model 2), lifestyle (model 3), dietary (model 4) and medical risk factors (model 5) attenuated, but did not materially alter, the associations (Table 2). We then tested for interactions between quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake (across the aforementioned outcomes), and although no interactions were observed (Pinteraction all >0.05 (model 5)), the independent prediction of both quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake with all-cause mortality and several chronic diseases still suggests that higher intakes of both is associated with greater disease risk reduction compared with higher intakes of either aspect alone.

HRs (95% CI) for all-cause mortality and major chronic disease according to the quantity and diversity of dietary flavonoid intake (in quintiles). HRs are from Cox proportional-hazards models using age as the underlying timescale. Quantity of flavonoid intake is mutually adjusted for diversity of flavonoid intake and vice versa. Further adjustments are made for covariates in model 5 including sex, region of residence, number of dietary assessments, BMI, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, education, ethnicity, socioeconomic status plus intakes of red and processed meat, refined grains, whole grains, sugary drinks, coffee, saturated fatty acids, sodium and dietary energy, and history of diabetes (type 1 or 2; not adjusted in T2DM analysis), hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia and for analysis of all-cause mortality, further adjustments were made for prevalent CVD, cancer, respiratory disease, and neurodegenerative disease at baseline. Corresponding sample sizes, event rates and additional details are provided in Table 2.

Minimally (model 1) and multivariable adjusted models (models 2–5) for diversity of individual flavonoid subclasses and the risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic disease are presented in Supplementary Table 5. Overall, following adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors (model 3), further adjustments for diet (model 4) and medical history (model 5) did not substantially alter the findings. In the fully adjusted model (model 5), the wider diversities of intake of compounds within the flavan-3-ol and flavanone subclasses were each associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, independent of absolute intake; the HR remained stable after both Q4 and Q2 respectively (HR (95% CI) for flavan-3-ols Q4 versus Q1, 0.91 (0.83, 0.99); flavanones Q2 versus Q1, 0.90 (0.83, 0.98); model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). When the corresponding model terms for quantity of consumption were examined, only flavan-3-ol intake was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality; the HRs were relatively stable beyond Q2 (Q2 versus Q1, 0.85 (0.78, 0.93); Supplementary Table 6). The data for chronic disease outcomes reveal that, compared with lower intakes (Q1), significant associations mostly emerged in those with the widest diversity at and above Q4; for flavan-3-ols there was a 13% (Q5, 0.87 (0.77, 0.98)) and an 8% (Q4, 0.92 (0.86, 0.99)) lower risk of T2DM and cancer; for flavanone there was a 7% (Q5, 0.93 (0.88, 0.99)) and a 6% (Q5, 0.93 (0.87, 0.99)) lower risk of cancer and respiratory disease; and for flavones there was a 13% (Q4, 0.89 (0.80, 0.99)) and an 18% (Q5, 0.82 (0.71, 0.95)) lower risk of T2DM and neurodegenerative disease, respectively (model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). When we examined the models for the subclasses showing beneficial associations for diversity, associations for quantity of intake emerged with T2DM wherein participants at and above Q3 for flavones and Q4 for flavan-3-ols were at a lower risk (flavones Q3, 0.89 (0.80, 0.99); flavan-3-ols Q4, 0.85 (0.77, 0.95); model 5; Supplementary Table 6). No interactions were observed between quantity and diversity of intake of any subclass with any outcome (Pinteraction all >0.05 (model 5)).

Minimally (model 1) and multivariable adjusted models (models 2–5) for diversity of flavonoid-rich foods are presented in Supplementary Table 5. Adjustment beyond demographic and lifestyle factors (model 3) for participant diet (model 4) and medical history (model 5) did not appreciably affect the associations. In the fully adjusted model, when holding the quantity of intake constant, the risk of all-cause mortality was progressively lower among those with a higher diversity of flavonoid-rich food intake; compared with an effective serving of 1.3, those with 2, 2.7, 3.4 and 4.5 different effective servings were associated with an 8% (0.92 (0.85, 1.00)), 10% (0.91 (0.84, 0.99)), 13% (0.88 (0.81, 0.96)) and 16% (0.84 (0.76, 0.91)) lower risk of all-cause mortality, respectively (model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). Holding the diversity of intake constant, there was no clear association for consuming a higher quantity of flavonoid-rich foods (model 5; Supplementary Table 6). Examination of chronic disease outcomes revealed that those with the highest (versus lowest) diversity of flavonoid-rich food intake had an 8% lower risk of respiratory disease (0.92 (0.87, 0.98)); there were no compelling associations with other endpoints (model 5; Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5). Holding diversity constant, a higher quantity of flavonoid-rich foods, beyond Q2 (Q2, 0.87 (0.78, 0.97)), associated with a lower risk of T2DM; there were no compelling associations with other endpoints (model 5; Supplementary Table 6). No interactions (Pinteraction all >0.05 (Model 5)) were observed between quantity and diversity of flavonoid-rich food consumption.

Neither removing energy intake nor adjusting for a healthy plant-based diet score substantively altered the HR (sensitivity analyses 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables 5 and 7). Excluding participants who had an event in the first two years of follow-up tended to marginally strengthen the relationships between our exposures and outcomes (sensitivity analysis 3; Supplementary Tables 5 and 7).

In >120,000 UK Biobank participants, we observed that participants who consumed the widest diversity of dietary flavonoids, flavonoid-rich foods and/or specific flavonoid subclasses had a lower risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of cause-specific chronic disease, ranging from cardiometabolic disorders (including CVD and T2DM) to other major conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease. We also found that both the quantity and diversity of total dietary flavonoids are independent predictors of mortality and several chronic diseases, suggesting that consuming a higher quantity and wider diversity is better for longer-term health than higher intakes of either component alone.

Our findings highlight the importance of consuming a diverse range of flavonoids for the management of chronic disease risk, which, from a public health perspective, provides support for consuming a variety of flavonoid-rich foods such as green and/or black tea, berries, apples, oranges and grapes25. This fits with our current understanding that different flavonoid compounds can exert different biological benefits1,26,27,28. For example, in the regulation of blood pressure alone, compounds from each subclass appear to act on a variety of different mechanisms, increasing nitric oxide bioavailability, reducing endothelial cell oxidative stress and modulating vascular ion channel activity29,30. Indeed, the health-promoting effects of flavonoids are wide ranging, with multiple flavonoid compounds implicated in multiple biological activities, including, among others, inhibiting platelet aggregation, lowering low-density lipoprotein oxidation, mitigating atherosclerotic lesion formation, improving insulin sensitivity indices, inducing antioxidant defences, and reducing inflammatory responses in addition to specific anticarcinogenic actions, such as an ability to induce apoptosis in tumour cells, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and prevent angiogenesis and tumour cell invasion15,28. As a result, the collective actions of multiple flavonoids appear to lead to greater health protection compared with single subclasses or compounds.

We found that consuming both a higher quantity and wider diversity of dietary flavonoids appears better for longer-term health than higher intakes of either component alone. To date, epidemiological research has focused on the quantity of flavonoid intake, finding that higher consumption of several flavonoid subclasses is associated with a lower risk of several chronic diseases2,7,8,9,10,11,12,31,32. Indeed, the first proposed dietary guideline for flavonoids was released in 202233, and recommended consumption of 400–600 mg d−1 of flavan-3-ols for potential cardiometabolic health benefits. Our results suggest that future guidelines could be reframed to also consider recommending intake from a range of sources. Further studies are also ongoing to determine the environmental footprints of different flavonoid-rich foods to ensure their consumption also supports environmental sustainability and planetary health34. Moreover, our findings also align with our other recent work in which we propose a composite measure of flavonoid intake (termed the Flavodiet score) which is a sum of servings of flavonoid-rich foods6. We observed that those who had a better Flavodiet score had a lower risk of all-cause mortality6. Our current study on flavonoid diversity and health outcomes supports the Flavodiet score concept as means to promote higher intakes of flavonoids from different sources. Our analysis of diversity also complements existing analyses that evaluate associations between specific flavonoid food sources and health outcomes, which enhance the evidence base for the health benefits of specific flavonoid-rich foods35,36. However, by studying diversity specifically, our results suggest that consuming a greater variety of such sources appears better than their intakes in isolation.

To estimate flavonoid diversity, we used Shannon's equation with Hill's numbers22,23,24. This provides an approach to explicitly separate out and study the independent benefits of flavonoid diversity, versus quantity, for health outcomes. A fundamental feature of the Shannon equation is that it considers the most diverse diets to consist of all flavonoids consumed in equal proportions. Although this reflects a technical definition of diversity, such an intake is unlikely to occur in the real world and may not be the pattern of consumption that offers the greatest health benefits. Shannon's equation also only permits calculation of diversity among flavonoid consumers (omitting non-consumers), and results should be interpreted within this context (although <0.01% of participants in this cohort did not consume any flavonoids). We must also consider that calculating diversity within individual subclasses does not account for diversity of other subclasses (which appears important) and that calculating diversity by way of major flavonoid-rich foods does not account for other flavonoid sources (which may potentially be major sources for some individuals). While calculating flavonoid diversity by way of total flavonoid compound intake appears to overcome these limitations, this method relies on the precision of compound intake estimates, and these estimates, given the inherent limitations of dietary assessment methods and nutrient composition databases37, are likely to be relatively crude. Nevertheless, even with these constraints, we observed a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality and cause-specific chronic disease among those with the most (compared with the least) diverse flavonoid intakes when using this method. Indeed, beyond flavonoids this method could be further used to estimate and evaluate diversity of other (poly)phenolics, or groups of bioactives, or potentially various food groups. Although there have been recent discussion and some previous use of various diversity indices in nutrition science38,39,40,41, Shannon's equation (with Hill numbers) does not seem to have been used before to partition and study the independent roles of diversity and quantity. Hence, this work introduces a potential approach to study these characteristics of other dietary components in the future.

No previous works appear to have reported on the human health benefits of a flavonoid-diverse diet. Consequently, replication of our findings in other cohorts and clinical trials will be critical, as will the exploration of flavonoid diversity with other disease outcomes. Interpretation, however, requires careful consideration. For the most part, we observed that both quantity and diversity were independent predictors, suggesting there is a benefit to consuming a higher diversity beyond that of simply consuming a high quantity (and vice versa), although this relationship did not interact such that the benefit together was even greater than the combination of the individual parts42. On other occasions we observed quantity but not diversity was a predictor, which could suggest consuming a higher amount of any type provides benefit. Or perhaps a wider diversity of intake within the population under study is required before a role for diversity becomes observable, or that the average compositional make-up of diversity within the population was not relevant to the disease in question. Certainly, the biological relevance of diversity within subclasses may be less important if at least some compounds have similar biological effects. Indeed, those with the lowest diversity could theoretically consume one flavonoid type alone; hypothetically speaking, if this was considered the reference group and compared to those with a wider diversity, then after adjustment for quantity, the comparison compares one against multiple different flavonoid types, holding total quantity constant. If the one flavonoid type was overly protective against the disease in question, then there may be no benefit to consuming a wider diversity if the other flavonoids do not collectively provide a benefit larger than the reference. In other analyses we observed that only flavonoid diversity, but not quantity, predicted the outcomes. This could be due to synergies between different flavonoids, whereas simply consuming higher amounts of less diverse compounds may afford no benefit. We also observed that the quantity and diversity of flavonoid compound intake but not servings of flavonoid-rich foods were significantly associated with more outcomes, suggesting that the absolute intake of flavonoids matters more than the servings of flavonoid-rich foods per se, potentially because different foods have varying flavonoid densities and serving sizes. Moreover, combinations of some foods will probably provide a greater diversity of flavonoids than others—or example, consuming red wine and grapes will probably be less diverse than consuming oranges and grapes because there is less overlap in the flavonoid profiles of the foods.

The strengths of this study include the prospective design, large sample size, high number of cases and long follow-up time of ~10 years. Several limitations, however, should be noted. First, the observational design restricts our ability to infer causality or to exclude the possibility of residual confounding. To this end, we must consider whether the associations observed represent a benefit of higher diversity of flavonoids per se, or a signal that the various flavonoids act synergistically with other compounds found in flavonoid-rich foods, such as phenolic acids, lignans or other bioactives2. Indeed, the possibility of flavonoids being a marker of other unobserved and potential protective factors cannot be discounted. Second, although the Oxford WebQ has been validated against biomarkers and 24-h recalls for selected nutrients43,44, it does not capture data on certain types of flavonoid-rich foods (for example, specific types of berries), which potentially leads to imprecision in the assessment of diversity for certain subclasses (for example, anthocyanins), and as with all self-reported dietary assessments, common limitations and reporting biases apply2,45. Moreover, due to the limited number of dietary assessments, our analyses may have been affected by regression dilution with a probable underestimation of the strengths of associations46; this may be of specific importance when assessing diversity, assuming variation in intake is greater over longer timeframes. Third, incidence of T2DM was ascertained based on hospital and death records, which may not capture all cases, such as those diagnosed and treated in primary care. This may have introduced some degree of error, particularly if hospitalized individuals have different health-seeking behaviours or characteristics than those treated in primary care, highlighting the need for additional studies. Fourth, potential confounders were only assessed at baseline, and it is unclear how potential changes in their trajectories may have impacted upon the observed associations. Fifth, although we conducted extensive analysis showing that the associations of our exposures with the outcomes appear robust, we acknowledge that multiplicity issues should be considered when interpreting the results. Sixth, given our sample is not representative of all populations in terms of age, ethnicity, health status or socioeconomic standing, and so on, the generalizability of our results requires confirmation in other populations.

In conclusion, we found that a wider diversity of intake of total flavonoids, flavonoid-rich foods and/or specific flavonoid subclasses is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and incidence of chronic disease, including CVD, T2DM, cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease. We also observed that a higher quantity and wider diversity of dietary flavonoids, when consumed together, may represent the optimal approach for improving long-term health, compared with increasing either flavonoid quantity or diversity alone. Overall, our findings suggest simple and achievable dietary changes such as including several different daily servings of flavonoid-rich foods or beverages, such as tea, berries, apples, oranges or grapes, might have a major impact on population health, lowering the risk of all-cause mortality and major chronic disease.

For the present investigation, we used data from the UK Biobank—a large, prospective, population-based cohort study47. Between 2006 and 2010, >500,000 male and female adults, aged 40–69 yr, were enrolled47. Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres located across England, Scotland and Wales, where they undertook a comprehensive baseline assessment, completing questionnaires and physical measures, and provided biological samples. The UK Biobank study received ethical approval from the NHS North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (reference 11/NW/0382) and all participants provided informed consent.

For the current analysis, we excluded participants who withdrew their consent during follow-up or who completed fewer than two 24-h dietary questionnaires (by first removing individual recalls without plausible energy intakes: <800 or >4,200 kcal d−1 for men and <500 or >3,500 kcal d−1 for women) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Additionally, for the respective outcomes of interest, we excluded participants with prevalent CVD, T2DM, cancer, respiratory disease or neurodegenerative disease, prior to the last date of dietary assessment (Supplementary Table 8). Lastly, because Shannon's equation requires intake of at least one kind of flavonoid compound, those with zero total flavonoid intake were excluded, and then, depending on the exposure of interest (flavonoid-rich foods or intra-subclass diversity, and so on), participants with zero intake of flavonoid-rich foods or specific subclasses were excluded on a per-analysis basis, because the collective exclusion at the flavonoid-rich food or intra-subclass level would bias diversity of other levels (for example, compounds (Supplementary Fig. 1)).

Dietary information was collected using the Oxford WebQ 24-h dietary questionnaire44, which participants completed on up to five separate occasions, between 2009 and 201248. Flavonoid intake was estimated from the Oxford WebQ 24-h dietary questionnaire using the US Department of Agriculture flavonoid and proanthocyanidin food content databases49,50, with food codes derived from the updated version of the nutrient calculations for the Oxford WebQ for food items and composite recipes13,51. Flavonoid intakes (mg d−1) from all completed questionnaires with plausible energy intakes were averaged. We derived intakes of several flavonoids subclasses as follows: flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin and isorhamnetin), anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, petunidin and peonidin), flavan-3-ols ((+)-catechin, (+)-gallocatechin, (−)-epicatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin, (−)-epicatechin 3-gallate and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, plus dimers, trimers, 4–6-mers, 7–10-mers and polymers, plus theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3′-gallate, theaflavin-3,3′-digallate and thearubigins), flavanones (eriodictyol, hesperetin and naringenin) and flavones (luteolin and apigenin). Total flavonoid intake was calculated as the sum of all compounds. Intakes of isoflavones were not calculated due to the low consumption of isoflavone-containing foods in the general UK population52.

Diversity of flavonoid intake was calculated using Shannon's equation for entropy22 which was subsequently converted to Hill's effective numbers23,24. Calculations of diversity were made for total flavonoid intake, which considered diversity of all 31 flavonoids as described above. In an exploratory analysis we examined (1) intra-subclass diversity, which considered diversity of intake within individual subclasses, and (2) servings of flavonoid-rich foods, which included the key contributors to each flavonoid subclass, including tea (black and green), red wine, apples, berries, grapes, oranges (including satsumas), grapefruit, sweet peppers, onions and dark chocolate. The key contributors were determined as the three foods that contributed the highest percentage to the intakes of each flavonoid subclass (excluding fruit juices), and dark chocolate was included as it is typically high in flavan-3-ols13. Shannon's equation is as follows:

In Shannon's equation, pi is calculated as the proportion of individual flavonoids consumed per day (that is, the quantity of compounds (mg d−1) or flavonoid-rich foods (servings per day)) relative to total intake (that is, the total quantity of flavonoids (mg d−1) or flavonoid-rich foods (servings per day)) and s is the total number of individual flavonoid types (that is, compounds or flavonoid-rich foods) consumed. Diversity of flavonoid intake was calculated using the R package Vegan53. Conversion of Shannon's score into Hill's effective numbers was undertaken by exponentiating H (refs. 23,24).

The purpose of using effective numbers is to convert Shannon's non-linear score into an interpretable metric that quantifies diversity23. The resulting output, termed effective numbers, shows the number of different types of flavonoids that would need to be consumed in a specific proportional make-up to meet the same relative diversity as the diet from which it was calculated, wherein a higher value indicates wider diversity (a detailed explanation of effective numbers can be found in the Supplementary Methods). The Shannon equation and Hill numbers produce a measure of diversity that is relative to, and independent of, the quantity of flavonoid intake, such that it is possible that two individuals can have exactly the same diversity score, yet one of them may consume, for example, a threefold higher quantity of flavonoids. Therefore, following statistical adjustment for quantity of flavonoid consumption, it is possible to study the independent benefit of diversity of flavonoid intake.

The outcomes in the current study were all-cause mortality and incidence (first-time fatal or non-fatal events) of CVD, T2DM, total cancer, respiratory disease, and neurodegenerative disease. Date of death was obtained from death certificates held by the National Health Service Information Centre (England and Wales) and the National Health Service Central Register Scotland (Scotland). Dates and causes of hospital admissions were identified via record linkage to Health Episode Statistics (England), the Patient Episode Database (Wales) and the Scottish Morbidity Records (Scotland) as well as the National Cancer Registries (England, Scotland and Wales). Incident outcomes were defined as a hospital admission or death identified through primary or secondary diagnosis codes using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) as follows: CVD (I20-I25, I63 and I70-I74), T2DM (E11), cancer (C00-C97, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (C44)), respiratory disease (J09-J98, I26 and I27) and neurodegenerative disease (F00–03, G12.2, G20, G21, G23.1–23.3, G23.8, G23.9, G30 and G31). Hospital admission follow-up data for CVD, T2DM, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease were available until 31 October 2022 for England, 31 August 2022 for Scotland and 31 May 2022 for Wales. Follow-up data for cancer were available until 31 December 2016 for Wales, 31 December 2020 for England and 30 November 2021 for Scotland. Mortality data were available until 30 November 2022 for England, Scotland and Wales. We therefore censored outcome analyses on these dates.

Information on demographics, lifestyle factors and medical history including sex, age, ethnicity, anthropometry, physical activity, education, smoking and alcohol habits were obtained from the baseline assessment. Anthropometric measurements (height and weight) were obtained by trained personnel. BMI was calculated as weight/(height2) (kg m−2). Physical activity was derived using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form, and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking, moderate and vigorous activity measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-h per week). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postal code of residence using the Townsend deprivation score. History of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) was derived from self-reported physician diagnosis of disease or medication use at recruitment, and from ICD codes dated prior to the last date of dietary assessment (Supplementary Table 8). History of hypercholesterolaemia was identified by physician diagnosis (self-reported) or the taking of cholesterol-lowering medication (Supplementary Table 8). To identify other baseline comorbidities, self-reported physician-diagnosed CVD, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and respiratory disease at recruitment was combined with ICD codes dated prior to the last date of diet assessment (Supplementary Table 8). The Oxford WebQ was used to calculate average daily intakes of foods, nutrients, energy intake via information recorded in the UK Nutrient Databank as previously reported54. The healthful plant-based diet index was derived from 17 food groups55.

Cox proportional-hazards models were used to investigate relationships between diversity of flavonoid consumption and all outcomes of interest. Participants were followed up from the completion of the last valid diet questionnaire until the first occurrence of the outcome event, death, loss to follow-up or the end of follow-up (as described above), whichever occurred first. Flavonoid diversity was modelled as quintiles with low flavonoid diversity (Q1) as the reference group. All models examining diversity were mutually adjusted for quantity (quintiles) of the same flavonoids that contributed to flavonoid diversity. All models used age as the underlying timescale56. Five models of adjustment were computed: model 1 minimally adjusted for sex, region of residence (entered as a strata variable: London, North West England, North East England, Yorkshire, West Midlands, East Midlands, South East England, South West England, Scotland and Wales) and number of dietary assessments completed with plausible energy intake (2, 3, 4 or 5); model 2 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 1 plus demographic factors including: ethnicity (White, Black, Asian, mixed or other), BMI (<18.5, 18.5–24.99, 25–29.99, ≥30 kg m−2), education (low (GSEs/O levels/GCSEs or equivalent), medium (NVQ/HND/HNC/A levels/AS levels or equivalent), high (other professional qualifications, college/university degree)) and socioeconomic status (Townsend deprivation index in quintiles); model 3 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 2 plus lifestyle factors including: smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol intake (<1 g d−1, 1–7 g d−1, 8–15 g d−1, 16+ g d−1) and physical activity (MET-h per week in quintiles); model 4 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 3 plus dietary factors including: intakes of sugary drinks (0 d−1, >0–1 d−1, >1–2 d−1, 2+ d−1), cups of coffee (0 d−1, >0–1 d−1, >1–2 d−1, 2+ d−1), and red and processed meat, whole grains, refined grains, saturated fatty acids and sodium (all g d−1) and energy (kcal d−1) (all as quintiles); model 5 multivariable adjusted for covariates in model 4 plus medical history including history of diabetes type 1 or 2 (yes versus no), hypertension (yes versus no) and hypercholesterolaemia (yes versus no), and for analysis of all-cause mortality, further adjustments for prevalent CVD, cancer, respiratory disease and neurodegenerative disease at baseline. For variables where participants could select ‘do not know' or ‘prefer not to answer', or for those with missing data, responses were combined into an ‘unknown' indicator group. The proportional-hazards assumption was confirmed using Schoenfeld residual plots. Absence of multicollinearity among predictors was verified using variance inflation factors. To address concerns that occult chronic diseases in the years preceding diagnosis may have influenced dietary patterns, we conducted sensitivity analysis excluding participants who developed events within 2 years of follow-up. We conducted further sensitivity adjustments for the healthful plant-based diet index in place of other dietary factors in model 5. To assess the influence of flavonoid intakes irrespective of dietary energy, model 5 was rerun without calorie adjustment. To assess the potential independent benefits of quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake on the risk of our outcomes, we report the terms for quantity of flavonoid intake following adjustment for diversity of flavonoid consumption. To evaluate whether the joint effect of quantity and diversity of flavonoid intake was together larger (or smaller) than the combination of the individual parts42, likelihood ratio tests were used to compare models with and without interaction terms. We observed and interpreted the magnitude and direction of observed associations through estimated HRs and associated 95% CIs with a HR of 1 indicating no association. All analyses were undertaken using Stata/IC 14.2 (StataCorp) and R statistics (v.4.2.1).

Metrics details

Aging is one of the most prominent risk factors for neurodegeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the deterioration of old neurons are mostly unknown. To efficiently study neurodegeneration in the context of aging, we transdifferentiated primary human fibroblasts from aged healthy donors directly into neurons, which retained their aging hallmarks, and we verified key findings in aged human and mouse brain tissue. Here we show that aged neurons are broadly depleted of RNA-binding proteins, especially spliceosome components. Intriguingly, splicing proteins—like the dementia- and ALS-associated protein TDP-43—mislocalize to the cytoplasm in aged neurons, which leads to widespread alternative splicing. Cytoplasmic spliceosome components are typically recruited to stress granules, but aged neurons suffer from chronic cellular stress that prevents this sequestration. We link chronic stress to the malfunctioning ubiquitylation machinery, poor HSP90α chaperone activity and the failure to respond to new stress events. Together, our data demonstrate that aging-linked deterioration of RNA biology is a key driver of poor resiliency in aged neurons.

Our rapidly aging population poses one of the largest public health challenges in a generation1. A substantial portion of the public health burden is driven by neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which all increase in incidence rate as a function of age2. These pathologies are collectively defined by declining neuronal health, which manifests in devastating symptoms that are costly to manage and greatly reduce the overall quality of life in the aged population3. Systematic efforts over the past decades have identified biomarkers that are linked to neurodegeneration, but the vast majority of neurodegeneration cases have no familial history or single causal mutation4. Even in mutation-driven neurodegenerative pathologies, onset of symptoms is typically later in life, indicating that aging is an important contributor to disease. Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand how aging alone alters the molecular landscape of neurons and predisposes neurons for poor resiliency to external and internal stress.

Aging is generally linked to several molecular processes5. In neurons, the accumulation of aggregated proteins, dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mislocalization of disease-associated proteins are impacted by age and neurodegeneration-linked mutations6,7,8. However, the molecular interplay between these diverse cellular functions, their relative contribution to neurodegeneration and the importance of other implicated pathways are unknown, especially in an aged neuron that is susceptible to neurodegeneration. For example, the RNA-binding protein (RBP) TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in >95% of patients with ALS, and it directs the proper splicing of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins9,10. Yet we know little about how TDP-43 is initially mislocalized in patients with ALS, nor how it eventually forms aggregates in the absence of an ALS-linked mutation11. More broadly, RBPs and RNA biology are disrupted in neurodegeneration12,13, but it is unclear how the natural aging of neurons contributes to this dysregulation.

Here we leverage transdifferentiation to study the RNA biology of neurons in the context of aging. Transdifferentiation is an efficient means to study aging: human primary fibroblasts are directly converted to neurons, bypassing the pluripotent stem cell state that reverses most aging-associated damage14,15,16. In transdifferentiated neurons, we show that RNA metabolism is broadly dysregulated—key splicing proteins are mislocalized, the RBP-mediated stress response is chronically active and overall resilience to further acute stress is dampened. Depletion of the chaperone HSP90α from stress granules leads to their chronic retention. Notably, the aging human brain also displays the hallmarks of RBP dysregulation and chronic stress. Our findings demonstrate how aging alone functionally destabilizes the neuronal stress response and TDP-43-mediated splicing, which bridges a substantial gap in our understanding of how aging predisposes neurons toward neurodegeneration.

We generated isogenic transdifferentiated (Tdiff.1) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons (iPSC-diff.1) by transducing wild-type patient-derived fibroblasts or iPSCs, respectively, with lentivirus encoding doxycycline-inducible neuronal transcription factors (Fig. 1a). After differentiating in the presence of doxycycline and other small molecules for 3 weeks, we successfully produced >90% Map2+ and >80% Tubβ3+ neurons from fibroblasts and iPSCs (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1a–d), and the transdifferentiated neurons expressed several neuron-specific markers, including NeuN/RBFOX3 in the nucleus and synaptophysin at neurites (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). In addition, mature synaptic connections were observed (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Transdifferentiated neurons also fired both spontaneous and induced action potentials as measured by a multielectrode array (MEA; Extended Data Fig. 1i–k). We then verified that transdifferentiated neurons retained key aging markers. Bisulfite sequencing of CpG methylation, which can be used to estimate biological age17, indicated that the transdifferentiated neurons were similar in age to the original donor fibroblasts, whereas the iPSC-derived neurons and iPSCs exhibited fetal-like methylation patterns (Fig. 1d). Likewise, transdifferentiated neurons expressed higher levels of the senescence marker p16INK4A (Fig. 1e) and the apoptotic markers pro-caspase-3 and AIF (Fig. 1f,g), all of which are associated with aging18,19,20. Therefore, we used transdifferentiation to study neuronal aging.

Source data

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and differential expression analysis of the isogenic transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons revealed that over 4,000 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 1h). The upregulated pathways included the immune response and the lysosome, which are commonly upregulated in aged cells and further confirmed that transdifferentiated neurons retained expression of aging-linked genes21 (Supplementary Table 1). Whole-cell quantitative proteomics confirmed that most fibroblast markers were expressed at similar levels in iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons, whereas mature and glutamatergic neuronal markers were highly upregulated in both cell types (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), again indicating that our transdifferentiation process successfully converted fibroblasts into neurons. Notably, our proteomics data also revealed that known RBPs were broadly depleted in transdifferentiated neurons despite unchanged RBP transcript levels (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). Consistent with this depletion, the most de-enriched metabolic pathways of transdifferentiated neurons involved RNA metabolic processes like the spliceosome, the mRNA surveillance pathway and RNA transport (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Table 2). Gene set enrichment analysis likewise showed depletion of RBP-associated pathways in transdifferentiated neurons relative to iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2f). By mapping the proteomics data to the associated transcript levels, we also identified a large population of genes that were expressed highly as proteins but had normal or depleted transcript levels in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 1k). These highly retained proteins were associated with neurodegenerative pathways and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Given that oxidative phosphorylation was also upregulated more broadly in our proteomics data (Fig. 1j), we hypothesized that aged neurons were prioritizing metabolic pathways over RNA-related processes (Extended Data Fig. 2h), which may lead to destabilization of RNA biology.

Because the spliceosome was the most de-enriched of the RBP metabolism terms in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 1j), we performed immunofluorescence experiments to examine the subcellular localization of splicing proteins. Strikingly, we found that several spliceosome components were significantly mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in transdifferentiated neurons compared to the isogenic iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 2a). The mislocalization spanned across the various functional components of the spliceosome, including the U1 complex (SNRNP70 and SNRNPA), the tri-SNRNP complex (PRPF8 and SNRNP200) and proteins that direct alternative splicing (TDP-43 and TIA1)10,22,23. Notably, aged fibroblasts displayed a lower degree of splicing protein mislocalization (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Other proteins that can mediate alternative splicing, like FUS, were not substantially depleted from the nucleus (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), perhaps because FUS has another nuclear role in the DNA damage response24. Mislocalization of TDP-43 was observed in multiple transdifferentiated neuronal lines (Extended Data Fig. 3c), but not in neurons that were transdifferentiated from young neonatal fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

TDP-43 aggregation is implicated in >95% of ALS cases and >50% of Alzheimer's cases. In iPSC-derived neurons, prolonged stress treatments25 or truncation of the TDP-43 nuclear localization signal26 is required to observe TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation. In transdifferentiated neurons, super-resolution microscopy confirmed basal TDP-43 mislocalization and further revealed TDP-43 foci in the soma of these neurons without any exogenous manipulation (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Treatment with sodium arsenite, an acute oxidative stressor, for 1 h further showed that TDP-43 foci in the neuronal soma were distinct from canonical stress granules, which typically integrate TDP-43 but instead clustered independently in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Interrogation of TDP-43 interactions by affinity-pulldown mass spectrometry (AP-MS) from iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons revealed that spliceosome proteins were highly enriched in the TDP-43 interactome of transdifferentiated neurons despite their lower protein expression (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 3). Meanwhile, stress granule components like G3BP2 and Caprin1 were de-enriched in transdifferentiated neurons even when compared to TDP-43 pulldown in stressed iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3h–l). The strong association between TDP-43 and spliceosome components in aged neurons could not be recapitulated by simply treating iPSC-derived neurons with sodium arsenite (Extended Data Fig. 3h–j), indicating that it is an aging-specific phenomenon.

TDP-43 mediates the alternative splicing of hundreds of transcripts, and it was previously reported that loss of nuclear TDP-43 leads to the expression of STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons in patients with ALS27,28,29. Therefore, we next tested whether splicing of these TDP-43 targets was also dysregulated in aged neurons. We performed enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP)30 of TDP-43 in transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons to determine TDP-43 binding sites on RNA. Consistent with the nuclear depletion of TDP-43 that we observed, TDP-43 interacted with substantially fewer introns in transdifferentiated neurons despite retaining its canonical GU-rich binding motif31 (Fig. 2d–e). This reduced intronic binding coincided with a >2.5-fold depletion in TDP-43 binding to the ALS-linked cryptic exon splice sites in STMN2 and UNC13A (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c), although we did not detect cryptic exon expression (Extended Data Fig. 4d). We mapped TDP-43-bound introns to differentially spliced transcripts in aged neurons, and we observed significant changes in exon inclusion or exclusion events of approximately 500 transcripts, many of which were neuronal cytoskeleton proteins (Fig. 2f,g and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). For example, reduced TDP-43 binding at the intronic site between exons 35 and 36 of the neuromuscular junction protein AGRN led to the exclusion of these exons in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 2h). We observed a similar exon exclusion event in DNM1 (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Both AGRN and DNM1 are previously reported targets of TDP-43 splicing32, and dysregulation of AGRN is implicated in ALS33. Conversely, increased TDP-43 binding at exons 3 and 6 in the dementia-associated gene MAPT led to retention of those exons in transdifferentiated neurons, which is the expected alternative splicing pattern of MAPT in adults34,35 (Extended Data Fig. 4h).

To confirm that nuclear depletion of TDP-43 occurred as a function of aging, we tested whether the TDP-43 phenotypes we observed in transdifferentiated neurons were similar in aged wild-type mice (Fig. 2I). Immunofluorescence of 1.5-, 6- and 24-month-old mice confirmed that TDP-43 was mislocalized as a function of aging—neurons from the motor cortex of 1.5-month-old mice had strongly nuclear TDP-43, whereas the motor cortex neurons of 24-month-old mice TDP-43 contained cytoplasmic foci (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). These aggregates were not present in either the hippocampus or motor cortex of the 6-month-old mice (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Like TDP-43, core spliceosome proteins like PRPF8 and SNRPA—and the alternative splicing protein TIA1—were mislocalized in aged mice (Extended Data Fig. 5e). TDP-43 eCLIP of the 1.5-, 6- and 24-month-old mouse cerebellum also revealed age-dependent loss of intronic binding (Fig. 2k) despite retaining the normal TDP-43 binding motif (Fig. 2l and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Consistent with our findings using transdifferentiated neurons, we observed reduced TDP-43 binding to reported cryptic exon sites in aged mice32 (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Together, our data demonstrates that mislocalization of TDP-43 and other splicing components is an aging-related process that alters the splicing of hundreds of transcripts, many of which are important for neuronal health.

Our TDP-43 AP-MS and immunofluorescence results indicated that spliceosome components assembled independently of stress granules, which are the typical repository for cytoplasmic RBPs during stress events (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3g–l). Stress granules are biomolecular condensates that form in the cytoplasm due to activation of the integrated stress response36. One of the main functions of stress granules is the sequestration of mRNAs and RBPs until after the stress event is resolved37,38, and TDP-43 exclusion from stress granules is thought to lead to neurodegeneration-linked TDP-43 fibrillization39. Therefore, we tested whether dysregulation of the integrated stress response might be linked to TDP-43 mislocalization.

We performed AP-MS of G3BP1, which is a canonical stress granule marker. Consistent with our previous results from Fig. 2b, we found that spliceosome components were de-enriched from the G3BP1 interactome in aged neurons, especially TDP-43 (Figs. 2b and 3a and Supplementary Table 3). Acute stress treatment of iPSC-derived neurons caused a similar depletion of splicing proteins, indicating that transdifferentiated neurons might be basally stressed (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Other core stress granule proteins like Caprin1 were unchanged in transdifferentiated neurons, but auxiliary stress granule members like staufen-1 and staufen-2 were depleted, possibly due to their lower expression levels (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6b). The pulldown fold changes of spliceosome components for G3BP1 and TDP-43 were largely anticorrelated (Extended Data Fig. 6c), further indicating that they are distinct complexes in transdifferentiated neurons.

Source data

Under basal conditions, stress granule components are diffuse in the cytoplasm and will only assemble into condensates during stress events40. However, immunofluorescence revealed that core stress granule proteins like G3BP1 and Caprin1 pre-assembled into oblong, misshapen condensates in unstressed transdifferentiated neurons but not in iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6d). G3BP1 condensates were observed in many transdifferentiated neuronal lines (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f), and they were specific to aged neurons because fibroblasts and young transdifferentiated neurons did not contain these inclusions (Extended Data Fig. 6d–g). Phosphorylated eIF2α is the canonical marker for activation of the integrated stress response36, and we indeed observed higher levels of phosphorylated eIF2α in transdifferentiated neurons relative to unstressed iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 3c). The RNA-binding profile of G3BP1 and Caprin1 measured by eCLIP can also elucidate the stress status of cells; acute stress treatment causes stress granule proteins to bind more 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) rather than coding (CDS) RNA sequences, and we found elevated 3′ UTR binding in transdifferentiated neurons without stress treatment (Fig. 3d,e). Interestingly, the 3′ UTR sequences that were bound by G3BP1 and Caprin1 in transdifferentiated neurons were mostly unique and were not bound in unstressed iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 3f,g). The RNA-binding motif of Caprin1 was unchanged in aged neurons (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), suggesting that these cryptic 3′ UTR sequences were likely exposed due to chronic stress rather than a shift in RNA-binding preference by the stress granule protein. G3BP1- and Caprin1-bound RNAs were enriched for neuronal transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). Our data indicate that aged neurons are chronically stressed because of their unique, stress-associated phenotypes even at baseline conditions. Therefore, we refer to the stress granule-like inclusions in these aged neurons as chronic stress granules.

The formation of stress granules is associated with stalled translation36, and 3′ UTR binding by RBPs can also regulate translation of specific mRNAs41. Therefore, we used ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-seq)42 to determine the translation efficiency of stress granule-associated transcripts. In transdifferentiated neurons, thousands of transcripts had lower translation efficiency (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 7e). However, G3BP1- and Caprin1-bound transcripts had no shift in translation efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g), suggesting that chronic stress granules were not directly regulating translation in aged neurons. Moreover, we found that poly(A) RNA only accumulated into chronic stress granules in transdifferentiated neurons upon exogenous stress treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6i), and these granules were usually smaller and misshapen, indicating a reduction in fusion events43, relative to the canonical stress granules formed in iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Together, our data indicate that chronic, gel-like stress granules form in aged neurons, but they do not functionally alter translation.

The presence of chronic stress granules in aged neurons indicated that the dissolution of stress granules may be dysregulated, which in turn may exacerbate the dysregulated RNA metabolism we observed in Figs. 1 and 2. Stress granule resolution is mediated by ubiquitination of G3BP1, which is then recognized by VCP, a multifunctional protein that is involved in many ubiquitin-related processes44. ATPase activity of HSP90α, which also regulates the ubiquitinome, is required for proper resolution of stress granules45; HSP90 and VCP work together to clear misfolded proteins, leading to undetectable poly-ubiquitin chains in normal cells (Fig. 4a)46. We noticed in our affinity pulldowns of G3BP1 and TDP-43 that HSP90α and its subunits were among the most depleted interacting proteins in aged neurons, potentially indicating that dysregulation of this heat shock protein was causing poor stress granule resolution (Figs. 2b and 3a, Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 8a). HSP90α foci were also visibly distinct from chronic and arsenite-mediated stress granules in aged neurons (Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, VCP and its cofactor FAF2 were entirely absent from the G3BP1 interactome in transdifferentiated neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Therefore, we hypothesized that altered stress granule component ubiquitylation contributed to the lack of stress granule dissolution.

Statistics were calculated using a two-tailed Welch's t test. Ub, ubiquitin; SGs, stress granules.

We first measured the status of the ubiquitinome. As determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence, ubiquitination was broadly increased in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8c), which may be driving the integrated stress response through the accumulation of unfolded proteins47. Given that HSP90α chaperones hundreds of protein targets and is depleted from the stress granule interactome, we reasoned that its activity may be responsible for chronic stress granule presence. We then examined the HSP90α interactome, which confirmed the reduced interaction between HSP90α and stress granule proteins in aged neurons (Figs. 2b, 3a and 4d). HSP90α also did not bind to TDP-43 in transdifferentiated neurons despite interacting in iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8d). The HSP90α interactome of aged neurons was enriched with several proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation, including cytochrome c and the ubiquinone complex (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Notably, these oxidative phosphorylation proteins were highly expressed in aged neuron data despite having normal transcript expression (Fig. 1k,l, Extended Data Fig. 8f and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting a slow turnover rate that is perhaps caused by poor HSP90α activity.

To test if HSP90α might be stalled on ubiquitylated mitochondrial proteins, we performed a ubiquitin pulldown and MS in both transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons. Our results supported our hypothesis in the following three ways: (1) our ubiquitin pulldown in transdifferentiated neurons failed to directly detect any of the G3BP1/G3BP2 ubiquitin modifications that are required for stress granule turnover44 (Fig. 4e), (2) the pulldown found that G3BP1/G3BP2 were depleted from the ubiquitin interactome in transdifferentiated neurons (Fig. 4f) and (3) the mitochondrial proteins that bind HSP90α strongly in transdifferentiated neurons were also highly enriched in our ubiquitin pulldown (Fig. 4f,g). Together, these results indicate that stress granule turnover is deprioritized by protein chaperones and the ubiquitin machinery in favor of mitochondrial proteins.

Because HSP90α has ATPase-dependent foldase and ATPase-independent holdase activity48,49,50, we treated aged neurons with the HSP90α inhibitor ganetespib to bias the cells toward the holdase activity. We surprisingly found that HSP90α inhibitor treatment was sufficient to significantly reduce both chronic and arsenite-mediated stress granule formation (Fig. 4h,i), further indicating that HSP90α dysregulation contributes to the chronic stress observed in aged neurons.

The chronic activation of the integrated stress response in aged neurons may inhibit their effective response to new stress stimuli. For example, extended treatment with low levels of exogenous stressors was shown to dysregulate the integrated stress response in neuroblastoma cells51 and cause TDP-43 aggregation in motor neurons52. Therefore, we treated iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons with sodium arsenite for 1 h and allowed them to recover for up to 24 h. iPSC-derived neurons resolved ~50% of arsenite-induced stress granules within 2 h (Fig. 5a,b). Primary fibroblasts had similar stress granule recovery kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 9a). By contrast, transdifferentiated neurons responded poorly to stress and had elevated stress granule retention even 24 h postarsenite treatment (Fig. 5a,b). Poor stress granule resolution in transdifferentiated neurons was also observed in response to treatment with an endoplasmic reticulum stressor, thapsigargin (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Given that arsenite and thapsigargin typically activate the stress response via different eIF2α kinases, our data indicate that chronic phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 4c) renders aged neurons incapable of efficiently recovering from distinct types of acute stress.

To determine whether acute stress also affected downstream functions of the integrated stress response, we performed RNA-seq of iPSC-derived and transdifferentiated neurons immediately after arsenite treatment and after 24 h recovery from arsenite. It was previously reported that various heat shock proteins were activated following stress treatment and recovery53, and we observed a similar increase in the transcript levels of HSP70 and HSP90 components following stress treatment in iPSC-derived neurons (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 9c), including HSPA1A, which is only transcribed in response to stress54. However, transdifferentiated neurons failed to activate transcription of HSP70 and HSP90 chaperones (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). Only HSPA6 and HSPA7 were strongly activated in transdifferentiated neurons, but upregulation of these genes was even more pronounced in iPSC-derived neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9e). In addition, we found that expression of the STMN2 cryptic exon was activated in transdifferentiated neurons 24 h following arsenite treatment (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Together, our results demonstrate that aged neurons fail to properly respond to and recover from acute stress treatments, indicating a lack of resiliency that may underlie aging-related neuronal death.

Although transdifferentiated neurons are a powerful model to study aging, we sought to verify whether key phenotypes that we observed in cell culture are also present in aged human brains. To this end, we repeated several experiments—MS, immunofluorescence and eCLIP—in cohorts of aged brain tissue; we used the frontal cortex, which should mirror the cortical neurons we generated via transdifferentiation. Our cohorts consisted of three ‘mid-age' brains (30–50 years old) and three ‘old-age' brains (80–90 years old; Supplementary Table 6 and Fig. 6a). MS of lysed brain tissue revealed that there were several thousand proteins that were substantially upregulated and downregulated due to aging (Fig. 6b); the upregulated pathways primarily encompassed mitochondrial gene sets like oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic respiration (Supplementary Table 7). By contrast, RNA pathways were largely depleted due to aging (Supplementary Table 7), and RBPs were expressed at significantly lower levels than all other proteins in our old-age cohort relative to the mid-age cohort (Fig. 6c). This directly recapitulates the phenotype that we observed in transdifferentiated neurons compared to their isogenic iPSC-derived control neurons (Fig. 1i,j).

Given the similar RBP depletion in both cultured neurons and tissue, we tested whether TDP-43 was also basally mislocalized in the aging human brain. Immunofluorescence staining of TDP-43 in human brain tissue indeed showed an age-dependent increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 foci (Fig. 6d–e and Extended Data Fig. 10a), which is a finding that we observed in transdifferentiated neurons and in the aging mouse brain (Fig. 2).

Finally, we tested whether the aged human brain also displayed key phenotypes of molecular stress—elevated levels of phospho-eIF2α and increased 3′ UTR binding by G3BP1. As noted above, eIF2α phosphorylation initiates the formation of stress granules, and we found that the old-age brain cohort expressed significantly higher levels of phospho-eIF2α relative to the mid-age brain cohort (Fig. 6f and Extended Data Fig. 10b). In addition, G3BP1 eCLIP of the mid- and old-age brain cohorts displayed the predominantly 3′ UTR binding found in stressed conditions (Fig. 6g). Many 3′ UTR binding sites were shared between the brain samples and our cultured neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10c), which included known G3BP1 binding targets in neurons like MAPT55 (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Together, our data demonstrates that our findings in transdifferentiated neurons are largely recapitulated in the aging human frontal cortex.

Aging is one of the primary risk factors for neurodegeneration, and our study demonstrates that aging alone mechanistically and functionally destabilizes RNA metabolism in neurons. Our conclusions are drawn from several lines of orthogonal evidence in transdifferentiated neurons compared to isogenic iPSC-derived neurons (Figs. 1–5) with further validation in a mouse model (Fig. 2i–l) and in the human brain (Fig. 6). We demonstrate that transdifferentiation successfully generates aged neurons that express key neuronal markers and can fire both spontaneous and induced action potentials (Extended Data Fig. 1). Despite being a two-dimensional cell culture model that does retain expression of some fibroblast markers like COL1A1 (Extended Data Fig. 2a), the results from transdifferentiated neurons are largely recapitulated in the aged mouse cortex and aged human frontal cortex.

However, we do note a few differences, which are as follows: (1) human brain tissue has a lower, albeit still significant, degree of RBP depletion due to aging; (2) both human and mouse brains retain substantial levels of nuclear TDP-43 in their neurons and (3) the G3BP1 eCLIP binding in the human brains does not change as a function of aging. There are several explanations for these incongruencies. First, our cell culture model is a comparison between fetal neurons and aged neurons; fetal neurons are very different from even the youngest mouse and human brains we assay. Second, we are encumbered by the limitations of working with tissue, including the time between death and dissection, which may lead to degradation of unstable RNAs and cellular structures56. Third, the auxiliary glia cells of the brain may help clear protein aggregates in unhealthy neurons of a human or mouse, but this does not occur in our monoculture neurons57. Still, all our results clearly demonstrate that the RNA biology of an aged neuron is indeed ailing.

The proteomes of transdifferentiated neurons and human brains demonstrate that thousands of canonical RBPs are depleted in aged neurons, especially those involved in splicing and RNA transport. Intriguingly, the mRNA transcripts encoding RBPs are not depleted, indicating that the RBPs are perhaps being degraded more rapidly in aged neurons. This increased turnover could be due to a failure to localize to the proper region of the neuron. Indeed, dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport was previously reported in transdifferentiated neurons58, and we likewise find that the depleted splicing proteins, including the ALS- and dementia-associated RBP TDP-43, are mislocalized to the cytoplasm of aged neurons.

Mislocalization of TDP-43 is thought to be an initiating step in the pathogenesis of ALS, yet the cause of TDP-43 nuclear depletion to this point was unclear11; our results indicate that aging is sufficient to cause TDP-43 mislocalization, which may act as the first insult driving neurons toward neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, TDP-43 mislocalization in aged neurons decreases binding to neurodegeneration-linked cryptic exon sites. The next step of TDP-43-mediated pathogenesis is thought to be aggregation into fibrils, which is usually antagonized by stress granules39. Our recent report suggests that splicing proteins like SNRNP200 are recruited to stress granules in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells59; however, in aged neurons, splicing proteins including TDP-43 form complexes that are distinct from stress granules.

The chronic stress granules that form in aged neurons are compositionally distinct from canonical stress granules. Key RBPs are depleted from chronic stress granules, including RNA transport and splicing proteins, as mentioned above. Moreover, the physical properties of chronic stress granules appear to be gel-like, given their small area and oblong shape, which may explain why there is physical demixing between phase-separated stress granules and TDP-43 (refs. 60,61). The gel-like properties of chronic stress granules may arise from a prolonged inability to dissolve and may hinder recruitment of other RBPs even during new stress events. Together, we propose a model in which chronic, aging-related stress leads to TDP-43 exclusion from stress granules, which functionally destabilizes TDP-43-mediated splicing in aged neurons (Fig. 7).

Chronic activation of the stress response in aged neurons leads to physical demixing between stress granules and other RBPs, which functionally impacts splicing in aged neurons and decreases resiliency to acute stress.

The failure to respond to acute stress may further exacerbate the aging-mediated dysregulation of RNA biology we described. Given that we detected depletion of HSP90α from stress granules, the lack of HSP90α activation in response to acute stress treatment likely increases the relative burden of unfolded protein stress on aged neurons. In fact, the depletion of HSP90α from stress granules in aged neurons may result from one—or many—stress events that occurred before culturing of the primary fibroblasts. It is possible that resiliency to such stress events could be increased by exogenously rescuing chaperone activity in aging neurons. Therefore, reversing chronic stress may be a viable therapeutic avenue to prevent neurodegeneration and should be a focus of future efforts to promote the healthy aging of neurons.

Lenti-X 293T (Takara Bio, 632180) cells were cultured in DMEM (high glucose; Life, 11965118) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Life, 26140079) and passaged with 1:10 split ratios at 90% confluency using TrypLE Express (Life, 12604013). Within 24 h of a fresh passage, Lenti-X 293Ts were cotransfected with psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260), pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) and pLVX-UbC-rtTA-Ngn2:2A:Ascl1 (UNA; Addgene, 127289) or pLVX-UbC-rtTA-Ngn2:2A:EGFP (rtTA-Ngn2; Addgene, 127288) at a 1:1:2 mass ratio using the JetPEI transfection system (VWR, 89129-916). The supernatant fraction of transfected Lenti-X 293T cells was collected 48 h, 72 h and 96 h post-transfection and pooled at 4 °C. Lenti-X concentrator (Takara Bio, 631232) was added to the collected virus, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,00g for 45 min at 4 °C. The lentivirus-containing pellet was resuspended using 1× dPBS (Life, 13190250) in 1/100 of the original volume of the pooled supernatant fraction. Lentiviral titer was measured using Lenti Go-Stix (Takara Bio, 631280) and aliquoted at the desired titer for long-term storage at −80 °C.

Primary fibroblasts originating from antemortem patients (Supplementary Table 8) were cultured on uncoated plastic six-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FB012927) in TFM (DMEM, high glucose (Life, 11965118), 15% (vol/vol) FBS (Life, 26140079) and 1× MEM NEAA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11140050)) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with media changes every 2–3 days. Fibroblasts were passaged at 90–100% confluency with a 1:2 or 1:3 split ratio using TrypLE Express (Life, 12604013). Long-term fibroblast stocks were stored in 90% FBS with 10% (vol/vol) DMSO (Sigma, D2650-100ML) in liquid nitrogen. To generate transdifferentiation-competent fibroblasts, 80% confluent cells were transduced in 500 μl TFM with lentivirus containing the UNA expression vector in 5 μg ml−1 polybrene (Sigma, TR-1003-G). Following incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 8 h, the transduction volume was increased to 2 ml, and the fibroblasts were incubated with virus for an additional 40 h. To select for fibroblasts containing the UNA vector, the fibroblasts were treated with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1113803) for at least 2 weeks. Cultures with greater than 50% death rates after puromycin treatment were discarded.

Transdifferentiation plates were prepared by coating plastic six-well or 15-cm plates with 10 μg ml−1 poly-d-lysine (PDL; Sigma, P6407-5MG) and 0.0001% (wt/vol) poly-l-ornithine (PLO; Sigma, P4957-50ML) for 24 h, followed by a 24 h incubation with 10 μg ml−1 laminin (Sigma, L2020-1MG). UNA fibroblasts were expanded to the desired cell number; in general, approximately threefold more surface area of fibroblasts was cultured for the desired plating surface of transdifferentiated neurons. For example, three UNA 15-cm plates (Genesee Scientific, 25-203; 435 cm2 total surface area) would seed one transdifferentiation 15-cm plate. Large fibroblast cultures (>10 million cells) were cultured in Corning CellBIND Surface HYPERFlask cell culture vessels (Sigma, CLS10034-24EA) following the manufacturer's protocol. After the UNA fibroblasts were cultured to the desired cell number, fibroblasts were passaged to PDL-/PLO-/laminin-coated plates at 300% confluency for transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiating neurons were cultured for 3 weeks in NK (0.5× DMEM/F12, GlutaMAX supplement (Life, 10565042), 0.5× Neurobasal (Life, 21103049), 1× B-27 supplement (Life, 17504044), 1× N-2 supplement (Life, 17502048), 20 μg ml−1 laminin, 400 μg ml−1 dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP; SelleckChem, S7858), 2 μg l−1 doxycycline (Sigma, D9881-10G), 5 μM dorsomorphin homolog 1 (ref. 63; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 412610), 0.5 μM LDN-193189 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50176042), 0.5 μM A83-01 (Stem Cell Technologies, 72022), 5 μM forskolin (Stem Cell Technologies, 72114), 3 μM CHIR-99021 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 442310), 10 μM SB-431542 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 161410) and 10 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122)) with media changes every 48 h. Cell morphology was checked every 48 h on a Zeiss Axio-Vert.A1 to ensure proper transdifferentiation progression. Mature transdifferentiated neurons were not fluorescently-sorted to ensure that there were enough cells for experiments with high input requirements like eCLIP and affinity pulldowns. For culturing longer than 3 weeks, media changes were reduced to once every 4 days.

Primary fibroblasts were reprogrammed using the CytoTune iPS 2.0 Sendai Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A16517) at the titer recommended by the manufacturer. The fibroblasts were cultured in TFM for 1 week on an uncoated plate; afterward, the cells were passaged to plates coated with 1× Matrigel (Corning, 354277) and transitioned to ReproTeSR (Stem Cell Technologies, 05926) with media changes every 48 h. iPSC colonies were excised with a sterile needle and aspirated into a new plate for screening and validation. The iPSC cells were cultured on 1× Matrigel plates with mTeSR Plus (Stem Cell Technologies, 100-0276) media changes every 48 h; cells were passaged using Versene (Life, 15040066) dissociation reagent at a 1:5–10 split ratio. Long-term iPSC stocks were generated by resuspending the cells in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO.

iPSCs were seeded on a 1× Matrigel-coated 12-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FB012928) at ~50% confluency. The iPSCs were transduced with the rtTA-Ngn2 lentivirus in mTeSR Plus without polybrene. After 48 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the transduced iPSCs were treated with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin to select for iPSCs with doxycycline-inducible Ngn2 expression. The puromycin-resistant iPSCs were expanded to the desired cell number; in general, the iPSCs expanded fourfold once differentiation was initiated, so we seeded at ~25% confluency on 1× Matrigel-coated plates. Following seeding, the cells were cultured in mTeSR Plus with 2 μg ml−1 doxycycline for 72 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were passaged to new 1× Matrigel-coated plates if needed and transitioned to NMM1 media (0.5× DMEM/F12, GlutaMAX supplement; 0.5× neurobasal; 1× B-27 supplement; 1× N-2 supplement; 2 μg ml−1 laminin; 0.5 mM db-cAMP; 20 ng μl−1 recombinant BDNF (Peprotech, 450-02-50UG); 20 ng μl−1 human GDNF (Peprotech, 450-10-50UG); 10 ng μl−1 human NT-3 (Peprotech, 450-03-50UG) and 10 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin) with half-media changes every 48 h. The cells were maintained in NMM1 for at least 3 weeks to ensure complete differentiation.

Cell cultures were tested for the presence of Mycoplasma every month using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, LT07-318) following the manufacturer's protocol. All new cell lines were quarantined and tested for Mycoplasma twice, at least 1 week apart, before being cultured with existing lines within the lab. The presence of Mycoplasma was also sporadically tested using DAPI staining and fluorescence microscopy (see below).

Both male and female C57BL6/J mice (Mus musculus) used in this study were housed in the vivarium at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center or the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine in specific pathogen-free conditions. All protocols were approved by the UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were killed at 1.5 months (young), 6 months (mid age) or 22–25 months (old) of age, and their brains were collected for immunohistochemistry and eCLIP (see below). Each experiment was performed with cohorts of two to four mice. The brains were excised from anesthetized mice, split laterally into the two hemispheres with each half going to our two experiments and immediately frozen at −80 °C (for eCLIP) or fixed (for immunohistochemistry). For fixation, mouse tissue was incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for at least 24 h. The tissues were embedded in a cryomold in OCT solution (Sakura Finetek, 4583). Cryostat-sectioned tissue (20 μm) was mounted on Superfrost+ Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22037246) and stored at −80 °C until used for immunohistochemistry (see below).

Control human brain tissue samples were obtained from the UCSD ALS repository, which is compliant with HIPAA informed consent procedures and approved by the institutional review board (CA, 120056). The brain tissue was dissected in an autopsy suite (usually with a short postmortem interval of less than 6 h) and either immediately frozen for biochemical studies or fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 2 weeks. Frontal cortex derived from three mid-age and three old-age patient samples (Supplementary Table 6) was used for this study. Human brain tissue is available via the Target ALS Multicenter Human Postmortem Tissue Core and can be requested at the following webpage: https://www.targetals.org/resource/human-postmortem-tissue-core/.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted and stored at −20 °C for genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was purified from the cells using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 69504) following the manufacturer's protocol. Three micrograms of genomic DNA were used with the Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 Kit (Illumina, 20087706) at the UCSD IGM Genomics Center. Epic methylation data were submitted to the DNA Methylation Age Calculator maintained by the Clock Foundation (https://dnamage.clockfoundation.org/), which allowed us to approximate the age of cultured neurons17. We used the ‘Skin and Blood Aging Clock' result from the Calculator output. Excel was used to plot the bisulfite aging data versus the actual age of the donor.

Mature transdifferentiated neurons were seeded onto PDL-/PLO-/laminin-coated Cytoview MEA 48 plate (Axion Biosystems, M768-tMEA-48B). Approximately 1.5 × 105 neurons were seeded in a 50 μl droplet to concentrate the neurons on top of the electrode arrays. After a 2 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to allow the cells to adhere, 150 µl additional media was added to each well. Cells were cultured for at least 48 h before MEA recordings.

MEA recordings were taken by a Maestro Classic MEA system (Axion Biosystems) using Axion Integrated Studio Acquisition software (v.2.1.5). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C with the addition of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) to support CO2 buffering during recording. Neuronal activity was acquired at a sampling frequency of 12.5 kHz, using a Butterworth band-pass filter (200–3,000 Hz) and adaptive spike detector set at 5.5 s.d. from mean background noise. An electrode was defined as active with a mean firing rate greater than 0.017 Hz. Data acquisition for each condition consisted of a minimum of three 5-min recording sessions over the course of 30 min. Thresholded spike data (.spk files) were analyzed using Axion NeuralMetricTool software (v.2.1.5), evaluating weighted mean firing rate per well.

To measure induced action potentials, baseline neuronal activity was recorded for 30 min before the addition of 50 μM bicuculline (Tocris, 2503). Drug-induced neuronal activity was recorded following a 5-min equilibration period in the MEA system. Media was then refreshed, and neuronal activity was immediately recorded to assess recovery to induced activity (see ‘washout' in Extended Data Fig. 1). GraphPad Prism 10 was used to plot the MEA data, and Prism also calculated statistical significance using Welch's t test.

Ibidi μ-slide 18-well chambers (Ibidi, 81811) were coated as described above with PDL/PLO/laminin or 1× Matrigel for transdifferentiated and iPSC-derived neurons, respectively. Cells were transferred to the Ibidi μ-slides at least 24 h before immunofluorescence. Stress, recovery and inhibition treatments were applied at least 24 h after passaging to the Ibidi μ-slides—sodium arsenite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15654770) for 1 h at 0.5 mM; thapsigargin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, T7458) for 1 h at 1 μM; ganetespib (SelleckChem, S1159) for 24 h at 50 nM. To fix the cells, paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50980492) was added to the cell media to a final concentration of 4% (vol/vol), which was then incubated at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 45 min. The samples were washed three times for 5 min each with 1× dPBS. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 1× dPBS with 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma, X100-500ML) and 5% (vol/vol) donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 017-000-121) for 45 min at 25 °C. The permeabilized samples were washed three times for 1 min each with 1× dPBS with 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (dPBST). Primary antibodies were added to antibody solution (1× dPBST with 0.1% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10773877) at the concentrations listed in Supplementary Table 9 and incubated for 18 h with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The cells were then washed for 5 min three times with dPBST. Secondary antibodies were diluted in antibody solution (Supplementary Table 9) and incubated with the samples for 1 h with gentle rocking at 25 °C. Following this incubation, the cells were washed for 5 min three times with 1× dPBS, and Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36971) was used for long-term storage of the slides at 4 °C. The immunofluorescence samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM-880 microscope with 405, 488, 561 and 633 nm lasers using a ×63/1.4 oil immersion objective. Confocal imaging data were acquired as single slices, and line averaging was used to improve signal-to-noise ratio. For Airyscan imaging data, processing of all channels was performed in Zen software using super-resolution settings.

Immunofluorescence images were processed with ImageJ for visualization and quantification. To determine the nuclear fraction of proteins, a nuclear mask was created and used to calculate the nuclear and cytoplasmic intensity independently. The nuclear intensity was divided by the total intensity to derive the nuclear fraction. For the intensity of the entire cell, the nuclear masking step was skipped. To determine the number and shape of stress granules, difference of Gaussians filtering was used to remove background noise and to enhance G3BP1 foci before applying an intensity auto threshold. Using these thresholded images, G3BP1 foci were masked as regions of interest and were validated manually—false foci were removed, and any foci that were missed by the automatic detection were added. The BioVoxxel Toolbox Extended Particle Analyzer (https://imagej.net/plugins/biovoxxel-toolbox) was used to calculate circularity and roundness of G3BP1 foci. The number of stress granules per cell was calculated by dividing the number of stress granules by the number of nuclei in each image. Data were visualized using GraphPad Prism 10, Welch's t test was calculated in Excel and statistical outliers were discarded using Grubbs's outlier test.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (that is, human brain tissue) were deparaffinized using two 5 min incubations in CitriSolv (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 04-355-121) at 25 °C, then washed twice in 100% (vol/vol) ethanol for 5 min each before proceeding to rehydration. Paraformaldehyde-treated samples (that is, mouse brain tissue) were thawed at 25 °C for 30 min before rehydration.

All tissue samples were first rehydrated using decreasing serial washes (95%, 85% and 75%) of ethanol at 25 °C and then a final wash in dH2O before moving immediately to antigen retrieval. All samples were treated with an antigen retrieval step to increase the antibody signal in the fixed tissue. In brief, 1× citrate buffer (Abcam, ab93678) was heated in a conventional microwave for 90 s. The rehydrated/deparaffinized slides were incubated in the heated 1× citrate buffer and incubated at 98 °C in a preheated laboratory oven for 30 min. The slides were cooled to 25 °C for 20 min, washed twice in 1× dPBS and used immediately for antibody staining. The tissue samples were surrounded by a hydrophobic barrier drawn with barrier pen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NC9545623). To permeabilize the brain tissue, the samples were washed three times with SuperBlock (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 37515) for 5 min each and then incubated in SuperBlock for 45 min at 25 °C. After an additional three washes with SuperBlock, the samples were incubated in the primary antibody diluted in SuperBlock for 16 h at 4 °C; this step was repeated for the secondary antibody incubation, for which the sample was incubated at 25 °C for 6 h. The brains were then washed an additional three times with 1× dPBS, incubated with DAPI for 10 min, and mounted with Prolong Diamond. High magnification (×63) images were acquired on an LSM-880 microscope as described above. Tile scans were acquired on a Zeiss LSM-780 microscope at ×10 magnification. Map2+ neurons were manually identified and scored for cytoplasmic TDP-43 foci, and the results were plotted using GraphPad Prism 10. Statistics (Welch's t test) were also calculated in Prism.

The immunofluorescence protocol was followed through the secondary antibody staining step as described above. After washing the cells three times with 1× dPBS, the cells were fixed again with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde for an additional 10 min at 4 °C. Following fixation, the cells were washed with dPBST twice and incubated in FISH-W buffer (10% (vol/vol) formamide in 2× SSC) for 5 min at 25 °C. After the FISH-W treatment, the poly(A) probe was added to a final concentration of 125 nM in FISH-H buffer (2 mg ml−1 BSA + 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate in 2× SSC) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The cells were then washed twice with FISH-W buffer and twice more with 2× SSC at 37 °C for 5 min; all washes were performed in the humidified chamber. The slides were then mounted with Prolong Diamond and imaged and analyzed as described in the Immunofluorescence.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C or used immediately for western blotting. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl RIPA lysis and extraction buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89900) supplemented with 2× Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78440). The resuspended cells were incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 15 min, and they were further lysed by sonicating for 10 min (30 s/30 s off cycles). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 16,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was transferred to a new tube and combined with 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0007) supplemented with 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M3148-250ML). The samples were then heated to 70 °C for 10 min and loaded onto ten-well NuPAGE 4–12% Bis–Tris Mini Protein Gels (Life, NP0335BOX). Gels were electrophoresed in the Novex XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EI0001) at 150 V for 75 min. The samples were then transferred using the dry iBlot system for most proteins (iBlot 2 Transfer Stacks; Life, IB24002). Once the samples were transferred to the PVDF membrane, the membranes were blocked in 5% (wt/vol) milk powder (Apex Bioresearch, 20-241) in 1× TBST (1× TBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AAJ62662K7) and 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween-20 (Sigma, P9416)) for 30 min at 25 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted to the concentrations listed in Supplementary Table 10 in 5% (wt/vol) milk powder in 1× TBST and incubated overnight with the blocked membrane at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The membrane was then washed thoroughly three times with 1× TBST for 5 min each wash at 25 °C. Secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies were diluted 1:2,000 in 5% (wt/vol) milk powder in 1× TBST and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at 25 °C with gentle rocking. After an additional three washes with 1× TBST, the HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were developed with ECL western blotting substrate (Life, 32106) and imaged on an Azure 600 Western Blot Imager (Azure Biosystems). The western blot images were analyzed using ImageJ to determine the intensity of individual bands, which were normalized to the loading control. The relative expression was plotted using GraphPad Prism 10, and Welch's t test was used to calculate significance in Prism.

For phosphoproteins, a few modifications were made to the abovementioned protocol. First, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the LDS sample buffer. Second, a wet transfer in transfer buffer (1× NuPAGE transfer buffer (Life, NP0006) and 10% (vol/vol) methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A411-4)) was performed for 16 h at 40 V using the Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane (Sigma, IPFL00010). Third, 5% (wt/vol) BSA in 1× TBST was used for blocking and for antibody incubations. Fourth, the Li-Cor IR dye-conjugated antibody was used for the secondary staining, and we imaged using the IR channels of the Azure 600 Western Blot Imager. For phospho-Westerns, normalization was performed to the total protein stain.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted for RNA-seq experiments. For long-term storage of samples before RNA-seq, the cells were stored in Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026) at −20 °C and precipitated following the manufacturer's protocol before RNA isolation and library preparation. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, 74104) following the manufacturer's protocol, and libraries were prepared using the stranded mRNA prep kit (Illumina, 20040532). The IDT for Illumina Indices (Illumina, 20027213) was used for sequence barcoding, and sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 2000 using the appropriate flow cell attachment. RNA-seq data were trimmed with cutadapt 3.4 and aligned using STAR aligner 2.7.6a to the human genome (Gencode, hg38)64. From the STAR aligner output BAM files, subread featureCounts was used to quantify the number of reads in each gene65. Differential transcript expression was calculated using Salmon66 from FASTQ files using its pseudoalignment strategy. Alternative splicing was analyzed using rMATS 4.2.0 (ref. 67). RNA-seq data were visualized using R for differential expression and IGV for read density.

At least 1 × 105 cells were pelleted for whole-cell proteomics experiments. Cell pellets were resuspended in freshly made proteomics lysis buffer (8 M urea (Life, 15505-035), 75 mM NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9759), 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15568025), 1 mM NaF (Sigma, 201154-100G), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma, S6508-10G) and 1 mM β-glycerophosphate (Sigma, G9422-10G)). The suspension was sonicated for 400 s (10 s on/30 s off cycles) and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225) following the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 20 μg of protein was reduced with 10 mM TCEP (Sigma, 4706) for 30 min, alkylated with 15 mM freshly prepared iodoacetamide (IAA; Sigma, I6125-10G) for 45 min in the dark, and then treated with 10 mM DTT for 15 min in the dark. The samples were diluted to a final volume of 400 μl with 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) to achieve a urea concentration of less than 1 M and maintain a neutral pH. For digestion, 200 ng LysC endoprotease (NEB, P8109S) and 400 ng trypsin (NEB, P8101S) were added to the samples, which were then incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 16 h. The digestion was terminated by adding formic acid (Sigma, F0507-100ML) to achieve a final concentration of 1%.

To prepare human brain tissue for proteomics, 10 mg of brain tissue was dissected and added to freshly made tissue lysis buffer (8 M urea (Life, 15505-035), 50 mM NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9759), 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15568025), 4% SDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 24730020) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore, 539134-1SET)). After a 10-min incubation on ice, the tissue was heated at 95 °C for 10 min, sonicated for 400 s (10 s on/30 s off cycles) and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225) following the manufacturer's instructions. In total, 20 μg of protein was reduced with 10 mM TCEP (Sigma, 4706) for 30 min, alkylated with 15 mM freshly prepared IAA (Sigma, I6125) for 45 min in the dark and then treated with 10 mM DTT for 15 min in the dark. The protein was purified via methanol–chloroform precipitation and solubilized in 100 mM TEAB (Sigma, T7408). For digestion, 200 ng LysC endoprotease (NEB, P8109S) and 400 ng trypsin (NEB, P8101S) were added to the samples, which were then incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 16 h. The digestion was terminated by adding formic acid (Sigma, F0507) to a final concentration of 1%.

The digested peptides for all samples were desalted using the Stage-Tip method and then analyzed by a liquid chromatography (LC)–MS/MS setup. The setup included a timsTOF Pro 2 mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) coupled to a nanoElute 2 nano-LC system (Bruker Daltonics), using a CaptiveSpray ion source. The peptides were eluted through a reversed-phase C18 column (PepSep, 25 cm × 150 µm, 1.5 µm) maintained at 50 °C over a 50 min gradient of 5–35% solvent B (acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 500 nl min−1. The peptides were analyzed using data-independent acquisition (dia) parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) mode. The isolation windows for diaPASEF were determined based on data-dependent acquisition (dda)-PASEF data68. The settings for ddaPASEF included the following: a ramp time and an accumulation time of 75 ms each, one MS scan and ten PASEF MS2 ramps per acquisition cycle. The MS survey scan covered a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio range of 100–1,700 m/z and ion mobility (1/k0) range of 0.6–1.6 V s cm−2. Precursors with up to five charges were selected, with an active exclusion time of 0.4 min. The quadrupole isolation width was set at 2 m/z for m/z values below 700 and 3 m/z for m/z values above 800, with linear interpolation for m/z values of 700–800. For diaPASEF, the isolation windows were designed to encompass the precursor distribution across the m/z-1/k0 plane as defined by the ddaPASEF data, ranging from 323.6 to 1221.6 m/z and 0.7 to 1.34 V s cm−2 in 1/k0. Each 75 ms diaPASEF scan spanned a 40 Da mass width with a 1 Da mass overlap, and the number of windows varied to cover the entire ion mobility spectrum (creating 23 windows for ten diaPASEF scan cycles)69.

The diaPASEF raw files were processed using a library-free search approach in DIA-NN (v.1.8.1)70. An in silico digestion of a UniProt reviewed Homo sapiens database (December 2022) was used to predict the spectral library. The search parameters applied included the following: tryptic digestion with up to two missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as static modification, oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. The precursor false discovery rate threshold was set at 1%. The quantification strategy for precursors was set to robust LC (high precision), and cross-run normalization was set to retention time-dependent. Match between run enabled for the protein group matrix file generated by DIA-NN, filtered at 1% false discovery rate using global q values for protein groups and global and run-specific q values for precursors, was used for downstream and statistical analysis. The statistical analysis was performed using the limma package within the R framework71. Proteomics data were visualized using R and Excel.

At least 1 × 107 cells were used for eCLIP experiments; for transdifferentiated neurons, this usually required pooling three 15-cm plates into a single pellet, whereas other cell types required no more than one 15-cm plate. Live cells were washed with 1× dPBS before cross-linking. The cells were exposed to 4,000 μJ 254 nm UV light using a UVP CL-1000 Ultraviolet Cross-linker and pooled as needed for pelleting. Cross-linked pellets were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C until the rest of the experiment was performed.

eCLIP was performed essentially as described previously30,72. Immunoprecipitation-validated antibodies (Supplementary Table 11) were reacted with M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads (Life, 11204D). Cross-linked pellets were resuspended in 1 ml 1× eCLIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) IGEPAL-CA630 (Sigma, I8896); 0.1% (vol/vol) SDS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 24730020), 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate (Sigma, D6750)) supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore, 539134-1SET). After a 5-min incubation at 4 °C, the cells were sonicated for 5 min (30 s on/30 s off cycles). Following sonication, 5 U RNase I (Life, AM2295) and 10 U DNase (Life, AM2239) were added to the lysed cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min at 1200 rpm. The RNase digestion was stopped by immediately cooling the samples to 4 °C and adding 440 U Murine RNase Inhibitor (NEB, M0314L). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifuging at 15,000g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was transferred to a new tube, and the Dynabead-conjugated antibodies were added to the cell lysate. The immunoprecipitation reaction was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rotation.

Following immunoprecipitation, 40 μl was removed from the whole reaction for the input sample, which was stored at 4 °C until gel loading. The Dynabeads were washed twice with eCLIP HSW buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% (vol/vol) IGEPAL-CA630, 0.1% (vol/vol) SDS and 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate) and three times with eCLIP NSW buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2% (vol/vol) Tween-20 and 5 mM NaCl) using a DynaMag-2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12321D) magnet. After washing, the dry beads were resuspended in 1× fast AP buffer supplemented with 3 U FastAP (Life, EF0652), 4 U DNase and 80 U Murine RNase Inhibitor. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min at 1,200 rpm. The samples were then diluted in 1× PNK7 buffer with 40 U T4 PNK (NEB, M0201L) and incubated at 37 °C for a further 20 min at 1,200 rpm. The beads were washed with HSW buffer twice and NSW buffer three times. The dry beads were resuspended in eCLIP 3′ RNA ligation buffer (1.2× RNA ligase buffer, 1.2 μM ATP, 3.6% (vol/vol) DMSO, 0.024% (vol/vol) Tween-20 and 50% (wt/vol) PEG 8000) supplemented with 72 U T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB, M0437M), 16 U Murine RNase Inhibitor and 4 μM 3′ IP RNA Adaptor sequence (/5Phos/rNrNrGrArUrArUrCrGrArArGrArUrCrGrGrArArGrArGrCrArCrArCrGrUrC/3SpC3/), and the ligation reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 75 min with rotation. Following ligation, the beads were washed with NSW buffer twice, HSW buffer thrice and NSW buffer thrice. Samples were prepared for loading by adding NSW buffer and removing 20% of the IP sample for loading onto a western blot for visualization. The remaining 80% of the IP sample was used for the remainder of the eCLIP protocol. IP and input samples were mixed with 4× NuPAGE LDS buffer and 100 mM DTT, heated to 70 °C for 10 min, magnetically separated and loaded onto 4–12% Bis–Tris gels. The samples were electrophoresed for 75 min at 150 V using the Novex XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System as described above for western blots. The RNA-containing gels were transferred using a wet transfer system to Amersham Protran Nitrocellulose Western blotting membranes (Sigma, GE10600008) for 16 h at 30 V. The regions corresponding to the molecular weight of the protein visualized on the control western blot (+75 kDa to account for RNA binding) were excised using clean razor blades and transferred to sterile tubes. RNA was released from the membrane by resuspending in eCLIP PKS buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA and 0.2% (vol/vol) SDS) supplemented with 16 U proteinase K (NEB, P8107S). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min at 1,200 rpm and then further incubated at 50 °C for 20 min at 1,200 rpm. The released RNA was further cleaned using the RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (Zymo, R1016) following the manufacturer's protocol.

The input RNA samples were treated with FastAP and T4 PNK as described for IP samples above, and the RNA was isolated using the RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit. The input sample was annealed to 1 μM 3′ Input RNA Adaptor sequence (/5Phos/rArGrArUrCrGrGrArArGrArGrCrArCrArCrGrUrC/3SpC3/) at 65 °C for 2 min, and it was then ligated using the eCLIP 3′ RNA ligase buffer conditions mentioned above. The ligated input RNA was further cleaned using MyONE Silane Beads (Life, 37002D) that were equilibrated with RLT buffer (Qiagen, 79216) supplemented with 0.025% Tween-20. The RNA sample was added to 3.0 volumes of 100% ethanol and reacted with the beads for 10 min with trituration. The beads were then magnetically separated, washed three times with 80% (vol/vol) ethanol, air-dried for 5 min and eluted with dH2O.

Input and IP RNA were then reverse transcribed to cDNA by annealing 3 μM reverse transcriptase primer mix (/5Phos/NNNNNNNNNNAGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGT/3SpC3/) at 65 °C for 2 min. The annealed RNA was added to 1× first-strand buffer with 5 mM DTT, 8 U Murine RNase Inhibitor and 120 U Superscript III Enzyme (Life, 18080044) and incubated at 55 °C for 20 min. The cDNA was incubated with 2.5 μl ExoSAP-IT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78201.1.1ML) for 15 min at 37 °C. EDTA (10 mM) was used to stop the cleanup reaction, and RNA was removed by incubating with 100 mM NaOH at 70 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 100 mM HCl. The cDNA was cleaned up using the MyONE Silane Beads as described above, but the samples were not eluted from the beads. Instead, the beads were resuspended in 0.5 μM 5′ cDNA Adaptor Sequence (CAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGA) and annealed at 70 °C for 2 min. The sample was then ligated for 16 h in eCLIP cDNA ligation buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween-20 and 7.77 (vol/vol) DMSO) with rotation. Ligated cDNAs were further incubated with fresh MyONE Silane Beads as described above. The eluted cDNA was quantified by qPCR and PCR-amplified for sequencing with Illumina adaptors. Sequencing data were analyzed using the Skipper pipeline that was previously described73, which maps sequencing peaks to the human genome (hg38) using the input sample as background. The Skipper pipeline calculated the enriched RNA-binding windows and HOMER binding motifs; enriched eCLIP binding windows were further analyzed and visualized using R or Excel.

Tissue eCLIP was performed essentially as described above except for a few changes, which are as follows: (1) mouse and human brain tissue was homogenized in 1× dPBS and plated onto 10-cm plates, (2) tissue was irradiated with two 4,000 μJ cross-linking cycles, (3) brain tissue in 1× dPBS was lysed by diluting with 5× eCLIP lysis buffer, (4) the mouse eCLIP reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) instead of the human genome and (5) cohorts of two to four mice and three human donors were used for each age group/cohort in Figs. 2 and 6, respectively.

At least 5 × 106 cells were pelleted for AP-MS. Cell pellets were resuspended in IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and 0.5% (vol/vol) IGEPAL-CA630) supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor cocktail. The cells were then sonicated for 5 min (30 s on/30 s off), and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was transferred to a new tube, and the protein content of each sample was estimated using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. Approximately 3 mg of protein was combined with Dynabead-conjugated antibodies (see above; Supplementary Table 11) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with IP lysis buffer and three times with IP wash buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl). Any residual liquid in the tube was removed, and the dried beads were submitted to the Sanford Burnham Prebys Proteomics Core for MS. The MS for each protein was averaged across sample replicates, and the log2(fold change) and −log10(P) were calculated for the proteins. Proteins corresponding to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms in various relevant pathways were highlighted in the relevant plots.

Magnetic TUBE beads (LifeSensors, UM402M) were prepared for the pulldown by combining 300 μl bead slurry per sample and washing three times with TUBE IP buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% IGEPAL-CA630) on a magnetic rack. The washed beads were resuspended in 300 μl TUBE IP buffer per sample. At least 5 × 106 cells were pelleted for the TUBE pulldown. Cells were resuspended in TUBE lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 50 mM freshly made N-ethylmaleimide, 50 mM NaF and 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate) supplemented with fresh protease inhibitor and rotated end-over-end for 15 min at 4 °C. After rotation, the cells were sonicated for 5 min (30 s on/30 s off), and the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content was estimated using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, and 3 mg of protein was combined with 300 μl of the washed magnetic TUBE beads from above. The lysate was incubated with the beads using end-over-end rotation for 18 h at 4 °C. Following this incubation, the beads were isolated using a magnetic rack and washed three times with TUBE IP buffer and then three times with IP wash buffer. The washed beads were resuspended in 100 μl (50 mM) Tris (pH 8). The peptides were reduced and digested using TCEP, IAA, DTT, trypsin and LysC as described above in the ‘Proteomics' section. The proteases were neutralized with 1% formic acid. MS was performed essentially as described above in the ‘Proteomics' section with one modification—the samples were searched using a diglycine remnant-containing peptide library provided by Eric Fischer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute).

For Ribo-seq, we simultaneously generated footprinting and bulk RNA-seq samples so that they were processed in the same manner. Samples were collected as previously described74. Briefly, cells were cultured in 15 cm plates. Cells were treated with 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide for 1 min at 37 °C followed by two washes with ice-cold 1× dPBS supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide. Ribo-seq lysis buffer (12.5 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 7.5 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide, 1 mM DTT, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and 20 U ml DNase) was added to the washed cells, which were then collected and centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C.

The cell lysate was treated with 250 U RNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2295) at 25 °C for 45 min. The RNase digestion was halted by adding 200 U SUPERase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2694) and transferring to 4 °C. Samples were loaded onto a sucrose gradient (34% sucrose, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide) and centrifuged for 1 h at 300,000g in a TLA-110 rotor (Beckman Coulter, 366735) at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the polysome pellet was resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's protocol by chloroform-based separation. Ten micrograms of total RNA was used for the extraction of 28–34-nucleotide mRNA fragments that were resolved with a 15% UREA-TBE gel for ribosomal footprints. Ribo-seq libraries were then processed as described74,75.

Corresponding samples were grown in parallel for RNA-seq in six-well plates and treated as described previously75. For RNA-seq, cells were collected with Tri-Reagent (Ambion, AM9738) for RNA extraction and used for polyA selection with Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Purification Kit (Invitrogen, 61012). Then, additional DNA degradation and 3′ mRNA resolution and phosphorylation were carried out by DNaseI and 3′ dephosphorylation using FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EF0651) and T4 PNK (NEB, M0201S), followed by 3′ adaptor ligation using T4 ligase (NEB, M0437M). The products were used for reverse transcription with SuperScript III (Invitrogen, 18080093) for first-strand cDNA synthesis. The cDNA products were 3′ ligated with a second adaptor using T4 ligase and amplification with 8–12 cycles of PCR for final library products of 200–300 bp.

Sequencing reads for Ribo-seq and corresponding RNA-seq samples were aligned as previously described76. In brief, linker (CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT) and poly(A) sequences were removed, and the remaining reads were aligned to rRNA. Unaligned reads were used for the alignment to the GRCh38 human sequence. Alignment was performed using Bowtie (v.1.1.229) with a maximum of two mismatches per read. Reads that were not aligned to the genome were aligned to sequences that spanned splice junctions. The aligned position on the genome was determined as the 5′ position of RNA-seq reads. For Ribo-seq reads, the ribosome P site was calculated using the 5′ end of the reads of the canonical ORFs with +12 for reads that were 28–29 bp and +13 for reads that were 30–33 bp.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes, and experiments were generally not anonymized or randomized during analysis. Outlier data points were only excluded if they tested as a significant outlier using Grubb's test. For simple statistical comparisons, a two-tailed Welch's t test (that is, a t test assuming a normal distribution but with unequal variances) was performed in most cases, and the degrees of freedom for significance scoring were approximated using Satterthwaite's correction. We did not confirm normal distributions for each data distribution, but all individual data points are plotted for every experiment. Certain data analysis pipelines (for example, clusterprofiler for KEGG term enrichment or RMATs for splicing analysis) have their own statistical calculations built into the software, and although we note which test was used, the original work will provide greater detail about the statistical power of their calculations. For imaging data and blots, we performed each experiment at least in triplicate; certain imaging experiments (for example, Map2/Tubβ3/G3BP1 staining) were performed over ten times, and we observed strong reproducibility across many different biological and technical replicates. The figures shown in the manuscript are a representative sample of each experiment (Figs. 1b,c,e,f, 2a,c,j, 3b,c, 4a–c,h, 5a,c and 6d).

The New York Times published a new report last Friday that claimed Elon Musk has been using illicit drugs, which led to speculation about why he looked so spaced out during his “farewell” press conference at the Oval Office. But the billionaire spent the weekend denying that he uses drugs, going so far as to insist the newspaper was “lying their ass off.”

The denials started in a rather jokey way after a Musk fan account named Whole Mars Catalog tweeted, “Given Elon Musk's business track record, any drugs he's taking should be put in the public's drinking water.”

Musk replied with a crying-laughing emoji and “100” before getting into his denial: “Also, to be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off. I tried *prescription* ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then.”

The Whole Mars Catalog replied: “nothing wrong with being a little horsey every once in a while.” Ketamine is often used as a veterinary anesthetic, especially for horses. Aside from ketamine, the report from the New York Times claimed Musk has been using Ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and the prescription medication Adderall.

The Wall Street Journal was the first major newspaper to publish an extensive report on Musk's alleged drug use back in Jan. 2024. The crux of the story was that many people who worked with Musk were worried that his alleged drug use could hamper his ability to successfully run his companies. Aside from the Ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, Adderall, and ketamine, the Journal's reporting also included allegations that he used cocaine and LSD.

Musk smoked cannabis on Joe Rogan's podcast in 2018, though that was before Rogan's podcast moved to Texas. Recreational use of marijuana has been legal in California, where that episode was filmed, since 2016. However, drug use is still prohibited for people to acquire high-level security clearances, which Musk holds as a federal contractor through SpaceX.

One of the new allegations from the New York Times reporting is that Musk has received “advance warning” of drugs tests required to keep his security clearance, citing “people close to the process.” The newspaper didn't further elaborate on how Musk would learn about the timing of supposedly random drug tests. NASA issued a statement in 2024 saying the agency “does not have evidence of non-compliance from SpaceX on how the company addresses the drug- and alcohol-free workforce regulations.”

It was Musk's alleged use of ketamine that has received the most attention on social media, especially after the Journal report came out. And the new report from the New York Times on Friday claims Musk has experienced bladder issues from using the drug. The 53-year-old has used ketamine “often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to the Times.

Musk made a rather bizarre appearance at the White House on Friday, appearing with a black eye that he claimed was caused by his 5-year-old son. Musk apparently told the boy, nicknamed X, to punch him in the face. The Tesla CEO also rolled his head around and appeared to gaze into the distance at odd intervals as Trump was speaking.

Musk has previously said that he was prescribed ketamine for depression, but on Saturday he denied using it at all in recent years. “I'm not on ketamine ffs,” Musk wrote over the weekend in response to social media speculation he may have been using the drug recently when he was filmed playing with silverware at a dinner with President Trump.

The Whole Mars Catalog's joke about having “a little horsey every once in a while” probably best summarizes the relaxed attitude most Americans have about drug use in the 2020s by private individuals. But the potential hypocrisy seems to be the bigger issue.

Musk's work for President Donald Trump has been centered around supposedly rooting out fraud in the federal government. But the billionaire is a federal contractor who's now been accused of somehow getting around drug tests. And Trump is the guy who complains that immigrants and “drug dealers” are flooding into the U.S. and harming Americans. If Trump's right-hand man is using illegal drugs—substances that would otherwise get the average person into trouble—normal people are going to see that as terribly hypocritical.

Musk has also complained about how other people treat mental illness with medications, writing as recently as Friday, “Overprescription of psychiatric drugs is a real problem.” The SpaceX CEO wrote in a tweet last year, “We're definitely oversubscribing drugs to kids,” apparently intending to write “overprescribing.” 

Gizmodo reached out to Musk's companies X and Tesla for comment but did not receive a response. We'll update this post if we hear back.

Still winds up 35% faster than the RX 7600 XT.

AMD's RX 9060 XT 16GB appears to lag behind Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti in leaked review benchmarks from Eteknix. Despite the video being quickly removed due to an embargo breach, a Reddit user, via VideoCardz, managed to capture several snapshots, unraveling the most important metrics. While these thorough and detailed performance charts appear to be authentic, we suggest you wait for official reviews.

The RX 9060 XT is AMD's direct response to Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti family, similarly fragmented into 8GB and 16GB flavors, coming in at $299 and $349, respectively. Based on AMD's internal performance evaluations, the RX 9060 XT 16GB is poised to deliver 6% better performance than the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, at 1440p Ultra. Aside from pricing, this isn't an entirely fair comparison, as we're aware how an 8GB framebuffer can cripple performance in VRAM-intensive titles.

Based on the shared slides, the reviewer has compiled a comprehensive list of numerous GPUs, presenting their performance data at both 1080p (shared by VideoCardz) and 1440p (shared on Reddit) resolutions. Across an average of 10 games at 1080p, the RX 9060 XT reportedly delivers 187 FPS, falling 3% behind the RTX 5060 Ti at 194 FPS. It does reach parity with the RX 7700 XT (186 FPS), while beating its direct predecessor, the RX 7600 XT 16GB, by 35%.

Moving over to 1440p, the RX 9060 XT drops to 134 FPS, now 5% short of the RTX 5060 Ti at 142 FPS and 3% slower than the RX 7700 XT at 139 FPS. Nonetheless, it still manages to maintain its 35% lead over the RX 7600 XT. This is an impressive showdown by AMD, but we'll hold off on price-to-performance comparisons until we're certain AMD can supply these GPUs in ample quantities at their stated MSRP, something the RTX 5060 series struggles with.

On a theoretical basis, AMD's option is 20% more affordable, while only sacrificing approximately 5% of the performance. While AMD has made ground with FSR 4, Nvidia still reigns supreme in terms of software, with its comprehensive CUDA platform, and other exclusives like RTX VSR (Video Super Resolution), HDR, Multi Frame Generation, Smooth Motion, among others. This adds to the inherent value Nvidia offers, as AMD still lacks alternatives for most of these features.

A quick check at Best Buy shows most RTX 5060 Ti 16GB models are currently selling around the $500 mark, so AMD has a lot of flexibility and headroom if it can ensure a consistent supply at launch and in the weeks to come.

The amount of photos, videos and files that we have on our devices makes traditional storage options obsolete. If you have a hard drive that has 2, 3, 4, or even 5TB of space, it is almost useless when a single vacation's worth of high-res photos and video can take up ample space. That's why smart people are looking for big, reliable external drives, and what better time to upgrade to an external drive?

Seagate's long history of reliability and durability makes them a great brand to go with: Amazon has the Seagate expansion 22TB external hard drive at a record low (and all time low) price now of $249, over 50% off of the launch price of $599. Both 20TB and 24TB are way more expensive, make sure you get the 22TB before it's gone.

See at Amazon

Why take someone's word when here is a drive that could last a lifetime? The Seagate Expansion 22TB is a “long term investment” in your digital life. If you're a creative professional or just someone who wants to keep every precious memory safe, this drive could last you years of content. Add to that Seagate's reputation for reliability means, you can rest assured that your data will be safe and secure for ages. In comparison to cloud storage, which will run a minimum of $10 a month (and often much higher for larger capacities), this one-time payment option is a bargain.

The process of opening the box to setup the Seagate 22TB HDD is fantastically easy: The drive is designed to be very simple to use and you just plug in the included power adapter and USB 3.0 cable and you are all set. USB 3.0 has the added benefit of helping to move files quickly and efficiently with minimal time wasted for large files. Also, it will seamlessly work on either your Windows computer or Mac.

What we really liked about this drive is the included Rescue Data Recovery Services. Accidents can happen to anyone, and when they do, having a safety net can be critical. Seagate's data recovery service takes the worry out of it by knowing if something goes wrong, experts could recover your files. Unfortunately, many external drives don't offer you any data recovery protection, so this is a real plus for Seagate.

Since Seagate Expansion 22TB is a desktop-type external hard, it works perfectly in a home office, home studio space, and to help anyone centralize their digital file storage. The 3.5-inch size will also provide better performance and reliability than the small-portable external options. Plus, the shape and size of this product looks really nice and easy to manage.

If you were going to upgrade your method of backup and storage options, now is the time to do so.

The future of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is looking bright. Scientists have just reported the first in-human recording from a novel wireless BCI device that could possibly help people with stroke communicate independently again.

Researchers at the University of Michigan performed the feat on May 14, using the Connexus BCI device developed by the company Paradromics. The device was temporarily implanted into the brain of a person living with epilepsy. Paradromics is now planning to conduct clinical trials of the device later this year.

The U-M research team, led by neurosurgeon Matthew Willsey, is working on a project to better understand how epilepsy affects the brain's signaling. They partnered with Paradromics, one of several companies vying to pioneer the next generation of BCI technology (a list that also includes Elon Musk's Neuralink), to use its experimental Connexus device.

Chinese Brain Implant Project Set to Overtake Musk's Neuralink

According to Willsey, the device offers several advantages over existing BCI systems. For instance, it's tiny (no smaller than a dime) yet contains over 400 microelectrodes that act as sensors, allowing the researchers to capture plenty of information from the brain. For context, the team has previously worked with BCI devices only outfitted with around 100 sensors.

The Connexus is designed to send this information to a transceiver implanted in the chest, but unlike most existing BCI implants, it would also allow users to operate compatible computer devices without physical attachments. This also means that the device should be fully implantable, ideally providing its users more freedom.

“I'm excited that the system itself has the potential to be a high-capacity recording system that could one day expand the functionality of present-day BCIs,” Willsey told Gizmodo. “Furthermore, the system implanted in the body communicates wirelessly with the system outside the body so that there are no wires that run through the skin.”

The team implanted the Connexus in a volunteer already set to receive a temporal lobectomy, a surgery that removes parts of the brain causing chronic seizures. It was then safely removed fully intact less than 20 minutes later, though not before it had recorded signals from the patient's brain. The researchers are still analyzing this data, but they're certainly optimistic about the device's future.

“This could lead to its eventual use as a high-performance BCI and could also lead to downstream clinical trials,” Willsey said.

Paradromics announced in March that the first of these trials is expected to occur in late 2025, provided they receive the go-ahead from regulators. The company plans to initially test whether the Connexus can restore communication through digital devices in people with speech impairment caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, or severe spinal cord injuries. They're hoping that the device can have applications for mental health or chronic pain as well.

The U-M team is also working with other BCI devices that look to go beyond the limitations of current technology. In January, for instance, they published research showing how their high-performance BCI device allowed a paralyzed man to fly a virtual drone with only his thoughts, and with much greater accuracy than other, non-invasive systems. With any luck, these devices, while still experimental, will someday provide many people a new lease on life.

Elon Musk on Sunday announced that a new version of X's direct messaging (DM) feature, XChat, was rolling out with support for features like vanishing messages, encryption, and the ability to share files, alongside its audio and video calling support.

The new features aren't yet broadly available, as XChat only recently started beta testing among a select group of users. However, Musk said that the X team expects to bring XChat to all users sometime this week, unless they encounter scaling issues during the rollout.

In a series of X posts, Musk also noted that the updated version of XChat has been built on Rust with “Bitcoin-style” encryption and a “whole new architecture.” It's not clear what he means by Bitcoin-style encryption, given that Bitcoin itself cannot be described as “encrypted.” (Bitcoin uses public key cryptography and signatures for its security.)

As a result, some are debating whether Musk is using the terminology simply as marketing speak, if he misunderstands encryption, or if he used the wrong word — perhaps meaning to say “cryptography” instead.

The X owner has often spoken of wanting to make X's DMs a challenger to encrypted platforms like Signal and iMessage. However, calling XChat a service with only “Bitcoin-style encryption” calls into question whether it's really a potential competitor.

In addition, Musk shared on X that XChat users can now make audio and video calls without a phone number across all platforms.

Ahead of this launch, X said it was pausing work on encrypted DMs, presumably because XChat would soon replace the older system. 

Unfortunately for X users, the service has faced some significant instability over the past week or so, as multiple outages left users unable to browse timelines and use other features, including XChat.

I love a rugged device. Not because I have a use for one—I live in New York, and the “elements” are usually more psychologically harrowing than physical—but damn, sometimes I'm a sucker for a stunt, and knowing I'll have tunes when the apocalypse strikes ain't bad either. Anker is here to scratch that baser, stunt-loving, disaster-fearing itch in my brain with what it's calling an “industry-first” Bluetooth speaker that plays just fine while floating in all types of water.

The Soundcore Boom 3i outdoor speaker is the latest in Anker's Boom series of outdoor speakers and offers a few headlining perks. One, as I mentioned before, is that this thing can float. According to Anker, the Soundcore Boom 3i: “Stays upright and sound-forward, even in waves. No distortion, no sinking—just loud, clear audio for kayaking, pool parties, and every water adventure.” That's not really a technical feat necessarily; the weight is just distributed in such a way that the actual speakers stay pointed away from the watery depths. Still, it's a nice flourish if you plan on throwing this thing into a lake or a big pool, or if you're feeling a little wacky, the ocean.

Speaking of ocean water, the Boom 3i is also apparently a lot more durable on that front compared to competitors. Anker says, thanks in part to a coating on the outside of the speaker, the Boom 3i can withstand exposure to salt water much longer than competitors. Specifically, Anker says the Boom 3i will stay “corrosion-free” for up to two years, while “other” speakers may start to degrade in five months. Outside of its emphasis on floatability, the Boom 3i also has some solid drop resistance and can withstand drops onto concrete of up to 1 meter (3.28 feet), can be submerged 1.5 meters deep in water for up to 30 minutes, and has an IP68 dust resistance as well.

Outside of its durability, the Boom 3i also has 50W of sound, which equates to 98dB of volume and 16 hours of audio playback. That should be plenty of battery and loudness if you're using this thing at a lake party or somewhere out in the open for a party. Adding to its apocalypse-weathering vibes is also an emergency alarm for if you're ever in trouble that emits a noise that's “roughly as loud as a motorcycle” to signal you need help. Similarly, there's a voice amplifier that lets you broadcast a message out loud and a “Buzz Clean” feature that vibrates the speaker with sound to clean off sand and dust. Given all of that rugged, apocalypse-defying goodness, the Boom 3i won't come cheap, retailing at $189, but if you're looking for something that can save your ass when Waterworld hits, then it might be worth every penny.

For over a decade, researchers have suggested a high possibility of our Milky Way galaxy smashing into neighboring galaxy Andromeda around 5 billion years from now. The collision would merge the two galaxies into a single (very creatively named) “Milkomeda”—but new research now indicates that this is less likely than previously assumed.

Integrating new data from the Gaia and Hubble telescopes, an international team of researchers has simulated our galaxy's movement for the next 10 billion years. The computer model also makes use of new mass estimates for other galaxies within the Local Group—a galactic group that hosts the Milky Way and Andromeda, among others. Ultimately, the simulation indicates that there is only about a 50% probability that the two galaxies will collide in the next 10 billion years, bolstering similar results from previous studies.

“Here we consider the latest and most accurate observations by the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes, along with recent consensus mass estimates, to derive possible future scenarios and identify the main sources of uncertainty in the evolution of the Local Group over the next 10 billion years,” the researchers, including experts from the University of Helsinki and Durham University, wrote in the study. “We found that uncertainties in the present positions, motions and masses of all galaxies leave room for drastically different outcomes and a probability of close to 50% that there will be no Milky Way–Andromeda merger during the next 10 billion years.”

Just as planets exert gravitational forces on each other, galaxies also impact their galactic neighbors. Specifically, Andromeda, the Triangulum galaxy, and the Large Magellanic Cloud (a galaxy orbiting the Milky Way) influence the Milky Way's path. According to the researchers, previous analyses that calculated higher chances likely didn't factor in the gravitational pull of the Large Magellanic Cloud. “The orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud runs perpendicular to the Milky Way–Andromeda orbit and makes their merger less probable,” they explained.

Their simulation also accounted for uncertainties, another factor that could have lowered the probability. Still, the team highlights the fact that even with the newest information, there are still a number of unknowns that make it difficult to determine exactly how the Milky Way and Andromeda will move, although more data from the Gaia telescope could continue to refine their predictions.

While “Milkomeda” might never come to life, the researchers did find another highly likely collision almost certainly slated for sometime in the next two billion years: a Milky Way–Large Magellanic Cloud merger (I don't even want to know what they'd call the resulting galaxy).

Nevertheless, “the fate of our Galaxy is still completely open,” they concluded.

Power bank deals are not rare, especially when new models and brands come out but every so often a deal comes along that really catches your eye. That's what's happening right now with this Anker 30W 10,000mAh portable charger. This isn't just another price reduction: this is a record low for one of the most highly-rated power banks in its class, and it's only available for a limited time as part of a special Amazon flash sale.

The Anker 10,000mAh 30W power bank is discounted to just $12, which is a full 50% off its normal $25 price tag. For comparison, historical sale prices have dipped as low as $17, but this is the all-time lowest price for this particular model. Amazon is running a flash sale and if you scroll down the listing, you'll notice a bar showing exactly how many units are remaining in stock.

The revolutionary 30W quick charging delivers double the energy of standard 5V/3A chargers. That means it's possible to charge an iPhone 16 Pro Max to 50% in just 27 minutes which is half the time it would take with a standard power bank. The 10,000mAh capacity portable is perfect for traveling and gives up to two full charges for an iPhone 15, nearly two charges for a Samsung S24, and up to ten charges for AirPods Pro 2.

The 5.4-inch USB-C cable that's supplied is tested to withstand over 10,000 bends so it's durable enough for everyday use and travel. The power bank itself is also portable and compact and slips into a pocket or bag without adding any extra bulk. Bi-directional fast charging also means that you can charge the power bank itself in no time with up to 30W output and 20W input, so you're never left without your devices for long.

Compatibility is nearly universal, supporting everything from recent iPhones and iPads through Galaxy phones, MacBooks, Nintendo Switch, and Steam Deck. The box includes the power bank, the built-in USB-C cable, an 18-month warranty, and access to Anker's excellent customer support. With over 10,625 reviews and a very solid 4.6 out of 5-star rating, it's clear that this model is a user favorite.

Don't hesitate and order yours before they sell out and start experiencing fast charging on the go.

Don't be so excited for that new Nintendo Switch 2 landing on your doorstep June 5 that you tear into that big red box like a rabid kid on Christmas morning. Nintendo's new handheld has one caveat that you should look out for on launch, namely the screen protector. If you're used to taking the thin plastic film off your new devices' screens, Nintendo suggests you ignore your first impulse and leave that layer right where it is.

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Walmart

Nintendo published its instruction manual for the Switch 2 on Sunday. Those who merely scanned over the document may not have spotted a small note under the “Careful Usage” section about the display. “The screen is covered with a film layer designed to prevent fragments scattering in the event of damage. Do not peel it off,” reads the manual.

This layer likely won't prevent scratching or chipping. It simply keeps the screen from busting apart and scattering glass shards everywhere. This is likely similar to the same preinstalled plastic layer found on the Nintendo Switch OLED. It's attached with a kind of adhesive, so removing it with any haste can damage or mar the glass screen underneath. You may be able to remove it with ginger hands so you can install your own screen protector, but your better option is to apply a separate layer of screen protection on top of what's already there.

Nintendo sells its own Switch 2 carrying case and screen protector bundle, but if you want to save money on launch day, you can find other protectors from brands like Hori, NEXT, and PowerA. You can also look at companies like Dbrand which sells a 2-pack Prism 2.0 screen protector for $35 alongside the new Switch 2 Killswitch case. We won't have to wait long to find a laundry list of screen protectors on Amazon or elsewhere, so there will be no lack of choice. Considering how the Switch OLED tended to pick up blemishes, we suggest you treat your new handheld with care until you can find a protector.

The Switch 2's use of magnetically attached Joy-Con 2 controllers has some concerned about wear and tear, especially from the exposed pins on the handheld's main unit once both controllers are removed. Nintendo says not to swing or dangle the console from each controller. The Mario maker also mentions you shouldn't “affix stickers to the part of the Joy-Con 2 where the SL/SR buttons are located.” The company also advises that small metal objects can stick to the magnetic areas of the console and that not removing them could result in damage over time as it weakens the magnetic connection.

Don't treat your Switch 2 as your new frisbee or dog toy, and you should be alright. We'll see how well the handheld lasts over time after release. Despite the legacy of Joy-Con stick drift on the original Switch, the Switch 2 still won't use drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks. Instead, Nintendo is likely relying on a cover surrounding each stick to keep out dust and preserve the stick mechanism for longer. Gulikit—the company that first launched Hall effect Joy-Con stick replacements for the original Switch—previously told Gizmodo it's working on new modules for the Switch 2.

NVLink or PCIe-based ConnectX-8 SuperNICs?

Following the export ban of its H20 chips to China, Nvidia is reportedly designing a Blackwell-based alternative dubbed B30 with multi-GPU scaling capabilities, according to The Information. Multiple leaks have reported different names for this accelerator, shifting from the RTX Pro 6000D to B40, and now B30, possibly indicating different variants within the forthcoming BXX family.

The Information claims that Nvidia's future B30 solutions will support connecting multiple GPUs for scaling. It's important to note these accelerators are reportedly built using GDDR7 memory, employing GB20X silicon — the same chips that power consumer-grade RTX 50 GPUs. While many believe this 'multi-GPU scaling' capability refers to NVLink, Nvidia has excluded NVLink support from its consumer-grade GPU dies since the last generation.

The company introduced RTX Pro Blackwell servers at Computex, which employ up to eight RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, connected via ConnectX-8 SuperNICs with built-in PCIe 6.0 switches for GPU-to-GPU communication. This configuration also applies when connecting two DGX Spark superchips together, and that's likely what we'll see with the B30 as well. It is theoretically possible that Nvidia has modified existing GB202 chips, the ones you find on an RTX 5090, and enabled NVLink support.

When asked regarding the H20 ban, Jensen explicitly stated that Nvidia would not create further alternatives based on Hopper, indicating a shift to the Blackwell architecture for future China-bound chips. The U.S. government specifically targeted the H20's memory bandwidth and interconnect bandwidth, deeming it too high for unrestricted export. The rationale was that these AI accelerators can be used to build supercomputers in China for military applications.

Nvidia has long been engaged in a regulatory whack-a-mole with the U.S. government, concerning the export of its high-performance AI accelerators to China. These export control policies have also impacted competitors, such as AMD, which recently reported potential losses of up to $800 million following the ban on its MI308 chips.

Citing these policies as "a failure", Jensen Huang highlighted how the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge if Chinese rivals like Huawei are forced to innovate and design hardware that can compete against Nvidia, and possibly even define future global standards.

Data-labeling startup Scale AI has hired the team behind Pesto AI, which helps companies recruit developers remotely, according to a blog post by one of Pesto's founders.

Founded in 2017 by Ayush Jaiswal and Indian food delivery platform Swiggy's co-founder Rahul Jaimini, Pesto AI is backed by the likes of Product Hunt's Ryan Hoover and Gumroad's Sahil Lavingia. According to Crunchbase, it has raised more than $8 million in funding.

Pesto will be shutting down its operations. According to its LinkedIn page, Pesto had 71 employees, but it's not clear how many of those are joining Scale AI.

“Earlier this year, I made the exciting decision to join Scale. This move marks the next chapter in a journey I've been deeply passionate about for years—exploring how we can harness the power of AI to create meaningful opportunities for people around the world,” Jaiswal, whose LinkedIn profile says he now is the head of growth at Scale, wrote in the blog post.

Previous reporting about Pesto suggests the startup was also involved in educating developers during its early years.

Scale AI did not immediately return requests for comment.

And the certainty that these SoCs will pack 18 Oryon V3 cores continues to grow.

A seasoned tech tipster has stated that Qualcomm is testing Snapdragon X2 Elite devices in configurations with 64GB of RAM. Roland Quandt, best known for his exclusives published via Germany's WinFuture.de, stated this weekend that the “SC8480XP aka SD X2 Elite [is] in testing with 64GB RAM.” He is also more convinced than ever that this upcoming Oryon V3 CPU architecture chip will come packing 18 cores.

PC enthusiasts are hopeful that Qualcomm has learnt some lessons from its initial Snapdragon X Elite venture. It had a lot of help from Microsoft to spearhead Copilot PCs using the first Oryon architecture processors last June. However, interest in them fell sharply as AMD and Intel responded rather swiftly with their own power-sipping but potent AI/NPU-enhanced laptop processors.

The last time we heard murmurings about the touted SC8480XP was back in March. At the time, we highlighted that 18 cores would increase the CPU core count by 50% vs the first-gen Snapdragon X Elite. Moreover, the newer architecture is expected to deliver its own performance boost.

Rumors also point to the Snapdragon X2 Elite looking to push into the desktop side of the market, or even servers. This notion comes from chatter about Qualcomm testing chips like the SC8480XP with advanced cooling solutions, including a 120mm radiator toting AiO. That would mark quite an intergenerational change.

Moving on to other SoC specs, like onboard RAM, the last we heard, the SC8480XP was being tested in Qualcomm SiP (system in package) format with 48GB RAM on board, as well as a 1TB SSD storage on board. Now it looks like options with up to 64GB of RAM on board may be offered.

Quandt was at Computex 2025 and kept a keen eye on Qualcomm developments during the show. If his leaked info didn't come via a Qualcomm contact, perhaps a device partner talked about upcoming SC8480XP configurations behind closed doors somewhere in Taipei. Whatever the source, please add a touch of salt to these leaks until we hear directly from Qualcomm or a device partner.

Since we've sailed by Computex without any official Snapdragon X2 Elite, or what might be called Snapdragon X2 Ultra Premium, news, we are most likely looking at the Snapdragon Summit 2025, in September, for Qualcomm to take the wraps off its next-gen processors. We will also hopefully see designs that Qualcomm's partners have come up with to sell these Windows-on-Arm devices to us.

It's not totally clear what Laura Loomer, the 32-year-old conspiracy monger and right-wing media personality, means to President Donald Trump. She really, really doesn't like it when people call her an influencer or an adviser to the president, and, technically, she's not a lobbyist—although that's becoming increasingly complicated within Trumpworld. Loomer is also not officially employed by the White House or the federal government.

Whatever she is, Trump's advisers have officially grown tired of her. And they hope that Trump may soon too.

But on a sunny California day in May, Loomer had just cemented herself as the influencer in Trump 2.0, with the ultimate feather in her cap to prove it.

Just shy of a month after Loomer met with Trump in the Oval Office and successfully advocated for the firings of six National Security Council officials, Loomer had finally gotten what she really wanted: Mike Waltz was removed from his post as national security adviser. At the meeting, she had also urged Trump to fire the National Security Agency (NSA) director and head of the US Cyber Command, four-star General Timothy Haugh—which the president did, not long after the NSC purge. (Waltz, Hough, and the NSC officials did not reply to requests for comment.)

Loomer had already told the president that she thought the officials and Waltz were allegedly disloyal. In a phone call with WIRED, Loomer was adamant that Waltz's appearance in a 2016 ad about veterans opposing Trump was grounds for his departure. Both in private and in front of her more than 1.6 million followers on X, Loomer had been waging a holy war against Waltz for hiring, she alleged, “individuals who have a history of anti-Trump remarks and anti-Trump associations.” Though it took a few extra weeks after her meeting with Trump for it to finally happen, Loomer said she had successfully convinced the president—who considers her “terrific” and “very special,” in his own words—to cut loose one of the most important officials in geopolitics.

A number of Trump's advisers tell WIRED that while they have seen a certain utility in Loomer, even if they find her tiresome and off-putting, their mutually beneficial arrangements may be coming to an end. With her role in the Waltz departure and her recent critiques of the Qatari government's mega jet gift, senior Republicans who interact with Trump tell WIRED, she's flying awfully close to the sun. As much as these sources, who requested anonymity to avoid incurring Loomer's wrath, believe that Loomer is reaching the end of her rope as far as her influence with the president goes, they're still aware that she possesses enough power to potentially destroy their careers with a single tweet or blog post.

Until recently, Loomer had established a role as something of a digital directed-energy weapon. The White House would keep her at a distance, but also let her rip when it was convenient for certain factions within the West Wing. Internal discontent with Waltz, in this case, was one of those instances. “She overestimates and overstates her influence,” an administration source with knowledge of the Waltz discussions told WIRED at the time of the firing, “but that doesn't mean her takes aren't ever appreciated from time to time.” (The White House did not answer questions from WIRED about Loomer's role in personnel decisions. A source close to Trump tells WIRED that “Laura Loomer plays no role in the administration.”)

The Trump superfan and MAGA version of a gonzo content creator had gone from gadfly status to something approaching a real player in just under two years, but her ascent was particularly rapid upon Trump's return to office. Loomer, whether Trump's advisers liked it or not, couldn't be squelched. The MAGA embodiment of Arnold Schwarzenegger's “I'll be back,” Loomer had frustrated campaign advisers to such an extent that they tried, and mostly failed, to keep her at arm's length during both the 2024 GOP primary and general elections, and she wasn't officially hired by the campaign despite repeated requests. (When asked by WIRED what those roles were, Loomer said that the jobs were in opposition research, vetting personnel, and “assisting with Panama.”)

Loomer has emerged as one of the most important voices in Trump's ear, meeting him at his Mar-a-Lago club and speaking to him on the phone with some degree of frequency, after years spent on the fringes of the far-right conspiracy internet. Loomer rose to prominence by openly embracing anti-Muslim rhetoric and other extreme positions, like sharing a video on X about how 9/11 was “an inside job,” leading even the likes of GOP congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to urge Trump in mid-2023 not to hire her. Her influence has only grown since.

“Hold on, one sec. My phone is blowing up,” Loomer told WIRED minutes after the news about Waltz broke on May 1. The pings eventually subsided, and she cut to the chase about why claiming the firings as a “SCALP,” in her words, was so important. “It's not about who your friends are, whether something is morally right or morally wrong,” she said. “It has to be done. Hopefully the administration is serious about administering loyalty tests.” She's obsessed with these so-called loyalty checks: “They're not doing loyalty checks,” she tells WIRED. “You need to have loyalty to the commander in chief … You need to be loyal to President Trump.”

With an almost dystopian fervor for Trump loyalty as her guide, no target has been too small for the Trumpworld Terminator. She's gone after big fish like Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, but also takes broadsides at the spouses of lower-level nominees. In a May 4 post on her “Loomered” website titled “EXCLUSIVE: BLM-Linked Wife of Trump DOJ Nominee Raises Vetting Concerns,” Loomer attacked pro bono attorney Kristin McGough over alleged

Tens of millions of dollars in NSF grants have been slashed, and scientists fear the US is about to lose a generation of climate researchers.

The Trump administration has terminated National Science Foundation grants for more than 100 research projects related to climate change amid a widening campaign to slash federal funding for scientists and institutions studying the rising risks of a warming world.

The move will cut off what's likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars for studies that were previously approved and, in most cases, already in the works. 

Affected projects include efforts to develop cleaner fuels, measure methane emissions, improve understanding of how heat waves and sea-level rise disproportionately harm marginalized groups, and help communities transition to sustainable energy, according to an MIT Technology Review review of a GrantWatch database—a volunteer-led effort to track federal cuts to research—and a list of terminated grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) itself. 

The NSF is one of the largest sources of US funding for university research, so the cancellations will deliver a big blow to climate science and clean-energy development.

They come on top of the White House's broader efforts to cut research funding and revenue for universities and significantly raise their taxes. The administration has also strived to slash staff and budgets at federal research agencies, halt efforts to assess the physical and financial risks of climate change, and shut down labs that have monitored and analyzed the levels of greenhouse gases in the air for decades.

Broader economic anxieties and uncertainty over clean-energy subsidies are compounding industry fears.

“I don't think it takes a lot of imagination to understand where this is going,” says Daniel Schrag, co-director of the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University, which has seen greater funding cuts than any other university amid an escalating legal conflict with the administration. “I believe the Trump administration intends to zero out funding for climate science altogether.”

The NSF says it's terminating grants that aren't aligned with the agency's program goals, “including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), environmental justice, and misinformation/disinformation.”

Trump administration officials have argued that DEI considerations have contaminated US science, favoring certain groups over others and undermining the public's trust in researchers.

“Political biases have displaced the vital search for truth,” Michael Kratsios, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said to a group of NSF administrations and others last month, according to reporting in Science.

But research projects that got caught in the administration's anti-DEI filter aren't the only casualties of the cuts. The NSF has also canceled funding for work that has little obvious connections to DEI ambitions, such as research on catalysts. 

Many believe the administration's broader motivation is to  undermine the power of the university system and prevent research findings that cut against its politics. 

Trump and his officials have repeatedly argued, in public statements and executive orders, that climate fears are overblown and that burdensome environmental regulations have undermined the nation's energy security and economic growth.

“It certainly seems like a deliberate attempt to undo any science that contradicts the administration,” says Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

On May 28, a group of states including California, New York, and Illinois sued the NSF, arguing that the cuts illegally violated diversity goals and funding priorities clearly established by Congress, which controls federal spending.

A group of universities also filed a lawsuit against the NSF over its earlier decision to reduce the indirect cost rate for research, which reimburses universities for overhead expenses associated with work carried out on campuses. The plaintiffs included the California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has also lost a number of research grants.(MIT Technology Review is owned by, but editorially independent from, MIT.)

The NSF declined to comment.

GrantWatch is an effort among researchers at rOpenSci, Harvard, and other organizations to track terminations of grants issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NSF. It draws on voluntary submissions from scientists involved as well as public government information. 

A search of its database for the terms “climate change,” “clean energy,” “climate adaptation,” “environmental justice,” and “climate justice” showed that the NSF has canceled funds for 118 projects, which were supposed to receive more than $100 million in total. Searching for the word “climate” produces more than 300 research projects that were set to receive more than $230 million. (That word often indicates climate-change-related research, but in some abstracts it refers to the cultural climate.) 

Some share of those funds has already been issued to research groups. The NSF section of the database doesn't include that “outlaid” figure, but it's generally about half the amount of the original grants, according to Noam Ross, a computational researcher and executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit initiative that promotes open and reproducible science.

A search for “climate change” among the NIH projects produces another 22 studies that were terminated and were still owed nearly $50 million in grants. Many of those projects explored the mental or physical health effects of climate change and extreme weather events.

The NSF more recently released its own list of terminated projects, which mostly mirrored GrantWatch's findings and confirms the specific terminations mentioned in this story.

“These grant terminations are theft from the American people,” Ross said in an email response. “By illegally ending this research the Trump administration is wasting taxpayer dollars, gutting US leadership in science, and telling the world that the US government breaks its promises.”

Havard, the country's oldest university, has been particularly hard hit.

In April, the university sued the Trump administration over cuts to its research funding and efforts to exert control over its admissions and governance policies. The White House, in turn, has moved to eliminate all federal funds for the university, including hundreds of NSF and NIH grants. 

Daniel Nocera, a professor at Harvard who has done pioneering work on so-called artificial photosynthesis, a pathway for producing clean fuels from sunlight, said in an email that all of his grants were terminated. 

“I have no research funds,” he added.

Another terminated grant involved a collaboration between Harvard and the NSF National Center for Atmospheric  Research (NCAR), designed to update the atmospheric chemistry component of the Community Earth System Model, an open-source climate model widely used by scientists around the world.

The research was expected to “contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric chemistry in the climate system and to improve air quality predictions within the context of climate change,” according to the NSF abstract. 

“We completed most of the work and were able to bring it to a stopping point,” Daniel Jacob, a professor at Harvard listed as the principal investigator on the project, said in an email. “But it will affect the ability to study chemistry-climate interactions. And it is clearly not right to pull funding from an existing project.”

Plenty of the affected research projects do, in one way or another, grapple with issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But that's because there is ample evidence that disadvantaged communities experience higher rates of illness from energy-sector pollution, will be harder hit by the escalating effects of extreme weather and are underrepresented in scientific fields.

One of the largest terminations cut off about $4 million dollars of remaining funds for the CLIMATE Justice Initiative, a fellowship program at the University of California, Irvine designed to recruit, train and mentor a more diverse array of researchers in Earth sciences.  

The NSF decision occurred halfway into the 5-year program, halting funds for a number of fellows who were in the midst of environmental justice research efforts with community partners in Southern California. Kathleen Johnson, a professor at UC Irvine and director of the initiative, says the university is striving to find ways to fund as many participants as possible for the remainder of their fellowships.

“We need people from all parts of society who are trained in geoscience and climate science to address all these global challenges that we are facing,” she says. “The people who will be best positioned to do this work …  are the people who understand the community's needs and are able to therefore work to implement equitable solutions.”

“Diverse teams have been shown to do better science,” Johnson adds.

Numerous researchers whose grants were terminated didn't respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review or declined to comment, amid growing concerns that the Trump administration will punish scientists or institutions that criticize their policies.

The termination of existing NSF and NIH grants is just the start of the administration's plans to cut federal funding for climate and clean-energy research. 

The White House's budget proposal for the coming fiscal year seeks to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in funding across federal agencies, specifically calling out “Green New Scam funds” at the Department of Energy; “low-priority climate monitoring satellites” at NASA; “climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs” at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and “climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences” at the NSF.The administration released a more detailed NSF budget proposal on May 30th, which called for a 60% reduction in research spending and nearly zeroed out the clean energy technology program. It also proposed cutting funds by 97% for the US Global Change Research Program, which produces regular assessments of climate risks; 80% for the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a global network of ocean sensors that monitor shifting marine conditions; and 40% for NCAR, the atmospheric research center.

If Congress approves budget reductions anywhere near the levels the administration has put forward, scientists fear, it could eliminate the resources necessary to carry on long-running climate observation of oceans, forests, and the atmosphere. 

The administration also reportedly plans to end the leases on dozens of NOAA facilities, including the Global Monitoring Laboratory in Hilo, Hawaii. The lab supports the work of the nearby Mauna Loa Observatory, which has tracked atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for decades.

Even short gaps in these time-series studies, which scientists around the world rely upon, would have an enduring impact on researchers' ability to analyze and understand weather and climate trends.

“We won't know where we're going if we stop measuring what's happening,” says Jane Long, formerly the associate director of energy and environment at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. “It's devastating—there's no two ways around it.” 

Growing fears that public research funding will take an even larger hit in the coming fiscal year are forcing scientists to rethink their research plans—or to reconsider whether they want to stay in the field at all, numerous observers said.

“The amount of funding we're talking about isn't something a university can fill indefinitely, and it's not something that private philanthropy can fill for very long,” says Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. “So what we're talking about is potentially cataclysmic for climate science.”

“Basically it's a shit show,” he adds, “and how bad a shit show it is will depend a lot on what happens in the courts and Congress over the next few months.”

One climate scientist, who declined to speak on the record out of concern that the administration might punish his institution, said the declining funding is forcing researchers to shrink their scientific ambitions down to a question of “What can I do with my laptop and existing data sets?”

“If your goal was to make the United States a second-class or third-class country when it comes to science and education, you would be doing exactly what the administration is doing,” the scientist said. “People are pretty depressed, upset, and afraid.”

Given the rising challenges, Harvard's Schrag fears that the best young climate scientists will decide to shift their careers outside of the US, or move into high tech or other fields where they can make significantly more money.

“We might lose a generation of talent—and that's not going to get fixed four years from now,” he says. “The irony is that Trump is attacking the institutions and foundation of US science that literally made America great.”

A team of scientists at NYU Abu Dhabi has developed a breakthrough paper-based diagnostic device that can detect COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in under 10 minutes, without the need for sophisticated lab equipment or trained personnel. The Radially Compartmentalized Paper Chip (RCP-Chip), engineered by researchers at the Advanced Microfluidics and Microdevices Laboratory (AMMLab), offers a fast, affordable, and portable solution for on-site screening of infectious diseases.

Conceived during the early COVID-19 lockdowns, the RCP-Chip has been developed to detect even minute traces of viral genetic material using a droplet of fluid and a visible color change. It operates without electricity or special equipment, needing just a source of mild heat at around 65°C, similar to the temperature of warm water. Its compact design, engineered from a single sheet of paper, integrates miniature components such as sample ports and vents, fluidic resistors, and reaction chambers pre-loaded with primers, enzymes, and gold nanoparticles.

The research is detailed in a paper titled Single-Layer Radially Compartmentalized Paper Chip (RCP-Chip) for Rapid Isothermal Multiplex Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Gene Targets, published in the journal Advanced Sensor Research. The study reports the development and validation of the RCP-Chip as a rapid, multiplexed diagnostic platform for infectious disease detection suitable for low-resource settings.

"During the COVID-19 pandemic, our goal was to create something fast, affordable, and easy to use, especially in areas where access to lab facilities is limited," said NYUAD Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Bioengineering and senior author Mohammad A. Qasaimeh. "The RCP-Chip is designed for real-world impact. It can be reconfigured to detect other infectious diseases, making it a powerful tool for global health."

The device supports multiplex testing, meaning it can detect several gene targets in a single run. This improves efficiency while reducing sample volume and cost. Its flexible design can be adapted to detect various pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc.), across sample types such as saliva, blood, and environmental sources.

This is a fast, affordable, lab-free test that detects multiple gene targets in under 10 minutes. What makes it truly impactful is its real-world potential. This portable test could significantly improve outbreak response by enabling faster isolation, treatment, and control."

Pavithra Sukumar, NYUAD Research Assistant and co-first author of the study 

Next steps for the research team include enhancing the chip's plasmonic detection capabilities and expanding its applications for point-of-care applications. They also aim to explore smartphone connectivity for real-time data sharing and outbreak tracking, further improving its utility in public health surveillance.

This work underscores NYUAD's commitment to advancing scientific innovation that addresses global challenges, particularly in healthcare accessibility and pandemic preparedness.

As the global population ages, the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continues to rise. But the molecular mechanisms behind the deterioration of brain cells have remained elusive.

Now, a new study by University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers has found that old neurons have unique defects resulting from molecular stress that make them especially vulnerable to neurodegeneration.

Aging has been a black box for a long time. Nobody is really sure what an aged neuron looks like, how it behaves, or how it's different from a young neuron."

Gene Yeo, Ph.D., corresponding author, professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and director of the university's Center for RNA Technologies and Therapeutics and the Sanford Stem Cell Innovation Center at the Sanford Stem Cell Institute

Yeo's team created aged neurons in the lab by using a cell culture approach called transdifferentiation. This technique directly reprograms skin cells from human donors into neurons that appear old at the molecular level.

The team discovered that in comparison with young neurons, old neurons displayed hallmarks of molecular stress, such as halting growth and storing untranslated RNA and proteins in compartments called "stress granules" outside of the cell's nucleus.

The molecular stress prevented the aged neuron cells from contending with new stress events. "It's the neuronal equivalent of being so stressed that you catch a cold," said first author Kevin Rhine, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research fellow in Yeo's lab. 

The researchers also found that:

"We think that aged neurons are prioritizing other proteins and forgetting about the stress response and about RNA-binding proteins that keep everything running smoothly," said Yeo.

Neurodegenerative diseases put an enormous burden on public health. The researchers think the findings could contribute to the development of new therapies to prevent these diseases.The next step is to pinpoint the source of cellular stress in order to keep RNA in a healthy state, according to the researchers.

The study will be published in Nature Neuroscience on June 2, 2025.

Antimicrobial resistance directly causes more than 1 million deaths every year and contributes to more than 35 million more, according to the World Health Organization. Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp., 2 gram-positive pathogens highly likely to develop resistance to known treatments, can cause dangerous hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections.

This week in Microbiology Spectrum, researchers describe a newly synthesized compound called infuzide that shows activity against antimicrobial resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus in laboratory and mouse tests. In addition, the findings suggest that infuzide kills bacteria in ways that differ from other antimicrobials, which may help keep resistance at bay. 

Infuzide emerged from more than a decade of work by interdisciplinary researchers looking for ways to create compounds that could act against pathogens in ways similar to known pharmaceutical compounds. Those include hydrazones, inorganic synthesized compounds that previous studies have shown to demonstrate antibacterial activity, including against resistant strains. The researchers synthesized 17 new compounds that contained hydrazones, and among those infuzide showed activity against gram-positive S. aureus and Enterococcus.

"We started the project as a collaboration, looking for ways to synthesize compounds and connecting them with compounds that might have biological activities," said medicinal chemist Michel Baltas, Ph.D., from the Laboratoire de Chimie de Coordination at the University of Toulouse in France. Baltas co-led the new work, along with Sidharth Chopra, Ph.D., from the CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow, India. 

The researchers found that infuzide specifically attacks bacterial cells. In lab tests, they compared the antimicrobial effects of infuzide against vancomycin, a powerful antibiotic representing the standard of care in treating resistant infections. They found that infuzide more quickly and effectively reduced the size of bacterial colonies than the standard drug. In tests of resistant S. aureus infections on the skin of mice, the compound effectively reduced the bacterial population. The reduction was even higher, the researchers reported, when infuzide was combined with linezolid, a synthetic antibiotic.

Infuzide did not show significant activity against gram-negative pathogens, though Baltas said the group is looking for small changes to infuzide that might expand its antimicrobial activity.

The researchers synthesized the compounds without the need of solvents, which can be expensive and environmentally hazardous. The simplicity of the chemical reactions, Baltas said, would make it easy to make large quantities to be used in new treatments. "I am sure the same reactions can scale up." 

In addition, the group has been investigating the effects of synthesized compounds on other infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. "We have many other candidates to make antimicrobial compounds," Baltas said.

What happens inside your brain when you hear a steady rhythm or musical tone? According to a new study from Aarhus University and the University of Oxford, your brain doesn't just hear it-it reorganizes itself in real time.

Every beep, tone and new sound you hear travels from the ear to registering in your brain. But what actually happens in your brain when you listen to a continuous stream of sounds? A new study from Aarhus University and University of Oxford published in Advanced Science reveals that the brain doesn't simply register sound: it dynamically reshapes its organization in real time, orchestrating a complex interplay of brainwaves in multiple networks.

The research, led by Dr. Mattia Rosso and Associate Professor Leonardo Bonetti at the Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University, in collaboration with the University of Oxford, introduces a novel neuroimaging method called FREQ-NESS - Frequency-resolved Network Estimation via Source Separation. Using advanced algorithms, this method disentangles overlapping brain networks based on their dominant frequency. Once a network is identified by its unique frequency, the method can then trace how it propagates in space across the brain.

We're used to thinking of brainwaves like fixed stations-alpha, beta, gamma-and of brain anatomy as a set of distinct regions. But what we see with FREQ-NESS is much richer. It is long known that brain activity is organized through activity in different frequencies, tuned both internally and to the environment. Starting from this fundamental principle, we've designed a method that finds how each frequency is expressed across the brain."

Dr. Mattia Rosso, Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University

The development of FREQ-NESS represents a major advance in how scientists can investigate the brain's large-scale dynamics. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined frequency bands or regions of interest, the data-driven approach maps the whole brain's internal organization with high spectral and spatial precision. And that opens new possibilities for basic neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, and clinical diagnostics.

This study adds to a growing body of research exploring how the brain's rhythmic structure shapes everything from music cognition to general perception and attention, and altered states of consciousness.

"The brain doesn't just react: it reconfigures. And now we can see it", says Professor Leonardo Bonetti, co-author and neuroscientist at Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University, and at the Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing, University of Oxford. "This could change how we study brain responses to music and beyond, including consciousness, mind-wandering, and broader interactions with the external world."

A large-scale research program is now underway to build on this methodology, supported by an international network of neuroscientists. Due to the high reliability across experimental conditions and across datasets - FREQ-NESS might also pave the way for individualized brain mapping, explains Professor Leonardo Bonetti.

According to a recent study, in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), epileptic seizures are significantly more common than previously known. The discovery deepens understanding of the symptoms of this memory disorder and emphasises the importance of taking epileptic seizures into account in the treatment and monitoring of patients. 

Coordinated by Neurocenter Finland, this major project by the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Oulu examined the prevalence of epilepsy in patients with FTD. The research dataset is one of the largest in the world, and the results have been published in the prestigious JAMA Neurology journal. 

Epilepsy is known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, for example, but data on the on the connection between FTD and epilepsy remains scarce. The newly published study fills this information gap and shows that epilepsy is considerably more common in patients with FTD than previously estimated.

The study analyzed patient data from the university hospitals of Kuopio and Oulu from the period 2010–2021. Out of a total of 12,490 medical records, the study identified 245 patients with FTD and 1,326 patients with Alzheimer's disease. In addition to examining the prevalence of epilepsy in these patients, the prevalence was also examined in healthy controls.

Our results show that epilepsy is considerably more common among those with FTD than those with Alzheimer's disease or in healthy controls. It is noteworthy that epilepsy occurred in some patients with FTD already ten years before their dementia diagnosis, and it was more common in all the examined stages of the disease than previous international studies have reported."

Doctoral Researcher Annemari Kilpeläinen, first author of the research article and medical specialist in neurology

The prevalence of epilepsy was assessed at several time points from ten years before to five years after the dementia diagnosis. In patients with FTD, the prevalence of epilepsy increased over time, and five years after the diagnosis approximately 11% had epilepsy. In addition to epilepsy diagnoses, medications used for epilepsy were more common in patients with FTD, which strengthens the reliability of the results.

Diagnosing epilepsy in patients with FTD may be challenging as the symptoms of the disease may resemble epileptic seizures. This may lead to underdiagnosis and delays in treatment. However, untreated epilepsy can significantly worsen patients' condition.

"Identifying epilepsy is important because its treatment can improve patients' functional capacity and quality of life. Knowledge about the association between epilepsy and FTD raises new research questions: do these diseases share some pathophysiological mechanisms and could some FTD symptoms be caused by alterations in the specific electrical systems of the brain", says the project's principal investigator, Associate Professor and Director of UEF Brain Research Unit Eino Solje.

The recently published study is part of an extensive project that combines exceptionally extensive real-life patient data with different kinds of unique registers. The project involves a strong cooperation between the University of Oulu and the University of Eastern Finland as well as different fields of science, including between researchers in the fields of medicine and law. Kuopio University Hospital and Oulu University Hospital are part of the international European Reference Network EpiCARE and recognised centres in the field of epilepsy treatment and research.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Today I am going to discuss a recent paper on intensive blood pressure control in people with type 2 diabetes. This was a big study. It included over 12,000 participants who were older than age 50, and had type 2 diabetes and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease; either they'd had a prior cardiovascular event, had two or more risk factors, or had a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

The study was performed in China and it was really done to determine, potentially once and for all, what the target should be in treating patients with type 2 diabetes. The ACCORD trial tried to answer this question, but it didn't show overall improvement in outcomes with blood pressure reduction, although when they did subset analysis, they did show benefit in certain groups. It still didn't have that definitive feel, and I think this study does.

They were looking only at systolic blood pressures, and they wanted to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg in the intensively treated group; in the standardly treated group, the blood pressure target was a systolic of less than 140 mm Hg. The primary endpoint was nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI, treatment or hospitalization for heart failure, or death from cardiovascular disease causes.

In this study, 45% were women. The average age was 63.8 years. Body mass index was 26.7 and 25% smoked. The baseline blood pressure was 140/76 mm Hg and the mean blood pressure over approximately 4 years of follow-up was 121.6 mm Hg in the intensively treated group vs 133.2 mm Hg in the standard treatment group.

You basically began to see a difference between the two in terms of the primary endpoint after about a year, so you started to see this split. At the end of the study, there was a very significant difference in terms of the primary endpoint between the two groups.

I want to point out that, in my brain, those blood pressure targets that were reached are actually fairly standard. The intensively treated group was about 120 mm Hg, and that's compared with the standard treatment group, which was around 130 mm Hg.

I must say that, in my own practice, given all the changes that we've seen over the years in blood pressure targets, the results from this study have actually motivated me to lower my systolic target, at least in terms of how I treat patients in clinic, because I think they may get further benefit.

That then begs the question of how did they measure blood pressures in this study? I get patients who have what's called white coat hypertension. They come into my office, their blood pressure is higher, and then I have them test at home and it's better. 

In this study, they tried to take away some of that interference. They had patients come into clinic having had no exercise, no coffee, and no cigarettes for at least 30 minutes before their appointment. The patients had 5 minutes of seated rest, and then they had three blood pressure measurements, each done 1 minute apart. There was no talking or joking around. They just sat there and had their blood pressures measured in the appropriate way.

The average systolic blood pressure was used of those three readings to determine whether treatment was changed. They followed pretty standard treatment regimens for hypertension, which are the ones we use in our ADA guidelines for the management of hypertension.

People in the intensive group ended up on one or two additional medications compared with those in the standard group. The overall rate of severe adverse events was equivalent in both groups, but there was more symptomatic hypotension and hyperkalemia in the intensively treated group.

As I said, this has actually changed how I'm treating my patients. The difference between 120 mm Hg and 133 mm Hg isn't that big in my brain, and yet there does seem to be a difference in terms of outcomes, primarily cardiovascular outcomes, as the primary endpoint.

I think that, if a patient can tolerate a lower blood pressure without symptomatic hypotension, I am going to be treating them down to a lower target. I think this was a well-done study that actually will probably inform practice and guidelines in the future because I think it helps inform us of what is potentially the best target for our patients.

A trial of an interactive game that trains people to alter their brain waves has shown promise as a treatment for nerve pain – offering hope for a new generation of drug-free treatments.

The PainWaive technology, developed by UNSW Sydney researchers, teaches users how to regulate abnormal brain activity linked to chronic nerve pain, offering a potential in-home, non-invasive alternative to opioids.

A recent trial of the technology, led by Professor Sylvia Gustin and Dr. Negin Hesam-Shariati from UNSW Sydney's NeuroRecovery Research Hub, has delivered promising results, published in the Journal of Pain.

The study compared hundreds of measures across participants' pain and related issues like pain interference before, during and after four weeks of interactive game play. Their brain activity was tracked via EEG (electroencephalogram) headsets, with the app responding in real time to shifts in brainwave patterns.

Three out of the four participants showed significant reductions in pain, particularly nearing the end of the treatment. Overall, the pain relief achieved by the three was comparable to or greater than that offered by opioids.

Restrictions in the study's size, design and duration limit our ability to generalise the findings or rule out placebo effects.

But the results we've seen are exciting and give us confidence to move to the next stage and our larger trial."

Dr. Negin Hesam-Shariati, UNSW Sydney's NeuroRecovery Research Hub

The PainWaive project builds on UNSW Professor Sylvia Gustin's seminal research into changes in the brain's thalamus – a central relay hub in the brain – associated with nerve (neuropathic) pain.

"The brainwaves of people with neuropathic pain show a distinct pattern: more slow theta waves, fewer alpha waves, and more fast, high beta waves," Prof. Gustin says.

"We believe these changes interfere with how the thalamus talks to other parts of the brain, especially the sensory motor cortex, which registers pain."

"I wondered, can we develop a treatment that directly targets and normalises these abnormal waves?"

The challenge was taken up by an interdisciplinary team at UNSW Science and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), led by Prof. Gustin and Dr Hesam-Shariati, and resulted in PainWaive.

The four participants in its first trial received a kit with a headset and a tablet preloaded with the game app, which includes directions for its use. They were also given tips for different mental strategies, like relaxing or focusing on happy memories, to help bring their brain activity into a more "normal" state.

The user data, meanwhile, was uploaded to the research team for remote monitoring.

"After just a couple of Zoom sessions, participants were able to run the treatment entirely on their own," says Dr Hesam-Shariati.

"Participants felt empowered to manage their pain in their own environment. That's a huge part of what makes this special."

Initially, Dr Hesam-Shariati says, the team planned to use existing commercial EEG systems, but they were either too expensive or didn't meet the quality needed to deliver the project. Instead, they developed their own.

"Everything except the open-source EEG board was built in-house," says Dr Hesam-Shariati. "And soon, even that will be replaced by a custom-designed board."

Thanks to 3D printing, Prof. Gustin says, the team has cut the cost of each headset to around $300 – a fraction of the $1,000 to $20,000 price tags of existing systems.

The headset uses a saline-based wet electrode system to improve signal quality and targets the sensorimotor cortex.

"We've worked closely with patients to ensure the headset is lightweight, comfortable, and user-friendly," says Prof. Gustin.

"Owning the technology offers us the potential to one day offer PainWaive as a truly affordable, accessible solution for at-home pain management, especially for those with limited access to traditional treatments."

The researchers are now calling for participants to register their interest in two upcoming trials of the neuromodulation technology: the Spinal Pain Trial, investigating its potential to reduce chronic spinal pain, and the StoPain Trial, exploring its use in treating chronic neuropathic pain in people with a spinal cord injury.

When cancer spreads from a primary tumor to new sites throughout the body, it undergoes changes that increase its genetic complexity.

A new study from researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) provides fresh insights about how cancers evolve when they metastasize - insights that could aid in developing strategies to improve the effectiveness of treatment.

The team - led by collaborators Dr. Luc Morris, a surgeon and cancer genetics research lab director at MSK, Dr. Xi Kathy Zhou, a professor of research in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, and Dr. Chaitanya Bandlamudi, a cancer genomics researcher at MSK - examined the genomic profiles of more than 3,700 patients across 24 cancer types who had multiple tumor sites biopsied over time.

The samples were profiled using MSK's proprietary tumor sequencing test. This allowed the research team to compare the genetic profiles of an initial tumor and metastatic site from the same patient.

The team's findings, which were published June 2 in Nature Genetics, showed that tumors evolve over time, and that metastases tend to accumulate more copy-number alterations (CNAs) than mutations. This led the researchers to wonder why CNAs, but not mutations, were so commonly emerging when tumors metastasized.

Mutations are like small typos in the genetic code that can affect how a gene functions, leading to the production of abnormal proteins or the alteration of gene expression. CNAs, on the other hand, are larger scale duplications or deletions of genetic material.

One extreme form of CNA - genome doubling - turned out to be important during the process of metastasis.

"We found that whole-genome duplication - which is the doubling of the entire set of chromosomes in a cancer cell - was the most common genetic event during metastasis, occurring in nearly one-third of patients," explained study first author Dr. Karena Zhao, who conducted research at MSK while attending medical school at Weill Cornell Medical College.

As cancer cells divide and make mistakes in replicating their DNA, mutations accumulate. Some mutations help the cells grow faster, while other mutations can affect essential genes and be harmful to the cell.

Genome doubling allows cancer cells to hedge their bets, creating additional copies of genes, so that one copy can be mutated or deleted, while the other copy survives intact. This enhances the tumor cell's ability to adapt, survive, and resist treatments."

Dr. Xi Kathy Zhou, professor of research in population health sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine

Unlike CNAs, more mutations can actually make tumors more visible to the immune system. That's because the changes to their genetic sequences can make them produce abnormal proteins, which are then treated like a foreign threat by the immune system. The team found that CNAs made tumors resistant, while mutations made tumors more susceptible to immunotherapy.

"In the end, our study found that during metastasis, cancer cells tend to evolve by maximizing CNAs, while not generating too many mutations that could potentially stimulate an immune response," Dr. Bandlamudi said.

Together, the findings suggest that newer strategies, such as therapies to target genetic instability in these highly altered cells or to alter the tumor microenvironment, could be critical for creating lasting responses in metastatic cancer, the researchers said.

"Understanding these key genomic differences between primary and metastatic tumors is vital for clinical care, as biomarkers like CNAs and tumor mutational burden are increasingly used by clinicians to inform decision-making, especially around the use of immunotherapy drugs," Dr. Morris said.

Aortic valve narrowing (aortic stenosis) with concomitant cardiac amyloidosis is a severe heart disease of old age that is associated with a high risk of death. Until now, treatment has consisted of valve replacement, while the deposits in the heart muscle, known as amyloidosis, often remain untreated. An international research consortium led by MedUni Vienna and University College London has now been able to demonstrate for the first time that combined treatment consisting of heart valve replacement and specific drug therapy offers a significant survival advantage for patients. The study results have been published in the European Heart Journal.

As part of the study conducted by the research team led by Christian Nitsche (Department of Medicine II, Clinical Division of Cardiology, MedUni Vienna) and Thomas Treibel (Department of Cardiovascular Imaging, University College London), data from 226 patients with aortic stenosis and concomitant cardiac amyloidosis from ten countries were examined. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the heart valve that directs blood from the left ventricle into the bloodstream. In cardiac amyloidosis, misfolded proteins are deposited in the heart muscle. Both diseases occur in older people and often together. Until now, it was unclear whether treating amyloidosis in addition to valve surgery would benefit patients.

The analysis now published showed that both aortic valve replacement and treatment with the drug tafamidis for amyloidosis were associated with a significantly lower risk of death. The survival benefit was highest in patients who received both forms of treatment

Our results even show that patients with both conditions who received valve replacement and specific amyloidosis therapy had similar long-term survival rates to people with aortic stenosis without amyloidosis."

Christian Nitsche, study leader

Both aortic stenosis and cardiac amyloidosis impair the heart's pumping function and can lead to death if left untreated. Targeted therapy can slow the progression of amyloidosis, while valve replacement treats the mechanical stress caused by the narrowed heart valve. Around ten percent of patients with aortic stenosis also have amyloidosis, but this is often not diagnosed in everyday clinical practice. "Our findings also suggest that patients with severe aortic valve stenosis should be screened for amyloidosis so that we can offer them targeted life-prolonging treatment options," emphasises Christian Nitsche.

A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that adolescents who prefer to sleep and wake up later ("night owls") reported greater impulsivity than those who prefer to sleep and wake up earlier ("morning larks").

Results show that adolescents with self-reported evening preference, or "night owl" tendencies, reported greater negative urgency and lack of perseverance, which are two aspects of impulsivity. This means that they were more likely to act impulsively when experiencing negative emotions and quit difficult tasks. In contrast, there was no association between objectively measured circadian phase and impulsivity.

Surprisingly, we did not find a significant link between dim light melatonin onset and impulsivity in our sample. This suggests that there may be unmeasured psychological or behavioral factors influencing both impulsivity and the self-assessment of circadian preference, regardless of the timing of an individual's internal circadian clock."

Riya Mirchandaney, lead author, doctoral candidate in clinical-health psychology, University of Pittsburgh

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, circadian rhythms are internal biological rhythms that exist in all living organisms. This timekeeping system, or "body clock," is synchronized to the 24-hour, light-dark cycle. Circadian preference reflects an individual's desired timing of sleep and wake, and circadian timing can be objectively measured by analyzing saliva or blood plasma to detect dim light melatonin onset.

The study involved 210 adolescents across two studies. They had a mean age of 17 years, and 60.5% were female. Participants completed self-reported measures of impulsivity and circadian preference. Laboratory samples of saliva were taken to assess circadian phase by determining dim light melatonin onset. During a week-long protocol, participants also wore a wrist actigraph to estimate sleep midpoint and duration, and at bedtime they completed an assessment of impulsivity.

Mirchandaney emphasized that the results could influence future research to help teens avoid the negative effects of impulsivity, which is a well-established contributor to alcohol and substance use.

"Adolescence may be a prime opportunity for preventing adverse outcomes associated with impulsivity using chronotherapeutic interventions to advance sleep and circadian timing," she said.

This study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism within the National Institutes of Health. The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented June 9 during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle. SLEEP is the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.

At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.

Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.

That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.

"It all fell to me," said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.

Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom — money that went toward her medication and family needs.

But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. "For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'" he said. "I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'"

A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump.

Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.

Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.

By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.

If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.

"These things tend to roll downhill," Olenski said.

Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: "I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs."

But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.

Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.

Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.

The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.

"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly," she said.

Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.

"We can't always solve their problem," Tavares said. "But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school."

Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students — work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.

"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone," said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. "And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work."

In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.

But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're "actual people" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.

"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out," he said.

Despite strong evidence that early allergen exposure can prevent food allergies, new research shows most parents still wait.

Study: Parental Motivation for Introducing Babies' First Foods and Common Food Allergens. Image credit: shine.graphics/Shutterstock.com

A study published in the journal Nutrients aimed to understand when and why parents introduce their infants to solid foods.

Food allergy prevention in children is an important healthcare need. Current guidelines support the early introduction of allergenic foods to infants to reduce the risk. Yet parental attitudes and practices in this field are unclear.

For more than 40 years, beginning in the late 1970s, parents were advised to delay introducing non-milk foods to their babies to prevent the development of food allergies. As such, the standard of care for healthcare providers was to instruct parents to avoid giving allergenic foods to their babies until they were at least one year old.

Despite this, food allergy prevalence increased significantly over the next four decades.

This prompted the Learning Early About Peanuts (LEAP) trial by du Toit et al., which aimed to determine whether introducing peanuts early or avoiding them in infancy was more effective in preventing peanut allergy. This randomized controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of early introduction.

As a result, the guidelines were modified to reflect this evidence, recommending that parents begin feeding peanut-based products to babies by 4-6 months of age, or if that was not possible, at least as early as possible.  

The question is whether parents are aware of this change in recommendation, and at what age they introduce solid foods to their babies. The current study explored parental decisions in giving first foods and the underlying reasons for their choice.

The study sample included only parents of children with at least one diagnosed food allergy, with an average child age of 6.9 years (54.8% boys, 45.2% girls).

The study included 42 parents who filled out an online survey. Almost all were mothers, and their children were, on average, seven years old. 61.9% of the children had peanut allergy and 52.4% had tree nut allergy.

Approximately 40% of children were born before 2016; the rest were later. About half of the children encountered their first foods between 4 and 5 months, and the rest later. The first food introduced was cereal, followed by vegetables, in ~55% and ~29%, respectively.

Compared to Canadian parents, American parents were significantly more likely to introduce vegetables rather than cereals as the first food, with an adjusted odds ratio of 9.62.

Guidelines in both countries include cereals and vegetables as appropriate first foods.

So few parents introduced eggs or fruits as the first food that their responses were not analyzed in statistical models due to insufficient sample size.

Healthcare provider advice was cited as the leading factor in parental decisions about when to start first foods in 72% of cases. This was followed by peer advice in 13% of cases.

There was no statistically significant difference in the age at which allergens, such as eggs or peanuts, were first introduced between children born before or after 2016. The data suggested a possible trend, although the number of early introductions in the pre-2016 group was small, limiting statistical power.

The study shows that most parents give cereals as the first food to their infants, primarily because of recommendations from healthcare providers. Despite the presence of evidence from the LEAP report, there has not been a statistically significant shift towards earlier introduction.

Parents older than 34 were more likely to introduce first foods earlier in infancy, with an unadjusted odds ratio of 2.08, but this trend did not reach statistical significance.

The study highlighted many reasons why parents delay introducing the first foods in infancy. These include a fear of provoking an allergic reaction, insufficient parental education regarding the benefits of early food introduction, a lack of access to health services, and children's non-acceptance of new foods.

While many healthcare providers across multiple regions are aware of the change in guidelines regarding first foods in infancy, this information has not been fully translated to the general population.

Healthcare providers should, therefore, take opportunities to educate parents on the advantages of beginning first foods for their infants by 4-6 months or whenever the infant can tolerate it. They should present evidence that this practice decreases the risk of food allergies, disproving earlier recommendations that supported avoidance.

The study also evaluated factors such as caregiver education level and household income, but found no statistically significant association between these factors and the timing or type of the first food introduced.

Conclusions

Despite its limitations, the current study suggests that healthcare providers should guide parents in introducing foods to their babies early, based on evidence of its benefits in reducing the risk of food allergy.

However, the study's small sample size, reliance on caregiver memory, and predominance of mothers limit the applicability of the findings to a broader audience.

A larger sample size and more objective data would increase the value of future studies and validate these findings.

A global resolution on digital marketing of breast milk substitutes must be rigorously enforced, writes Afshan Khan, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and coordinator of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement.

Breastfeeding saves lives. It is one of the most powerful, proven investments in child survival, development and health. And yet its practice is being undermined — not by science, but by sophisticated and often misleading digital marketing.

More than half of new parents are exposed to online promotions for formula milk, often disguised as medical advice or peer support. In some countries, that figure rises to over 90 per cent.

What these aggressive campaigns for breast milk substitutes (BMS) do not tell parents is that breast milk is essential for building a child's immune system — something formula simply cannot do. They also ignore a critical risk: formula must be mixed with water, and in communities without safe water access, this often leads to illness and infection in young children.

Digital marketing campaigns are targeting parents at their most vulnerable — when they are seeking guidance, not manipulation. These tactics distort choice by drowning out trusted, evidence-based information with biased, misleading promotion.

This not only undermines public health principles and a decade of progress in breastfeeding promotion, it also puts the health and future of entire generations at risk.

These digital marketing tactics contravene a longstanding global framework. The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1981, was designed to protect families from precisely this kind of exploitation.

Yet, as a 2022 WHO and UNICEF report revealed, formula companies now spend up to 70 per cent of their marketing budgets on digital tools — from apps and virtual baby clubs to paid influencers and online forums — harvesting personal data and pushing targeted promotions in breach of the Code.

In response, WHO member states adopted a landmark resolution at the World Health Assembly in Geneva this week (26 May) to curb digital marketing of breast milk substitutes and protect parents' right to accurate, transparent information. Led by Mexico and Brazil and supported by nine country members of the UN-hosted Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, this resolution is a critical step forward.

The science on breast milk is long proven. By providing essential nutrition, strengthening immunity, and supporting cognitive development, breastfeeding can radically change the health and economic outcomes of mother and child.

Scaling up breastfeeding globally could prevent 823,000 unnecessary child deaths and 20,000 deaths from breast cancer every year. It has been linked to a 20 per cent reduction in the risk of physical and cognitive stunting.

These recognised advantages of breast milk had begun to take hold. Since 2012, rates of exclusive breastfeeding have risen from 37 per cent to nearly 48 per cent in 2021. Three quarters of these children live in low- and lower-middle-income countries, which represents important, tangible progress.

But digital platforms spreading misleading formula marketing are cutting into this progress, with inadequate breastfeeding responsible for 16 per cent of child deaths each year.

The new resolution gives countries a new framework to take action. Translating this into results will, however, require further coordinated efforts across sectors.

First, stronger enforcement is essential. Countries need robust monitoring and accountability systems to track violations and respond effectively. Vietnam offers a promising model: with support from the SUN Civil Society Alliance, it has launched the AI-powered Virtual Violations Detector, which identifies breaches of the Code in real time and alerts regulators, enabling swift action and targeted advocacy.

Another step will be to align fragmented policies across civil society and health systems. Harmful breast milk substitute marketing flourishes in disconnected systems, such as when health workers lack guidance, civil society is under-resourced, or tech platforms are unregulated. To close these gaps, governments must adopt an approach that brings all actors to the table.

Finally, it is equally important to support positive campaigns that champion breastfeeding. It is not enough to restrict harmful marketing — parents need support and encouragement to make informed decisions.

El Salvador has shown through its “Nacer con Cariño” (Born with Love) national policy how the promotion of breastfeeding can be integrated into prenatal and delivery care. Since its implementation in 2021, 69,000 babies have been born under this respectful care model and, thanks to the training of more than 1,000 breastfeeding counsellors supported by the SUN Movement, the country has far surpassed the global exclusive breastfeeding targets of 50 per cent for 2025, reaching a rate of more than 65 per cent.

Informed parents make empowered choices, and empowered choices give every child the best possible start in life.

Together with the resolution on the extension of the World Health Assembly nutrition targets, and the commitments made by countries at the Nutrition for Growth Summit in Paris earlier this year, we have a renewed mandate to act. Let's make sure we use it and ensure this resolution moves from Geneva into meaningful action and change online and on the ground.

GOAL looks at the tiers of teams in the 2025 Club World Cup, asking who might win it all and who is just happy to be here?

With the European season finally coming to a close, attention turns directly to the Club World Cup, FIFA's shiny new fun competition, soon to be played out in the U.S. summer sun.

But with 32 teams hailing from all over the world, it can be chaotic to summarize it all. How can you piece together RB Slazburg, HD Ulsan and Real Madrid? What is the through line among them? And what are the vibes to be found? Sure, there are three or four clear favorites, but outside of them, it gets a bit tricky.

And there's a good mix here, from obvious favorites to legacy clubs, to a few teams who might just be happy to be picking up a paycheck and selling a few jerseys on a summer tour.

The Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. There are 32 teams in the expanded field. And with less than two weeks until the opening kick, it's time to ask: Who's here to win it? Who's here for the money? Who's here for holiday? Who's got a lot to lose but not much to win?

GOAL US breaks it all down in the 2025 Club World Cup Tier Rankings.

From Manchester City to Real Madrid, here's how to catch every match of the 2025 Club World Cup live

Disclaimer: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

The FIFA Club World Cup is almost upon us, beginning Saturday June 14, with the finals taking place on Sunday, July 13. The Club World Cup is an international event where 32 teams from top leagues around the globe compete in a World Cup style tournament to determine the best club team in the world. Ready to learn how to watch the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 from the comfort of your own home? Throw on your jersey, turn on the TV, and see below.

JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - DECEMBER 19: Phil Foden of Manchester City shoots during the FIFA Club World Cup Semi-final match between Urawa Reds and Manchester City at King Abdullah Sports City on December 19, 2023 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

For some historical context, the tournament began in 2000 in Brazil as the FIFA Club World Championship, running alongside the Intercontinental Cup. The Intercontinental Cup, which featured a showdown between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the Copa Libertadores, was also billed — like the FIFA Club World Championship — as a battle for the title of the world's best club. Then in 2017, the two competitions merged to form the current tournament, the FIFA Club World Cup. 

In 2025, the tournament expands to 32 teams, featuring eight groups of four teams that will compete in a round-robin format, with the top two from each group advancing to the knockout stage. The 16 team knockout stage will commence on Saturday, June 28 to determine the two finalists who will compete on Sunday, July 15. Manchester City of the English Premier League are the current title holders, while Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid holds the record for the most victories, with five.

Now, watching all of these games won't be as difficult as you might think. Why? Well, you can stream every second on DAZN, a subscription-based sports streamer that's got live and on-demand coverage of a wide variety of sports, including FIFA Club World Cup games. Here's how to get it.

The entirety of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be exclusively streamed on DAZN. In what FIFA describes as a "historic broadcasting deal," all 63 matches will be live streamed for free on DAZN worldwide — no subscription required. Whether you're tuning in from home or on the go, you can catch every match from the group stage to the final without spending a dime.

DAZN is available on all major connected devices, including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles. As long as you've got an internet connection, you're good to go — meaning you won't miss a single goal, save, or dramatic finish.

And if you like what you see during the tournament, DAZN also offers paid plans with additional content beyond the Club World Cup. For long-term sports fans, the 12-Month Monthly Saver plan is $19.99/month, giving you access to DAZN's full lineup — including over 150 boxing and MMA fights, behind-the-scenes documentaries, and expert fight analysis. Just keep in mind that this plan requires a full 12-month commitment and can't be canceled early.

Prefer to keep things casual? The Flexible Pass goes for $29.99/month and lets you cancel anytime with just 30 days' notice. It's perfect if you want full access to DAZN's library without locking yourself into a year-long plan — and if you cancel early, you'll only pay for what you've used thanks to pro-rata billing.

Whether you're just here for the Club World Cup stream or ready to dive into DAZN's full sports lineup, you've got plenty of ways to watch.

Trying to keep up with fights, football, or exclusive DAZN content while you're traveling or outside your home region? A VPN can make all the difference. By masking your location and connecting you to a server in another country, a VPN helps unlock DAZN streams that might otherwise be restricted where you are — no geo-blocks, no interruptions.

If speed and reliability are a must, ExpressVPN is a solid choice, starting at $8.32/month and backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee. Want to save a little cash? Private Internet Access offers dependable service for just $2/month. You can also go with NordVPN, which is fast, user-friendly, and often heavily discounted (we're talking up to 76% off). No matter where you're tuning in from, a VPN helps make sure DAZN's lineup — from big-name bouts to behind-the-scenes docs — is always within reach.

Please note: all times are in local time.

When FIFA says “jump,” the proprietors of NFL stadiums don't even ask how high.

Seattle's Lumen Field will host six games of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. During which it won't be known as Lumen Field, because of FIFA rules relating to stadium sponsorships.

Via multiple reports, the venue will undergo $19.4 million in upgrades to make it suitable for the top tournament in international soccer.

The biggest requirement is natural grass. This will require irrigation, vacuum ventilation, and grow lights. 

Also, FIFA rules require a full complement of individual seats with backs. The bleachers in the “Hawks Nest” currently does not. For the World Cup matches, they will.

The good news for Seahawks fans is that the backs will remain for NFL games.

Every stadium that will host FIFA World Cup games must have a grass playing surface. It's one of the great hypocrisies of NFL ownership. 

NFL players overwhelmingly prefer playing on grass. The owners won't do it for them. But they won't hesitate to do it for FIFA.

The U.S. men's national team is set to play in its last remaining competitive tournament before co-hosting the World Cup in 2026, and the vibes could not be much worse.

Even head coach Mauricio Pochettino is speaking out about it.

When the USMNT announced the rosters for the Gold Cup, the notable absences of stars like Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah sparked an uproar among U.S. soccer fans. The team was already going to be shorthanded with several key players tied into Club World Cup duties, so it seemed imperative for the best remaining players to take advantage of the last extended camp together for the next year.

Pulisic — citing the need for rest — saw it differently. And that led to Pochettino pointing out the contrasting mentality global superstars take to national team duty. He said that players he's coached like Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane were all "desperate" to play for their national teams.

Pochettino said in a podcast appearance with former USMNT stars Landon Donovan and Tim Howard:

"Today, we have plenty of players playing abroad for USA. But the most important thing is the culture we saw in you (Tim Howard and Landon Donovan), that to be desperate to come and be the priority - the national team. ... Even Messi, even Neymar, even Mbappe for France. We were working with these guys, Harry Kane. These guys are desperate to go to the national team. And for them, when they go, they don't see if it's a friendly game. It's an official game. It's a World Cup. It doesn't matter. Because the possibility to defend one time more, your flag, your shirt, I want to feel proud about that. And that it the responsibility of us to translate."

Those comments appeared to be an obvious jab at Pulisic, Robinson and others for viewing the Gold Cup as not worth their time. And sure, the Gold Cup has been relegated to a developmental tournament in recent years in light of the CONCACAF Nations League. But Pochettino wants to see a culture of players who look at USMNT duty as an honor regardless of the tournament or competition.

That mentality had clearly been lost among this current generation of players despite the immense individual talent. And Pochettino is running out of time to reinstate it.

12:41 PM EDT on June 2, 2025

By sheer power of will, determination, and lots and lots and lots of money, FIFA is looking to turn the previously irrelevant Club World Cup into a quadrennial summer-time blockbuster. Traditionally, the event has been a global supercup of sorts, each year pitting the seven winners of FIFA's seven federations' continental tournaments against each other in a brief, midseason contest that virtually nobody really cared about. This month will bring the inaugural edition of the new-look CWC, a 32-team behemoth that will cram an already over-stuffed soccer calendar with yet another competition that nobody asked for.

It will take a lot of work to make this tournament into something fans care about. For the players and clubs involved, however, there are hundreds of millions of reasons why they're willing to cut into their already vanishingly small rest and recovery time to try their damnedest to win. In its effort to make this whole thing matter, FIFA has filled the prize pool with ungodly sums of money, enticing participants with lucrative payouts that can rise up to $125 million for the winners. That's almost one Florian Wirtz, if reports are to be believed, which should ensure that clubs like Real Madrid—who just paid Liverpool €10 million to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold early enough for him to play in the group stage of the CWC—and freshly crowned Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will provide a good showing.

For the smaller clubs in the competition, the outlandish prize pool is even more of an incentive to dive in headfirst, as making it to the round of 16 could be worth upwards of $20 million total. For clubs, this financial windfall could prove invaluable in filling the coffers and helping improve rosters and facilities. For players, getting a cut of the prize money could make for their biggest paychecks of the whole year.

But lo, what misshapen beast looms on the horizon, hobbling over to mess up the rest of our soccer fun? Why, MLS, of course! Seattle Sounders players are in the midst of a public battle with the league over the split of the CWC prize pool that players would receive, thanks to old collective bargaining agreement terms that date back before the newfangled CWC took shape.

While the MLS CBA has specific carveouts for the established non-league tournaments—such as the U.S. Open Cup, the Champions Cup, and the Leagues Cup—the CWC, as Sounder at Heart points out, would fall into a narrowly capped catch-all clause:

(v) Compulsory Tournament/Non-Compulsory Tournament: If an MLS Team or MLS receives prize money by virtue of the Team's performance and/or participation in a Compulsory Tournament or Non-Compulsory Tournament (other than the tournaments set forth above i.e., USOC, Canadian Championship, CCL, Campeones Cup, Leagues Cup), Players competing in that tournament will receive the following:

(a) If the Team or MLS receives prize money, fifty percent (50%) of such prize money up to a maximum payment to the Players (collectively) of $1,000,000 per tournament.

This likely would not be an issue in previous iterations of the Club World Cup, but with the money FIFA is throwing at this new format, the $1 million cap on player earnings becomes more egregious, since entry into the tournament itself comes with almost $10 million. Even if the Sounders crash out with three straight losses, earning no additional prize money, the players could only receive roughly 10 percent of that initial bonus. This, as one can imagine, has not gone over well with the players.

Ahead a league match against Minnesota on Sunday, Sounders players took to the pitch wearing t-shirts that read "Club World Cash Grab," while fans in the stands, already among the most vocal in MLS, chanted "you dirty greedy bastards." Yikes! The MLS Players Association has also come out in support. In a statement released on Sunday, the MLSPA accused the league of not bringing forward a "reasonable proposal" in response to player demands, adding that MLS often asks the MLSPA to "deviate" from the CBA when it suits the league but has proven unwilling to show the same kind of good faith when its the players who stand to gain.

The MLSPA and all MLS players stand united with the Seattle Sounders players who tonight demanded a fair share of the FIFA Club World Cup prize money. #FairShareNow #FIFACWC

The player complaints makes even more sense when considering what a good performance could mean financially. Despite drawing a tough group featuring PSG and Atlético Madrid, the Sounders could earn up to $13.5 million just from that stage of the tournament (the team stands to earn $2 million per win, $1 million per draw, and $7.5 million if it advances into the round of 16). Capping the players' collective cut of that at a maximum of $1 million is a spit in the face.

MLS players have an extra consideration when it comes to the Club World Cup. Unlike, say, PSG players, who have no other games besides CWC games until the domestic season starts back up in France in August, the CWC is taking place right in the middle of the MLS season. It's possible that participation in the CWC will hurt these teams in the back half of the MLS season and therefore hurt the players' earning potential; even if it doesn't, the tournament will put added stress on the players' bodies. In a league that constantly twists itself and its rules into knots looking to get what it wants, it's no surprise to see MLS suddenly turn rigid when players come asking for what's fair.

After the U.S. Women's National Team victory over China PR, Sam Coffey intentionally sought out Naomi Girma to give her a hug of celebration but also one of gratitude.

Coffey, the USA's defensive midfielder, is one of many happy to have Girma on the backline after nagging injuries kept the young defender out of commission internationally in 2025.

“Having her on the field is like having a security blanket and just being wrapped in it,” Coffey said. “... I can't put into words what she means to this team.”

Head coach Emma Hayes echoed how valuable it was to have the center back on her side again.

The backline of Girma, Avery Patterson, Emily Sonnett and Crystal Dunn helped hold No. 17 FIFA-ranked China scoreless, and for the most part, far from the U.S. goal. It was the 26th shutout Girma has contributed to as a USWNT starter.

In the post-game press conference, Hayes that Girma told her that seeing the fans cheering for the U.S. team as the bus rolled into the stadium reminded her just how much she missed playing for the National Team.

“She's a world-class player, and you can see that,” Hayes said. “I thought she brought something to our performance I've been looking for, so I'm delighted we have her back.”

At 24 years old and despite having just 45 caps, Girma returned to the USWNT as a full-fledged veteran as Hayes continues to develop younger players as larger tournaments like the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup and 2028 Los Angeles Olympics draw closer.

Girma will be charged with helping players like Patterson acclimate to the international game. The Houston Dash defender earned just her third cap and made her second start in the friendly win.

“It just feels good to be back on the field with this group and playing with a lot of players, some I've never played with and some I haven't played with in six months,” Girma said.“So, just good to get that rhythm again.”

Goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce is a player who hadn't played with Girma yet, although the two are more than familiar as Women's Super League rivals with their clubs Manchester United and Chelsea FC. They recently met in the FA Women's Cup Final where Girma (along with fellow USWNT teammate Catarina Macario) and Chelsea took home the trophy.

Tullis-Joyce, who earned her second start and clean sheet, was grateful to have Girma on her side this time around. Tullis-Joyce and Girma began their new relationship as teammates in camp in Minnesota, and the ‘keeper quickly noted Girma's leadership and how articulate the defender was as the two bounced ideas off each other.

To no one's surprise, Girma has picked up right where she left off at the end of 2024.

“It does feel natural now,” Girma said. “I was able to watch what we did before, and I think a lot of what Emma wants to do is layer on what we had done in the past year. So, I think the changes are good and easy for me to adapt to with that base knowledge of how we want to play. It was just nice to be back on the field.”

And just as much as she missed the team, they missed her, too. They'll get another chance to develop chemistry with Girma again when the U.S. takes on Jamaica on June 3rd in St. Louis, Mo. (7 p.m. CT / 8 p.m. ET on TNT, Max, Universo and Peacock in Spanish and Westwood One Sports on radio).

“I think everybody sees it on the field, but off the field as well,” Coffey said. “She's just a joy in this environment and such a light for us, and we have missed her so much.”

Hello! The European club season may have come to a close with Paris Saint-Germain's win in the UEFA Champions League final on Saturday but there is still plenty of soccer to watch this summer. I'm Pardeep Cattry with a preview of what's to come.

All times U.S./Eastern

Tuesday, June 3🇪🇺 UWNL: Spain vs. England, 1 p.m. ➡️ CBS Sports Network, Paramount+🌎 Friendly: USWNT vs. Jamaica, 8 p.m. ➡️ TNT

The U.S. women's national team kicked off the international break with a 3-0 win over China on Saturday, one that showcased the strides that Emma Hayes' young team are making as the era of experimentation continues.

Saturday's win offered another glimpse at a new-look version of the USWNT, one where the pieces are beginning to fall into place after months of work together. The group easily unlocked China's high line over the course of the match, with Catarina Macario among the standouts after notching a goal and an assist. Hayes attributed the dominant performance to the work the team has done over the last several months, one that has come with a learning curve that has begun to subside.

The USWNT's attacking trio on Saturday, featuring a front line of Macario, Alyssa Thompson and Michelle Cooper, filled in nicely as Hayes explores her attacking options as all three members of triple espresso – Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilason – remain unavailable. Hayes has other players available to her for Tuesday's match against Jamaica, including fellow youngsters Ally Sentnor and Emma Sears and veteran Lynn Biyendolo. Whatever combination she opts for in the upcoming match, though, she did identify some areas of improvement for a relatively young group as they continue in the lengthy buildup to the 2027 Women's World Cup.

While the offseason is in sight, or already underway, for a chunk of the world's best players, there is still plenty of soccer on the schedule over the next two months. A first-of-its-kind summer of soccer awaits, one with several high-stakes matches on the schedule.

World Cup qualifying resumes

June 11 marks the one year mark before the 2026 World Cup, a tournament that will be top of mind for several national teams as they look to book a spot at the 48 team tournament in North America next summer. Four nations – Japan, New Zealand, iran and Argentina – have already joined the three host nations, while a handful of other teams could join them before the month is over.

While some confederations are several months into their qualifying campaigns, Europe is still in the early stages of their qualification tournament. A handful of high-profile teams will play their first qualifiers this month, a list that includes previous World Cup winners Germany, Spain, France and Italy. Luciano Spaletti's Italy will be a team to watch during UEFA's qualifying run since they have missed the last two editions of the World Cup, especially surprising since they won the Euros in 2021.

New-look Club World Cup gets underway

Meanwhile, 32 clubs from around the world are in the final stages of preparation for the newly expanded version of the Club World Cup. The U.S.-set tournament begins on June 14 and will feature new Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, as well as fellow European heavyweights Real Madrid and Chelsea and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami. The field now officially includes MLS' LAFC, who won a play-in match against Club America on Saturday to take the final spot in the competition.

How exactly each team will approach this competition is a big question and seems likely to vary from squad to squad. Al-Hilal, the club owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, may go all out by recruiting Al-Nassr's Cristiano Ronaldo but will only have until June 10 to get a deal done. It is unclear how the European clubs will handle this tournament considering it is the final stage of a demanding season that began last August and could run until July 13, should they reach the final.

Women's Euro returns in July

This summer's major international tournament will take place in Switzerland, where 16 teams will compete in the Women's Euro. England enter the competition as the reigning champions, winning on home soil in 2022 during a tournament that set records for attendance and viewership, though there have been some dynamic shifts in Europe since. Chief among them is the rapid transformation of Spain, who were a team with potential but no history of deep runs in major competitions and exited in the quarterfinals after a loss to the hosts. A year later, Spain beat England in the Women's World Cup final and will arrive in Switzerland as the favorites to win the whole thing. 

Hopes will still be high for England, though they will be without goalkeeper Mary Earps after she suddenly announced her international retirement last month. Earps had lost a starting role in recent months to Chelsea's Hannah Hampton, who has been the expected starter at the Euros for some time.

On course for her best club campaign, the 20-year-old is beginning to prove why the USWNT have another potential star player on their hands. 

At 20 years old, Alyssa Thompson has the world at her feet.

For years now, she has been touted as the future of the United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT).

But as far as she - and those around her - are concerned, the future is now.

After scoring her first international goal last October, Thompson has broken free of anything holding her back, skyrocketing her status as one of the best forwards in the NWSL this term.

Just nine games in and the Angel City star is on course for a season's best campaign in her third year in the league.

Alyssa has found the back of the net five times and assisted her teammates twice, one of which was to set up her sister Gisele, the two playing alongside one another.

Her best return prior came in 2024, also scoring on five occasions, assisting seven.

Thompson's club form is electric, and now she's challenging that energy into the national team, stepping up in the absence of key forwards Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith, and Mallory Swanson.

With an assist in their latest 3-0 win over People's Republic of China, it seems the American wonderkid is seizing her opportunity with both hands, and lightning-fast feet.

Alyssa Thompson provided an assist in the USWNT's win over the People's Republic of China.

Alyssa Thompson's rise is not sudden. It has always been a matter of when, not if.

Having been involved with the national team for several years now, even featuring at the 2023 Women's World Cup, her first taste of a major tournament made missing out on the Paris 2024 Olympics roster all the more painful.

By her own admission, the winger was not the best forward Emma Hayes had at her disposal at the time, though it didn't make missing out any easier to accept.

It was undoubtedly a blow to her confidence, the fact of having time on her side providing little comfort. But she found guidance from someone who knew exactly how she was feeling in Christen Press.

Press is one of several veterans to take her compatriot under their wing while playing together in California. The 36-year-old is a figure of resilience, fighting her way back to the sport through difficult injuries among other setbacks.

“I've always looked up to her,” Thompson told Just Women's Sports.

“As an older sister, I feel like I crave some advice because I feel like I've always done everything first for my sisters.

“It's just been really nice getting to know her as a person and I feel like I've learned so much from her.”

Their connection transcends just admiration, though. The pair often will put in extra time training, doing shooting drills - the Christen Press school of finishing, their teammate Madison Hammond joked.

Not only has it reaffirmed the belief Thompson has in her ability mentally, it has also shown visibly on the pitch. Small changes, like her first touch before shooting, has elevated her abilities and contributed to the fine form she is in of late.

“Knowing that she is [saying] ‘you can score, I believe in you', really gives me a lot of confidence,” Thompson added.

“Like yeah, if you believe in me, what can I not do?”

Those words alone, from someone who has been there before, have had the power to transform doubt into determination.

Alyssa Thompson for Angel City in the NWSL.

Thompson's form has not gone unnoticed. She is making it increasingly difficult for Hayes not to include her in full strength national team rosters, let alone current ones.

Perhaps more impressively, is that the Los Angeles native has proven that she isn't just there to make up the numbers, but rather she can contribute effectively to the team when called upon.

“Beyond their determination and their drive to be the very best, I love the way they reflect on what they need, and then they work at trying to put that in place,” the U.S. head coach said of the Thompson sisters.

“They don't feel at any point they've made it, and they keep looking for that little extra yard, whatever it is, to keep improving – they're very different players, but I think they have the qualities that the team are looking for.

“I think Alyssa has been easily one of the best players in the NWSL this year.”

Such is her desire to become a better player, the elder of the sibling duo has absorbed every bit of what her national team coach has asked of her.

Two months ago, at the SheBelieves Cup, Hayes believed it would take half a dozen experiences with the player to get to a point where they began moving forward. While their hand may have been forced with notable absentees, the youngster has shown she is very capable to rise to the occasion.

Thompson has demonstrated that setbacks don't define a career – even this early on – it's how you bounce back that does.

Lionel Messi will wear his Argentina shirt again for two matches with his beloved national team in the next 10 days, before leading Inter Miami in the FIFA Club World Cup.

Messi arrived in Argentina on Monday morning to rejoin the defending World Cup champions for qualifying matches for the 2026 tournament.

"¡Buenos días, capitán!" or "good morning, captain" was the caption on a photo of Messi arriving to Argentina's headquarters.

Argentina will visit Chile on June 5 at 9 p.m. ET at Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos in Santiago, Chile. Then, Argentina will host Colombia – a battle between the 2024 Copa America finalists – on June 10 at 8 p.m. ET inside Mâs Monumental in Buenos Aires.

Both matches fall during a FIFA international break between the MLS season and before the Club World Cup. 

Messi is coming off one of his best stretches during the 2025 MLS season, scoring five goals in his last three matches, helping Inter Miami improve from sixth to third place in the MLS Eastern Conference.

Messi has traditionally played with the national team when healthy as a member of Inter Miami – including two matches before the MLS Cup playoffs last season. These two matches could be no different despite the timing.

Messi and Inter Miami will star in the Club World Cup opening match on June 14 against Egyptian club Al Alhy at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. They will also play against FC Porto (Portugal) in Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 19, and return to Miami for their final group stage match against SE Palmeiras (Brazil) on June 23.

Playing with Argentina before the MLS Cup playoffs last year, Messi was scoreless in a 1-1 draw against Venezuela on Oct. 11, 2024, then exploded with a hat trick and two assists in a 6-0 victory over Bolivia on Oct. 15, 2024.

Messi last played with the national team in November: He was scoreless as Argentina lost 2-1 to Paraguay on Nov. 14, 2024, and had the assist to Lautaro Martinez in a 1-0 win over Peru on Nov. 19, 2024.

Messi was unable to play with Argentina in matches against Uruguay and Brazil this March, while he was recovering from an adductor strain. Argentina beat Uruguay 1-0 on March 21, and beat Brazil 4-1 on March 25.

Argentina has two more World Cup qualifiers later this year: They will host Venezuela on Sept. 9, and visit Ecuador on Sept. 14.

Messi has yet to declare whether he will play for Argentina for World Cup 2026, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Salt Bae has responded to claims online that he was turned away at an after-party following PSG's Champions League triumph over Inter Milan.

The notorious restaurateur attended the showpiece event in Munich, in which Luis Enrique's side cruised to a 5-0 win - the largest ever margin of victory in a Champions League final.

Salt Bae has been a controversial figure in the footballing world since the 2022 World Cup final, when he broke FIFA rules after gaining access to the pitch and gatecrashing Argentina's celebrations.

In other cringeworthy scenes, the Turkish chef put another player's medal in his mouth and kept trying to grab the trophy from the Argentina team so he could pose for a photo.

And over the weekend, fans thought they had caught the social media sensation at the centre of another embarrassing moment.

As he exited a bus and approached the entrance to a hotel, where there was reportedly a high-profile party after the final, Salt Bae appeared to be turned away by the doormen and escorted to the side.

A post shared by Nusr_et#Saltbae (@nusr_et)

He was then seen waving at fans, posing for photos, and signing books.

However, the chef denied such claims on his Instagram, and explained that he was at the hotel solely for the thousands of fans that wanted to see him there. 

Salt Bae said: 'After the Champions League final match, we arrived to the hotel in UEFA bus, the reason we were there at that moment was because of our thousands of fans who wanted to see us there.

'As always, I was in that area to return their love and to take photos. Due to the busyness that occurred, while I was waiting for my vehicle to go to my own hotel, my back turned in front of the door, there was a directive from Mr. Dormen. 

'There was no organization like invitation party in the middle, hence the news that I was not included in the party. It's all just baseless.

'Let it be known that we are never happy to go anywhere we are called with love not to be taken anywhere. Don't worry about such little things, the rest is artificial intelligence.'

Real name Nusret Gokce, Salt Bae owns more than 20 Nusr-Et restaurants and charges £2,000 for a tomahawk steak wrapped in gold. He first went viral online in 2017 after filming his flamboyant method of seasoning meat, often in front of diners. 

The 41-year-old has struck up a close rapport with several of football's biggest figures, including FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who visited one of his restaurants in 2021 and mimicked his salt-seasoning pose. 

A post shared by Nusr_et#Saltbae (@nusr_et)

'Mr Nusrat, number one, the best of the best, unforgettable evening in Dubai,' Infantino said on a video posted on social media. He also called him a 'legend'.

In the last few days, Salt Bae took to Instagram to give plaudits to Infantino, whom he crowned the 'King of football'.

'King of football gianni_infantino Under your leadership, football has not only grown - it has united the world in ways few ever could.'

After Salt Bae's World Cup final antics, FIFA later revealed that he was not permitted to walk onto the pitch and, after launching an investigation, vowed to take 'appropriate internal action'. 

The chef also insisted that he did not step onto the pitch to steal the limelight from any players. 

He said: 'I didn't go on the pitch with the purpose of advertising; I just felt like it. Then it was a bit of a surprise. There were at least another 1,000 people on the pitch but when they show the video they make out it was just me.

'I never, ever wanted to overshadow anything. I didn't like the attention. I didn't kick anyone, steal anything.'

ALAJUELA, Costa Rica – The U.S. U-20 Women's National Team dominated Puerto Rico to win 3-1 in its second Group A match at the Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship.

The win guaranteed the USA a top two finish in the group and the berth to the 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup that goes along with it. The 2026 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup will be held from September 5–27 next year in Poland.

The USA will finish group play on June 3 against Costa Rica (4 p.m. ET on FS2) with a win or a tie clinching first place in the group.

U.S. head coach Carrie Kveton made nine changes to the starting XI from the USA's 8-0 opening game win over Guyana – center back Abby Mills and forward Mya Townes were the only holdovers — but it mattered little. The USA scored in the fourth minute and never looked back, dominating the match while out-shooting Puerto Rico 24-3 overall and 8-1 in shots on goal.

The first goal came from a somewhat unlikely source, right back Kate Scott. The ball was worked well from the left to the right and Townes fed Scott with a square pass just above the right side of the penalty area. A sliding Puerto Rico defender could not quite get her toe on the ball, and it rolled to Scott, who took a great prep touch and smashed her shot from just outside the penalty box into the left side of the net for the early goal. It was Scott's first goal at the U-20 level. She also had one goal at the U-17 level.

Puerto Rico's only chance of the first half came in the sixth minute when a long ball behind the U.S. defense led to some confusion between goalkeeper Keally Titmuss and Scott, who smashed into each other as Titmuss raced out of her net, leaving an open goal for Puerto Rico striker Susana Roberts. Scott recovered and threw her body to the ground block Roberts' initial shot and then Roberts sent her second chance over an open net.

Forward Mary Long then doubled the lead in the 24th minute when she timed her run to stay onside by a slim margin and raced in on goal off a through ball from Scott. Long held off her defender and finished under duress from six yards out as she tumbled to the ground to make it 2-0.

Long scored her second goal in the 65th minute when she ran onto a pass from halftime substitute Linda Ullmark and shot from just above the right side of the penalty area. She used as much finesse as power to roll her shot off the left post and in from 18 yards out. The two goals were the first at the U-20 international level for Long, who scored three times at the U-17 international level.

Puerto Rico pulled one back in the 67th minute as University of Arizona striker Aurora Gaines ran onto a poor back pass by the U.S. defense and fought off three U.S. defenders on a mazy dribbling run to slot home from six yards out.

Additional Notes: 

• After 15 players earned their first U-20 caps in the first game against Guyana, five players earned their first U-20 international caps in this match: Kealey Titmuss, Kate Scott, Kennedy Ring, Mary Long and Chloe Rickets.

• Aven Alverez earned her team leading fourth U-20 international cap when she came on in the 84th minute.

• Scott, who hails from Pennsylvania, captained the U.S. U-20s for the first time.

Ahead of the next FIFA window, five Inter Miami CF players have been called up to represent their national teams during the June international break. The players will participate in the CONMEBOL and Concacaf World Cup qualifiers, as well as international friendlies.

Here's a look at the players and their upcoming matches.

Inter Miami CF captain Lionel Messi has been called up to represent the Argentine national team during this CONMEBOL qualifying window for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Messi and Argentina enter this window atop the standings, having already secured their place in the upcoming World Cup. La Albiceleste will visit Chile on June 5 at 9 p.m. ET in Ñuñoa, Chile, before hosting Colombia on June 10 at 8 p.m. ET in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Messi is the all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying with 34 goals in 69 matches, and he will look to add to that tally during this international window.

Midfielder Telasco Segovia will be available for Venezuela's senior national team for its two CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying matches.

La Vinotinto will play two crucial games in their quest for a first-ever World Cup qualification. First, they will host direct rivals Bolivia on June 6 at 6 p.m. ET in Maturín, Venezuela, and will wrap up the window with a visit to Uruguay on June 10 at 7 p.m. ET in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Forward Fafa Picault has been called up by the Haitian national team for the Concacaf World Cup qualifying matches.

Haiti will visit Aruba on June 7 at 5 p.m. ET in Oranjestad, Aruba, to then host Curaçao on June 10 at 6 p.m. ET in World Cup qualifying action. The Grenadiers currently sit in second place in their group, tied on six points with the Curaçao national team.

Picault has made 14 appearances for the Haitian national team, registering one goal and four assists.

Midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi has been called up to the Under-20 U.S. Men's Youth National Team for an international training camp and friendlies in Cairo, Egypt from June 2 through June 11.

After earning minutes with the senior USMNT earlier this year in matches against Venezuela and Costa Rica, Cremaschi will now represent the youth team in friendlies against the U-20 squads of Colombia on June 7 and Egypt on June 10.

Academy product Santiago Morales has been called up to represent the U.S. Under-18 Men's National Team for the upcoming UEFA Friendship Cup in Nyon, Switzerland.

Morales is part of the 20-player roster selected by Head Coach Marlon LeBlanc to compete in the prestigious eight-team tournament taking place from May 30 to June 11. The U.S. has been drawn into Group A and will face Argentina on Wednesday, June 4, and Australia on Saturday, June 7, after already playing their first match against France.

Morales scored in the opening match, helping the U-18 USMYNT earn a 2-2 draw against France and subsequently earning a penalty shootout win.

Following the group stage, Morales and the U.S. U-18s will play a placement match on Tuesday, June 10, with opponents determined by final group standings. The top team in each group will meet in the championship match, while the remaining teams will play for placement accordingly.

Wolves are looking to be productive this summer – and one target looks to be all set to leave his club.

Wanderers are facing a huge window with Matheus Cunha and Pablo Sarabia having already moved on.

Vitor Pereira wants to take Wolves to the next level, but the manager will have to brace for losing some players, as has been the case for the last few seasons.

Cunha has now officially joined United after much speculation.

He will of course be very difficult to replace, such was his ability to change a game in an instant with a bit of magic.

Wolves have been linked with a few players to potentially play in his left sided 10 position next term.

Harvey Elliott was briefly linked with Wolves, but the feeling is that he will be too expensive at over £40 million.

But James McAtee is also a target for Wolves – and Manchester City look set to sanction his exit.

At the moment, there is heavy speculation that Manchester City are trying to sign Rayan Ait-Nouri.

City were expected to join the hunt for Ait-Nouri, and now they are firming up their interest and a deal is expected to happen.

But potentially, we might see Wolves try and raid City for McAtee.

It has been reported by the Mirror that Pep Guardiola has decided against including McAtee in the squad he is taking to the upcoming Club World Cup in the US.

That suggests that McAtee, who is highly coveted, will be sorting out his future.

It is worth noting though that McAtee will join up with the England U21s squad for the Euros. But certainly, Guardiola not wanting him for City's squad is a clear indicator of how he sees him right now.

Wolves like McAtee. But there are plenty of other clubs in the mix to sign him, including ones from overseas such as Bayer Leverkusen.

That said, Wolves may be encouraged by this development, and given they have a good relationship with City after the Matheus Nunes and Tommy Doyle transactions, there may be a deal to be done.

Wolves are up against it to sign McAtee, who is valued around the £25 million mark.

But Wanderers have now offloaded Cunha and need someone for that left 10 position – and McAtee seems like he'd be a great fit.

He plays in those attacking midfield roles and likes to play between the lines. He is not dynamic or explosive like Cunha, but very good in the pockets and tight spaces.

Pep Guardiola has branded McAtee ‘incredible' before (Manchester Evening News) and made it clear that he's been in an unfair situation with his game time at the Etihad Stadium.

Wanderers would likely be able to offer him regular game time, and potentially, they could even promise him Cunha's old number 10 shirt.

Settling into a gray upholstered chair in her living room in central London, beneath an enormous chandelier that makes even the nearby grand piano look compact, Michele Kang finds her mind drifting to the PBS home improvement series This Old House. She is fresh off a meeting with architects—down a glass-encased elevator to the conference room below her five-bedroom Knightsbridge apartment—and she has buildings on the brain.

She enjoys design, she says, clad in a cardinal-red double-breasted Valentino dress coat against the chill of a February afternoon, but she doesn't have the patience to slog through a long television season. “I just want to see the before-and-after picture,” says Kang, 65. “Who cares about the middle? I want to see the final product.”

Her entire life, Kang has focused on the endgame. Her outcome-oriented approach has made her a phenomenally successful tech entrepreneur—ranking 28th on Forbes' 2025 list of America's Richest Self-Made Women (which publishes on June 3) with a net worth estimated at $1.2 billion. But while she might privately wish that she could skip the process, she's also a woman who, after earning an economics degree from the University of Chicago and an MBA from Yale, meticulously mapped out the next 30 years of her career. She decided she would spend ten years consulting, to learn all aspects of a business, and then a decade as an executive before finally achieving her lifelong dream: becoming a CEO. She checked that last box in 2008 when she founded Cognosante, a health care IT company, which she sold last year for more than $1 billion.

Acquaintances and business partners describe Kang as unfailingly prepared. John Textor, a former executive chairman of sports-focused streaming service FuboTV, says he will try to catch her off-guard at her other home in Florida, but “it doesn't matter how early I get to her. She's still perfectly ready to go—couture, perfect hair, on her game. She's been taking notes while I'm still waking up.”

Even so, Kang never could have foreseen her second act. Six years after a chance meeting at an event on Capitol Hill awakened an interest in professional soccer, she is the owner of three prominent teams: the Washington Spirit of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), OL Lyonnes of France's Première Ligue and the London City Lionesses, recently promoted to England's Women's Super League. Even more unexpected, the humble Kang finds herself widely recognized as the global face of investing in women's sports.

GOAL GETTER | Michele Kang's London City Lionesses (top) earned promotion to the Women's Super League by claiming the title in England's second division this year—and it wasn't her first championship as a team owner. Her Lyon club (middle) has won back- to-back titles in France, and the Washington Spirit, built around star Trinity Rodman, won the NWSL Championship in 2021.

“I didn't know who Leo Messi was,” she says of the Argentine soccer superstar, laughing. “Now, here I am.”

Kang took control of the Spirit in 2022 at a $35 million valuation, then considered an astronomical price for a women's team. In reality, it was a bargain. Forbes estimates the Spirit are worth $130 million, and they aren't the only NWSL club to have seen such dramatic appreciation. Last year, L.A.'s Angel City FC sold at a record $250 million valuation to Disney CEO Bob Iger and his wife, Willow Bay. Then, in January, the league selected Denver as its 16th franchise for a $110 million expansion fee. “Michele really set the valuation boom in motion,” NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman says.

Once again, Kang has an ambitious goal in mind, and this time, she is expecting her grand plan to take a lot less than 30 years. In the not-too-distant future, she believes, women's soccer teams will be trading for $1 billion or more—and she's willing to spend whatever it takes to make that happen. Between purchasing her three clubs, seeding a handful of women-focused sports startups and donating $30 million to the U.S. Soccer federation, Kang entered the sports world with an ante of at least $200 million. And she's not done: Her February meeting with architects centered on her plans to construct a practice facility in Kent, southeast of London, for the Lionesses, and in April, she announced what amounted to a $25 million donation to U.S. Soccer as she handed over the nonprofit research arm of her holding company, which focuses on the biomechanics of female athletes.

At the same time, Kang and her fellow owners face a steep climb to approach the valuations of the 124 teams in the four major North American men's sports leagues, which are all worth at least $1 billion and have appreciated nearly 1,800% on average since Forbes started valuing them in 1998. By comparison, the women's leagues are still in their infancy, and many of the clubs have yet to show they're able to generate real money. For example, despite having won the NWSL title in 2021 and reached the 2024 championship game, Kang's Spirit posted roughly $15 million in regular-season revenue last year. Meanwhile, Major League Soccer's D.C. United, playing home games at the same stadium, collected $90 million in 2024, according to Forbes estimates.

Those concerns—paired with massive pay gaps between male and female players, unequal media coverage and occasionally outright discrimination—have led some critics to write off the recent women's sports boom as nothing more than a social cause.

Kang isn't buying that.

“This is not charity; this is not some corporate DEI project,” she says. “I'm on a mission to prove that this is good business—not just a business, but a good business.”

Kang considers herself a “very, very private person” and says she is still adjusting to the spotlight that has come with her involvement in professional sports. Sitting with a reporter in her home, she chuckles. “You're going to interview me for an hour?” she says. “I don't have a story for an hour.”

But don't mistake her modesty for timidity. “When she comes in the room, she commands that room, and that's hard to do—especially in a male-dominated situation,” says billionaire NBA legend Earvin “Magic” Johnson, who joined the Spirit last year as a minority investor and strategic partner. Berman, the NWSL's commissioner, remembers her first time meeting Kang, at a breakfast in 2022: “She was the most put-together human I had ever seen—a little bit intimidating for me.”

From her earliest days, Kang has had no trouble taking charge. Growing up in South Korea as a self-described tomboy, she refused to practice piano and would play sports instead. (Years later, after a few of her friends went on to study at Juilliard, she joked with her mother, “You should have made me practice!”)

While Kang, whose given name is Yongmee, aspired to follow in her father's footsteps by studying in America, her parents weren't exactly keen to see their youngest daughter cross the Pacific. But she managed to convince them that, amid the 1980s political unrest that pushed South Korea from dictatorship to democracy, they were better off paying for college than saving for a wedding. “I used a slight threat that ‘If you don't let me go, then who knows what could happen to me?'” Kang, now divorced, recalls with a knowing smile.

After business school, she became a partner at Ernst & Young, specializing in the high-tech and telecommunications sectors, and in 2000 she jumped to TRW as head of corporate strategy for the nonautomotive divisions at the conglomerate, which developed weapons and spacecraft. When the company was acquired by aerospace giant Northrop Grumman in a hostile takeover two years later, she saw an opportunity. “They gave me this health IT business that was failing miserably,” she says. “They felt like, if you screw up, you can't really do damage.”

In fact, Kang's timing was perfect. In 2004, President George W. Bush began a push to guarantee Americans access to electronic medical records and created the Nationwide Health Information Network to help. Northrop Grumman was among the four companies selected to build the network and secured a $68 million contract to digitize the medical records of U.S. Defense Department employees. Between 2003 and 2007, Kang more than tripled the revenue of her division.

Armed with new expertise in health care IT—an industry that was (and some would argue remains) technologically antiquated—Kang then decided to strike out on her own. In 2008, from an office above her garage in Bethesda, Maryland, she launched Cognosante.

To hear Kang tell it, nothing Cognosante did was revolutionary. But she recognized that as hospitals and pharmacies moved their paper records online, too many systems were popping up that couldn't communicate with one another—using different file formats for insurance information, for instance, or different codes to identify diseases. Cognosante essentially connected the dots, helping doctors and health care professionals access notes and imaging results from anywhere, with a particular focus on improving the flow of information at state government agencies.

This go-round, her timing wasn't ideal. Within months of Cognosante's founding, the subprime mortgage crisis sent the economy into a nosedive. With banks in disarray, Kang sold around $700,000 of her Northrop Grumman stock to fund her business. “I had a lot of offers to invest in what I was doing, and I didn't take any of the money—not because I didn't need money but rather because, if I took their money, I could not take the kind of risk that I was planning to take,” she says.

After emerging from the financial turmoil, Cognosante expanded its client base to federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It also extended its services into areas such as cybersecurity and Medicaid fraud detection. The company got to a point where, Kang says, she had two options: go public or bring in new management. Last year, she chose to sell, to a subsidiary of Irish IT giant Accenture.

“At some point, if you really want to take the company to the next level to compete against the big guys, then you need a different set of leaders,” Kang says. “Even when I started, I knew that ten years was going to be the maximum for me to lead this organization.”

Kang imagined that her next decade would center on philanthropy, and that was still the plan when she wrote a roughly $2 million check for 35% of the Spirit in 2020, not long after meeting the team's owners at a D.C. reception held for the U.S. women's national soccer team, which had just won the World Cup.

“It was not an itch—I didn't know anything about it,” she says of the NWSL at that time. But she liked the idea of supporting female athletes, and she believed that if the league could help close the gap with men's sports, “the future is just incredible—not only for the players but, more importantly, a lot of young girls.” Besides, she says, across her career, “I'm the first one to jump in when everyone else is trying to figure it out.”

“I see the value, and if I don't start valuing it, who else is going to do it for us?” says Kang, who paid $35 million for her first team.


Kang got her chance after a scandal engulfed the team a year later. Three players told the Washington Post that Spirit coach Richie Burke had repeatedly screamed at them, insulted them and threatened to bench them, during games and at practice. Kaiya McCullough, a rookie defender, told the Post that Burke had made racially insensitive jokes and that the experience had sent her “into survival mode.” She questioned whether she would ever play soccer again.

Burke denied any wrongdoing but was fired, and an ensuing leaguewide investigation uncovered similar allegations against coaches at three other clubs. The Spirit's players published an open letter calling on Steve Baldwin, a tech executive who was then the club's CEO and majority owner, to sell the team to Kang. Negotiations turned ugly, with Baldwin reportedly accusing Kang of organizing “a coup attempt,” but she eventually took control by besting an offer from billionaire bond investor Todd Boehly, who turned around and bought the men's and women's clubs of English soccer powerhouse Chelsea FC for a combined $5.2 billion in May 2022.

Kang's $35 million price tag shocked observers, given that valuations in the NWSL historically had been under $5 million and that, despite the success of the U.S. women's national team, women's pro soccer had a bumpy track record. The Women's United Soccer Association, a $40 million effort to capitalize on American excitement around the 1999 Women's World Cup, began play with eight teams in 2001 and folded after three seasons, reportedly racking up $100 million in losses. A second attempt, known as Women's Professional Soccer, also managed to eke out three seasons, from 2009 to 2011.

The NWSL arrived in 2013 and showed more promise—enough that Kang was comfortable raising her stake to an estimated 80% in the 2022 sale, despite the league's lack of profitability. “I see the value, and if I don't start valuing it, who else is going to do it for us?” she says. “Whether I paid $5 million or $35 million wasn't going to make a whole lot of difference.”

Changes came quickly, with investments in the Spirit's front office and coaching staff and a reinforced roster around superstar forward Trinity Rodman (the daughter of NBA great Dennis Rodman). When Kang first joined the Spirit, its annual revenue was an estimated $5 million; by 2024, that number had tripled. Attendance climbed to nearly 14,000 per game, up from fewer than 6,000 in 2022.

“She hasn't wavered on spending money not only to make the Spirit better but also women's sports better, period,” says Magic Johnson, who notes that he had an opportunity to invest in the NWSL's Angel City FC but was won over by Kang and ended up putting his money in the Spirit. “She won't stop until she's happy about where women's sports can go and she's achieved the goal of taking it there, even if she had to do it herself.”

Looking beyond Washington, Kang agreed in May 2023 to buy 53% of the French club then known as Olympique Lyonnais Féminin, separating the operations of one of the world's best women's teams from its male counterpart. Later that year, she acquired the London City Lionesses and formed Kynisca Sports International to house her soccer investments under one roof, in London. She is now targeting a South American squad.

Multiclub ownership is common in men's professional sports—for example, City Football Group owns more than a dozen soccer teams, including Manchester City and New York City FC. But that model—and the operating efficiencies that come with it—is a new development in the women's game. By centralizing global scouting and player and coach development, Kang can reduce the organization's spending, and she hopes to attract global brands as sponsors because of her presence in multiple countries. The company is also developing best practices with its facilities as Kang works to build new training centers for all three of her clubs.

“Michele shows up, and she starts talking about the incidence of ligament injuries during the menstrual cycle—she's putting money into research on women's bodies and how to train as women,” says Textor, whose Eagle Football Holdings owned the Lyon team, now known as OL Lyonnes, before Kang's purchase and maintains a minority stake. “She's definitely not the boat floating up on the rising tide. She is the reason the tide rises.”

Now, others are—finally—matching her enthusiasm. The NWSL has added blue-chip sponsors including AT&T and Google in the past year, and it achieved a financial breakthrough in 2023 when it signed media rights deals with CBS, ESPN, Ion and Amazon Prime Video collectively worth $240 million over four years—roughly 60 times the league's previous fees.

Kang, at the center of it all, has a hard time wrapping her mind around everything she has accomplished in five years, saying, “The fact that I'm talking about the word legacy is surreal.” But she is also enjoying the moment and taking pride in her teams, trying to travel to most Spirit games. When the topic of the 2024 championship game loss is broached, she can only laugh and say, “Don't go there.”

So will the Spirit avenge the defeat and raise the trophy in November? “Absolutely,” she says with a grin. “Mark my words.”

The first jersey auction from US Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team.

The U.S. Soccer Federation, United States National Soccer Team Players Association (USNSTPA) and United States Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA) have announced a partnership with MatchWornShirt, a global leader in the sports memorabilia market.

As per the deal, the company has become their official match-worn auction platform. The agreement represents MatchWornShirt's official U.S. launch and an important turning point in the company's growth trajectory and expansion, providing real-time access to signed, game-worn jerseys from the United States Men's and Women's National Teams.

The first jersey auction from U.S. Soccer has begun already, showcasing match-worn, signed jerseys from the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) during their recent back-to-back games against Brazil. On May 31, 2025, a fresh auction started at kickoff when the USWNT faced China.

This summer, MatchWornShirt will hold further auctions showcasing players' jerseys from the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) throughout its 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign.

Mark Levinstein, Executive Director of the Players Association of the U.S. Men's National Team Players, said, “Owning a match-worn jersey is holding a living fragment of U.S. Soccer history. The jerseys carry the energy, emotion, and dedication of the players who have spent their lives to earn the opportunity to wear them, and tell a story of hard-fought battles, unforgettable moments, and the pride of representing an entire nation on the global stage. Fans and collectors can connect directly to the legacy of the USMNT.”

Lilian Bours, Chief Marketing Officer of MatchWornShirt, said, “The energy around sports memorabilia in the U.S. has never been higher – and soccer in America is entering a golden era. We're thrilled to give American soccer fans unprecedented access to their National Teams, deepening the emotional connection to their favorite players and celebrating the game's most iconic moments. We turn matchdays into memories – in wearable and collectible form.”

Tijmen Zonderwijk, CEO and Co-founder of MatchWornShirt, commented, “What started as one small auction in the Netherlands has now grown into a global community, and we are excited to bring that same trusted experience to fans in the U.S., starting with their beloved men's and women's national teams.”

Manchester City have opted against including James McAtee in their squad for the Club World Cup as their neighbours Manchester United continue to circle. The snub could prove telling as the academy graduate weighs up his future.

City will jet halfway across the world to play in the tournament but won't go with McAtee, who instead has been added to England's pre-tournament training squad ahead of the U21s Euros in Slovakia.

McAtee has enjoyed moments in a City shirt, but is still very much establishing himself. He scored an FA Cup hat-trick several months ago and has also contributed in the Premier League, but won't get the chance to rub shoulders with the squad's senior stars at the FIFA tournament.

As a result potential suitors are beginning to circle and one of those is the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move, especially as McAtee is tipped to have a bright future.

The Daily Mail reports that Guardiola's decision to overlook him could spell the end of his time on the blue side of Manchester. The Catalan has been honest about the state of affairs and whilst he wants to keep the 22-year-old, he would understand his desire to play regularly.

He said in April: “For the age, I'd like him to stay. But I understand players want more minutes. He can play different positions but I don't know how the squad will be and we will see.”

Another factor at play is that McAtee's contract expires in 2026 - leaving the City hierarchy to either hand him a new deal or cash in before he becomes a free agent. The academy graduate has excelled on loan in the Championship previously, but would command a higher move were he to head away from the Etihad.

McAtee himself is keen on a move to the Bundesliga, where he's been linked with the likes of Bayer Leverkusen. He's seen first-hand how young English players have thrived in the Germany environment with Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham among them.

Letting McAtee leave would represent a risk for Guardiola, who has copped criticism for allowing City's academy products to leave before giving them a proper shot. Several of them have gone on to excel elsewhere, Morgan Rogers among them.

Sounders wore shirts reading ‘Club World Ca$h Grab'

Players' union supported players with statement

The Seattle Sounders wore shirts in the warm-up for the team's game against Minnesota United on Sunday reading “Club World Ca$h Grab,” in protest over the manner in which bonuses from participating in the Club World Cup are being distributed.

Afterwards, the MLS Players Association released a statement expressing solidarity with the Sounders players who, according to the statement “demanded a fair share of Fifa Club World Cup prize money.”

“Fifa's new tournament piles on to players' ever-increasing workload without regard to their physical well-being,” the statement read, before pointing out that Fifa will pay MLS teams large amounts (about $9.5m) to participate in the tournament. “Despite this windfall, the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players themselves.”

In addition to the $9.5m for participating in the tournament, clubs earn more based on performance in the games, drawing from a Fifa prize pool of around $475m. However, the current MLS collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournament, capped at $1m for the entire team.

In effect, that makes for an initial 90/10 split of prize money, with the ratio potentially getting worse if MLS teams advance in the competition.

The MLSPA said in its statement that the players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes to the arrangement, but that the league has “failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.”

Fifa itself does not have any rules governing how teams distribute prize money between front office, players, and associated parties.

 SEOUL, June 2 (Yonhap) -- With his team closing in on a spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, South Korea head coach Hong Myung-bo said Monday he will not push his banged-up captain Son Heung-min too hard in the upcoming qualifying matches.

 South Korea, 23rd in the FIFA rankings, will take on 59th-ranked Iraq at Basra International Stadium in the southern Iraqi city of Basra at 9:15 p.m. Thursday (3:15 a.m. Friday, South Korean time).

 In the third round of the Asian qualifiers, South Korea are leading Group B with 16 points from four wins and four draws. With two matches remaining, they are three points ahead of Jordan and four above Jordan.

 South Korea only need one more point to punch their ticket to the World Cup. If they don't get it done this week, South Korea will have another chance against Kuwait in Seoul on June 10.

Hong Myung-bo, head coach of the South Korean men's national football team, speaks to reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, on June 2, 2025, before departing for Iraq for a World Cup qualifying match. (Yonhap)



 And Hong said Son, who has just returned from a foot injury, will be used conservatively over the next two matches.

 Son missed about a month, from mid-April to mid-May, with that injury. He played limited minutes for Tottenham Hotspur when they defeated Manchester United for the UEFA Europa League title on May 21.

 "He and I have not yet discussed exactly how much he will play. But my staff and I already know all about his drive and his desire to play," Hong told reporters at Incheon International Airport, just west of Seoul, before departing for Iraq. "Since we have two matches coming up (to try to qualify for the World Cup), I will not push him too hard. Once we get to Iraq, we will decide which of the two matches we will focus on."

 Even if Son doesn't play big minutes in Iraq this week, Hong said veterans, such as Son, can also help the team in other areas.

 "We will probably play in a hostile environment in front of partisan fans," the coach said. "We have some players who have had experience playing in these situations. It's something we should keep in mind going into the stadium for this match."

 When unveiling his 26-man squad last Monday, Hong said he had left out some Europe-based players because they had been idle since their club seasons ended in early May and because he felt players in the domestic K League 1, currently in the middle of the season, would bring more to the table.

 Hong noted that he isn't as concerned about the players he did select from European clubs, including Lee Kang-in of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Hwang Hee-chan of Wolverhampton Wanderers, because they have remained sharp through their club or individual training.

 Lee and PSG won the UEFA Champions League title Saturday. Though Lee didn't play, he took part in PSG training sessions right up until the big final.

 "I don't think players like Hwang Hee-chan and Lee Kang-in will have any conditioning issues," Hong said. "Over the next couple of days, we will have to decide how to incorporate those players into our lineup."

FIFA Club World Cup

Seattle Sounders players took the field ahead of their match against Minnesota United Sunday night wearing protest T-shirts, expressing their disapproval of their potential prize money allocation for the upcoming Club World Cup. The Sounders, along with Inter Miami and — after Saturday night's play-in win over Club América — LAFC, will participate in the tournament, which kicks off on June 14.

Seattle players warmed up for the match wearing shirts emblazoned with a pair of slogans: “Club World Ca$h Grab” and “Fair Share Now.” The Emerald City Supporters, the primary supporters' group of the Sounders, joined the protest as well, chanting the slogans along with a more pointed message: “you dirty greedy bastards.”

All three MLS clubs taking part in the tournament will receive $9.55 million simply for qualifying, the standard allocation set aside by FIFA for any club from Concacaf. That sum grows as teams advance through the tournament, with teams earning $2 million for every win and $1 million for a draw. Simply advancing out of the tournament's group stage would garner another $7.5 million. It is a potentially massive windfall for any MLS team, many of whom lose money every year.

Players, though, are only guaranteed a fraction of that prize pool. The collective bargaining agreement between MLS and its players stipulates specific bonus payouts for tournaments that MLS players typically compete in, like the U.S. Open Cup, Concacaf Champions Cup and Leagues Cup. Their share of the prize pool from tournaments which aren't specifically addressed is capped at $1 million. The Club World Cup was still years from being announced when the CBA was ratified in 2021.

Player payouts in other leagues vary, and Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei addressed the disparity with The Seattle Times in March.

“If you're going to be on the field and playing against an opponent that's making $700,000 for the same appearance, then you're asking yourself, ‘Did we earn the right to play in this game?' If so, I'm not asking for $700,000, but it's a big, big, big difference,” Frei said.

The MLSPA, the labor union that represents MLS players, released its own statement on Sunday, expressing support for Seattle's cause and touching on long-standing concerns with the physical workload placed on MLS players by the sport's ever-expanding schedule.

“FIFA's new tournament piles on to players' ever-increasing workload without regard to their physical well-being. In order to seize this additional calendar territory, FIFA had to commit historic amounts of prize money to secure club and player participation. As a result, MLS will receive an unprecedented windfall. Despite this windfall, the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players themselves.”

The statement also says that the MLSPA's members have “privately and respectfully” invited the league to discuss a potential renegotiation of bonus terms for the Club World Cup but says the league has simply referred them to the terms of the CBA.

“It is the players who make the game possible,” read the statement. “It is the players who are lifting MLS up on the global stage. They expect to be treated fairly and with respect.”

The Sounders will play all three of their group games in the Club World Cup at home, against Botafogo, Atlético Madrid and newly crowned UEFA Champions League winner PSG.

The current United States men's national team camp will be the longest time that Mauricio Pochettino will have the squad together since taking over in September of 2024, but he'll be without even more first team players with Folarin Balogun, DeJuan Jones, and Sean Zawadzki all leaving USMNT camp with injuries. Waker Zimmerman, Nathan Harriel, and Paxten Aaronson have replaced them in the roster for friendlies facing Türkiye and Switzerland ahead of the Gold Cup.

Monaco man Balogun has picked up an ankle injury, which will prevent him from making his first appearance under Pochettino during his tenure. Balogun was out with a shoulder injury when the Argentine was appointed, and now will begin another camp without the top striker in the roster. Balogun won't be the only star missing as Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, and Gio Reyna are also absent.

With the Club World Cup taking place this summer, some players have club obligations that prevent them from taking part in international duty, while Pulisic wasn't named so that he can get rest during the summer. If this were a standard Gold Cup, the absence of stars wouldn't raise many eyebrows due to it being a tournament that favors domestic talent, but with the men's World Cup next summer, this is the last competitive tournament that the USMNT will have ahead of time due to not needing to take part in World Cup qualifying.

Add that in with it being the most time that Pochettino has spent with the first team and it could be a great chance to move past Concacaf Nations League disappointment, where the USMNT not only saw Mexico lift the trophy but also fell in the third place game to Canada as well. There needs to be improvement under Pochettino, it will be tougher to come by if he's not able to get the USMNT core up to speed with his style. 

Balogun's absence presents big opportunities to Patrick Agyemang and Brian White, but if the forwards in camp can't find their scoring touch, the malaise of the team will continue.

Colton Smith and NCAA men's singles champion Michael Zheng are among 22 college players who will benefit from direct entry into ATP Challenger Tour events as part of the third year of the ATP Next Gen Accelerator.

This initative between ATP and the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) was created to increase the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system. Following the NCAA Championships in May, players qualified based on their year-end ranking and/or performance in the NCAA Championships.

Four of the 22 qualifiers — Jack Pinnington Jones, Zheng, Oliver Tarvet and Smith — are multiple-time qualifiers for the Accelerator.


Smith made his ATP Tour debut this year at Indian Wells, where he qualified and defeated Flavio Cobolli in the main draw. The American then advanced to his first ATP Tour quarter-final in Houston.
Rafael Jodar, who was a freshman at the University of Virginia, won the 2024 US Open boys' singles title. Samir Banerjee, the 2021 Wimbledon boys' singles champion, was a junior at Stanford University.
Pinnington Jones, a repeat qualifier from Texas Christian University, defeated Cameron Norrie at an ATP Challenger Tour event last year in Nottingham.

Players ranked in the Top 20 of the ITA final singles rankings who have finished their education are granted up to eight Accelerator Spots at Challenger 50 and 75 tournaments, with opportunities split between main draw (for Top 10 ITA-ranked players) and qualifying (11-20).

Players who reach the quarter-finals or better of the individual NCAA Division I Championships also qualify for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator if not already eligible through their ITA ranking. These opportunities are available from 7 July 2025 for a period of 12 months. 

 Accelerator qualifiers who will continue their education will receive six opportunities over six months (July–December), enabling them to benefit from the programme during their college offseason and parts of their fall season.

Novak Djokovic reached a remarkable milestone with his dominant straight-set win against Cameron Norrie at the 2025 French Open.

The Serbian icon cruised to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory over world No 81 Norrie in the last 16 at the Paris Grand Slam.

Djokovic broke seven times en route to improving his head-to-head record against the 29-year-old Brit to 6-0.

In his on-court interview, Djokovic said: “I feel good. I expect each day to play better and better. I've played 12 really good, solid sets so far. Everything is looking good.”

Asked about reaching 100 wins at Roland Garros, the former world No 1 added: “It's a good number, a happy number for me. But the 101st victory is the most important (laughs).

“It's another victory but it's obviously not finished here for me. I'm happy to add to the history of this sport that has given me so much. I hope there will be another win in a couple of days.”

The No 6 seed has progressed to the quarter-finals without dropping a set in his four dominant wins.

The 24-time major champion will face world No 3 Alexander Zverev in a quarter-final blockbuster. Zverev was leading Tallon Griekspoor 6-4, 3-0 in his fourth round match when the Dutchman was forced to retire.

Tim Henman makes bold Novak Djokovic prediction as he looks beyond Roland Garros

Djokovic's win against Norrie was his 100th victory at the French Open, which makes him the third man to reach a century of wins at a single Grand Slam event.

Rafael Nadal won 112 matches at Roland Garros, while Roger Federer amassed 105 victories at Wimbledon and 102 at the Australian Open.

Djokovic, who celebrated his 38th birthday on May 22, has become the oldest man to reach the French Open quarter-finals since Hungarian Istvan Gulyas in 1971.

With his fourth round win, Djokovic extended his winning streak to eight matches — a run that includes four wins from his 100th ATP singles title run at the Geneva Open ahead of Roland Garros.

The Serb is chasing a fourth French Open title and record-extending 25th Grand Slam overall.

PARIS, France—Watch out, WTA girls—Mirra Andreeva is raiding everyone's closet at Roland Garros.The No. 6 seed stepped onto court for her fourth-round match against good friend and No. 17 seed Daria Kasatkina wearing a long bordeaux-red pleated skirt—the same one that Zheng Qinwen revealed to the Tennis Channel that she's been ‘too shy' to wear herself.Andreeva accessorized with gold earrings shaped like tennis racquets—quickly recognized by tennis fashion fans as part of Paula Badosa's new ‘Aces' jewelry collection.Read More: Paula Badosa set to launch 'Aces' jewelry collection with The 1916 CompanyAnd after sealing the 6-3, 7-5 win over Kasatkina on Monday afternoon, Andreeva gained another accessory: Her opponent's sweaty wristband, after Kasatkina lobbed it in her direction before they exchanged a hug at the net.“I kind of had a feeling that after the match she's gonna do something like this!” Andreeva said in her post-match press conference.“I knew that if I would lose, I would also do something funny to kind of relax a bit the atmosphere and not have this tension and pressure around us.”

“Honestly, I can't imagine people playing their actual matches in this kind of long skirt!” Andreeva told Tennis.com.© Getty Images, Instagram @rolandgarros, Associated Press

With Kasatkina sponsored by Adidas and Andreeva outfitted by Nike, it's unlikely the black wristband will see any on-court action—but it's definitely not going anywhere.“I kept the wristband, so it's gonna be in my bag for now,” Andreeva said with a cheeky grin.Andreeva was also spotted wearing a piece from No. 10 seed Badosa's new “Aces” jewelry collection with The 1916 Company, which launched last month.

Cameron Norrie was knocked out of the French Open in straight sets as Novak Djokovic claimed his 100th win at Roland Garros.

While Jack Draper and Alexander Bublik put on a power-hitting masterclass, the encounter between Norrie and Djokovic was a game of attrition and extended rallies.

Djokovic shrugged off his 38 years to reach the quarter-finals and become the oldest player to do so in the men's draw for half a century.

Asked about his milestone victory, Djokovic said on court afterwards: “It's a good number, but victory 101 would be better, so in search of another win it's obviously not over here for me.

“I am very happy to make history in this sport that I have loved for my whole life and I hope that I will be able to add another victory in two days.”

Norrie needed a medical timeout in the second set for a foot problem that seemed to affect his movement slightly, but Djokovic was the superior player on court throughout for his 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 win.

The contest itself was closer than the scoreline suggests. At one point in the second set, with the score poised at three games apiece, three-time Roland Garros winner Djokovic needed six game points in order to hold, having been broken in the first game.

But as he has done so often in the last few years, when it mattered, Djokovic delivered. There were glimpses of some of his best tennis, swerving down the line passing shots and he looked almost infallible when he came to the net, but he did not need to be at his best to beat 29-year-old Norrie.

As both players employed their drop shots all too frequently – Djokovic used his 18 times in the match – it was the experienced Serbian who benefited.

Djokovic was never really under pressure at any point, only having to hit 26 winners, and only six passing shots, while making fewer unforced errors, 28 to 32 when compared to Norrie.

In the previous round, Norrie only needed three sets to come through a battle of the Britons against Jacob Fearnley, to become one of two British players in the fourth round for the first time since 1963.

Good afternoon and welcome to fourth-round coverage of Cameron Norrie versus Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros.

Norrie has not dropped any sets since his first-round upset win over 11th seed Daniil Medvedev. Since that five-set epic, the Briton has seen off Argentina's Federico Agustin Gomez in round two and countryman Jacob Fearnley in round three, both in straight sets.

Djokovic, a three-time French Open champion, has not dropped a set en route to the second week. The former world No 1 made lightwork of Mackenzie McDonald in round one before dispatching home favourite Corentin Moutet in round two and then Filip Misolic in the third round.

The head-to-head between Norrie and Djokovic is as one-sided as it can get – Djokovic is 5-0 against the Briton. However, Norrie can take solace from the fact their most recent meeting, the Geneva semi-final, a week before the French Open, went the distance. 

Djokovic went on to win that ATP 250 event but it was the second time in their five meetings that Norrie managed to win a set against the Serbian.

Their last meeting at a major was the Wimbledon semi-final in 2022. Norrie won the opening set before Djokovic, who was the eventual champion that year, won 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.

French wildcard Lois Boisson, ranked No. 361, stunned No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula in a thrilling comeback at Roland Garros, reaching her first Grand Slam quarterfinal in her Grand Slam main-draw debut. It was her first meeting vs. a Top 20 player -- and she got the win.

France will be represented in the Roland Garros quarterfinals after all, following a stunning comeback upset by one of the lowest-ranked players to ever make it this far at a Grand Slam event.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

Lois Boisson, the 22-year-old wild card ranked No. 361, shocked No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in their fourth-round meeting on Monday. In front of a delighted crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, Boisson executed the come-from-behind win after 2 hours and 40 minutes of gripping play.

"I [would] not believe that if you tell me that two weeks ago," Boisson said afterwards. "I trust in myself, but yeah, for sure, if you say that, no, I can't believe. Now it's that, and I'm so happy about it."

Contesting her first Grand Slam main draw and only her second tour-level event, Boisson pulled off a historic run in her national capital. The last time a Frenchwoman made it into the Roland Garros singles quarterfinals was 2017, when both Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic made the elite eight.

Boisson is the lowest-ranked woman to make a Grand Slam quarterfinal since former Top 20 player Kaia Kanepi reached the 2017 US Open quarterfinals ranked No. 418. Boisson is also the first woman to make the quarterfinals of her Grand Slam main-draw debut since Carla Suarez Navarro made the last eight here in 2008 as a qualifier.

"For the match point, I really felt very tense, and when I saw that my forehand was a winner, well, the whole pressure went off," Boisson told the French press. "I was just so happy to win and to be able to play the quarterfinals."

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Andreeva awaits: Boisson is now 1-0 against Top 20 players in her career -- her match against World No. 3 Pegula was her first-ever meeting with a player ranked inside that echelon.

Things won't get any easier for the wild card: another of the world's Top 10 players will be Boisson's quarterfinal opponent. She will have her first meeting with No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva, who bested Daria Kasatkina earlier on Monday. 

Regardless, Boisson will reach a career-high ranking after the tournament. She is projected to rise to around No. 120 after this win (WTA 125 results from this week could shift that a few spots). Another upset win in the quarterfinals could push Boisson as high as No. 68 in the PIF WTA Rankings.

"Things are not going to change for me," Boisson said. "They're going to continue in the same way. It's just that my ranking will enable me to play larger, more important tournaments. That's the only thing that's going to change."

French twist: Boisson was the only French player in either the women's or men's singles draws to make it into the Round of 16. And now her fairytale run will continue after her comeback in Monday's match -- which echoes her comeback from an ill-timed injury.

Boisson was projected to receive a Roland Garros main-draw wild card last year after winning her first WTA 125 title on home soil in Saint-Malo. However, before last year's Roland Garros started, Boisson suffered an ACL injury that kept her off tour for nine months.

Back in action in 2025, Boisson made her WTA main-draw debut on home soil in Rouen, reaching the second round. This fortnight, she got her year-delayed Roland Garros wild card to make her Grand Slam main-draw debut. And she backed it all up, beating Elise Mertens in the first round for her first Top 25 win.

After four straight three-set wins, Boisson is now flying the tricolore for the home nation all the way into her first tour-level quarterfinal, at a Grand Slam no less. 

"It's absolutely great to be in the quarterfinals," Boisson said. "My hope is to have as many French people in that level in the coming years. It represents a lot to be in the quarterfinals here, and as I said, I hope to go even further."

Match moments: Pegula's experience wore down the Grand Slam first-timer at the end of the opening set. Pegula cranked a forehand crosscourt winner to break for 4-3, and the American ended up winning ten of the last 11 points to take the one-set lead.

But Boisson kept pace with the No. 3 seed, using her heavy forehand well on the clay. Of the players remaining in the draw at the start of the day, Boisson had the most topspin on her forehand this event (by contrast, Pegula had the least).

Boisson also regularly found passing and lob winners to chip away at Pegula's advantage. In a perfectly constructed point, Boisson fired a rally backhand crosscourt to break for 5-4, then routinely held serve to tie the match at one set apiece.

In a back-and-forth third set, Boisson took control by converting her fourth break point of a tense 4-4 game. Serving for the match at 5-4, Boisson faced four break points herself, but she refused to yield, finishing off the shocking upset.

Boisson is the first player to reach her first WTA Tour-level quarterfinal at a Grand Slam event since Emma Raducanu at the 2021 US Open. It's still a long way away, but she needs just three more wins to replicate Raducanu's result and win a Slam title.

French wildcard Lois Boisson, ranked No. 361, stunned No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula in a thrilling comeback at Roland Garros, reaching her first Grand Slam quarterfinal in her Grand Slam main-draw debut. It was her first meeting vs. a Top 20 player -- and she got the win.

Just 10 days after needing a deciding set to defeat Norrie in the semifinals of the lead-up event in Geneva, 6-4, 6-7 (6), 6-1, Djokovic cruised past him in straight sets in Paris, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, the only real trouble coming in the second set as the Brit opened up a 2-0 lead.But Djokovic held at love and broke right back at love to catch up to 2-all and was never behind again the rest of the match, eventually sealing victory after two hours and 14 minutes on court.He improves to 19-0 in fourth-round matches at Roland Garros.Awaiting the No. 6-seeded Djokovic in the quarterfinals will be No. 3-seeded Alexander Zverev. Djokovic leads the overall head-to-head, 8-5, including 3-1 at Grand Slams—though the only loss was his retirement loss at the Australian Open earlier this year.They've split their only two clay-court meetings, 1-1, with the German winning in the final of Rome in 2017, 6-4, 6-3, and the Serb winning in the quarterfinals of Roland Garros in 2019, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2.This will be their first meeting on this surface in six years.

Novak Djokovic broke new ground Monday at Roland Garros, where he recorded 100 wins at a major event for the first time in his standout career.

The 38-year-old delivered a typically measured performance to dispatch Cameron Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 and reach the quarter-finals at the clay-court major for a 16th consecutive year. Djokovic, a three-time champion at Roland Garros, is just the second player to record 100 wins at the event after 14-time titlist Rafael Nadal (112).

“It's a very pretty number, but 101 victories sounds better,” said Djokovic. “I will continue to search for another victory, it's clearly not finished for me here. I'm very honoured to make history in this sport, which has given me everything in my life."

He is him.Djokovic sails past Norrie 6-2 6-3 6-2 to cement his spot in the QFs once more 👊#rolandgarros #djokovic pic.twitter.com/L5ItXFYY3W

After improving to 19-0 in fourth-round matches at Roland Garros, Djokovic set a quarter-final clash with third seed and last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev. The Serbian leads Zverev 8-5 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having notably retired from their most recent meeting in the semi-finals at the Australian Open in January.

Having defeated Norrie en route to his 100th title in Geneva two weeks ago, Djokovic was aware of the obstacle that stood before him, and he started the quicker on Court Philippe-Chatrier. He nullified the Briton's attempt to extend the rallies with ease, running away with a clinical opening set after the pair traded early breaks.
Aiming to reach the quarter-finals at a Grand Slam for the second time in his career, Norrie shifted to a more aggressive approach in the second set, which coincided with an error-strewn start from Djokovic. Yet the Serbian regrouped with a series of stunning winners and clever points at the net.

Norrie took a medical timeout to treat his left ankle before serving at 3-4 in the second, and it appeared to hamper his momentum further as Djokovic strengthened his grip on the encounter: He won eight of the final 10 games to seal a two-hour, 14-minute victory and become the oldest quarter-finalist at the event since 39-year-old Istvan Gulyas in 1971.
“I feel good. I always have high expectations, I know that I can always play better each day," added Djokovic. "But in the end, it's 12 sets played, 12 sets won, so it's all positive and solid up until now.”
The No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Djokovic is this week chasing a record 25th major title. He now owns an impressive 100-16 record at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Norrie took a medical timeout to treat his left ankle before serving at 3-4 in the second, and it appeared to hamper his momentum further as Djokovic strengthened his grip on the encounter: He won eight of the final 10 games to seal a two-hour, 14-minute victory and become the oldest quarter-finalist at the event since 39-year-old Istvan Gulyas in 1971.
“I feel good. I always have high expectations, I know that I can always play better each day," added Djokovic. "But in the end, it's 12 sets played, 12 sets won, so it's all positive and solid up until now.”
The No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Djokovic is this week chasing a record 25th major title. He now owns an impressive 100-16 record at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Having defeated Norrie en route to his 100th title in Geneva two weeks ago, Djokovic was aware of the obstacle that stood before him, and he started the quicker on Court Philippe-Chatrier. He nullified the Briton's attempt to extend the rallies with ease, running away with a clinical opening set after the pair traded early breaks.

Back in January, Madison Keys shocked the world by capturing her maiden Grand Slam title in Australia. However, the American star is determined to prove her deep run wasn't a one-off, as she has now powered into the French Open quarterfinals—following in the footsteps of Serena Williams.

After defeating compatriot Hailey Baptiste in straight sets (6-3, 7-5), Keys, 30, becomes the oldest American to reach the quarterfinals in women's singles at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season since Serena, 35, in 2016, per Opta Ace. 

The seventh seed will now face fellow American Coco Gauff in the quarterfinals, as Gauff matched a historic Venus Williams record with her win over Yekaterina Aleksandrova in the fourth round.

Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, is looking to match her best result at the French Open, where she reached the semifinals in 2018. She lost to Sloane Stephens in straight sets.

This season, Keys has claimed two titles: the Australian Open and Adelaide. However, she has struggled to make deep runs on clay, with her best result being a quarterfinal finish in Madrid, where she fell to Iga Swiatek.

Gauff, 21, and Keys have faced each other five times, with Keys holding a 3-2 edge. Their most recent clash was in the Round of 16 at Madrid last year, where Keys won in three sets.

In fact, Keys has won their last two meetings, including a victory in Eastbourne in 2023. This will be their second Grand Slam encounter. Gauff won their first, at the 2022 US Open, in straight sets during the Round of 32.

After her Grand Slam debut, Alex Eala has her sights set on a maiden Wimbledon appearance at the end of the grass-court season.

The 20-year-old will become the first Filipina woman to play in the main draw at SW19, having fallen in the third round of qualifying at the tournament back in 2024.

Eala's Grand Slam singles debut at the French Open ended in a three-set defeat to Emiliana Arango, though she was able to win a match in the doubles alongside Renata Zarazua.

Now, all eyes will be on how she fares in her biggest grass-court season to date.

Just days after the end of her clay-court season, Eala is already in the UK for her opening grass-court tournament of the season.

The 20-year-old will be in action at the Birmingham Open, which will be held as a WTA 125 event for the first time after being downgraded from a WTA Tour-level event.

Eala is the third seed in the women's singles draw and has been handed an intriguing opener against world No 152 Linda Fruhvirtova.

Though there is a significant rankings gap between world No 73 Eala and her Czech opponent, it will not be an easy test against an opponent looking to rediscover form after a challenging spell.

Top seed Alycia Parks has already been beaten in Birmingham, meaning Eala will be among those looking to take advantage.

The Filipina was also in the doubles draw in Birmingham, she and partner Rebeka Masarova beaten 6-4, 6-4 in a tough match against second seeds and established doubles stars Ellen Perez and Storm Hunter.

After competing in Birmingham, Eala will immediately head to Ilkley for the second of two WTA 125 events held in the UK on grass.

The world No 73 will be among the leading contenders for the title, with world No 53 and recent new WTA Tour champion Maya Joint currently in line to be the top seed.

The event has been upgraded from 2024, having previously been an ITF-level event.

It will be Eala's main draw debut at the tournament, which will be held from June 8-15.

Among the other notable names entered alongside Eala and Joint are defending champion Rebecca Marino and Yuliia Starodubtseva.

Eala's grass-court season will culminate in perhaps the most famous tournament of them all, the 20-year-old set for her second Grand Slam main-draw appearance at the All England Club.

The Filipina just missed out on a main-draw debut last year after a tight straight-sets defeat in the final round of qualifying to Lulu Sun – who went on to reach the quarter-final of the women's singles event.

Much like with Roland Garros, Eala's ranking was high enough for her to automatically enter the main draw without having to worry about qualifying in 2025.

PARIS (AP) — Loïs Boisson had never even played at the French Open before, let alone in the biggest arena at Roland-Garros, and now the unseeded 21-year-old Frenchwoman is through to the quarterfinals.

Boisson, a wild card entry ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating third-seeded American Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier in Monday's fourth-round play.

Quite some victory, considering Pegula was the U.S. Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points.

After Pegula missed an easy-looking winner at the net, and then clutched her head in her hands, Boisson had her first match point, and the biggest point of her career so far.

Pegula returned a strong serve to the back of the court, where Boisson unleashed a brilliant forehand winner down the line. She then raised her arms in the air, realising the enormity of her win.

“I really don't know what to say, but ‘Thank you to all of you'" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview. “Playing on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.”

Boisson made the notoriously hard-to-please crowd laugh when she added: “I'm really happy on here. I can stay a long time if you like.”

The crowd broke into chants of “Loïs, Loïs" and she waved back to them.

She was in the news last month. British player Harriet Dart apologized to Boisson after asking the chair umpire to tell her to put some deodorant on. Now she's the only French player — male or female — left at Roland-Garros.

Asked what her ambitions were for the rest of the tournament — she plays sixth-seeded Mirra Andreeva on Wednesday in the quarterfinals — she replied, “I hope to win, right?”

That prompted more laughter from the crowd at Court Philippe-Chatrier, which included tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who has been criticized in some quarters for the lack of women playing in the night session.

Top-ranked Jannik Sinner was playing his fourth-round match later Monday in the night session against No. 17 Andrey Rublev, following 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic's match against Britain's Cameron Norrie.

In other women's fourth-round play, second-seeded Coco Gauff, the 2023 U.S. Open champion, won 6-0, 7-5 against No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova.

Over on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, the 18-year-old Andreeva, who reached the semifinals at Roland-Garros last year for her best performance at a major, won 7-5, 6-3 against No. 17 Daria Kasatkina. She playfully threw her wristband at Andreeva when they came to the net and Andreeva joked she would keep it.

No. 7 Madison Keys also advanced on Court Suzanne-Lenglen after beating Hailey Baptiste 6-3, 7-5 in an all-American contest. There's another one coming up for Keys against Gauff.

In remaining men's fourth-round play, No. 3 Alexander Zverev, last year's runner-up, was leading 6-4, 3-0 against Tallon Griekspoor when the unseeded Dutch player retired from the match. He later said it was due to an abdominal strain.

The quarterfinals are underway, with two men's matches and two women's matches, all on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka faces Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng followed by defending women's champ Iga Swiatek against No. 13 Elina Svitolina.

The first men's contest sees eighth-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti take on No. 15-seeded American Frances Tiafoe, before defending champion Carlos Alcaraz plays 12th-seeded American Tommy Paul. ___

PARIS (AP) — Coco Gauff might have earned her fifth consecutive trip to the French Open quarterfinals with a straight-set victory Monday, but she still is catching flak because she forgot to bring her rackets to a match earlier in the tournament.

The No. 2-seeded Gauff, who won the 2023 U.S. Open and was the runner-up in Paris in 2022, has been engaging in a bit of back-and-forth with another American and Roland-Garros quarterfinalist, Frances Tiafoe, over the equipment blunder.

Tiafoe teasingly called the 21-year-old Gauff “Mrs. Mature.” Gauff's retort: “I feel like maybe just playing tennis, it forces you to grow up faster for some people. Maybe not him.”

It was Tiafoe who first made that very mistake back in March, showing up for a match at the tournament in Indian Wells, California, without his rackets. He got plenty of ribbing on social media and from other players — including Gauff.

So when Gauff went to Court Philippe-Chatrier for her first-round match last week and opened her bag only to realize there weren't any rackets inside, the 27-year-old Tiafoe was only too happy to call her out.

“She was full out shaking her whole bag like it was an empty cookie jar on Chatrier. I was like, ‘What are you doing?' ... I'm going to keep ripping her for a long time. I've never seen someone (ranked No. 2) in the world have zero things in her bag. That was incredible,” said Tiafoe, who will play in the quarterfinals Tuesday.

“That kind of thing is so big because it just makes everyone (realize) we're all human. People make mistakes, whether it's the team or her or whatever,” he said, then added with a smile: “That was a funny moment, especially (because) she tries to be Mrs. Mature. That was great. I'm happy it happened to her. Hopefully it happens again.”

Gauff acknowledged she couldn't really offer much of a retort.

“I literally told him: 'From you, I expected it. From you, it's OK, but the fact that it happened to me ... .' Because I feel like I'm a professional person, and usually I am someone — if anybody knows me — I'm someone that can find the comeback real quick. Even if I'm wrong, I'm one of those people that will still defend myself. I don't like losing arguments," Gauff said Monday after beating No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-0, 7-5 in the fourth round.

“But that one, I just had to take it. I learned that I had nothing to say, especially because I gave him a lot of (hassle) for it,” she said, “and then not even six months later, I did the same thing on an even bigger stage. But I have learned my lesson, and hopefully it won't happen again."

Next for Gauff is an all-American matchup in Wednesday's quarterfinals against No. 7 Madison Keys, who won the Australian Open in January. Keys eliminated yet another American, Hailey Baptiste, 6-3, 7-5.

As for Tiafoe's barb about “Mrs. Mature" — stemming from how Gauff carries herself on the court and off after breaking through at Wimbledon at age 15 and collecting her first Grand Slam title at 19 — she said she hears that type of comment a lot.

“I definitely for sure feel like I'm sometimes, when I was a junior, especially more mature than maybe some of my peers. I don't know why. I feel like I have always been that. When I was in school, I would always be the first one to class. I remember getting yellow for the behavior chart once, and that was like the worst day of my life,” Gauff said. “I'm definitely someone that prides myself in being a good example. I think it's because I have two younger brothers, and I feel like I have to be that example.”

The Frenchwoman is the lowest-ranked player to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2017.ByEd McGroganPublished Jun 02, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 02, 2025

In a colossal upset, 361st-ranked Lois Boisson, a 22-year-old French wild card and Grand Slam main-draw debutant, has defeated third-seeded Jessica Pegula in the fourth round of Roland Garros, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.Boisson entered the tournament with one main-draw, tour-level match win on the season: a 6-0, 6-3 victory over 110th-ranked Harriet Dart at Rouen. She now has five, and none more unlikely this one.Pegula, whose strengths are amplified on surfaces faster than red clay, had still never lost to an unseeded player at Roland Garros. She was also 19-2 against opponents ranked outside the Top 100 at Grand Slams.Despite all that, Boisson has become the lowest-ranked player to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2017, when 418th-ranked Kaia Kanepi did so at the US Open.

Boisson came into this match with nothing to lose, and even more so when she trailed by a set and 4-3. From there, she used every tool in her impressive arsenal, from massive inside-out forehands to scrappy defense to drop shots, to unsettle Pegula—and unleash the partisan crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier for the first time.“She's got about 10 people in this stadium who are cheering for her,” noted Lindsay Davenport about Pegula, on the TNT broadcast.Five games later, and Pegula was down 2-0 in third.“Jessie's got to stop the bleeding right here,” said Davenport. “The fans are a real thing.“She's not only fighting the game of Boisson, she's fighting the fans.”

The circumstances of this match were not unlike Pegula's quarterfinal against Alexandra Eala in Miami. Playing an out-of-nowhere underdog on a big stage, with most fans against her and everything to lose, the American remained calm under pressure.It was enough to see her through that night in Florida, but not on Monday in France.Pegula began a turnaround by, first off, simply reducing errors. Boisson—who came into the match having hit the most winners of any player in the women's draw—troubled Pegula late in the second set by making her hit one more ball, time and again. Once Pegula cleaned up her game, she found ways to generate pace, and started using something Boisson was doing against her: the drop shot. A doubles veteran, Pegula began to draw Boisson to net with the slow ball and finish points with simple, crisp volleys.

But despite regaining control of the contest, Pegula could not create enough distance from her challenger. She went just 1 for 6 on break points in the third set—failing to convert at 30-40, while leading 3-2, proved pivotal—as Boisson remained uber-aggreesive and dictated play against the heavy favorite. She looked like the higher-ranked player in the decider, and would be rewarded for her against-all-odds effort.Pegula would earn four break points in the final game, but all four would vanish. The first was erased with a Boisson mishit, but the final miss was the most painful, when a short Pegula volley strayed an inch or so wide.That felt like Pegula's last chance, and indeed it was. Two points later, and a big Boisson forehand—one as big as this upset—sealed a shocker on the terre battue.

There are few in the history of tennis who would have been able to compete with stars like Serena and Venus Williams, and there were not many within their generation who managed to do so.

It's a testament to their dominant and relentless success that the time between their first Grand Slam title, won by Serena in 1999, and their last, again won by Serena in 2017, spans 18 years.

In between that time, they racked up a combined tally of 30 majors, as two of the most successful tennis players in the history of the game.

And yet, there was actually one player who continued to thwart Serena on the biggest of stages, with Justine Henin a constant thorn in the side of the 24-time Grand Slam champion.

For many, Henin was regarded as Serena Williams' greatest-ever rival alongside Venus, given the fact that the Belgian truly pushed the legendary American for a huge chunk of her career before her early retirement.

It's telling that, when Serena lost the world number one in 2002, it coincided with Henin's first-ever Grand Slam title. And then, when she snatched that top spot back in 2008, it also came at the same time as Henin's decline.

During that period, the 43-year-old, born in Liege, won more majors (7 v 4), had a positive head-to-head of five wins and three losses, and an even more impressive record of four wins and one loss in Grand Slams against one another.

Naturally, there are alternative factors to consider for this period, such as Williams' torrid injury record coinciding with Henin's peak.

With that in mind, many can argue for Venus, and it would be a valid claim.

But Henin, with a patented one-handed backhand that John McEnroe dubbed the best of all time, certainly deserves to be in the conversation for Serena's greatest rival.

Frustratingly for Henin, her career was cut cruelly short in 2011 when she finally called time on a glittering career.

Having won seven Grand Slam titles, including a magical 2007 run to the US Open title where she beat both Serena and Venus on her way to the final, she is widely regarded as one of the best players of her generation.

In early January of 2011 though, at just 28 years of age, she cited a chronic elbow injury as the reason behind her decision to quit tennis.

She claimed: ‘In these recent months I have rarely been spared of the pain. The doctors told me my elbow is too fragile and therefore I cannot continue my profession at this high level.

‘I'm in shock, of course. After having considered the advice of doctors, it is now clear and accepted that my career finally ends.'

Regardless of the frustrating nature of Henin's retirement, she is still remembered fondly over a decade on from such a sad decision.

ROLAND GARROS, PARIS — One year ago, Loïs Boisson had her tennis dream dashed.

After tearing through the third rung of professional women's tennis, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) awarded Boisson a wild card for the French Open. A week before, at a minor tournament in Paris, Boisson tore her anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and missed nine months of tennis. She didn't even watch the tournament on television.

Twelve months after the pain, Boisson was on Court Philippe-Chatrier, soaking in the adoration of a French crowd. She upset Jessica Pegula, the world No. 3, to reach the French Open quarterfinals. She is the first French woman to reach the last eight at Roland Garros since Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic in 2017, after beating Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

“I don't know what to say,” Boisson told the crowd in French on court. “I knew before the match that there was a possibility, but I knew that she was very tough … I gave my all and in the end I won.”

Boisson looked a little overawed by the occasion in the first set, as Pegula's relentless accuracy and consistency from the baseline ground her down and drew her into mistakes. Boisson couldn't read the American's drop shots and was often scrambling to no avail after being pushed further and further to the back of the court. Boisson is the world No. 361 as she makes her return from injury, and the 358 places were showing.

But Boisson did not wilt, and the slow filling-up of the lower bowl of Chatrier was a barometer for how she worked her way into the match. Boisson figured out that she could make Pegula hesitate in coming to the net, with a combination of drop shots and lobs that left the American in two minds.

At 4-4 in the second set, the pressure started to tell. Pegula missed two groundstrokes she will likely never miss at a major again, before Boisson cracked a backhand crosscourt to take the set.

Riding a wave of tricolores and chants of “Loïs,” Boisson broke Pegula in the first game of the third set, but the American came back to reel off three games as Boisson went from sparkling to flat — and the crowd did too.

But at 4-4, just as in the second set, her combination of high, heavy spin and elite redirection on her forehand — dragging Pegula this way and that — put more doubts in the American's mind. She missed a backhand from the middle of the court at deuce, and a point later, Boisson was serving for the match.

With Boisson down 30-40, both players tightened. Pegula waifed a backhand over the net and then hit a clever short, angled forehand, but Boisson eked it over and the ball died at Pegula's feet. The American earned a second break point, but the crowd rose to Boisson again. A drop-shot-lob combination spinning over Pegula's head — the play that had given her a foothold in the match in the first place — brought the crowd to its feet and saw Boisson raise her arms for noise for the first time.

By the final game, Court Philippe-Chatrier was almost full. Word moved around the ticket-holders, likely waiting for Novak Djokovic's match to follow this one, that one of their own was doing something special. Another break point. Another drop shot. A flick from Pegula that dropped wide, the American leaning on the net in disbelief.

A net cord off a Pegula return sent Boisson scrambling forward to a ball she somehow dug out. She played the next shot, a volley off a weak lob, like she wanted it to land on a pillow, not some clay. Pegula got to it but could only net.

On her first match point, Boisson sent a forehand inside-in and raised her arms to a roar that shook Chatrier. It was Boisson's roar after the handshake, arms out and screaming into the sky, that made the past 12 months melt into air.

Australian Open figures have been left stunned by suggestions that the tournament could be pushed back to February, Express Sport has learned. Speculation over a new date for the first Grand Slam of the year intensified after former pro Patrick McEnroe claimed that it could be moved to create a longer winter break.

McEnroe suggested that talks over a new date had happened and that there was a ‘plan' for the Australian Open to be shifted. Players, particularly those at the top of the game, have complained about the broadening calendar and the large volume of tournaments they need to play. Last September, Carlos Alcaraz suggested that tennis bosses risked ‘killing' stars by adding more tournaments to their already packed schedules.

In a conversation about the calendar during TNT Sports' US coverage of the French Open on Saturday, seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe suggested that the Australian Open should move. His brother, Patrick, a commentator and former player, responded: “I'm hearing rumblings that it could move to February.”

But Express Sport has learned that there is no truth to these rumours after speaking with Tennis Australia sources. There was confusion over where the speculation might have started, followed by categorical denial.

Next year's Australian Open begins on January 12 and ends on February 1.



Patrick McEnroe went on to suggest that moving the Australian Open would open a window for a new tournament, potentially played in the Middle East. He said: “Of course, there'd probably be another big tournament put in in early January, that's part of potentially the plan. Middle East, hello?”

“It's pretty typical of all sports like in the NBA you see players taking nights off under contract. In tennis the difference is you don't play you don't get paid. No guaranteed contracts. Top players have big endorsement deals but even those normally have stipulations that the players have to play certain events or be ranked at a certain spot to collect the money.”

Alcaraz is the most high-profile player to complain about the schedule. There was a 49-day break between the final of the ATP Tour Finals and the first round of the Australian Open. Prize money is the main source of income for many professional players, meaning they are compelled to enter as many tournaments as possible and risk injuries and burnout.

Last September, Alcaraz said: “I'm the kind of player who think there is a lot of tournaments during the year. Mandatory tournaments, and probably during the next few years, [there are] going to be even more tournaments, more mandatory tournaments. So, I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way.”

A few months later, ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi confessed sympathy with players who feel they do not get enough of a break during the winter. He said: “We have expanded the Masters 1000, and in the 96-draw Masters, there is theoretically one more match only if you reach the final. I agree with the players when they say that the off-season is too short and the Davis Cup also has an impact on this.

“With the new format, many players play in November, once only those from the teams that reached the final, the others went on vacation. Now you don't have enough time to rest, rebuild your body and start playing tennis again.”

Serena Williams was a trailblazer on and off the court.

The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion amassed over $95 million in career earnings and is widely regarded as the GOAT female tennis player.

The retired tennis ace continually pushed the boundaries during her playing career, especially when it came to fashion.

Serena's iconic 'superhero' outfit forced an entire rule change at the 2018 French Open.

At the same tournament 16 years prior, Williams caused a stir by playing in a custom tennis kit inspired by the Cameroonian national team.

The year was 2002 and the French Open happened to overlap with the World Cup in Japan and Korea.

The Indomitable Lions, led by ex Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o, were embroiled in their own kit controversy that summer when then their sleeveless shirts were banned from the 2002 World Cup.

FIFA banned the Cameroonian squad from wearing their signature sleeveless shirts because they were 'vests' and not 'shirts'.

When the World Cup eventually rolled around, the African nation protested FIFA's decision by wearing the same shirts but with black sleeves underneath them.

Puma were the creative minds behind the iconic shirts, and just so happened to be Serena's sponsor as she headed to Paris that year.

At the time, the 20-year-old phenom was the world no. 3 and in search of her second Grand Slam title after winning on home soil at the 1999 US Open.

Sensing an opportunity, Williams and Puma collaborated on their own version of the banned Cameroonian kit for her to wear at Roland  Garros.

During the first two rounds of the second Grand Slam of the year, Serena rocked a sleeveless green dress trimmed with red, black and yellow, which prominently featured the Cameroon crest. 

The homage to the 2002 World Cup team was complete with yellow high socks, matching green and yellow shoes, and a color- coordinated headband to match.

Serena even requested a no. 26 to be stitched onto the back as a nod to her birth date, but it was rejected by tournament organizers.

“Since I always wear sleeveless things, Puma came up with this idea for me during the French Open to wear the Cameroon outfit, which is really exciting,” Serena explained at the time.

“I was reading an article where it says that Cameroon is everyone's favorite team,” she added. “[Even] if you're supporting England, a lot of people have this love for Cameroon because they're always fighting so much it seems. They're the best African team."

Sadly, Cameroon failed to get out of their group at the 2002 World Cup, finishing in third place in Group E, ahead of Saudi Arabia but behind the Republic of Ireland and Germany.

Fortunately, Serena fared much better at Roland Garros, but only after switching up her Cameroon-inspired outfit.

From the third round until the final, she wore a black and gold outfit with matching shoes.

She faced big sister Venus, who had recently beat her in the 2001 US Open final, in that year's showpiece.

That seemed to spur Serena on as she won the match 7-5, 6-3 to claim her maiden French Open title.

Out of nine Williams sisters Grand Slam finals, this was the only contest on the Parisian clay.

Williams would win four straight majors – the 'Serena Slam' (all four majors in a row but not during one season) - across 2002 and 2003.

She also beat Venus in three straight finals that year (2002 French Open, 2002 Wimbledon and 2002 US Open).

Serena would go on to claim her second and third French Open titles in 2013 and 2015 before retiring from the sport in 2022.

The 43-year-old has been focusing on family and business but did nit at a sensational return to tennis.

"I'm ready to hit some balls again," she wrote on social media.

Announcing the end of her glittering 26-year career in August 2022 in Vogue magazine, Williams revealed that she struggled making the call to retire, but ultimately did so to focus on her young family.

She said of her career: "I don't want it to be over, but at the same time I'm ready for what's next.

"I started a family. I want to grow that family."

The star added: "Maybe the best word to describe what I'm up to is evolution. I'm here to tell you that I'm evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.

Sister Venus, meanwhile, is over 30 years into her WTA career, although during recent years she has been plagued by injury, particularly to her knee.

However, the 44-year-old is still around the game, having still yet to official retire, serving as a broadcaster for TNT Sports at this year's French Open.

Williams is on commentary duties alongside Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, John McEnroe, and Caroline Wozniacki.

This will be Williams' first major broadcasting role at a Slam since stepping back from full-time competition.

"I know what it's like to battle on the clay, and I'm looking forward to sharing that experience,” Williams said in a press release.

She has been watching the likes of Coco Gauff make a run, but ruled out coaching her compatriot for one specific reason.

Having the French Open on as Paris Saint-Germain won the Champions League provided some logistical problems 

Novak Djokovic has revealed that French Open security officials held discussions about keeping players on-site on Saturday night rather than allowing them to return to their hotels.

The Serbian tennis star disclosed the unusual security measures were considered due to chaos on Paris streets following PSG's historic Champions League victory over Inter Milan.

The chief of security at Roland Garros debated the unprecedented step amid concerns over player safety as celebrations erupted across the French capital after the football club's first-ever European Cup triumph."There was quite a debate in the locker room with the chief of security whether we should go to the hotel," Djokovic explained to TNT Sports presenters Tim Henman and Laura Robson on Sunday afternoon.Novak Djokovic revealed that French Open officials were considering keeping players in roomsReutersHe revealed that officials considered housing players in rooms around Roland Garros rather than risk the journey to their accommodation."At one point, they were discussing whether we should stay in one of the rooms somewhere around Roland Garros, because where we are staying is quite close to the Arc de Triomphe," Djokovic said.The proximity to the famous landmark proved problematic as it became a focal point for celebrating PSG supporters."It was quite a scene yesterday and there was a lot of troubles on the streets.

He revealed that officials considered housing players in rooms around Roland Garros rather than risk the journey to their accommodation.

"At one point, they were discussing whether we should stay in one of the rooms somewhere around Roland Garros, because where we are staying is quite close to the Arc de Triomphe," Djokovic said.

The proximity to the famous landmark proved problematic as it became a focal point for celebrating PSG supporters.

Cruz Hewitt has rekindled memories of his dad Lleyton's battling heyday as he went down fighting in his first-round contest in the boys' event at the French Open.

The 16-year-old son of Australia's former world No.1, who had gone through qualifying to make the event at Roland Garros, proved a handful on Sunday for Italian Pierluigi Basile, two years his senior and higher-placed in the world junior standings, before succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 5-7 6-3.

Hewitt lost the tightest of opening sets on a breaker and looked practically down and out as Basile served for the match at 5-3 in the second set and earned a match point at 5-4, but the Sydney youngster fought tigerishly to turn it around and take the match into a decider.

The Italian had the superior firepower but Hewitt wouldn't lie down, revving up the the galleries packed round the tight court No.4 with the sort of crowd-rousing exhortations taken straight from his father's book.

Ultimately, he lost in two hours 10 minutes, unable to reach the second round as he had done at the junior event in January at the Australian Open, where he also lost in the first round in the qualifiers for the senior event.

The loss marked Cruz's grand slam return after his time at this year's tournament in Melbourne was marked by controversy surrounding him and fellow Aussie Nick Kyrgios.

Hewitt survived being down 5-3 in the second set, then giving his opponent match point before turning it around to take the match to a deciding set

Cruz (pictured with his famous parents Lleyton and Bec) also lost in the first round when he competed at the Australian Open earlier this year

Kyrgios was accused of harassing Hewitt over a photo the youngster posted to social media showing him posing with world No.1 Jannik Sinner, who was awaiting his punishment for breaching anti-doping rules at the time.

Kyrgios, who has been a vocal critic of Sinner, was not happy at seeing the 16-year-old with the Italian. 

Kyrgios commented under Cruz's post: 'Love ya Cruz but this is wild', then later adding 'Cooked post' with a needle emoji.

The Aussie firebrand also wrote: 'Thought we were boys' with several broken-heart emojis, with his comments drawing heavy fire from tennis fans and great of the game Andy Roddick.

Kyrgios later explained that he's good friends with Cruz and his remarks were a joke between the pair.

On Monday, 16-year-old Emerson Jones, the world's No.2 female junior, kicks off her campaign as top seed in the girls' event against US qualifier Capucine Jauffret, while the other Australian in the boys' tournament Ty Host will face US sixth seed Benjamin Willwerth.

Hewitt wasn't the only son of a famous player to feature in Sunday's program, with fifth seed Jagger Leach, whose mother is American former triple grand slam winner Lindsay Davenport, beating Kazakh Zangar Nurlanuly 6-1 1-6 6-0.

Tennis fans were left in awe of Cruz Hewitt's display at the French Open on Sunday, but saddened that he couldn't progress past the first round of the junior boys event. The 16-year-old showed the same trademark fight that was common in father Lleyton's matches, taking his older and higher-ranked opponent to the brink.

Cruz went through qualifying to make the junior event at Roland Garros, and proved a handful on Sunday for Pierluigi Basile. The Italian player is two years older and higher-placed in the world junior standings at No.24, compared to Hewitt at 41.

The 16-year-old Aussie managed to win the second set against his 18-year-old opponent, before succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 5-7 6-3. Hewitt lost a very tight opening set in a tie-breaker, and looked headed for a straight-sets exit when Basile served for the match at 5-3 in the second.

Basile also had a match point at 5-4, but Hewitt managed to reel off four consecutive games to send the match to a decider. The Aussie youngster was revving up the crowd and willing them to keep him in the contest, showing the same grit and determination that his father showed.

But in the end Hewitt ran out of steam and it was Basile advancing to the second round. The Aussie lost in two hours and 10 minutes, unable to reach the second round as he had done at the junior event in January at the Australian Open.

Hewitt had also lost in the first round in the senior qualifying event in Melbourne after being granted a wildcard. The 16-year-old is trying to emulate his famous father and make a career of his own, but has so far failed to make it past the second round of a junior grand slam event. Fans were left impressed by his performance on Sunday, but disappointed he couldn't go any further.

He wasn't the only son of a famous player to feature on Sunday, with fifth seed Jagger Leach beating Kazakh player Zangar Nurlanuly 6-1 1-6 6-0. Leach is the son of American former triple grand slam winner Lindsay Davenport.

Hewitt's fellow Aussie 16-year-old Emerson Jones - the world's No.2 female junior - will kick off her campaign as top seed in the girls' event against US qualifier Capucine Jauffret on Monday (local time), The other Australian in the boys' tournament (Ty Host) will face US sixth seed Benjamin Willwerth.

The only Australian remaining in the senior singles tournament is Daria Kasatkina, after Alexei Popyrin proved no match for Tommy Paul on Sunday night. Popyrin's encouraging week in Paris ended in anti-climatic fashion after a crushing 6-3 6-3 6-3 loss to 12th seed Paul in the fourth round.

"I'm definitely happy with my week's work, just disappointed with the way it ended," the 25-year-old said. "Look, if I lost this match and I played good tennis then, then I would have been sufficed and happy, but I lost and didn't play my best, really didn't do what I wanted to do, what I've been what I've been banging on about all week, consistency.

"There was no consistency today, it was a very, very up-and-down match. And it was just not the way I planned for it."

MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF: Verstappen made contact with Russell and Leclerc – but why were they racing each other in the first place?

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has admitted that contact with George Russell in the Spanish Grand Prix “was not right and shouldn't have happened” – as Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner urged his lead driver to “keep his nose clean” in upcoming races, with the four-time champion now one penalty point away from an automatic race ban.

Verstappen picked up three penalty points in Barcelona after a late collision with George Russell's Mercedes.

That moves the Dutchman to 11 penalty points – one point away from a ban. The points accrue across a rolling 12-month period, with none coming off Verstappen's tally until the end of June. Before that date, Verstappen must negotiate both the Canadian Grand Prix and Red Bull's home race in Austria.

Verstappen was handed the three penalty points for the crash with Russell late on in the Grand Prix on Sunday, after a chaotic restart saw contact between the Red Bull and both Charles Leclerc's Ferrari and then Russell's Mercedes.

A Safety Car had been called after Kimi Antonelli parked up in a gravel trap following a power unit issue. While Verstappen was fitted with hard tyres for the restart, those around him had softs – and thus the Dutchman was at an immediate disadvantage.

He was lying third behind the two McLarens but lost a place to Leclerc along the straight, with the two banging wheels in an incident that the stewards decided required no further action. Russell then dived down the inside into Turn 1, making contact with Verstappen which sent the Red Bull driver onto the escape road.

While he emerged ahead of Russell, the team ordered him to give the place back – and it was in this moment the second contact was made. The stewards decided Verstappen was to blame, handing him a 10-second time penalty and those three penalty points on his super licence.

Writing on Instagram after the race, Verstappen said: “We had an exciting strategy and good race in Barcelona, [until] the Safety Car came out. Our tyre choice at the end and some moves after the [Safety Car] restart fuelled my frustration, leading to a move that was not right and shouldn't have happened.

“I always give everything out there for the team and emotions can run high. You win some together, you lose some together. See you in Montreal.”

Team boss Horner, meanwhile, was asked how concerned he was at the prospect of losing Verstappen from his line-up for a race should he pass the 12-point threshold.

“You can never guarantee anything,” said Horner. “He's just got to keep his nose clean in the next couple of races. Then the first points come off at the end of June.”

Verstappen is due to drop two points from his licence on June 30, those earned for a collision with Lando Norris at last year's Austrian Grand Prix.

That would take him back to nine points – buying him some breathing room, although the next points will not be removed from his licence until the end of October.

Last season saw Kevin Magnussen banned for one race after accruing 12 penalty points, the Dane sitting out the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for Haas, with the team running Oliver Bearman in his place.

Should Verstappen hypothetically fall foul of a one-race ban, Red Bull could choose to promote one of their two Racing Bulls drivers in Liam Lawson or Isack Hadjar, or run a driver from their pool of talent such as Ayumu Iwasa or Arvid Lindblad.

The comedian broke down some of the biggest moments from season two during a FYC conversation with Jack Black.


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	In a meeting of the comedy minds, Nathan Fielder sat down with Jack Black on Sunday afternoon for a conversation about The Rehearsal, his buzzy HBO series that dove deep into the aviation industry. 


	In the second season of the show, Fielder spent two-and-a-half years becoming a real pilot, on a journey to support his hypothesis that co-pilot-to-pilot communication is the leading cause of plane crashes. He told Black — who questioned how he got the FYC event moderator gig, suggesting Christopher Nolan instead — that he had been interested in commercial aviation disasters for almost 20 years and noticed that pilot communication was a common thread.

	In the season two finale, Fielder actually flies a 737, with 150 actors as passengers. Black declared when he was watching the show, “You tricked me because I thought we were heading towards a Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. You're going to be sitting at a panel, you're going to be talking to all of the members of Congress about flight safety; and then you pulled a switcheroo on us, and the finale episode is actually you've learned how to fly a 737, an unbelievable twist I did not see coming.”

	“If I could get in front of the Congress panel, I would have done that and I will still do that, if they will have me,” Fielder responded, pointing out how the FAA made a statement this week about the show, which he had previously called “dumb.” He touched on it again at the event, saying, “They don't seem to know what they're talking about, truly.” 

	











	Fielder explained that once he had the basic idea for the show, he figured that the best way to truly understand the aviation industry was to become a pilot himself, which would “also help me when I'm talking to these pilots, to be like, ‘Hey, I'm a pilot too.'”


	“I wanted to get to the point where I was like, even though it's a small plane, still if I'm a commercial pilot it takes a lot of work. And I was like, well, that'll really help me go through the mindset but also sort of show that I'm trying to take this seriously. And so that was the initial goal,” he continued. “And then flying the big plane thing, we didn't actually know that we could do that for sure until, literally, like days before it happened. We were still trying to figure it out.”


	And though him becoming an actual pilot was a surprise to the audience until the final episode, Fielder said he was open about it to the people he talked with on camera. “And then in the edit, we were sort of like, oh, it's more interesting if maybe this is like a reveal in the last episode, rather than having it sort of spread out throughout the season. So part of it was an edit choice.”

	Black asked Fielder now that he is a certified pilot how often he is flying, with the comedian revealing, “I do it when I have time. I just had to send my passport to the Chinese Consulate to get a China crew visa for a flight that I'm supposed to do soon.”


	“But also, when you don't fly all the time, it gets a little scary,” he admitted to laughs from the crowd. “So anyways, I'm gonna do it I think, but it's like when there's large spaces in between each flight, you start to be like, should I get some more practice maybe? But I'm sure it's fine, right? I mean, I passed the test, so I must know what I'm doing.” 

	











	With an entire episode dedicated to the life of Sully Sullenberger, who famously landed a plane on the Hudson River in 2009, Fielder also revealed, “I haven't spoken to him. I tried to reach out at one point, I wanted to talk to him — it was through someone that represented him, I guess so he didn't reply. I don't think we heard back, but I'm sure he watched it and was probably just shocked at someone figuring out what actually happened in that plane. I assume he just can't actually acknowledge it, because it would be illegal, right?” he deadpanned of his “discovery” in the show that Sullenberger was listening to an Evanescence song on his iPod during the landing.  


	Fielder teased, “The reason we're highlighting him is because he did the right thing in terms of the communication — even though he did wait till they were pretty close to the water. Maybe he could have asked [his co-pilot for his opinion] a little earlier, if I can give any note now that we're sort of peers, I guess. Very few of us have been able to achieve a miracle in the plane, we're a small group. So hopefully he'll reach out now.” 


	Black concluded the screening at Vidiots by telling Fielder, “Your contribution to television and cinema history is magical. I watch it and I laugh so hard and I go, ‘Oh, that's so stupid, that's hilarious.' And then there's this magical thing where it actually solves actual problems and it works. And it's like, how the fuck does he do that? What's happening here?”

"Taylor shined a big bright light on it and showed it could be done successfully," says one music lawyer. What's different now?


													By
												

	Steve Knopper



Four years before Taylor Swift began her crusade to re-record new versions of her early albums so she could own the valuable master recordings, Bowling for Soup did the same. The pop-punk band put out Songs People Actually Liked — Volume 1, note-for-note copies of early quasi-hits such as “Girl All the Bad Guys Want” and “Punk Rock 101,” and justified it by telling fans they were more mature, better musicians and sought to “add some luster” to the originals.


	The band conspicuously did not say the 2015 project's main purpose was to secure the rights to those songs, boost streaming royalties and be able to license them to movies, ads and TV shows. At the time, that seemed crass. “We had to be very careful about never making our audience feel like we were taking advantage of them,” says Jaret Reddick, the band's frontman, by phone from a Disney cruise with his family in Juneau, Alaska. “Shortly after that, Taylor Swift literally educates the entire music population on song ownership. She made it OK for all of us to re-record our stuff and everybody will back us. It was such a blessing.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Swift announced Friday (May 30) that she purchased the master recordings to her first six albums, from 2006's Taylor Swift to 2017's Reputation, from investment firm Shamrock Capital, for an undisclosed price. The sale was the end of a six-year crusade, after music mogul Scooter Braun bought the Nashville record company, Big Machine Label Group, which had released Swift's original recordings. Angered that control of her catalog went to Braun, who'd worked with her enemy Kanye West, Swift tried and failed to buy back the recordings from Braun, then Shamrock, which bought them from Braun for what sources say was around $360 million.


	Swift's strategy — re-recording all six of those albums with most of the original musicians as “Taylor's Versions,” convincing top radio stations to air them and streaming services to emphasize them in playlists while promoting them on her massive tours — has been influential, directly or indirectly, on other artists. It has also led to major labels overhauling their contracts to avoid anybody else replicating “Taylor's Versions.” In part because Swift's re-recordings have muted sales, streaming and licensing for the originals, all three major labels have recently overhauled their contracts to force artists to wait 10, 15 or even 30 years to re-record after departing their labels. “You try to put the shortest re-recording restriction you can get in the record contract — it used to be five years after release, but now I've found they've extended it to 10 years,” says Ben McLane, another music attorney.


	Nonetheless, artists in the post-“Taylor's Versions” age persist in following Swift's lead: Pop-punk band Cartel recently announced it would release a re-recording of its 2005 album Chroma this September. “Artists are re-recording their masters more frequently than they were,” says Josh Karp, a lawyer who represents Cartel and other artists. “Part of that is definitely that Taylor shined a big bright light on it and showed it could be done successfully.”


	Long before Swift, Frank Sinatra, Little Richard, Chuck Berry and many others re-recorded their hits to claim financial control, and the process still happens today, with or without Swift's influence. Switchfoot put out a new version of its 2003 breakthrough The Beautiful Letdown 20 years later; TLC, Wheatus and Paris Hilton have done the same in recent years; and Ashanti announced in 2022 that Swift inspired her to begin a similar project. “It's also a technological issue,” Karp says. “It's simply easier to record now than it was 10, 20, 30 years ago.”


	Swift's crusade, according to Gandhar Savur, a music attorney, has helped young artists better understand the benefits of signing label licensing deals rather than ownership deals. In the former, artists retain control of their recordings, although they're unlikely to get an advance payment from a label to fund an expensive recording project; in the latter, the label pays out that advance money in exchange for ownership of the recordings for as long as several decades. “Historically, artists have said, ‘Don't give away your publishing,' and that message has gotten across. Now I feel like artists are starting to feel that way about their recordings as well,” Savur says. “Part of that is a result of big stories and big headlines and Taylor Swift and whoever else talking about the importance of owning their recordings.”


	After Wheatus finished re-recording its 1999 alt-rock hit “Teenage Dirtbag” in April 2020, and it went viral on TikTok and Instagram during the pandemic lockdown, the new master generated nearly $25,000 for singer-songwriter Brendan Brown, according to Billboard estimates in 2023. Although Swift did not inspire the new version — that would have been original label Sony Music's losing the master recordings, according to Brown — the singer-songwriter has praised Swift for raising the issue. “I would love to see the contract,” Brown said by phone from a tour bus en route to New Jersey after Swift's announcement Friday. “But generally the answer is, ‘Yeah. Nice job. Get 'em.'”

Alex Warren's “Ordinary” remains the biggest song in the world, as it notches a fifth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 and a third week atop Billboard Global Excl. U.S.


	As previously reported, the song takes over at No. 1 on the U.S.-based Billboard Hot 100.


	Meanwhile, sombr scores his first Global 200 top 10 with “Back to Friends” (up 17-9) and MOLIY, Silent Addy, Skillibeng and Shenseea's “Shake It to the Max (Fly)” surges to the top tier on Global Excl. U.S. (16-10), likewise becoming the first top 10 on the tally for each act.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	











	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	“Ordinary” leads the Global 200 with 70.1 million streams (up 1% week-over-week) and 13,000 sold (up 17%) worldwide May 23-29. Further sparking its profile, Warren performed the song on the American Music Awards, broadcast on CBS, May 26.


	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2 on the Global 200, after 18 weeks at No. 1 starting last September (second only to the 19 weeks at No. 1 for Mariah Carey's “All I Want for Christmas Is You” since the chart began); ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” repeats at No. 3, after 12 weeks at No. 1 starting in November; Billie Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” keeps at No. 4, following three weeks at No. 1 last August; and Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” lifts 6-5 after seven weeks on top starting in February 2024.


	sombr's “Back to Friends” hits the Global 200's top 10, bounding 17-9 with 37.7 million streams (up 13%) worldwide. The singer-songwriter (real name Shane Boose) is charting his first two Global 200 entries in the top 20 simultaneously – “Undressed” jumps 19-13, likewise hitting a new high, with both tracks having benefitted from exposure on TikTok.


	“Ordinary” rules Global Excl. U.S. with 50.9 million streams (up 1%) and 5,000 sold (up 6%) outside the U.S.

	











	“Die With a Smile” is steady at No. 2 after 17 weeks atop Global Excl. U.S. starting last September. Only “APT.,” which holds at No. 3, has led longer: 19 weeks, beginning in November. “Birds of a Feather” ascends 5-4, following three weeks at No. 1 last August, and JIN's “Don't Say You Love Me” dips to No. 5 a week after it debuted at No. 4.


	Plus, MOLIY, Silent Addy, Skillibeng and Shenseea's “Shake It to the Max (Fly)” swoops into the Global Excl. U.S. top 10, bounding 16-10 with 31.2 million streams (up 21%) and 1,000 sold (up 29%) outside the U.S. The track leads the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart for a fourth week.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated June 7, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 3. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service.

It's no mystery that Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson have become frequent collaborators after starring in and executive producing “True Detective” together. Now, original series creator Nic Pizzolatto is teasing that the acting duo might return to the hit HBO series more than 10 years since first starring together in it. 

Pizzolatto, who served as an executive producer on “True Detective” Season 4 but has not written for the show since his HBO deal expired after Season 3, said during the “Nothing Left Unsaid” podcast that he is toying with another “story” involving McConaughey and Harrelson's respective characters, Rust Cohle and Martin Hart. Pizzolatto, McConaughey, and Harrelson recently reunited for a January 2025 ad for True to Texas, with McConaughey and Harrelson back as their “True Detective” characters.

“I actually have another story for [characters] Cohle and Hart that, who knows, maybe we'll do it one day,” Pizzolatto said, adding that they all have had conversations “about getting back together and doing it” especially since both McConaughey and Harrelson “are open to it.”

 










McConaughey and Harrelson only appeared in Season 1 of anthology series “True Detective.” Season 3 included references to their characters, confirming that it was set in the same universe. Season 4 similarly cited the Season 1 storyline. 

Pizzolatto continued of his possible project bringing back McConaughey and Harrelson, “It's not something I've written or anything, it's just in my head, and we've talked about getting back together and doing it. I think the guys are open to it, it's just a question of whether that would ever happen or not.” 

“True Detective” Season 4, titled “Night Country,” was written by new showrunner Issa López and starred Jodie Foster, who became the first actor to win an Emmy for “True Detective.” Pizzolatto infamously was critical of the season, saying that how “Night Country” narratively connected to his first season was “so stupid.”  

Pizzolatto previously was set to reunite with his “True Detective” star McConaughey for FX drama series “Redeemer” based on Patrick Coleman's debut novel “The Churchgoer.” The show was scrapped in 2021.

McConaughey has consistently praised Pizzolatto and his experience on “True Detective” Season 1. The actor said in March 2025 that “objectively” the first installment is still his favorite season, despite still serving as an EP for the entire series. “I happen to be in that one, so I thought that was incredible, incredible television and a great series. I watched it weekly, like everyone else, on Sunday night, and that was an event for me,” he said. “And I got to sit back and enjoy that. I loved the water cooler talk on Monday morning. Even though I made it, I sort of forgot what was going to happen next. It was one of the great events in TV.”

It's not news that the documentary market continues to be in flux, particularly for political documentaries, with many filmmakers complaining about a lack of distribution channels. So it's good news that Netflix has closed a hybrid licensing deal for six documentary films that played well at festivals over the past year, but were not acquired by any distributor. Rather than leave the orphans in limbo, Netflix opted to give this group of diverse titles a distribution home.

The films include Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk's “The White House Effect” and “In Waves and War,” Chris Smith's “Devo,” Kimberly Reed's “I'm Your Venus,” Matthew O. Henderson's “A King Like Me,” and the late Sacha Jenkins‘ “Sunday Best.”

This out-of-the-box Netflix deal gives the docs Netflix Original status in English-speaking territories the U.K., United States, and Canada. In territories outside the English language, they are available non-exclusively.

“There are always more great films out there than there are distribution opportunities,” Netflix's Adam Del Deo, VP of Documentaries wrote IndieWire an email. “We saw a chance to bridge that gap by partnering with our licensing team to make sure these six impactful films — which all received stellar festival receptions — could be seen and loved by wider audiences. The fact that they all come from talented filmmakers we've had the privilege of working with before telling such a diverse range of stories makes this even better.”

 










It makes sense that Netflix would support established filmmakers the streamer had worked with before. They include Impact Partners‘ “The White House Effect” (October 31) from Cohen and Shenk (Netflix's “Athlete A,” “Audrie and Daisy,” and the Oscar-nominated documentary short “Lead Me Home”). “The White House Effect” was well-received at Telluride 2024, followed by 13 more festivals. The directors dig into the origin story of the current climate crisis, going back three decades, when the world was poised to stop global warming. Using exclusively archival material, “The White House Effect” depicts how a political battle in the George H.W. Bush administration changed the course of history.

Netflix also licensed Cohen and Shenk's second Telluride 2024 premiere, “In Waves and War” (November 3) a troubling story about how three Navy SEALs left their tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and returned home with treatment-resistant chronic psychological pain. They, and others in the veteran and PTSD community, are being saved, finally, by a healing psychedelic therapy.

“Netflix came up with interesting way to get films out there that hadn't found a deal yet,” said Submarine co-founder Josh Braun, who repped “In Waves and War” and “The White House Effect.” “We are happy to be part of this, because the market is challenging and this is a good opportunity to get these films out there in a bigger way than a self-release.” 

 










Netflix has also worked with doc veteran Chris Smith and his producer Danny Gabi (“Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond,” “Fyre Fest”). Smith directed Sundance 2024 Premiere “Devo” (August 19) a biodoc that explores the evolution of the art-punk New Wave band, which scored a hit with “Whip It” in 1980 and gained mainstream success with their message of societal “de-evolution,” formed in response to the 1970 Kent State shootings.

Netflix also licensed Tribeca 2024 premiere “I'm Your Venus” (June 23), directed by Kimberly Reed (“Dark Money”), which follows the biological and ballroom families of “Paris Burning” star Venus Xtravaganza as they investigate the unsolved mystery of her 1988 murder.

Another movie in the package, produced by Netflix stalwart Fisher Stevens (“Beckham,” “Dark Money,” Season 1) is Matthew O. Henderson's SXSW 2024 premiere “A King Like Me” (June 19). The movie follows members of the New Orleans cultural institution the Zulu Club, the first Black Mardi Gras krewe, as they struggle to bring the Zulu parade back to the streets for Mardi Gras Day 2022 after Hurricane Ida and losing members to gun violence and COVID. 

Also included in the Netflix buy is Tribeca 2023 debut “Sunday Best,” written by Mark Monroe and directed by the late Sacha Jenkins (July 21). Produced by Netflix veteran Rafael Marmor (“Will & Harper”), the film shows how pioneering television host Ed Sullivan platformed Black musicians during the Civil Rights era. “I was very saddened, like the rest of the documentary community, to hear the tragic news of Sacha Jenkins, the director of ‘Sunday Best,' passing away,” added Del Deo. “He was a creative force and incredibly talented. Our thoughts are with his family.”

 










As recent hits “Becoming Led Zeppelin” ($13 million worldwide) and “No Other Land” ($3.6 million worldwide) prove, a theatrical audience will show up for some docs. But the bottom line for this Netflix non-fiction sextet: these films will now be watched on the world's largest viewing platform.

Jonathan Joss, who voiced John Redcorn on multiple seasons of Fox's animated series King of the Hill, was shot and killed Sunday in San Antonio, police have confirmed.

	A suspect, Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, 56, was located and eventually booked for murder, according to the police. The investigation is ongoing.

EXCLUSIVE: Major layoffs are underway Monday the Walt Disney Company, with several hundred employees impacted globally, Deadline has learned. The bulk of them are across divisions of Disney Entertainment, including marketing for both film and television as well as television publicity, casting and development. Also affected are Disney's corporate financial operations.


	According to sources, the size of the cuts on the film and TV side of Disney Entertainment is comparable. No teams are being eliminated. The majority of the Disney Entertainment Television staffers are said to be based in Los Angeles. Deadline will continue its coverage as more details about those impacted emerge during what is expected to be a tough day on the Disney campuses.

	











	This is the fourth — and largest — round of layoffs in the past 10 months that has affected various Disney television operations. They are part of an ongoing cost-cutting process at the traditional media companies as they reshape their business to focus on streaming while facing economic headwinds. Disney's Bob Iger set the pace upon his return as CEO, establishing a goal of at least $7.5 billion in cost reductions at the start of 2023, with about 7,000 jobs eliminated that year.

In early March, just under 200 Disney employees were laid off, representing almost 6% of the workforce in the ABC News Group and Disney's entertainment networks, including Freeform and FX.


	A big restructuring last October involved the shutdown of ABC Signature, with its operations folded into 20th Television, and the consolidation of ABC and Hulu Originals scripted drama and comedy teams. It resulted in about 30 Disney Entertainment Television layoffs.

	











	And last July, DET underwent a round of staff cuts that impacted roughly 140 people, representing about 2% of the total workforce, 60 of them at National Geographic.


	The latest cuts follow Disney's better-than-expected Q2 earnings last month, fueled largely by  experiences and sports, with streaming also delivering strong results as direct-to-consumer operating profit increased by $289 million to $336 million. At the annual shareholder meeting earlier this spring, Iger spoke about creating new jobs, largely in Disney experiences, including theme parks.


	The Disney layoffs also come on the heels of staff cuts at NBCUniversal as the company is spinning off several cable networks into a new company named Versant.

In a role that returned her to acting, Munn opens up about Sam's betrayal and what it means for her and Jon Hamm's Coop for season two, which is currently filming.


							By 

	Lexi Carson



[This story contains major spoilers from the season one finale of Your Friends & Neighbors.]


	“You don't deserve it,” Olivia Munn‘s Sam says when confronted by Jon Hamm's Coop in the Your Friends & Neighbors finale. 




	In the first episode of the Apple TV+ series, a death was revealed in the wealthy, fictional Westmont Village, leaving a mystery of who could be a murderer among these elites. Who killed Paul (Jordan Gelber)?


	Sam's husband was the victim, making Coop a prime suspect when the police later found out about Coop and Sam's secret relationship. Coop ended up getting arrested when the murder weapon, a gun, was found in his car — a murder weapon that was planted there by Sam to frame Coop.

	But in the season finale, which released Friday, viewers discovered that there was never a murder. Paul died by suicide — while on FaceTime with Sam — and she staged the scene to make it look like a murder so that she could receive Paul's life insurance money, as she was in the process of divorcing him. When Coop gets out on bail and confronts Sam, one of her reasons for setting him up is because Sam, who comes from a blue-collar background, doesn't think Coop, a former hedge fund guy, deserves the life he has. “Ultimately, the show is a social exploration. It's a little bit of a satire, and thematically it's all about what makes these people tick,” creator Jonathan Tropper told THR in a finale interview about how the reveal and ending sets up the show for the already renewed season two.


Your Friends & Neighbors marked Munn's first on-screen project following her breast cancer diagnosis. She's previously opened up about how she was nervous to film sex scenes with Hamm because of her cancer scars. Last month, the actress told THR at the show's premiere about how their chemistry was something that came naturally. “He and I get along so well it's just really easy to play,” she said. 

	











	Below, Munn talks to THR about how money and privilege are the real villains in the series, explains how anyone could relate to Coop and Sam's on-again-off-again relationship and teases what's next for Sam in season two, which is currently filming.


	***


In episode six, we started to see a different side to Sam when she told off a salesperson when buying skincare. Knowing what we now know, was that a clue that there was more to Sam than we might expect?


	What I loved about that scene was that Sam is on the precipice of losing everything, and that's where we meet her in episode one. And by that point in the show, she's at the apex of that. Everything that she is desperate to hold on to is literally at the very end of her fingertips, and in that moment, everything just explodes. That salesperson is the unfortunate recipient of all of that. But in that moment, it's all the energy she's put into not only holding on to it but to have created it. She's had so much ambition and drive in her life to get to the top of the social mountain and have this incredible wealth. Not only has she been desperately trying to hold on, but she's watching this just disintegrate in her hands.


Before the twist is revealed, Sam broke things off with Coop. Why did she decide to let him go? Then it seemed like he was trying to make their relationship more than a friends-with-benefits situation.


	It wasn't said in the script, but it's something that [Jonathan] Tropper [creator/showrunner] and I talked about a lot, and when I went into the season I was thinking about: “What's the part of the story that we haven't seen before we meet all these characters? And what's been going on with Sam and Coop?” They both entered their relationship in similar places but very different emotionally. He was looking for a soft place to land when he was struggling so much to want to keep his family together, and my character is hoping that this flourishes into something more. So, I thought a lot about what other conversations they were having that we don't see on screen. When he got to that point where it seemed like he wanted more, the reality was that he said that so many times. There's a point where you have to just wake up and realize you're in this cycle of: “Yes, he wants more. OK, no, he doesn't. Yes, he wants more. No, he doesn't.” There's a point where she just has to say, “Enough is enough.”

	











Now, about the ending, what was your reaction to reading in the script that Sam made her ex-husband's suicide look like a murder? 


	I absolutely loved it. (Laughs) Tropper did a really great job of this unflinching exploration of human nature and ambition, and the lengths people will go to make and retain their wealth and status in society. This part was like the Shakespearean equivalent of showing what all that leads to: When you see what happens when blind ambition and the desperate need to maintain your social status and wealth come up against losing it all. At that moment, on the surface, it seems like she just wants the insurance money, and to the length that she's going, it's so extreme. But it's the need. It's a timeless story of people thinking that money buys happiness, and putting all of your self worth and your entire life into the idea that if you have money, then everything is going to be OK. So for her, there was no other way. That was the only path forward.


When Coop asks her why she framed him for Paul's murder, she responds, saying, “You should have been kinder to me,” and notes that he doesn't deserve the privileged life he has. However, that could apply to a lot of people in that neighborhood, so why was Coop the one to pin Paul's death on?


	That line: “You should have been kinder to me” is something that Tropper told me in our first initial call. I thought about that for so long, and I love that line so much. And that's a great question: why him? But it's because of having been so intimate with him and having this close relationship. I think that we've all had those relationships where you feel like you've really given your heart to somebody and really exposed yourself, and you're being very vulnerable and very loving and it's just being taken. Nothing is being given back to you. You're left feeling really empty at the end. For Sam, that is part and parcel of what that entire world is like. People take and take and they feel no need to to replenish anything.

	











	What I really loved about that scene in particular was that there has been so much dialogue in the world about privilege, and I've had to have many conversations with friends about it just over the last five years where it's been at the apex of discussion in the world. I had a conversation with one friend who was asking me to explain it to him and I didn't mind because he really was earnestly wanting to know. He's like, “But I work really hard to get to where I'm at. So why are people saying that I don't deserve it?” I was like, “Look, you know, I'm a first-generation American. This is my mother's 50th anniversary of fleeing Saigon to come to America as an immigrant. No one is saying that people with inherent privilege don't work hard or haven't faced their own battles and slayed their own dragons and worked really, really hard. What people fail to realize is that on that same mountain, they have been given the cheat codes, maps and keys to the gates along the way.”


	So, yes, they have to climb the mountain, but it's all been set up for them to make it through to the next level, the next stage. So they're on their way up and they're working hard to get to the top, while the rest of us have this Sisyphean task to keep trying to get up this mountain. But we don't have the cheat codes. We don't have the maps in front of us. There's no one that we know at that next gate that says, “I'll let you in.” I know your dad; I know your mom. Oh, that's great we went to Yale together, come on in. The rest of us are still struggling to get up the mountain, while on the other side, people with privilege are making their way up the mountain.

	











	That moment in the foyer of Sam's home, that's what Sam is saying: “Yeah, you worked hard, but I worked harder because it was not set up for me to be here.” Everything was set up for Coop. When Tropper first talked to me about this, [he mentioned] it's a lot based on his life. He lived in Westchester and had a whole other life before his life now. He goes: There is this world of people whose families are wealthy and their families went to Harvard or Yale, and so their children get to go to Harvard or Yale. And then, because the dad had a hedge fund, or knew this hedge fund guy, it's set up for his son to then go into this hedge fund, and then it's set up for him to run the hedge fund. Then, there are certain goals they set off for themselves, and they achieve them. Get your first mansion, get your second mansion, get your vacation home, get this plane, get that plane and then it's this accumulation of wealth and things. And then something happens that unravels it all, and you realize that everyone has been putting all their attention and energy onto something that's so external. When the internal cracks even the slightest, it just exposes the fragility of that entire world.


During your monologue, Sam setting up the crime scene reminded me of Gone Girl. Was that an inspiration at all for Sam's storyline? Did it inspire your performance?


	I never thought about that, and Tropper never brought that up, either. So, I never thought about that. But I think of Gone Girl as sociopathic. (Laughs) She's very sociopathic, and I think that Sam is a very nuanced, complex character who came from a blue-collar upbringing who has found herself at the top of this social mountain and has convinced herself this is what she needs to do to survive. She's convinced herself that the only way to survive is to be in this social world and with this enormous wealth and that there is no other path in life to forge, which I always think is interesting because she didn't come from money. She can go back into a life and figure out how to live without money. It's not foreign to her. So why does she so desperately want to do anything to stay in this place with this friend group and have this house and this car and these purses and shoes?

	











	I thought about that a lot. Money can corrupt the soul when you're around a lot of people who put priority on things and not relationships; on the label and the Zip code. That kind of ideology is sticky, and it can stick to you and how you move in the world, and how you think about the world. I think Sam has really lost her sense of self and is focused on only the things she has seen that matter. The money and lifestyle have also corrupted Sam, and when something like that happens, you can't really see any other way besides what you think is the only one in front of you.


Since you are currently shooting season two, how would you compare the first season to the second?


	In the second season, what we've all seen in the world for hundreds of years, too, this is the same story. People with wealth and power can do horrible things, and yet you turn around and they're sitting next to you at the dinner party, and they just keep finding their way back into these social circles and keep finding their way back into being accepted. It's staggering and shocking for most of society who have a moral compass. It's set up that way because they've got the key, those cheat codes. Everything is set up for people who have been born with privilege; life is already set up for them to falter and come back up. My character wasn't born with privilege and yet, here she is. She's fallen off the mountain, and yet she's still in this world, and we're going to see the struggle of trying to stay in that world, keep a place in that world, get back to where she was and how everyone is going to handle that.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios is finalizing a deal to acquire Split Fiction, a hot feature package based on the video game of the same name, which is set to team Wicked helmer Jon M. Chu and actress Sydney Sweeney, sources tell Deadline.


	We're told the deal is coming in at north of $2 million. We were first to report on bidding for the project a couple of weeks ago, when Sony was among others in the race. Script is by Paul Wernick & Rhett Reese, the duo behind recent Marvel Studios hit Deadpool & Wolverine.


	Developed by Hazelight Studios and powered by Unreal Engine, Split Fiction centers on two writers — Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster — who become trapped inside a simulation created by Rader Publishing, a tech company that uses AI to mine authors' ideas. The pair must work together to escape as they navigate through surreal environments, inspired by their respective genres of sci-fi and fantasy. Sweeney will play one of the two authors, though it's presently unclear which one it will be.

	











	Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson & Mike Goldberg will produce the feature take, with Timothy I. Stevenson executive producing. Electric Somewhere is also producing, with Hazelight Studios' Josef Fares and Oskar Wolontis exec producing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Split Fiction, we a couple of weeks ago shared an update on Doug Liman's undersea supernatural film Deeper, starring Tom Cruise. We reported that Ana de Armas is poised to co-star in the flick, following an astronaut who encounters a terrifying force while on a deep dive into a never-before-explored trench. Originally set up at MGM, when the studio bought a spec from Max Landis, the film has been in development for nearly a decade. We hear McQuarrie is currently involved in penning the script. Originally, Bradley Cooper was to star, with Kornél Mundruczó directing; Idris Elba and filmmaker Baltasar Kormákur teamed on a later iteration that likewise failed to move forward.

	











	Chu is repped by Artists First, UTA, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman; Sweeney by Paradigm and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Wernick & Reese are repped by WME and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Story Kitchen is with WME & Pryor Cashman, and the latter also reps Hazelight Studios.

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


Sean Combs' personal assistant “Mia” returned to the stand today for the third day, where she spoke about her reticence to come forward sooner with allegations of sexual assault against Combs. “I was terrified and brainwashed,” she said, while being cross-examined by Combs' defense attorney, Brian Steel.


	Steel took a highly aggressive approach to his cross examination as he picked up the defense's efforts to undermine Mia's allegations by highlighting instances where she appeared affection towards, or supportive of, her former boss. Mia (who is testifying under a pseudonym) responded to Steel's questions by trying to convey the complex emotions that came with working for someone who was both her alleged abuser and someone she described as her “protector.” 


	As he pressed Mia, Steel's tone was often exaggerated and sarcastic, and at times directly confrontational. At one point he asked Mia if she'd joined “the #MeToo money grab,”  garnering one of many objections from the prosecution, which the judge sustained. (Mia later asserted that she did not intend to file a civil suit against Combs.)




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Steel also repeatedly cast doubt on the veracity of Mia's allegations, asking if her claims were true, suggesting the events she described never happened, or that she made them up. (Combs' defense has yet to take such a pointed approach to trying to subvert the claims of his other alleged victims.) At one point, Mia retorted, “I would not lie in this courtroom. I never lied in this courtroom. Everything I have said is true.”

	











	As expected, the prosecution has repeatedly objected to Steel's questions and Judge Arun Subramanian has often sided with the prosecution (at one point, he sustained about 10 objections in as many minutes). Federal prosecutor Maurene Comey expressed her concern to the judge that Steel's tone would not be reflected in the court transcripts; and she accused Steel of trying to “humiliate” Mia and effectively deterring other potential victims from coming forward.

	











	One person who certainly seemed engaged with Steel's approach was Combs. The mogul's face was glued to Steel as he grilled Mia, intense and concentrated, as if he was watching a movie for the first time.

	For much of the cross, Steel asked Mia about supportive and loving text messages she sent Combs both during her employment and after. In one exchange from 2019, after she'd stopped working for Combs, Mia described a nightmare in which Combs saved her while she was trapped in an elevator with convicted sex criminal R. Kelly. A few months later, Mia texted Combs that she was sending him “all the love in the world.”


	Asked if Combs still had a hold on her at that point, Mia said the mogul still did “psychologically.” She also added that she sent these texts after “tragic events” in his life, like the death of his partner, Kim Porter, in November 2018. 


	“I was always constantly seeking his approval. He was my authority figure, my only authority figure,” Mia said at one point.


	Steel also pressed Mia over why there was no contemporaneous documentation of Combs' alleged abuse, even though she was constantly filming Combs at his instruction and taking notes during their time together. Mia said she never captured Combs in a moment of anger because she “would not have been allowed to film that.” She added that she only filmed “whatever he wanted me to film” and that capturing such an incident would've been a “huge break of trust, loyalty, and confidentiality.”

	Similarly, Mia said that writing down an alleged instance of abuse, or discussing with others, would've been a breach of confidentiality. She said that the only time she “reached out for help was very subtly to people in the office but not disclosing things that other people hadn't witnessed.” She suggested others who worked for Combs were similarly cautious, saying “nobody around batted an eye” when Combs misbehaved or acted out. 


	Mia even said she grew fearful when Combs threatened to tell his girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, about “everything” between them. Mia said this made her “feel like I had sone something wrong,” as well as “internalize blame and shame.” 


	“I don't know how to explain what that does to a person,” she added.

	











	During her testimony last week, Mia repeatedly broke down in tears as she detailed a hellish eight years working for Combs between 2009 and 2017.  


	She claimed she fluctuated between a constant state of feeling like Combs' best friend and “a worthless piece of crap,” all depending on the volatile mogul's mood. Sometimes, she'd be showered with praise and promised executive roles in one of Combs' many companies. At other times, Mia said, she might have her arm crushed in a heavy industrial door or have a bowl of spaghetti hurled at her for not rushing off to IHOP in the middle of the night fast enough. 


	Mia said her job was always in jeopardy and once was placed on unpaid leave for “insubordination” because she left a hotel without Combs' permission to attend a party with Ventura at Prince's house. “We ran through the house,” Mia said of the women trying to escape when Combs turned up. “There was something across the street that looked like — I don't know if it was woods or not, but somewhere to hide, like bushes, and we were trying to run to hide there.” 


	Mia testified that Combs sexually assaulted her multiple times, describing the alleged attacks as unpredictable and sporadic. They occurred, she said, on Combs' 40th birthday bash at the Plaza Hotel, inside his bedroom closet, and on a staff bunk bed while she slept. There were other sexual assaults, Mia said, but she repressed them, only able to recall a “horrible dark feeling in my stomach.” 


	“I always thought that it was the last time, and if there ever [was] a next time, I would somehow be more prepared,” Mia testified. “We would have to get right back into work, and there was so much going on, I never processed it. I never thought it would happen again.” 


	Mia was identified as Victim-4 in the Southern District of New York's criminal indictment against Combs, with her allegations tied to the racketeering charge against the music mogul. Prosecutors accuse Combs of wielding his vast wealth and “multifaceted business empire” to fulfill his sexual desires with crimes including physical assault, threats, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice. He allegedly forced his sleep-deprived employees to do his bidding by subjecting them to physical force and threats of financial and reputational harm. (Combs has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts against him.) 


	On cross-examination, Combs' attorney Steel grilled Mia on why she never told anyone about the alleged assaults. He also confronted Mia with numerous social media posts where she heaped praise on Combs, promoted his business ventures, and created a specialized scrapbook for Combs' 45th birthday.

	“The man who you say has ruined your life,” Steel asked. “This is what you write to him?” 


	“At the time, as low as he would make me, he would also make me feel the opposite as well,” Mia explained in response. “Again, I can tell you what my therapist has said, but I'm not a professional to explain that.”

Byron Allen's Allen Media Group has engaged investment bank Moelis & Company to sell its television stations across 21 markets.


	The company has invested over $1 billion in acquiring the stations over the last six years growing to become one of the largest independent privately held owners of Big 4 (ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX) network affiliates.


	“Six years ago, Allen Media Group began the process of investing over one billion dollars to acquire big four network-affiliated television stations. We have received numerous inquiries and written offers for most of our television stations and now is the time to explore getting a return on this phenomenal investment,” said Byron Allen, founder and chairman- CEO of Allen Media Group. “We are going to use this opportunity to take a serious look at the offers, and the sale proceeds will be used to significantly reduce our debt.”

NY & Broadway Editor


SPOILER ALERT: The final paragraphs of the following interview contain details about the ending of Maybe Happy Ending


	TV has been good to Darren Criss. He found fame on Glee and critical acclaim in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, to name just a small sampling of his television work. But talk to the Tony-nominated star of Maybe Happy Ending even briefly about his career and one thing quickly becomes clear: He really, really loves Broadway.


	Criss made his Broadway debut as Daniel Radcliffe's replacement in the 2012 revival of How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, returned as Neil Patrick Harris' replacement in 2015's Hedwig And The Angry Inch and in 2022 starred with Sam Rockwell and Laurence Fishburne in American Buffalo.












	But it's his glowingly reviewed starring role in Maybe Happy Ending that has earned Criss his first Tony nomination. Actually his first two – as a producer of the Will Aronson-Hue Park musical, Criss would take a trophy if the show takes the Best Musical award. In all, Maybe Happy Ending is nominated for 10 Tonys, including Criss' Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role/Musical. And for the second time since 2022 Criss will cohost (with Renée Elise Goldsberry) the official Tony Awards pre-show The Tony Awards: Act One. (He also recently extended his run in Maybe Happy Ending through August 31).




			Watch on Deadline		







	In this interview, Criss talks about, among other things, Broadway, the Tonys and his Tony-nominated role of Oliver, a “Helper-Bot” in a future Seoul who lives alone in a small apartment, forever hoping for the return of his owner who, unbeknownst to Oliver has assigned the obsolete robot to a retirement compound where he'll eventually run out of replacement parts. Across the hall, though, is Claire, a more recent (but still obsolete) “Helper Bot” played by Helen J Shen. The two form a bond despite learning of their impending power-down. The sweet and funny musical asks us to ponder: Is love worth the risk of certain heartbreak?

	











	The Tony Awards: Act One will stream live for free on June 8 from 6:40 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. ET (3:40 p.m. – 5 p.m. PT) on Pluto TV. The 78th Annual Tony Awards, hosted by Cynthia Erivo from Radio City Music Hall, will immediately follow, broadcast live to both coasts on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ in the U.S.


	Maybe Happy Ending is playing at Broadway's Belasco Theatre. Directed by Michael Arden, the musical stars Darren Criss, Helen J Shen, Dez Duron and Marcus Choi.


The following interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.


DEADLINE: So you could actually win two Tonys this year, right?


DARREN CRISS: I suppose the answer is yes. I'm always being so, so coy.


DEADLINE: And you're hosting the pre-show [with Renée Elise Goldsberry].


CRISS: I tend to only like doing it when I'm also in a show. So I did it while I was doing American Buffalo [in 2022] and so here we are again. I just love stacking things on. I sort of I thrive on overcommitting.


	And I love the Tony Awards ceremony. I say that specifically because I try not to put too much stock into the sort of organized accolade system of it all, which is not to trivialize its importance and its distinction. But what I love about this ceremony specifically is that it is the biggest mainstream gathering for the Broadway community, historically the biggest platform for the shows. Now things have changed in the past several years, where Broadway, because of social media and quite to an exciting and wonderful degree, in my opinion, has been able to live outside of the theaters of midtown. It used to just be cast albums and the Tonys broadcast that were our access points. This was the way that most people around the US and maybe outside the US, this is how we would get an inside look. The Tonys still have this sort of classic grandeur to them. 


	Everybody who you are seeing perform at the Tonys most likely did a matinee that day. So when you're watching a Tony broadcast, when you're watching YouTube of a famous Tony performance like Patti LuPone performing as Evita, I love to remind people that by the time that she was doing that live on television, she'd had also just done it like three hours before…This is why the Tonys are so remarkable to me. The workhorse dynamic of these people is so important to me. 


	One of the only live shows that's meant to be a live show that features a bunch of people that do live shows. So anyway, just being a part of it means a lot to me, because I love these people dearly. And, you know, people always talk on and on and on, like myself, about the community of Broadway. It's not some disingenuous canned line, it's a real thing, like we're all roommates. We all work within several blocks of each other. We've all seen each other's work. We're all familiar on a very intimate level that by the time we're all in Radio City, most of the people in that room have worked together, have hung out together, have shared experiences in a way that when you're working in film and television, just by the nature of the way those those pieces are created, don't. So, yeah, if you can't tell, I love the Tonys.


DEADLINE: Since so many of you do all know each other, and let's say you're all friends, there must still be a feeling of competition. You, for example, are going up against your friend Jonathan Groff, so what's that feel like?


CRISS: Call me a happy idiot, and naive, deluded, delusional, I genuinely feel zero percent of competition and that I can feel your readers eyes roll from my seat here at home in New York City. But it's just true, like these are all people that I have spent time with, and hope to continue to gladly spend my time and money on getting to receive their work and their art and their inspiration. These are guys that I've hung out in bars with, had laughs with, been in theaters with done projects with. I really, really, really like those guys. I love their work. I think it's all terrific. I think everybody has their own superpowers. Everybody has their own unique thing. And any one of these guys can do stuff I can't do, and that can be said of everybody in that [best acting] category. Not because any of us are better or worse, we're just different people, and we're in wildly different shows. And I have to say, and again, I know that I have a generally happy go lucky disposition, but I mean this with as much genuine objectivity as I could possibly convey: There's something very special about this Broadway season. There's something really special going on this season, with very distinct shows that have something very wonderful and distinct to offer. If there was a guy that was exactly like me in another robot show, then, yeah, it would feel like the dirty C word of competition.

	











DEADLINE: Since you mentioned robots, how were your robot movements on stage developed? You have very specific movements, as opposed to Helen's movements?


CRISS: I was talking about how we all have our own, maybe superpowers is a strong word, but we all have our bag of tricks. You know, we all have our parlor tricks as actors. And any time there's a moment in a piece where one of those tricks might be handy for the piece, you certainly want to use them. But I never thought I'd be able to employ any of my interest in physical theater in this piece, it just truly didn't cross my mind.


	This show came about in the most miraculous way in my life…There's something, dare I say, divine, about the way this thing kind of landed in my in my lap, via a friend who has been a longtime buddy, and somebody who I've admired forever, Michael Arden. We're old pals, and I always wanted to work with him. And so when this came up, I guess maybe he knew about my interest in physical theater work. 


	Michael suggested that I zoom with Moni Yakim, who was a revered professor, now retired I think, at Juilliard for many, many years. I had two zooms with him, about an hour each, just to kind of talk about the physical vocabulary of what this role could be. And then as he was going through stuff, it immediately made me think, oh my god, we're doing clown and Jacques Lecoq and commedia and mime and Marcel Marceau, the stuff that I loved a lot n high school, that I studied in college. I have to give credit to my professor Malcolm Tulip at University of Michigan, who was a Lecoq student. So I kind of got, you know, hip to that shit when I was in college, and then I took time off. I ended up studying abroad in the Italian countryside at a wonderful institution called the Accademia dell'Arte where we studied a lot of these very archaic forms of storytelling and physical storytelling that I fell in love with. 


	So I've got these tricks in my bag that just kind of sat dormant because I never thought I'd be able to use them. And my conversations with Moni kind of opened that attic doorway to go like, Oh my God, look at this dusty old box. Yes, I still have this. This is great. So I started employing a lot of those things that I was interested in, and saw how they kind of fit. 


	And to your point, about how I'm being a little different from Helen. My guiding light was to really contrast myself, not only as differently from her, but to contrast myself as much from an audience as possible, to kind of let them know what's going on immediately. Here's our characters, here's the world we live in, here's the tone, here's the heart, here's what we can laugh at and what we can take seriously. From the very opening of the show, I kind of employ all those sort of goal posts within my physicality. And from the jump, you understand this thing is not human, but there are human tendencies. And so I really wanted to use the physicality. So it's a bit of Commedia dell'arte, it's a bit of Kabuki, it's a bit of geisha, a lot of their physical vocabulary, and with a significant dash of the great Glen Keane, who's one of Disney's finest animators, and to me, one of the great animators of facial expressions. There's a lot of Disney animated film in the way that Oliver emotes with the space.


DEADLINE: Helen Shen isn't quite as robotic, which makes sense because her Helper Bot character Claire is a slightly newer model than yours.












CRISS: Helen has said and very astutely that Oliver exists with a lot of angular edges where Claire has more curves and fluidity. And I think that's absolutely true. And the more I angle, the more she curves, and the more she curves, the more I angle, it's symbiotic, this noticeable polarity between the two characters.


DEADLINE: Which brings me to my my last question. Does Claire erase her memory? Because everyone I discuss this with seems to have different ideas.


CRISS: Well, I think far be it for me to take anybody's particular perspective away from them, but I have a definitive directive from Michael Arden of what happens and I'm happy to tell you what it is, because I think it's neater storytelling, it's more tidy. I think Oliver definitely does keep his memory and Clair deletes hers. That's the play that we're telling, that's the story we're telling. That's the action that she's playing and it's the action I'm playing every night. But the theater is a living, breathing, mutating organism. What I love about people's uncertainty is that it speaks to how invested they are in the story and these characters. I love that people have their own ideas. I think we're telling a very specific story but I'm a big believer that when you make stuff and you put art into the world, it doesn't really belong to you anymore.


	When I was a kid, the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which is such a formative film for me that I will love forever, they literally ride off into the sunset. And I remember just like wanting them to ride forever, like not even time or life itself will stop these people, these heroes, from going on adventures forever. But then the sun goes down and the movie ends, but my takeaway was like, Well, surely they're gonna keep going forever, even though logic tells me they won't. But that hope that they do, and that excitement of it, despite everything I know, is such a fun feeling to hold on to.

With her Wicked leading role, the multihyphenate has become a capital "S" star — and on her new studio album I Forgive You, is telling the world who she really is.

There was a time when Cynthia Erivo could glide around town on her Razor scooter in peace. “Don't laugh!” she quips as she reminisces about those halcyon days while sitting in a cozy loft above a cavernous Los Angeles studio. “I've been doing it for years!”


	Whether maneuvering New York's busy streets or transporting her from her L.A. home to a nearby studio to record voice-over work, Erivo's reliable kick scooter was once her preferred mode of transit. But even a decade ago, she was warned that her hobby wasn't sustainable with the life she was building. “[Director] John Doyle said to me, ‘Cynthia, you're not going to be able to do that for very long,' ” she recalls. “And I was like, ‘But why? I'm good! It's fine!' ”

	











	His prediction ultimately came true. In the years since making her 2015 Broadway debut in Doyle's production of The Color Purple, Erivo has transformed from buzzy theater ingenue to certified, capital “S” star by practically every metric. At just 38, the multihyphenate is already nearly an EGOT (she's only missing her Oscar, despite three nominations); has starred in prestige TV series like The Outsider, Genius and Poker Face; paid tribute to musical legends at the Kennedy Center; and, most recently, scooped up that third Oscar nom with Wicked, the highest-grossing musical adaptation in film history.

	











	Along the way, Erivo hasn't lost sight of what matters to her, using the star power she has accrued for good. When she publicly came out as queer in 2022, she cited the importance of helping “some young Black queer actress somewhere” feel less alone in the industry. At the top of 2025, she took home GLAAD's prestigious Stephen F. Kolzak Award for her continuing commitment to promoting visibility for the LGBTQ+ community. And in June, she'll bring her talents to the massive WorldPride celebrations in Washington, D.C., making sure that everyone hears her voice — including politicians aiming to strip her community's rights.


	For her latest endeavor, though, Erivo decided to take the same energy she puts into both her community and others' projects and turn it inward. She didn't take to the stage or the screen, but rather the studio, looking to reinvigorate her solo music career — and the result is her revelatory second album, I Forgive You, out June 6 through Verve and Republic Records.


	Back in September 2021, Erivo released Ch. 1 Vs. 1, her debut LP of adult contemporary tracks where she aimed — and, reflecting today, thinks she failed — to provide a soundtrack to her life up until that point. “It never quite felt like it was mine,” she says. She recounts working with a group of “lovely” producers and writers who provided plenty of new ideas and sounds — yet the project itself underutilized her own vocal dexterity. “It didn't feel like it was one uniform story.”


	So when she began thinking about her next album, she started from scratch. On the advice of Wicked co-star Ariana Grande, Erivo met with Republic Records chairwoman and chief creative officer Wendy Goldstein to discuss her strengths and figure out a path forward. What could Erivo do that nobody else could? “Everything fell into place really fast from there,” Goldstein recalls of their first meeting.

	











	The answer was simple: Erivo's greatest asset is and always has been her protean voice, an instrument that belies her diminutive frame and lets her craft entire worlds of intricate harmonies. Her mother has said she first heard her daughter sing beautifully at a mere 18 months old, though Erivo has since said she first recognized her own innate talent around the ripe old age of 11. Following a brief stint studying music psychology at the University of East London, she dropped out, later enrolling at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London (where she now serves as vice president). After graduating in 2010 and spending three years performing around the United Kingdom, Erivo landed a breakthrough role in the off-West End production of The Color Purple in 2013.


	“Anyone who saw her in that performance knew pretty quickly that she was just a generational talent,” says Jessica Morgulis, Erivo's longtime manager who began working with her a year before The Color Purple transferred to Broadway in 2015. “In all my days of going to the theater, I've never seen the entire audience leap out of their seats mid-song in applause.”


	So when it came to creating her own music, Goldstein asked why Erivo wasn't leaning into her biggest strength. “When you hear Cynthia's voice, you're transfixed. I felt like we needed to lead with that,” Goldstein says. “We spoke a lot about how to really highlight her vocals, using it as an instrument with stacking and layering to create beautiful production.”


	That, Erivo says, unlocked something for her. “Wendy is a very singular human being who just gets it,” she says. “It was the first time that everything became really clear. To have someone who understands who you are as a musician and a singer and an artist was just a new experience within this space for me as an artist.”

	











	The subsequent project, executive-produced by Erivo and her longtime collaborator, Will Wells, spans pop, soul, jazz, disco, gospel and more, with her voice front and center. But more importantly, after a career dedicated to portraying characters, I Forgive You is just Erivo, telling the world who she is.


	“People see a very cookie-cutter version of me, and we do this thing with people where we isolate them or crystallize them in one space and go, ‘She's just that,' ” she says. “People don't know me as a musician in the way they're getting to know me now.”


As Erivo arrives for our conversation, you'd never guess that she's coming off one of the biggest performances of her life. Less than 48 hours earlier, she was belting out her forthcoming ballad, “Brick by Brick,” and Prince's “Purple Rain” alongside maestro Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic during a surprise appearance at the orchestra's Coachella set. “I was so surprised at how vast that audience was,” she giddily admits. “It was unbelievable.”


	Though Erivo remains humbly awestruck by the ensemble inviting her to perform for her biggest crowd to date, her own reputation has preceded her from the jump. “I mean, for anyone who likes singers, all of our algorithms were just filled with endless bootlegs of her singing her f–king ass off,” all-star songwriter Justin Tranter says of her Tony Award-winning Broadway debut.


	But while the world was tuned into Erivo's jaw-dropping performances of The Color Purple's showstopper “I'm Here,” she found herself focused on something else entirely while playing the character of Celie: her sexuality. “I hadn't really ever explored [my queerness], I hadn't really ever discovered or understood or really learned about it,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, I get to play this woman who is exploring and learning about her own queerness at the same time as trying to discover what love is.' This sort of wonderful thing happened at the same time — I got to do the same for myself.”


	Erivo had been out to her close friends and family since her early twenties, but playing Celie for two years began to open the door to come out publicly, as fully embodying the experience of a queer woman eight times a week slowly made her more assured. “It's like your feet finally hit the ground,” she explains. “Even the work that I started doing, whether I'm on a set or in a studio, I just felt a lot more relaxed.”

	











	With that newfound sense of ease came a wave of projects. After closing out her run in The Color Purple, she booked her first film roles, in Drew Goddard's Bad Times at the El Royale and Steve McQueen's Widows, holding her own on-screen with stars like Viola Davis and Jeff Bridges. With her starring performance in 2021's Harriet, Erivo earned her first pair of Academy Award nominations (for best actress and best original song) — had she won, she would have become the youngest person ever to earn EGOT status.


	“How lovely is that? To be in this position at this point in my career is one, a privilege — but two, a massive surprise,” Erivo says of her near EGOT. “To be one of those people that's on the edge of even looking that in the face is quite wonderful.”


	Morgulis credits Erivo's sharp instincts, saying she's “almost never wrong” when picking projects and pointing to her client's multiple viral performances at the Kennedy Center Honors, where Erivo has honored Dionne Warwick, Julie Andrews and Earth, Wind & Fire, as an example.


	“Often, the producers of something like that will be leaning one way, because whoever it is you're paying homage to has some favorite song of theirs they want to hear,” she says. “But Cynthia knows herself so well and will say, ‘I know I can really give this individual the best performance from me if we do this other song.' And every time, she nails it.”


	Yet despite her many successes, Erivo says nothing could have prepared her for the cultural phenomenon that was Wicked. She knew the film would do well, but she never predicted it would break box-office records and earn a whopping 10 Oscar nominations. “It's insane,” she says. “And it's insane while it's happening, too.”

	











	Of all Wicked's achievements, none shocked Erivo as much as the soundtrack's immediate Billboard chart success. It bowed at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 (the highest debut for a film adaptation of a stage musical in the chart's history), ruled the Top Album Sales and Vinyl Albums charts, and landed seven songs on the Billboard Hot 100, with her own version of “Defying Gravity” earning the highest position among them at No. 44. “The cast was like, ‘Oh, so it's just in the ether now? People are just listening to it on their way to work at this point?' ” Erivo recalls. “It's really wonderful.”


	The second part of the duology, Wicked: For Good, will arrive in November, and Erivo warns fans unfamiliar with the source material that her viridescent heroine, Elphaba, enters much darker territory in the second act. “She's able to access her rage more,” she says. “The scent I wore changed. The makeup changed. Little shifts that bring you to a more mature version of who Elphaba becomes. And she is delicious in this next one.”


	The Wicked Witch of the West isn't the only one who has changed in between the two films' releases — with rave reviews and another Oscar nomination for her stellar performance in the first act, Erivo became a household name practically overnight. That transition has occasionally felt scary, especially when it comes to maintaining her personal privacy.


	“I think there is an interesting thing that happens, where it's assumed that because you're in the public eye, everything is for everyone,” she explains. “But being in the public eye does not stop you from being a human being — you just have eyes on you now. I am totally OK to share some of my life — whenever you see me on the stage, whenever you hear me sing, whenever you see me act, I am sharing. But that doesn't mean that everything gets to be yours. I should be able to keep something for myself.”

	











	That “something” likely includes her visible, but never publicly confirmed (including for this story) relationship with lauded producer-writer Lena Waithe. “You also wouldn't want me to share everything — nobody should have to, because then what's left?” she says with a half-smile. “You can be grateful, but you can still have a boundary.”


	But thanks to the groundwork she has laid over the course of the last decade, Erivo says she doesn't feel flummoxed by her sudden stardom. “I'm glad that I had those breakthroughs before — it's school for what might come, and it means that here and now, it doesn't feel like it's going to sweep me up,” she says. “A lot of us fear that if this happens, you'll sort of lose yourself. But I still feel like myself.”


There is a moment in “Play the Woman,” an early, R&B-adjacent standout from I Forgive You, when Erivo taps an unexplored topic in her career thus far: unabashed desire. “I could run these hands of mine down the map of your spine/Feel how your heat against my fingertips could make the blood in me rush,” she croons on the pre-chorus before blooming into her glossy head voice: “Could you play the woman for me?/Go slow, 'cause I like what I see.”


	Erivo had long wanted to explore sensuality in her acting. But when the parts didn't materialize, she decided to take matters into her own hands. “Honestly, you rarely get that opportunity as Black women anyway,” she says. “So I was just like, ‘Well, if I don't put it in my own music, I'll never get to put it anywhere else.' ”


	That ethos runs through I Forgive You, as Erivo breaks out of the boxes that the industry at large constructed around her ever-growing career while simultaneously giving voice to the parts of herself that she was once too scared to reveal in public. Whether she's providing a grooving rumination on self-doubt with “Replay” or delivering an airy ballad about finally finding connection after years of trying on “I Choose Love,” Erivo lays all her cards on the table.

	











	“It wasn't scary to write because I really didn't know how else to write it. It had to come,” she explains. “The scary thing was getting ready to share it. When something is personal, you hope that people understand that your humanity exists and they're not just listening to random stories that come from nowhere.”


	When going into their sessions with Erivo, Tranter was already well-aware that she had one of the best voices in the business. What they quickly discovered was just how adept a songwriter she was, too. “She's a real visionary in that she knows what the f–k she's doing,” Tranter says. “It's not even that I was surprised, it's just that the world doesn't know her that way. You don't know what to expect when someone like Cynthia hasn't been able to reveal all her talents yet.”


	That's a recurring theme in Erivo's career: One of the main hurdles she faced while working on her debut album was record executives who were unsure how to utilize her talents or market her. She recalls one telling her, “You can sing everything, and we don't know what to do with you.” Her response? “ ‘Why don't we just try everything, then?' ” she remembers. “ ‘If I can do it, then why not try?' ”


	It's a refrain Morgulis returns to often. With her client's aspirations spreading across multiple fields of entertainment, the manager says that it's vital for her to help Erivo remain in control of the projects she's working on. “That conversation of not putting her in a box and, importantly, not allowing others to put her in a box, is happening on every single level of her team,” Morgulis says. “That act alone kind of sends a message to the industry of who she is and what direction she's going in.”

	











	And recently, Erivo has applied that philosophy to discussing her identity. After coming out publicly on the cover of British Vogue in 2022, she assumed a rare position in the entertainment business as a Black queer woman in the public eye, and it's a platform she takes seriously.


	Her decision to come out, Erivo says, had less to do with her own sense of self-actualization and more to do with the deep sense of care she feels toward her community. “I think I was actively looking for those who were encouraged to be more themselves,” she says. “I can't change a person's opinion of me; if they want to feel some way, there is nothing I can do about that. But I was so excited about being able to at least be one more face where someone could say, ‘Oh, my God, she did it and can still do it. She's still creating, she's still making. So maybe I can also do the same.' ”


	In hindsight, Erivo says she didn't feel any trepidation about her decision to come out and didn't notice any significant change in the roles she booked or the feedback she received for her performances. “Maybe I'm naive and wasn't paying attention to it, because I'm sure there was [pushback],” she confesses.


	The one notable exception came in early 2025, when the Hollywood Bowl announced that Erivo would star in the titular role of its upcoming three-night production of Jesus Christ Superstar. A predictable wave of conservative outrage followed at the thought of a Black queer woman portraying Jesus Christ, accusing the actress and the production itself of “blasphemy.”

	











	Erivo can't help but laugh. “Why not?” she chuckles with a shrug, before adding that most of those comments don't seem to understand the critical lens of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. “You can't please everyone. It is legitimately a three-day performance at the Hollywood Bowl where I get to sing my face off. So hopefully they will come and realize, ‘Oh, it's a musical, the gayest place on Earth.' ”


	It's easy for Erivo to dismiss a vocal minority decrying the mere announcement of her casting in a limited-run performance; it becomes much harder when the conversation turns to politics. Like many, she has watched in horror as the Trump administration has attempted to strip the rights of and federal protections for queer and trans people across the country through a flurry of executive orders.


	Erivo doesn't pretend to have all of the answers. “I'm trying to be a person you can get positive things from, because that is the only way you can balance this stuff,” she says with a sigh. But when she looks at something like the current administration's “anti-woke” takeover of the Kennedy Center — the place where she has delivered some of her most iconic performances to date — she can't help but feel a sense of dread. “I don't know who gains what from that. I hope that it comes back,” she says. “It's really sad to have to watch this happen to it. The Kennedy Center is supposed to be a space of creativity and art and music for everyone.”


	Yet Erivo refuses to let that dread rule her actions. It's part of why, during Pride Month, she will perform a headlining set at the closing concert for WorldPride in Washington, D.C., alongside Doechii. “I want to encourage people to not decide to just tuck away and start hiding and not being themselves anymore, because that is exactly what they want,” she says. “The more yourself you are, the more you are in front of people who don't necessarily understand, the better understanding starts to happen.”


	Tranter points to that sentiment as a perfect example of why Erivo has become such a powerful voice in the entertainment industry. “Cynthia being Black and queer, and being one of the most famous people alive in this moment while our community is dealing with what we are dealing with, is no mistake,” they say. “For someone as talented as her to be a beacon for young Black queer people all over the world, to be in the most successful movie and releasing a gorgeous, poetic album in this moment is no accident.”

	











	It's apparent that Erivo holds herself to an incredibly high standard. As Morgulis rattles off the singer's schedule for the next few months — wrapping up filming on the forthcoming feature film adaptation of Children of Blood and Bone, hosting the 2025 Tony Awards and performing at least six solo concerts around the country, among dozens of other obligations — she must pause for a breath. “It's a lot,” she says. “But she can do it.”


	But today, the singer stops short of perfectionism. Even in a career as fortunate as hers, she knows that she cannot be everything to everyone. “I used to say, ‘I don't want to make any mistakes. I don't want to get anything wrong,' ” she recalls. “What I'm leaning toward is just trying to be the best version of myself, full stop.

Two weeks after taking second place on the season 23 finale of “American Idol,” 18-year-old country crooner John Foster thrilled fans with a glimmer of the new music he's working on, including inspiration from meeting one of his own idols. 

On May 31, 2025, Foster posted a new music video, filmed in one take, of himself performing “Amazing Grace” with a dose of his Louisiana-infused sound. 

“I thought it fitting that my first Post-Idol music video be ‘Amazing Grace', because it's His Grace that's brought me this far,” he wrote. “This is a raw, one-take recording, and every lyric, including the Cajun French chorus, is a thank you to God. Thank you Fable House for capturing this moment.”

“American Idol” fans saw Foster perform “Amazing Grace” a couple of times, including a portion performed in Cajun French, during his hometown visit on the show, when he serenaded lawmakers at the Louisiana State Capitol on May 14. 

Within 24 hours, over 10,000 fans liked Foster's video, loved seeing his full rendition in the new music video, including one who wrote, “I loved hearing you sing Amazing Grace. John always keep this sweet humble spirit that you have ❤️❤️🙏”

Another commented, “John you are an amazing singer!! How sweet the sound. You have touched the hearts of millions with your beautiful voice. 😘”

“One of favorite gospel hymns,” someone else wrote. “Thank you for singing this one…I pray your life journey is Blessed all the way through and Beyond…Gods Blessings Always be with you…I also Loved the Cajun French added for the ‘flavor' and sentiment that represents all of us fellow Louisianans…Huggs!! 🎵🥰🎶”

On the night before the “American Idol” finale, Foster also released his first single, “Tell That Angel I Love Her,” via 19 Recordings, the show's record label partner.

Two days before sharing his rendition of “Amazing Grace,” Foster shared another meaningful connection to his Louisiana roots, posting a photo with local music legend Wayne Toups on May 29. 

“I'm so glad that this moment was captured,” Foster wrote. “I'm a country musician down to my bones, but there are many genres and musicians that contribute to my unique sound. One of them is this gentleman, Wayne Toups, who is a legend in Louisiana music.” 

The teen continued, “That's what good music is all about: unique sounds combining to connect with the millions. Stay tuned everyone; I'm working hard to get some great things headed your way!”

Foster and Toups — a Grammy-winning artist known for his unique blend of zydeco, Cajun, and southern rock — performed “Mathilda” together at the Cajun Country Memorial Day Festival, according to radio station Gator 99.5. 

Toups also shared photos via Facebook from the concert and wrote, “We even had John Foster hit the stage with me—pure Louisiana magic! It was one for the books!”

Foster will get to perform alongside other legends on June 7, when he makes his Grand Ole Opry debut.

Days after winning the 27th season of “The Voice,” singer Adam David treated travelers at Nashville International Airport to an impromptu concert as they all waited for their flight. 

On May 31, 2025, airport officials at Berry Field Nashville airport (BNA) posted video footage of David, 34, who was waiting to board his flight. As he stood at the gate, he pulled out his acoustic guitar to perform a mini-concert for his fellow passengers.  

The airport's social media team captioned the post, “What happens when The Voice Season 27 winner @adamdavidofficial is flying out of BNA? A live performance at the gate, of course! Huge thanks to @spiritairlines for making this unforgettable moment happen. Just another day of live music at BNA!”

A post shared by Nashville Intl Airport (@flynashville)

As David stood near the ticket counter in the video, a Spirit Airlines agent could be heard announcing over the intercom, “A huge congratulations to Adam on winning season 27 of ‘The Voice!'”

Many people seated at the gate applauded, and David then told them, “I'm gonna play a couple songs,” before launching into “Signed, Sealed, Delivered.” Many fans who saw the video couldn't believe that David's fellow travelers weren't freaking out about being serenaded by the singer. 

One person wrote, “those people are way to calm!! I would be geeking out throwing my shoe and hootin and hollerin!! you sound amazing brother so proud of you!!!”

Someone else commented, “Aaaaand that is why you WON!!!! Humble, talented beyond any doubt with a looooot of soul….🔥👏❤️ What a moment! You must be really proud of yourself! You are the real thing! God bless you and never stop loving music and performing… you were born for this!”

Another fan chimed in, “Live at the airport! Now that's a lucky group of people right there! ❤️”

“No matter where,” someone else wrote, “always putting on a grade A show!! 🔥🔥👏👏❤️❤️”

A post shared by Zack Zaro (@zackzaro)

David, who's a native of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was in Nashville to perform at the Recovery Unplugged “Sober Sessions” on May 30 alongside Struggle Jennings and “American Idol” season 20 winner Noah Thompson. 

David, 34, previously sought help from the organization's branch in Fort Lauderdale and celebrated six years of sobriety in March, he told Nashville's News Channel 5, explaining, “Getting clean wasn't easy,” he added. “I went through everything. Detox. I did the full program down there. I wanted to give myself the chance to be successful, and I didn't want to have to go through it again.”

While in Nashville, he also got to reunite and jam with some of his fellow contestants on season 27 of “The Voice,” including Zack Zaro, Tatum Scott, Page Mackenzie, and his fellow Team Bublé member Carlos Santiago. 

In a post about their reunion, Santiago wrote, “Just a couple of #bublébros reunited in Nashville! After our knockouts, I told Adam, ‘you better win…' and he did. Super proud of you bro. This is only the beginning and I pray God blesses you and keeps you on this journey you're embarking on. I'll be cheering you on the whole way! Thank you @michaelbuble for coaching us and for leading him straight to the finish line!”

	President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, the fourth largest contributor to America's trade imbalance, after machinery and electrical equipment and automobiles. A vast majority of these imports are low-cost medicines which account for 90 percent of all prescriptions filled in the U.S. Millions of Americans take them daily for heart diseases and strokes, and to treat life-threatening infections. Disruption of their supply will have catastrophic consequences on America's health, for pharmaceuticals aren't like cars or smart phones one can do without — they're a basic necessity, like food and water.


	But there's a serious case to be made to bring back a large chunk of the manufacturing to the U.S. for reasons of national security, especially in the current divisive and uncertain political climate. It is no secret that the U.S. and China are currently in a testy relation that could escalate into a full blown military conflict over Taiwan. What if supply of these drugs are interrupted? Could there be a scenario where Americans aren't able to attend to machinery in factories or on the farm or, worse, aren't able to respond to a national threat because they don't have the medicines to stay fit for the job?

	











	Tariffs, however, will not alleviate such a scenario. But America's vulnerability is real, and it will take a concerted effort on multiple fronts to make America self-reliant in health care.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The problem with trying to relocate manufacturing of these drugs to the U.S. — which is the president's objective with tariffs — is that these imports are low-margin products. Companies will have a hard time making a business case to manufacture them in the U.S. They can't compete with India and China, the two countries that account for most of the supply of these “commoditized” pharmaceuticals to America, saving the American health care system reportedly more than $400 billion annually.


	India is the main source of supply to the U.S.; in chronic diseases (which account for 90 percent of national health care expenditure) it supplies 60 percent of all hypertension medicines and 90 percent of the two most prescribed blood pressure medicines, amlodipine and losartan. But the kicker is that India relies on China for 70 percent of the raw material. And China directly supplies 40 percent of all raw ingredients used in the U.S. to manufacture drugs.

	For certain life-saving antibiotics like cephalosporins, azithromycin, and penicillin, the dependence on China is as high as 90 percent. One single key ingredient, 6-aminopenicillanic acid, or 6-APA — which is the starting material for a class of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections and is growing in demand — is largely sourced from China. 


	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that in 2019, 72 percent of the raw materials that went into drugs prescribed in the U.S. came from FDA-approved facilities that were located outside the country. 


	In 2021, the Biden administration singled out the raw materials used in drugs sold in the U.S. as being just as critical for national security as semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals. It pointed to antibiotics as an example, citing a 2019 report from China that spoke of Beijing considering leveraging export of “antibiotics as a retaliatory tool in the U.S.-China trade war.” It mentioned Xinhua, China's state media, suggesting China could assume “strategic control” over supplies and limit exports.


	And during Trump's first term, Gary Cohn, then an economic adviser, warned at a security hearing that a Department of Commerce study found that 97 percent of all antibiotics in the U.S. came from China. “If you're the Chinese and you want to really just destroy us, just stop sending us antibiotics,” he said.

	When a skirmish broke out between India and China over a border dispute in 2020, Indian companies became alarmed about whether they would be able to manufacture antibiotics for the country. A story in the Times of India reported that the country depended on China for 90 percent of the raw materials to make the lifesaving drugs. Indian companies urged the government to provide help to bring production back into the country, which they had lost due to China's 15-20 percent cost advantage. 

	











	An executive of a leading manufacturer of antibiotics in India (which manufactures for my firm) said, “We can switch to another country, but the starting chemical to make the raw material comes from China. Without China, we are finished.”


	But China can't be blamed for its success — and its competitors' despair. More than a decade ago, it declared that medicines were a basic necessity for its huge population. With government support, it meticulously invested in large-scale manufacturing plants and manufacturing innovation to make pharmaceutical raw materials cheaply. It was a clever strategy of self-reliance, having full control of the hundreds of raw materials on which others depended.


	U.S. drugmakers seemed not to care. For one, making pharmaceutical raw materials often involves hazardous compounds, and it generates harmful pollutants that are costly to contain. But the biggest reason is that as world leaders in innovation, they're highly focused on research and development. Innovation is their mission, not manufacturing. Patents protect their profit, which depends less on manufacturing costs. 


	These innovator companies have little incentive to plunge into mass manufacturing low-cost medicines, especially the raw materials, where China has a 35-40 percent cost advantage over the U.S. 


	To the president's credit, he is pushing other avenues to make these companies fall in line on his mission to rebuild American manufacturing. He has issued an executive order to push the FDA and other regulatory agencies to expedite the approval process for establishing pharma manufacturing plants in the U.S. And indeed, several leading pharma companies have announced eye-popping investments: Johnson & Johnson said it will invest $55 billion in R&D and manufacturing; Genentech, $50 billion; and Novartis, $23 billion.


	The president seems lulled by these instantaneous pledges. But the fact is they involve manufacturing mostly patent-protected, highly profitable blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes and cancer drugs, and flu vaccines. Few of these medicines are currently imported from China or India. 


	To relocate the production of the low-cost imports on which American health care is so dependent, one of the ideas that has been bandied about in the industry is to modernize and overhaul pharmaceutical manufacturing, a sort of gut-renovation. 


	Today's pharma manufacturing is primitive compared with the aerospace and semiconductor industries, even steel and autos. It's reminiscent of Normal Rockwell's painting of a druggist calmly compounding various ingredients in a mortar and pestle as a sick boy looks on with anticipation. (Parke-Davis, then the largest drug company and now owned by Pfizer, commissioned Rockwell to make a series of illustrations for its ad campaign.)

	











	Production in the factories takes place in a disjointed fashion, in batches: Raw materials are stored in drums in a room, then transferred to another, where they are mixed in a large rotating tumbler. The mixture is hauled to another room, where it's dried, and then to another room where it's pressed into a tablet or filled into a capsule, and finally these are fed into a machine that packs them in blister strips and into a box. One can imagine a continuous process going seamlessly from chemical synthesis to the final tablet or capsule, managed and monitored by sophisticated technology. (This is currently done with biological medicines, where going from cell culture to propagation to filtration, formulation, and filling of vials and syringes is a seamless, automatic process.)


	In October 2019, Janet Woodcock, then director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA, testified before a congressional committee that revolutionizing drug and drug-substance manufacturing was the only way to match the low cost of labor in China and India and bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The agency announced programs to support companies wishing to adopt innovative technologies. (It didn't respond to my request for information on the status of the program.)


	Manufacturing innovations no doubt will help slash costs, but they will be slow and incremental.  What is needed is a leapfrog to get to the goal faster. One obvious way is to strongly persuade some of the companies that export to America to move their production to the U.S. and set up modern, cost-efficient plants.

	These solutions, few as they are with complex challenges, cannot be pursued with tariffs or executive order or piecemeal actions. The administration needs to  consider a large-scale  initiative, akin to the Marshall Plan, to reconstruct pharma manufacturing with loans and grants and other incentives. If there is one industry outside of aerospace and defense, it's the pharmaceuticals where America can be forgiven for ignoring its cherished free-market principles for trade and commerce for national security.

Ethan Hawke is back as serial killer the Grabber for indie horror hit “Black Phone 2.” Three years after “The Black Phone” first rang into theaters in 2022, its sequel already has been deemed a buzzy franchise. The first film grossed $161 million against an $18 million budget, with another installment announced in 2023. 

“Black Phone 2” is co-written by returning director Scott Derrickson along with C. Robert Cargill. The first film was based on a short story by Joe Hill, the son of Stephen King. Hawke's “the Grabber” abducted children and locked his victims in a basement; one of the kids, though (played by Mason Thames), managed to escape with the help of a haunted rotary phone that connected him to the ghosts of previously kidnapped boys. Thames is back for the sequel, along with original co-stars Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, and Miguel Mora.

“Black Phone 2” is produced by Jason Blum for Blumhouse, with Derrickson and Cargill also producing. Hill and Ryan Turek executive produce. Universal and Blumhouse present the Crooked Highway Production. The film was originally set for a June 27, 2025 release but was delayed until the fall.

Director and co-writer Derrickson told THR that the sequel will put an unexpected twist on the premise of the first film. “The first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is typical, a ghost story,” Derrickson said. “But in this one, you've got a ghost that is a villain.” 

He continued, citing how the plot has now differed since the lead isn't a 13-year-old boy anymore, “A middle school coming-of-age horror movie is a different animal than a high school coming-of-age horror film. There's a ratcheting up of intensity because of that.”

Derrickson previously said in interviews upon the first film's release that short story writer Hill had been speaking about expanding the entire “Black Phone 2” universe beyond just a direct sequel, as well. “It's not something that is innately exciting to me, in the case of this story. I'm interested in the characters that we created, and I think there's a tone to the movie that is unique and can be expanded upon,” Derrickson told The Wrap. “So possibly, we'll see. You never know, but I'm certainly not closed off to the idea.”

Universal will release “Black Phone 2” in theaters October 17. Check out the trailer below.

Sir Rod Stewart called off his planned residency show at the Colosseum in Las Vegas on Sunday night (June 1) just hours before set time due to an unspecified illness. The 80-year-old singer pulled out of the show around 6 p.m. local time, with less than four hours to go, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

	The singer shared the news with fans in an Instagram story, writing, “I am sorry to inform you that I'm not feeling well and my show tonight at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace is being rescheduled to June 10.” Stewart said the tickets for Sunday's show will be valid for the new date. In a note posted around the same time, the Colosseum said, “We are sorry to inform that due to illness, Sir Rod Stewart's show tonight at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace is being rescheduled to June 10.”

	After taking home the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2025 American Music Awards last month, Stewart returned to the Colosseum for a trio of shows on May 29, 31 and June 1 before pulling out of the June 2 gig. He is next slated to take the stage in Las Vegas on Thursday (June 5), followed by shows on the 7th and 8th. 


	After that, the “Hot Legs” star is slated to hit the road for a summer tour that will include amphitheater shows in California and Nevada before jumping over to his native England for a Legends slot performance on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival on June 29. Stewart recently announced that he will be joined by Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood at Glasto, where they will reunite their 1960s'70s band Faces. After returning to North America in July, Stewart will criss-cross the U.S. and Canada before resuming the residency  on Sept. 24.

 "I've known Eminem for a long time, and he's a great guy," Sandler previously said of the "Houdini" rapper.

	The sequel follows Adam Sandler's iconic character returning to the green nearly 30 years after the original to raise $300,000 for his daughter's ballet tuition.

	Sandler previously announced the Detroit rapper's inclusion in the highly anticipated sequel during a recent appearance on The Dan Patrick Show.

	“Eminem was cool, he came by, he was great,” Sandler raved of Em, adding, “I've known Eminem for a long time, he's a great guy and he came in and was funny as hell,” he said. “I think we just hung out a day with Eminem and he just shot and shot and he was insane. [He] said a million things we can use and a million that we're glad we have him on tape.” 


	The cameo-filled trailer features a slew of other big names, including Bad Bunny, Travis Kelce, Eric André, Margaret Qualley, and Martin Herlihy. 


	Bad Bunny plays Gilmore's chaotic new caddie, while Ben Stiller, Julie Bowen, and Christopher McDonald reprise their roles from the 1996 classic. The movie also stars Sandler's real-life daughter, Sunny Sandler, who plays Gilmore's daughter.


	Back in August, Sandler also discussed Travis Kelce's cameo in the comedy flick. During a Tonight Show appearance, the comedian shared of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, “He's a very nice guy. You guys would love him in real life. What a big, handsome guy. Funny and cool as hell. He's a stud and he's so funny.”

	











	Directed by Kyle Newacheck and co-written by Sandler and longtime collaborator Tim Herlihy, the film blends nostalgia with a new twist, bringing back fan-favorite characters while introducing fresh faces. Of course, Gilmore's fiery temper and unconventional golf skills are on full display once again.


	Eminem's appearance comes during a prolific era for the rapper. His 2024 album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, moving 281,000 equivalent album units in its first week and marking his 11th No. 1 album.


	The album's lead single, “Houdini,” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, earning Eminem his 23rd career top 10 single and his highest chart debut since “The Monster,” featuring Rihanna, which logged four weeks at No. 1 in December 2013-January 2014. 


	Menawhile, Post Malone is co-headlining the Big Ass Stadium Tour with Jelly Roll, which kicked off in April 2025 and runs through July in North America, before heading to Europe in August and September. The tour supports Post Malone's country-inspired album F-1 Trillion, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


Happy Gilmore 2 swings onto Netflix July 25. Watch the film's latest trailer below.

Linkin Park performed as part of the kick-off show at the UEFA Champions League final in Munich on Saturday night. The rock band showcased four songs — “The Emptiness Machine,” “In The End,” “Numb” and “Heavy Is The Crown” — for the crowd at Munich Football Arena ahead of the match between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan. 


	The show comes ahead of the band's world tour in support of last year's LP From Zero. The North American leg of the tour kicks off on July 29 at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. Linkin Park will then circle the nation throughout August and September — including a massive Dodger Stadium concert with Queens of the Stone Age on the bill — before the U.S. leg concludes Sept. 24 in Seattle.


	Linkin Park kicked off their reunion tour last fall despite protests from the late Chester Bennington's son and mother and a Danny Masterson-related controversy around new vocalist Emily Armstrong. The band's most recent album, From Zero, is their first since 2017's One More Light.

	The band officially added Armstrong to their lineup last September. At the band's first performance in their new incarnation, frontman Mike Shinoda told the audience, “We are thrilled to be back out here. It is not about erasing the past. It is about starting this new chapter into the future and coming out here for each and every one of you. We loved writing this music. We are very fuckin' excited about the new record. So thank you guys very much. We had an incredible night with you.”

	











	Shinoda later spoke about about Bennington's death and what it's been like to perform with Linkin Park without him during an appearance on The Tonight Show. “I think the important thing for us is that we never set out to, like, ‘Let's bring the band back' or ‘Let's find a singer,'” he explained. “That was never our intention or our goal.”

	Prior to the tour's launch, Smallwood took to Iron Maiden's website to request that fans put their phones back into their pockets and witness the show as it's supposed to be seen.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“We really want fans to enjoy the shows first hand, rather than on their small screens,” Smallwood wrote. “The amount of phone use nowadays diminishes enjoyment, particularly for the band who are on stage looking out at rows of phones, but also for other concertgoers. 


	“We feel that the passion and involvement of our fans at shows really makes them special, but the phone obsession has now got so out of hand that it has become unnecessarily distracting especially to the band. I hope fans understand this and will be sensible in severely limiting the use of their phone cameras out of respect for the band and their fellow fans.”


	In the wake of the band's first few shows of their latest tour, Smallwood shared a reflective post on social media over the weekend, thanking fans for their support of new drummer Simon Dawson, and applauding those who heeded his request for limited phone usage during the gigs.

	











	“A huge thank you to every one of you who kept your phones down, respected the band and your fellow fans, and embraced the show the way it's meant to be experienced – in the room with us,” Smallwood said. “That was a great boost for us and the band appreciated it greatly. It is so much better when they can see you unencumbered and that drives them on without that distraction. For the selfish few that didn't and just had to keep videoing… I wish you nothing but a very sore arm!


	“But they were few, and we do hope this support from fans, especially in the floor area in front of the sound desk, continues in Prague tomorrow and beyond,” he added. “As I said before, by all means take the odd quick pic as a memento of a great night, but otherwise please keep your phone in your pocket.”


	Iron Maiden's current Run for Your Lives World Tour marks their performances since wrapping the The Future Past Tour in São Paulo, Brazil in December. That tour was the last to feature drummer Nicko McBrain, who announced his “decision to take a step back from the grind of the extensive touring lifestyle.”

Netflix know that a lot of somebodies want this. The second season of “Nobody Wants This” will premiere October 23. The show first dropped on the streamer last September to sparkling reviews, with IndieWire's Proma Khosla praising the chemistry between leads Kristen Bell and Adam Brody.

The show, created by Erin Foster, finds Joanne (Bell, also an executive producer) and Noah (Brody) in a would-be conventional love story complicated by Noah's position as a rabbi. Popular podcaster Joanne isn't just not Jewish, she's also unreligious generally — as is her entire non-traditional family. As Noah and Joanne attempt to acclimate to each other's worlds, and Joanne explores converting, things get complicated — to put it lightly.

“Nobody Wants This” was renewed back in October, but the drop date was not revealed until the June 1 Netflix FYSEE L.A. Emmy event at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles. The evening featured a screening of the pilot followed by a live taping of Foster's “The World's First Podcast” with Foster, Bell, Brody and fellow cast members Justine Lupe, Timothy Simons, and Jackie Tohn.

 










Stephanie Faracy, Michael Hitchcock, Tovah Feldshuh, Paul Ben-Victor, Emily Arlook, Sherry Cola, and Shiloh Berman will also return for the next batch of episodes, and guests stars will include Miles Fowler, Alex Karpovsky, Arian Moayed, and Bell's “Gossip Girl” co-star Leighton Meester.

Foster based the series on her own life. The actress, writer and podcaster converted to Judaism after falling in love with her Jewish now-husband, Simon Tikhman. Last year, Foster discussed her experience with IndieWire.

“There were about 23 people [in my conversion class] and only three were converting for marriage, which tells you there was 20 very interesting stories going on in that room!” she said. “And I thought it was just interesting. I hadn't ever seen anybody explore that area, and I thought it'd be cool.”

Last month, Foster told IndieWire that Season 2 of “Nobody Wants This” would be “romantic and funny.”

“I'm not in the business of depriving people of what they want on a show like this, and making some like, artistic choice to rob you of what you want to see. I really tried to stay on point with Season 1, [it] was all these firsts, first kiss, first date, and this is going to be the next four to six months of the relationship what that looks like,” she said.

Wet'suwet'en leader Molly Wickham, an indigenous activist, used Canadian film and TV's biggest night to call for a "Free Palestine" when picking up the best documentary award for ‘Yintah.'


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	A Canadian Screen Awards that put marginalized voices front and center and challenged the global political landscape saw The Apprentice, a film about a young Donald Trump, dominate the national film and TV awards Sunday night in Toronto.


	Director Ali Abbasi's Trump origin story won best movie, while Sebastian Stan, the Romania-born American actor who plays the future U.S. president alongside Jeremy Strong as his consigliere Roy Cohn, earned top honors for best leading role.




	Daniel Bekerman, co-producer of the Canada/Ireland/Denmark co-production The Apprentice, said when accepting the prize, “Our movie shows how the young Donald Trump amassed wealth and power by finding a dilapidated building and slapping his name on it as president. We'll see how that works out.”

	Then Bekerman turned to Trump taunting Canada as a possible 51st state for the United States. “Now he wants to slap his name on this country. This is a challenge, but a good challenge, because as independent filmmakers and storytellers, what we need to do, what is our responsibility, is to tell stories with honesty that can build trust and build community. The rise of indigenous cinema in this country gives me hope. The rise of queer cinema in this country gives me hope. But we're faced with power structures that want to silence us. It's time to lock arms,” he added.

	Bekerman added that The Apprentice, which bowed in Cannes, received nominations at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. “But Ali, I told you, you have to come to Canada if you want to find some guts in this industry,” he said in a call-out to director Abbasi in the audience.

	











	Politics also overshadowed the CSAs when Wet'suwet'en leader Molly Wickham, an indigenous activist, came on stage with fellow directors of Yintah, which won for best documentary and follows a decade-long fight to protect indigenous lands from fossil-fuel companies.


	“The fight continues, and we will never give up. Our sovereignty is tied to our collective freedom. Land back. Free Palestine,” a fist-pumping Wickham declared as the awards show was telecast live on the CBC and CBC Gem networks countrywide. 


	Also Sunday night, the best movie director prize went to Andrew Rankin for Universal Language, a deadpan comedy that riffs on Iranian cinema and also earned the Directors' Fortnight audience award in Cannes. “We all know what political moment we're living in. Every day there are new Berlin Walls shooting up all around us and pitting us against each other in very cruel binaries. And if our film stands for anything, it stands for the fact that kindness can be a radical gesture, and that's really what we believe in now more than ever,” Rankin said when accepting his trophy.


	Elsewhere, the best reality series award went to Canada's Drag Race, the Canadian spinoff of the global format from local producer Blue Ant Media and for CTV. Series showrunner Trevor Boris when accepting the award said he saw the reality show as an “island of misfit toys.” He added, “There are so many of us who are different and don't really fit in because of who we love, or because of where we come from. But on this show, we're normal and we just have the most fun.” 

	











	The CTV and CW series Children Ruin Everything from New Metric Media won for best comedy, and Cate Blanchett picked up the best lead comedy performance prize for her star turn in Guy Maddin's political horror-comedy movie Rumours. Supinder Wraich won for best lead performer in a TV drama for her star turn in Allegiance, a CBC police drama. And Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent won for best drama series after the Canadian version of the Law & Order franchise format came into the CSAs with a field-leading 20 nominations.


	Kiefer Sutherland appeared on the CSAs to pay tribute to his late father, Donald Sutherland, who died in June 2024 after a celebrated career with credits like M*A*S*H*, Ordinary People and The Hunger Games. “Somehow this kid, and he was a kid from the Maritimes, felt like he had something to say,” he said of Donald Sutherland as a young man going to England to begin his acting craft before success in Hollywood. “He managed to forge, well, at least in my opinion, one of the most diverse, prolific and important acting careers in the history of film,” Kiefer Sutherland summed up.


	In other prize-giving, the main audience award went to W Network's The Way Home, and the kids audience award went to APTN's Warrior Up! In special award giving, Star Wars: The Acolyte and The Good Place star Manny Jacinto received the Radius Award on Sunday night for his global impact as a performer. “Who knew that applying to random auditions on Craigslist would end up here,” Jacinto told the CSAs audience in Toronto.

	











	And Marsha Greene, co-creator and showrunner of the CBC and BET+ drama The Porter and producer of the ABC series 10 Days in the Valley, accepted the Changemaker Award for calling out systemic racism and discrimination in Canadian TV. “We are in the time when people are questioning the validity and the necessity of this work. Some have even said our moment is over. Well, this is not about a moment. It is about a movement. I'm proud to live and work in a country that prides itself on its diversity, and I challenge all of us as Canadians to continue to move forward toward an industry that is truly inclusive,” Greene said on stage in Toronto.

The trailer for the upcoming Universal and Blumhouse horror movie hit Sunday at the pop culture convention CCPX in Mexico City.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Dead is just a word.


	That's the message behind Universal and Blumhouse's trailer for The Black Phone 2, unveiled Sunday at CCXP Mexico, a pop culture convention being held in Mexico City over the weekend.




	The movie is the sequel to the surprise 2022 hit that made $161 million against an $18 million budget. Based on a short story by Joe Hill, the son of Stephen King, the movie introduced audiences to the Grabber, a masked serial killer who abducts children, locking them up in his basement. One such kid, however, finds an unplugged but haunted rotary phone that connects him to the ghosts of the previous snatched boys. And in that, a possible way out.

					Scott Derrickson Explains Why He Needed to Make 'The Gorge' Before 'The Black Phone 2'		
			









	The movie ends (spoiler alert!) with the Grabber dead, so how the heck is he back? The trailer enticingly builds to a chilling phone conversation between our hero, played by a returning Mason Thames, and the Grabber, once again played by Ethan Hawke, with the latter telling the teen, “You of all people should know that dead is just a word.” Then the trailer unleashes a barrage of horror images.

	Director and co-writer Scott Derrickson, who got on the phone with The Hollywood Reporter prior to the trailer's reveal, was tight-lipped regarding the return. In fact, he was pretty much tight-lipped about a lot of things.


	But he did elaborate on the nature of ghost stories.


	“The first movie was a ghost movie but all the ghosts were victims, which is typical, a ghost story,” he said. “But in this one, you've got a ghost that is a villain.”

	











	With the first movie, Derrickson tapped into his Denver childhood, where bullies and violence were common. For this one, he drew on his high school experience of going to winter camps in the Rocky Mountains. The severity of the weather, the environment and the surrounding Rockies contributed to the tone of the new movie.


	But the difference between middle school and high school ages of the characters is the big change in tone.


	“A middle school coming-of-age horror movie is a different animal than a high school coming-of-age horror film,” says Derrickson. “And there's a ratcheting up of intensity because of that.”


	Derrickson wasn't necessarily planning on a sequel to Black Phone but said Hill wrote to him a month or two after the movie came out with some ideas. And having it set in the high school years proved appealing, especially when he worked out the timing in his head.


	“I thought if I go make another movie first and don't make a sequel now like you're supposed to, then by the time I finish, these kids are all going to be in high school,” he said. The movie he did was the large-budgeted monster Apple TV+ movie titled The Gorge with Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller. “And I can return to these characters in this different stage of their lives.”


	And because of that, Black Phone 2 is more of a horror film than the first movie, which he considers to be a supernatural thriller.


	“It is certainly more violent, scarier, more graphic,” he says. “And part of that is because of the age of the kids.”

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence offers tons of strategy in an excellently designed euro game about finding alien life – and it's getting a new expansion!

Whether you imagine aliens to be benevolent givers of distant technology, horrible monsters from beyond the stars, or just some single-celled bacterium, there's no argument that finding alien life would be a major discovery. But until that happens, we can imagine what it would be like to be part of SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a competitive strategy game with resource management and some tableau building. The goal of each player is to earn the most victory points by the end of the 5th round. Victory points are scored in a vast variety of ways. However, players will be mostly wanting to find traces of life on various planets in order to discover new alien life and learn more about them to score big.

On each players turn, they will perform various actions like launching probes to scout out nearby planets, dropping landers on those planets to do some deeper analysis, scanning deep space around Earth, discovering new technologies, analyze data, and more.

Depending on the technologies each player unlocks, they will have a different edge over their competition for each different action. For example, one technology makes landing a rover cheaper, while another offers a wider range while scanning deep space.

As players are racing to launch probes, drop rovers, and also land on the multitude of moons, they might score points based on who got there first, who did the most research, and so on. But one the alien life is found, the game really begins!

There are several different alien species to be discovered, and players won't know which they've found until it's discovered. At that point, the aliens special setup and rules are revealed. The alien species will offer new cards for players to collect into their hand as well as new ways to earn points and resources.

The game ends at the end of the 5th round. At which point the player with the most points wins!

SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a game that offers a ton of strategic depth. Plus there are lot of different tactics to reach victory. There are many different mechanics and systems that seamlessly work together in order to offer a great gaming experience. It's on the heavier side of complexity. But if that's not an issue for you gaming group, you might love SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

You'll be able to expand your search for alien life later this year. SETI: Space Agencies adds asymmetric organizations that will change how you scan the stars. These private tech companies and global research networks have unique abilities, strategic advantages, and starting conditions. 

The expansion introduces new alien species with their own unique traits, as well as more than 40 project cards that provide variety and strategic options. It also adds a new mechanic, Signal Tokens, that enhances scanning efficiency.

SETI: Space Agencies arrives in Q4 this year.

At the heart of the book trade since 1858

Sphere has won a seven-way auction for a paranormal romance trilogy from bestselling Spanish author Elena Armas. 

Senior commissioning editor Molly Walker-Sharp at the Little, Brown imprint negotiated UK and Commonwealth rights (excluding Canada) in the trilogy from the TikTok and Sunday Times bestselling author in a deal brokered by Anna Carmichael of Abner Stein on behalf of Jessica Watterson at Sandra Dijkstra and Associates. North American rights went to Berkley PRH and a global release is planned for autumn 2026. 

Sphere said: "Elena Armas first burst onto the romance scene in 2021 with The Spanish Love Deception, which has sold more than a million copies worldwide. The Icarus University series is Armas' first paranormal fiction, and will immerse readers in a small upstate New York college town with its first instalment, Alma Vampires, in which the life of an heiress, Valle Aguirre, is threatened after her mother's death and she must enlist the protection of Hadrian Cruz – the man whose fortune and secrets rival her own – as she searches for answers.” 

Walker-Sharp said: "True to form, Elena has married together all my favourite romance tropes (billionaire x vampires x dark academia) with so many nods to the all-time favourites we all grew up devouring – with Spanish folklore interwoven at every turn. The result? Pure slow-burn, angsty magic – and all of us at Sphere and Little, Brown are so, so excited to be partnering with Elena as she breaks this new dawn in her publishing."

Armas added: "From the first note I got from Molly and the team at Sphere, I knew that my transition to paranormal romance couldn't be in better hands. They not only understood my vision for this series, but also the vibes I want to capture and the homage I want to pay to the early aughts romances that shaped who I am today."

Armas is a Spanish writer whose books have been translated into over 30 languages.

Our paper fills this gap based on a three year-long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working Group. We reviewed past studies of habitability, but find that the lack of a universally valid definition of life prohibits a universally applicable definition of habitability.

A more nuanced approach is needed. We introduce a quantitative habitability assessment framework (QHF) that enables self-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models: First, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key conditions in the habitat. Second, a viability model, which describes the probability that a metabolism is viable given a set of environmental conditions.

We provide an open-source implementation of this framework and four examples as a proof of concept: (a) Comparison of two exoplanets for observational target prioritization; (b) Interpretation of atmospheric O2 detection in two exoplanets; (c) Subsurface habitability of Mars; and (d) Ocean habitability in Europa. These examples demonstrate that our framework can self-consistently inform astrobiology research over a broad range of questions. The proposed framework is modular so that future work can expand the range and complexity of models available, both for habitats and for metabolisms.

Visual summary of key considerations and arguments about the nature and scope of the definition and use of the term “habitable”. There are strong and valid arguments both for a simpler and more specific meaning and for a more complex and more universal meaning. Any single definition for “habitability” fails to meet the majority of the requirements. — astro-ph.EP

Overview of the NExSS Framework for Habitability. The framework assesses the suitability of habitats for model organisms/ecosystems. The potential habitats are described through a combination of system/planet-specific data and priors informed by exoplanet statistics. Habitat suitability is assessed by applying a function specific to species/organisms to the habitat properties. The outcomes are probabilistic in nature. This framework is both flexible and specific. A special case of habitat suitability is included that corresponds to “surface liquid habitability”. — astro-ph.EP

Overview of the temperatures ranges in which representative types of terrestrial organisms are biologically active (i.e., likely to complete life cycles). — astro-ph.EP

The search for extraterrestrial life in the Solar System and beyond is a key science driver in astrobiology, planetary science, and astrophysics.

A critical step is the identification and characterization of potential habitats, both to guide the search and to interpret its results. However, a well-accepted, self-consistent, flexible, and quantitative terminology and method of assessment of habitability are lacking.

Australia has been receiving high-level briefings from the United States' UFO task force for years, despite the repeated denials of the top military brass, newly revealed emails show.

Login or signup to continue reading

Freedom of information documents from December 2021 show US officials discussing a briefing regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAPs) - the modern term for UFOs - with its Five Eyes allies.

The email chain included officials from the United States UAP Task Force (UAPTF) and an Australian defence representative, using a US Department of Defence email address.

"Re tomorrow's UAP briefing, I received confirmation from Australia and Canada they will be here ... and of course UK," a UAPTF official wrote. 

However, a scheduling conflict led to the meeting being rescheduled for early January, 2022, much to the annoyance of the Office Under the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security (OUSD).

"I recall you and your team said last week that you wanted to come in today to brief the other partners. Because of this I urged the partners to build time into their schedules and come in for the brief," the OUSD official wrote.

"The last thing we want to do is be dismissive of our allies and their time," a UAPTF official replied.

"We definitely would like to continue this conversation with the partners, and now have an obligation to do so for multiple reasons."

The former Chief of Air Force - and now Vice Chief of Defence - Air Marshal Robert Chipman twice told senators during an estimates hearing that Australia had not been briefed on UAPs after the email exchange and rescheduled Five Eyes briefing. 

In November 2022, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked if the US had discussed UAPs with Australian intelligence services or the Air Force.

"I'm not aware of any formal discussions that we've held with the US," Air Marshal Chipman said.

"I imagine it would have come across my desk if those discussions were held in the last four months."

During the Senate estimates hearing the following year, the Air Marshal was more adamant in response to Senator Whish-Wilson's questions, which specifically queried if Australian defence attaches had received UAPTF briefings.

"No," Air Marshal Chipman said.

"No briefings at all," Senator Whish-Wilson said.

"No," Air Marshal Chipman repeated.

Briefing notes prepared in May 2022 for Air Marshall Chipman's Senate estimate hearing also state that neither "the US nor any other nation or ally" had requested or offered to collaborate on the issue of UAPs.

"Defence has no desire to seek collaboration on this issue," the briefing note states.

The Department of Defence refused to answer questions from The Canberra Times.

Grant Lavac, an Australian civilian UAP researcher, said the lack of transparency was "quite concerning".

"The Chief of Air Force leads all discussions on UAP in Australia, so if there's one person that needs to know what is happening on this topic in an Australian context and our discussions with allies, it's him," Mr Lavac said.

"He's either uniformed because there is a complete lack of intelligence sharing, or there's a degree of incompetence, or it's something more sinister like plausible deniability.

"Any one of those three scenarios is concerning."

It's not the first time the Australian Defence Force has misled Senators about the nation's UAP activities.

In 2024, Defence officials admitted Australia sent representatives to a UAP briefing in the Pentagon, after vigorously denying any involvement.

The agenda of the meeting, which was attended by members of the Five Eyes alliance, was later released by the US government.

It shows the alliance - which includes US, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand - met for a "caucus working group" to "cultivate shared awareness of allies' UAP issues, detection, and mitigation activities and challenges".

They discussed the need for "networks to share Five Eyes UAP reporting", including documents marked "top secret" and "special intelligence", along with UAP "collection planning".

"The intention is to develop a framework for future UAP collaboration," one document said.

Australia's UAP policy has previously been criticised for being out of step with its closest military allies, including the US, which introduced mandatory UAP reporting for defence personnel in 2021.

The US considers UAPs a potential flight safety and national security risk, while other allies have acknowledged the unknown aerial phenomenon, including the UK, Canada, France and Spain.

The Canberra Times has previously reported Australian Defence personnel don't feel comfortable reporting UAP sightings through official channels and freedom of information documents revealed senior Defence officials mocked the subject while preparing briefing notes.

The Australian Defence Force stopped collecting reports of UAPs in 1996, "after determining there was no scientific or other compelling reason to continue to devote resources to the recording and investigation of UAP".

Do sharks have best pals? Can cute-seeming animals be vicious? And does ancestry matter any more? The answers lie in this week's finest listens

“Who really gives a shit about roots any more,” asks Dashon (Caleb McLaughlin), a Detroit teenager who, in this audio drama, is begrudgingly in Zimbabwe with his family. He is indifferent towards their African ancestry, leading to uncomfortable conversations about race, colonialism and privilege. That could be a provocative enough story, but the supernatural twists that follow really elevate this production. Hannah J DaviesAudible, all episodes out now

TOKYO- Unverified earthquake predictions from manga artists, psychics, and feng shui practitioners have triggered widespread travel cancellations to Japan, particularly from East Asian countries. 

As per a CNN Report, despite lacking a scientific basis, these supernatural forecasts have created tangible economic impacts on Japan's tourism industry. The travellers are either postponing or cancelling their visits amid fears of an impending catastrophe.

A 1999 manga by artist Ryo Tatsuki, “The Future I Saw,” has significantly contributed to the current wave of anxiety. The comic correctly indicated March 2011 as a period of major disaster. This coincided with the devastating Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. 

Tatsuki's updated “complete version,” published in 2021, now warns of another major seismic event scheduled for July 2025. This fuelled fears across social media platforms.

Following the manga prediction, multiple psychics from Japan and Hong Kong have issued similar warnings about imminent destruction. These forecasts have gained traction online, particularly in East Asian countries where supernatural predictions sometimes carry cultural significance. 

The cumulative effect of these warnings has created a climate of apprehension among potential travellers despite the absence of scientific evidence.

CN Yuen, managing director of Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, reported to CNN Travel that bookings to Japan dropped by 50% during the Easter holiday period. 

The agency anticipates further declines over the next two months as fears persist. The impact has been most pronounced among travellers from mainland China and Hong Kong, representing Japan's second and fourth largest tourist markets, respectively.

The concern has transcended regional boundaries, reaching countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Social media platforms in these nations now feature abundant content advising against Japan, demonstrating how quickly unverified information can spread globally.

The geographic expansion of these fears illustrates the power of social media to amplify unscientific predictions across diverse markets.

Despite the widespread concern, official statistics demonstrate Japan's continued tourism strength.

The Japan National Tourism Organisation reported a record 10.5 million visitors in the first quarter of 2025. Chinese mainland visitors increased 78% year-on-year to 2.36 million, while Hong Kong arrivals grew 3.9% to 647,600 during the same period.

Japan's location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” makes it inherently vulnerable to seismic activity. In January, the Japanese government announced an 80% probability of a major earthquake striking the southern Nankai Trough within the next 30 years. 

However, seismologists consistently maintain that predicting the exact timing of earthquakes remains scientifically impossible, with some experts criticising the government's probability assessments.

For Japanese residents, earthquake preparedness represents a constant reality rather than a periodic concern. 

The country maintains some of the world's most advanced early warning systems and building codes specifically designed to withstand seismic events. 

Japanese society has developed sophisticated disaster response protocols following historical experiences with major earthquakes.

The contradiction between supernatural predictions driving travel cancellations and Japan's sustained tourism growth highlights the complex interplay between superstition, social media influence, and travel decision-making in modern society.

While authorities continue to emphasise science-based preparedness over prediction, the economic impact of these unverified forecasts demonstrates their tangible effect on consumer behaviour across the region.

Ministers from both countries discuss framework agreement and diplomatic upgrades to enhance regional connectivity and ties

In a significant diplomatic and economic development, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of Pakistan and Afghanistan's Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi held a high-level phone call on Sunday to advance the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line project, a transformative infrastructure initiative aimed at reshaping the geopolitical landscape of Central and South Asia.

The proposed 573-kilometer rail link, connecting Tashkent, Kabul, and Peshawar, and extending to Gwadar and Karachi ports, is expected to cost $4.8 billion. It is set to be a vital trade route, linking Central Asia's landlocked economies with international markets, potentially driving regional economic growth and enhancing connectivity.

According to a statement from Pakistan's Foreign Office, both ministers emphasised the urgency of finalizing the framework agreement for the UAP Railway project, signaling their shared commitment to moving the project forward. 

This dialogue followed Dar's recent conversation with Uzbekistan's Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich, in which they coordinated the final details for the upcoming signing ceremony of the agreement.

In addition to the infrastructure discussions, the call also highlighted a diplomatic thaw between the two countries. Minister Muttaqi expressed Afghanistan's appreciation for Pakistan's decision to elevate its diplomatic mission in Kabul from chargé d'affaires to ambassador level, with Afghanistan pledging to reciprocate by upgrading its envoy in Islamabad. 

This step marks a positive shift in the historically tense relationship between the two countries, which had been marked by years of mistrust.

“This is a very positive development,” said Muttaqi, framing the embassy upgrade as a milestone in the growing relationship between the two “brotherly countries.” This diplomatic shift follows similar actions by China and the UAE, which have both taken steps to engage with the Taliban-led Afghan government.

Both ministers also reviewed progress on various agreements from Dar's visit to Kabul in April, reiterating their commitment to building mutual trust and cooperation in a region that has long been affected by geopolitical tensions.

As Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan continue their work on the UAP Railway project and diplomatic relations continue to improve, these efforts may signal a new phase of cooperation and stability in the region, long troubled by division and uncertainty.
