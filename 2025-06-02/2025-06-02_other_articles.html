                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence offers tons of strategy in an excellently designed euro game about finding alien life – and it's getting a new expansion! Whether you imagine aliens to be benevolent givers of distant technology, horrible monsters from beyond the stars, or just some single-celled bacterium, there's no argument that finding alien life would be a major discovery. But until that happens, we can imagine what it would be like to be part of SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI: Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence is a competitive strategy game with resource management and some tableau building. Victory points are scored in a vast variety of ways. On each players turn, they will perform various actions like launching probes to scout out nearby planets, dropping landers on those planets to do some deeper analysis, scanning deep space around Earth, discovering new technologies, analyze data, and more. Depending on the technologies each player unlocks, they will have a different edge over their competition for each different action. For example, one technology makes landing a rover cheaper, while another offers a wider range while scanning deep space. As players are racing to launch probes, drop rovers, and also land on the multitude of moons, they might score points based on who got there first, who did the most research, and so on. There are several different alien species to be discovered, and players won't know which they've found until it's discovered. At that point, the aliens special setup and rules are revealed. The alien species will offer new cards for players to collect into their hand as well as new ways to earn points and resources. Plus there are lot of different tactics to reach victory. There are many different mechanics and systems that seamlessly work together in order to offer a great gaming experience. You'll be able to expand your search for alien life later this year. SETI: Space Agencies adds asymmetric organizations that will change how you scan the stars. The expansion introduces new alien species with their own unique traits, as well as more than 40 project cards that provide variety and strategic options. It also adds a new mechanic, Signal Tokens, that enhances scanning efficiency. Just so you know BoLS may collect a share of sales from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

At the heart of the book trade since 1858

Sphere has won a seven-way auction for a paranormal romance trilogy from bestselling Spanish author Elena Armas. 

Senior commissioning editor Molly Walker-Sharp at the Little, Brown imprint negotiated UK and Commonwealth rights (excluding Canada) in the trilogy from the TikTok and Sunday Times bestselling author in a deal brokered by Anna Carmichael of Abner Stein on behalf of Jessica Watterson at Sandra Dijkstra and Associates. North American rights went to Berkley PRH and a global release is planned for autumn 2026. 

Sphere said: "Elena Armas first burst onto the romance scene in 2021 with The Spanish Love Deception, which has sold more than a million copies worldwide. The Icarus University series is Armas' first paranormal fiction, and will immerse readers in a small upstate New York college town with its first instalment, Alma Vampires, in which the life of an heiress, Valle Aguirre, is threatened after her mother's death and she must enlist the protection of Hadrian Cruz – the man whose fortune and secrets rival her own – as she searches for answers.” 

Walker-Sharp said: "True to form, Elena has married together all my favourite romance tropes (billionaire x vampires x dark academia) with so many nods to the all-time favourites we all grew up devouring – with Spanish folklore interwoven at every turn. The result? Pure slow-burn, angsty magic – and all of us at Sphere and Little, Brown are so, so excited to be partnering with Elena as she breaks this new dawn in her publishing."

Armas added: "From the first note I got from Molly and the team at Sphere, I knew that my transition to paranormal romance couldn't be in better hands. They not only understood my vision for this series, but also the vibes I want to capture and the homage I want to pay to the early aughts romances that shaped who I am today."

Armas is a Spanish writer whose books have been translated into over 30 languages. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our paper fills this gap based on a three year-long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working Group. We introduce a quantitative habitability assessment framework (QHF) that enables self-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models: First, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key conditions in the habitat. We provide an open-source implementation of this framework and four examples as a proof of concept: (a) Comparison of two exoplanets for observational target prioritization; (b) Interpretation of atmospheric O2 detection in two exoplanets; (c) Subsurface habitability of Mars; and (d) Ocean habitability in Europa. These examples demonstrate that our framework can self-consistently inform astrobiology research over a broad range of questions. The proposed framework is modular so that future work can expand the range and complexity of models available, both for habitats and for metabolisms. Overview of the NExSS Framework for Habitability. The potential habitats are described through a combination of system/planet-specific data and priors informed by exoplanet statistics. This framework is both flexible and specific. A special case of habitat suitability is included that corresponds to “surface liquid habitability”. Overview of the temperatures ranges in which representative types of terrestrial organisms are biologically active (i.e., likely to complete life cycles). The search for extraterrestrial life in the Solar System and beyond is a key science driver in astrobiology, planetary science, and astrophysics. A critical step is the identification and characterization of potential habitats, both to guide the search and to interpret its results. However, a well-accepted, self-consistent, flexible, and quantitative terminology and method of assessment of habitability are lacking. Daniel Apai, Rory Barnes, Matthew M.

Freedom of information documents from December 2021 show US officials discussing a briefing regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAPs) - the modern term for UFOs - with its Five Eyes allies. The email chain included officials from the United States UAP Task Force (UAPTF) and an Australian defence representative, using a US Department of Defence email address. "Re tomorrow's UAP briefing, I received confirmation from Australia and Canada they will be here ... and of course UK," a UAPTF official wrote. "I recall you and your team said last week that you wanted to come in today to brief the other partners. "The last thing we want to do is be dismissive of our allies and their time," a UAPTF official replied. "We definitely would like to continue this conversation with the partners, and now have an obligation to do so for multiple reasons." The former Chief of Air Force - and now Vice Chief of Defence - Air Marshal Robert Chipman twice told senators during an estimates hearing that Australia had not been briefed on UAPs after the email exchange and rescheduled Five Eyes briefing. In November 2022, Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson asked if the US had discussed UAPs with Australian intelligence services or the Air Force. "I'm not aware of any formal discussions that we've held with the US," Air Marshal Chipman said. "I imagine it would have come across my desk if those discussions were held in the last four months." During the Senate estimates hearing the following year, the Air Marshal was more adamant in response to Senator Whish-Wilson's questions, which specifically queried if Australian defence attaches had received UAPTF briefings. Briefing notes prepared in May 2022 for Air Marshall Chipman's Senate estimate hearing also state that neither "the US nor any other nation or ally" had requested or offered to collaborate on the issue of UAPs. "Defence has no desire to seek collaboration on this issue," the briefing note states. Grant Lavac, an Australian civilian UAP researcher, said the lack of transparency was "quite concerning". "The Chief of Air Force leads all discussions on UAP in Australia, so if there's one person that needs to know what is happening on this topic in an Australian context and our discussions with allies, it's him," Mr Lavac said. "He's either uniformed because there is a complete lack of intelligence sharing, or there's a degree of incompetence, or it's something more sinister like plausible deniability. "Any one of those three scenarios is concerning." In 2024, Defence officials admitted Australia sent representatives to a UAP briefing in the Pentagon, after vigorously denying any involvement. It shows the alliance - which includes US, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand - met for a "caucus working group" to "cultivate shared awareness of allies' UAP issues, detection, and mitigation activities and challenges". They discussed the need for "networks to share Five Eyes UAP reporting", including documents marked "top secret" and "special intelligence", along with UAP "collection planning". "The intention is to develop a framework for future UAP collaboration," one document said. Australia's UAP policy has previously been criticised for being out of step with its closest military allies, including the US, which introduced mandatory UAP reporting for defence personnel in 2021. The US considers UAPs a potential flight safety and national security risk, while other allies have acknowledged the unknown aerial phenomenon, including the UK, Canada, France and Spain. The Canberra Times has previously reported Australian Defence personnel don't feel comfortable reporting UAP sightings through official channels and freedom of information documents revealed senior Defence officials mocked the subject while preparing briefing notes. The Australian Defence Force stopped collecting reports of UAPs in 1996, "after determining there was no scientific or other compelling reason to continue to devote resources to the recording and investigation of UAP".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TOKYO- Unverified earthquake predictions from manga artists, psychics, and feng shui practitioners have triggered widespread travel cancellations to Japan, particularly from East Asian countries. As per a CNN Report, despite lacking a scientific basis, these supernatural forecasts have created tangible economic impacts on Japan's tourism industry. The travellers are either postponing or cancelling their visits amid fears of an impending catastrophe. The comic correctly indicated March 2011 as a period of major disaster. This coincided with the devastating Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Tatsuki's updated “complete version,” published in 2021, now warns of another major seismic event scheduled for July 2025. Following the manga prediction, multiple psychics from Japan and Hong Kong have issued similar warnings about imminent destruction. These forecasts have gained traction online, particularly in East Asian countries where supernatural predictions sometimes carry cultural significance. CN Yuen, managing director of Hong Kong-based travel agency WWPKG, reported to CNN Travel that bookings to Japan dropped by 50% during the Easter holiday period. The impact has been most pronounced among travellers from mainland China and Hong Kong, representing Japan's second and fourth largest tourist markets, respectively. The concern has transcended regional boundaries, reaching countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Social media platforms in these nations now feature abundant content advising against Japan, demonstrating how quickly unverified information can spread globally. Despite the widespread concern, official statistics demonstrate Japan's continued tourism strength. Japan's location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” makes it inherently vulnerable to seismic activity. Japanese society has developed sophisticated disaster response protocols following historical experiences with major earthquakes. The contradiction between supernatural predictions driving travel cancellations and Japan's sustained tourism growth highlights the complex interplay between superstition, social media influence, and travel decision-making in modern society. While authorities continue to emphasise science-based preparedness over prediction, the economic impact of these unverified forecasts demonstrates their tangible effect on consumer behaviour across the region.

It is set to be a vital trade route, linking Central Asia's landlocked economies with international markets, potentially driving regional economic growth and enhancing connectivity. This dialogue followed Dar's recent conversation with Uzbekistan's Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich, in which they coordinated the final details for the upcoming signing ceremony of the agreement. Minister Muttaqi expressed Afghanistan's appreciation for Pakistan's decision to elevate its diplomatic mission in Kabul from chargé d'affaires to ambassador level, with Afghanistan pledging to reciprocate by upgrading its envoy in Islamabad. This step marks a positive shift in the historically tense relationship between the two countries, which had been marked by years of mistrust. “This is a very positive development,” said Muttaqi, framing the embassy upgrade as a milestone in the growing relationship between the two “brotherly countries.” This diplomatic shift follows similar actions by China and the UAE, which have both taken steps to engage with the Taliban-led Afghan government. Both ministers also reviewed progress on various agreements from Dar's visit to Kabul in April, reiterating their commitment to building mutual trust and cooperation in a region that has long been affected by geopolitical tensions. As Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan continue their work on the UAP Railway project and diplomatic relations continue to improve, these efforts may signal a new phase of cooperation and stability in the region, long troubled by division and uncertainty.
