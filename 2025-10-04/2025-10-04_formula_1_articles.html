ONBOARD: George Russell's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore GP Qualifying: Verstappen hits traffic on his final Q3 run

George Russell denied Max Verstappen pole position for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix.

George Russell set two laps good enough for pole position and will start at the very front for the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday.

The Mercedes driver posted a 1m 29.158s which left him 0.182s clear of Max Verstappen and a further tenth ahead of Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri.

It marks Russell's first pole under the floodlights in Singapore and the first for Mercedes since Lewis Hamilton's lap in 2018.

Piastri, meanwhile, was nearly four-tenths off Russell's time in third. I think there was a little bit left in it but not enough for pole. It's just been a pretty good weekend – very solid, no major hiccups or anything like that. I think the start of Qualifying we seemed pretty good, and then everyone else just seemed to find a lot of time and we didn't really. “I think a few things changed from yesterday to today with the track and everyone's just been pretty close, and anyone that nails it has been towards the front. The Mercedes are much, much faster, and I'm sure between Oscar's and my lap is a tenth in it or something, or maybe a little bit more, but not the four that that we need or the three and a half that we need. In terms of whether having a better feeling in the car gives him an additional sense of confidence for Sunday's race, Norris answered: “Not really. This track's kind of where you qualify is more than likely where you're going to finish, but there are still chances so we'll have to wait and see.”</p>

As the track started to get busier and most drivers had put a time on the board – with just Verstappen and Russell yet to venture out by the 15-minute mark – Lando Norris went fastest on a 1m 31.021s, prompting his engineer to respond: “Welcome back” While Antonelli then went quickest on a 1m 30.760s, it was confirmed that Lewis Hamilton – the driver he replaced at Mercedes – had been noted for a red flag infringement, an incident that it was later confirmed would be investigated after the session. Meanwhile another yellow flag appeared after Albon mirrored his team mate's earlier moment by briefly making a trip down the escape road, this time at Turn 16. There was frustration for FP1 pacesetter Fernando Alonso, the Aston Martin man being asked to limp his car home with just over 15 minutes remaining in the session. Elsewhere, more drivers were switching to the soft tyres for their flying laps. Russell slotted in-between them in second place, though admitted that he was “struggling for confidence” in the corner where he suffered a crash during Friday's FP2. Amid a few moments of traffic in a busy final minutes – with one seeing Verstappen with little room to manoeuvre alongside Alpine's Franco Colapinto as they tried to leave room for Pierre Gasly – Verstappen held on to P1 with a margin of 0.017s from Piastri, the McLaren driver slotting in a fast lap in the closing moments. Russell had to settle for third ahead of Antonelli in a decent showing for Mercedes, followed by Norris, Sainz and the Racing Bulls machine of Isack Hadjar. Hamilton – who faces a stewards' investigation over that red flag infringement – was eighth, while Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and the other Ferrari of Leclerc rounded out the top 10. Albon claimed P11 from the Kick Sauber of Gabriel Bortoleto (P12), the Haas duo of Esteban Ocon (P13) and Ollie Bearman (P14), and Alonso (P15). Colapinto was 16th while Lance Stroll took 17th for Aston Martin.</p>

2025 Singapore GP Qualifying: Verstappen hits traffic on his final Q3 run

Oscar Piastri set the pace during a disrupted second practice hour on Friday in Singapore, but can McLaren lead the way throughout the weekend or is one of their rivals looking likely to pose a challenge?

It wasn't the smoothest of days for Formula 1's 10 teams in Singapore as a disrupted second practice – which is the only practice session to take place at night and thus the only representative running drivers will get before Qualifying – meant very few long runs were completed, while multiple drivers had to abort their soft-tyre runs because of stoppages or yellow flags. That makes it's very tricky to work out a pecking order - but there are a few trends that emerged....

Championship leader Oscar Piastri wasted no time putting his frustrating weekend in Baku behind him (he suffered his first DNF of the year with crashes in both Qualifying and the race) to go top of the pile – and it looks like his McLaren is the one to beat as they search for 13 points this weekend to wrap up the Teams' Championship.

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz have both been disqualified from Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix due to technical breaches on their Williams cars. Albon and Sainz placed 12th and 13th in Saturday night's session at the Marina Bay Street Circuit but will lose those results after the team failed post-Qualifying checks. “The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked on car numbers 23 (Albon) and 55 (Sainz),” read a note from FIA F1 Technical Delegate Jo Bauer. As is standard procedure with such a scenario, the stewards later confirmed that Albon and Sainz had been disqualified from Qualifying. “Accordingly, the standard penalty applicable to technical infringements is imposed.” As a result, Alex and Carlos have been disqualified from Qualifying for tomorrow's Singapore Grand Prix. At no point were we seeking a performance advantage and the rear wings had passed our own checks earlier in the day, but there is only one measurement that matters and we fully accept the FIA ruling. "We have a car capable of scoring points here this weekend and will do everything we can to fight from the back of the grid tomorrow, and will immediately review our processes to make sure this doesn't happen again."</p>
