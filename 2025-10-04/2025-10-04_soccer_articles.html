                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella says his side tried to exploit Liverpool's right-hand side in their 2-1 win over the reigning champions. After Cody Gakpo had equalised following Moises Caicedo's opener, left-back Cucurella set up youngster Estevao for a 95th minute winner and the Spaniard says boss Enzo Maresca had identified Mo Salah staying forward as a weakness for the opposition. “We know that Salah is always ready for the counter attack so we practiced that and the manager said that the space might be there [on the right side of Liverpool],” Cucurella told Sky Sports. I tried to give my last effort and Enzo gave me the ball and I crossed for Estevao.” On the victory, Cucurella said: “I think we deserve it. We need to improve these things. “But in general I think we deserve this win. It was not an easy week for us. Playing Champions League we play every few days. It is good because if you lose then you have another game in a few hours.</p>

Adidas will be bringing back the white FIFA World Champions badge for the Argentina 2026 World Cup away kit.

The leaked Argentina 2026 World Cup away kit features a black and blue swirling design, paired with the lighter variant of the champions badge.

It marks the first time since France's 2020 home kit that the white version of the badge has been used, and the first time Adidas have given it to Argentina. Both the 2022 and 2024 home and away kits only carried the gold version.

The Adidas Argentina 2025-2026 away kit with the white FIFA World Cup winners badge football shirt will be available from March 2026. The white badge is not yet available for retail but is expected to arrive with the launch of the away kit next year.

A former member of the defensive ranks at the likes of Real Madrid and Sevilla is on the verge of a move to Major League Soccer, with Lionel Messi's Inter Miami.

That's according to transfer insider Fabrizio Romano, who point towards Sergio Reguilón as the player in question.

Left-back Reguilón is for his part currently available as a free agent.

This comes after the 28-year-old saw his contract terms with Premier League outfit Tottenham Hotspur allowed to expire earlier this summer.

A number of clubs, in turn, are understood to have expressed an interest in Reguilón's signature with a view to the season ahead.

And as alluded to above, late this week, one such suitor appear to have won out in the battle for his services.

As per a report from journalist Fabrizio Romano:

‘Inter Miami in talks for surprise move to sign Sergio Reguilón! Negotiations well underway to join MLS side on free transfer after leaving Spurs in July. Reguilón, expected to accept as he sees Inter Miami as best option despite multiple proposals on the table.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Enzo Maresca's home side have had an up-and-down start to the season. Champions Liverpool won their opening five Premier League games but fell to a late defeat against Crystal Palace last weekend, then lost their Champions League visit to Galatasaray in midweek. While still top of the league, they could be overtaken by Arsenal when the north London side play at home to West Ham United earlier on Saturday. Chelsea have yet to play well for a full 90 minutes. Injuries have not helped, and it looks like they are already paying a price for competing at the Club World Cup until the middle of July, which also impacted their pre-season preparations. But two league wins out of six is not good enough. Gregg Evans: For most of these early weeks, Liverpool have leaned on late goals and resilience to get results. The bigger question now is: how long before this new-look line-up truly hit their stride? Johnson: Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens have yet to establish themselves in the first team. Striker Liam Delap (hamstring) and midfielder Dario Essugo (thigh) have been ruled out for several weeks. Joao Pedro is a very good buy from Brighton & Hove Albion, having scored five goals in his first six appearances, including at the Club World Cup. His fellow Brazil international Estevao Willian is a real talent but just 18. Evans: All the talk is centred around Florian Wirtz and his slow start. For a player of such talent, the expectation is that he would be fully up and running by now, but he's taking his time to adjust. Club record signing Alexander Isak has not hit top gear yet, either, although that was expected, given he had only a short pre-season. Elsewhere, full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have been steady, but there's room for improvement. Centre-back Giovanni Leoni suffered the heartache of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage in his debut for the club and will be out for about a year, but Giorgi Mamardashvili will now get his chance in goal following Alisson's latest injury in Istanbul on Tuesday. Johnson: A combination of making very sloppy mistakes defensively and ill discipline. Their back-to-back league defeats in the past two matches, against Manchester United and Brighton, saw them go down to 10 men, in both cases having a player sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity. Trevoh Chalobah's dismissal last Saturday means he is suspended against Liverpool, and Chelsea are still learning to cope with the loss of his fellow centre-back Levi Colwill for most of the season with an ACL injury. Having star player Palmer struggling with an ongoing groin problem is not helping either. Back-to-back defeats for only the second time in head coach Arne Slot's 17-month tenure have left many people wondering whether he has made too many changes too quickly, even though every incoming and outgoing — minus the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold — made sense this summer. Breaking up a midfield unit that was so successful last season hasn't helped performances, and trying to fit in both Wirtz and Isak hasn't worked just yet. Johnson: Maresca is learning to cope with the harder schedule, just like his players. The 2-2 draw with Brentford last month raised alarm bells as he named key starters Reece James, Marc Cucurella and Palmer on the bench that day. Every position is covered, so injuries should not be too much of a concern. However, they are already stretched in defence following Leoni's season-ending setback, and the failed summer pursuit of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi. Elsewhere, there's no set right-back just yet, and the debate over Isak or Ekitike up front rumbles on. Liverpool are also trying to create a pathway for 17-year-old forward Rio Ngumoha, and that will continue as the season progresses. Johnson: Joao Pedro is not a traditional No 9 and likes to drop deep. That is going to limit the number of chances he gets. As mentioned, Delap is on the treatment table for weeks to come. Maresca has opted for teenage academy graduate Tyrique George, who prefers to play as a winger, to fill in on occasion, and it isn't really working. Another 19-year-old, Marc Guiu, was recalled three games into what was meant to be a season's loan at Sunderland after Delap's injury but has not played a single minute since. However, being without Palmer — their main creative spark — so often would hurt any team. He is going to miss out against Liverpool as well, which means he will have started just two of the season's first seven league games. While midfielder Enzo Fernandez is their top goalscorer so far with three in the six top-flight matches, Chelsea are clearly missing an edge up front. Evans: Isak was always going to take time, given his late return to training after a summer in transfer limbo, but Ekitike has hit the ground running after his move with four goals in eight games in all competitions. Federico Chiesa has also chipped in with important strikes and goal contributions, mainly off the bench. Evans: After a mammoth summer spend, Liverpool are still expected to retain the title and go deeper into the Champions League than their round of 16 exit last time (though that was to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain on penalties). The rivalry was particularly bitter when Chelsea had a much better side than this one and also had characters, like then manager Jose Mourinho, stirring the pot. Last season, Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk hinted that Chelsea could be in the title race, but after a promising start that had them second in December, they tailed off. Evans: Well, this is awkward, because I'm going for a Chelsea win. Like the previous game between these teams at Stamford Bridge, at the end of last season, although not as emphatic as that day's 3-1 result — 2-1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ball's design features three prominent colours: red, green and blue that also pays homage to the three host countries. The ball will carry iconography representing each of the three host countries: a maple leaf for Canada, an eagle for Mexico and a star for the United States, while gold embellishments pay tribute to the FIFA World Cup Trophy. The Trionda will have some big shoes to fill. After all, FIFA history is full of World Cup balls created for specific editions. But before we get to balls with names like Telstar, Azteca, Jabulani, Al Rihla, we should talk about why the need for an official ball arose in the first place. Their opponents were adamant on using the Tiento ball, which was made of 12 long panels. With neither side willing to budge, it was decided that both balls would be used for each half each. How much did their preference of a ball matter? Argentina were leading 2-1 at the interval with their favoured Tiento ball. Then Uruguay got their favoured ball for the second half, and they won the match 4-2 by scoring three second half goals. The Federale 102 consisted of 13 hand-stitched leather panels. It was the team captains who were given the choice of which ball to use in their games. Modern day advertising and marketing mavericks look away now. Because the Paris-produced Allen balls that were used during the France 1938 World Cup did not have any branding on the balls used during the biggest platform any brand could have: a football World Cup (even if it wasn't the earth stopping behemoth it is today). Instead, it had valves through which the ball could be inflated with a pump and a needle. The Swiss World Champion was made from greased leather, 18 long pieces of leather, in fact, that were joined together by nylon threads and arranged in rows of three panels. But the ball caused troubles for players when it rained. At this stage, leather balls were not waterproof. FIFA picked this ball by hosting a competition, where 102 unbranded footballs were submitted. Top Star balls were available in yellow, light brown and white. If you saw photos from the final of the Sweden 1958 World Cup, you probably remember a young Pele galloping with a shiny white ball at his feet. The white ball in question was the Top Star, which had 24 leather strips that were coated with wax to keep out moisture. The Top Star was so popular with players of this generation that players demanded that it be used in the 1962 World Cup quarter-final as well between Czechoslovakia and Hungary. This gave it the appearance of being more spherical. While the ball retained its shape for longer by allowing air to escape more slowly, there ball was criticised for absorbing water. Another event where the official ball was picked after a contest. In this one, over 100 unbranded balls were submitted to the Football Association. FIFA website notes that a group of experts tested the circumference, roundness, weight, loss of pressure and rebound distance of each ball before announcing that the Challenge 4-Star, made by British firm Slazenger, was the winner. This was the first time that Adidas was appointed as the official ball supplier – a partnership which continues to this day. The Telstar consisted of 32 panels – 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons, a design that became synonymous with footballs. The ball was resistant to water and mud. In fact, Adidas provided two options for the tournament: a whiteball that was ideal for floodlit matches, and an orange one that offered better visibility in snow. The ball — which got its name from tango, the famous dance form with origins in 19th century Argentina — was actually made in France. Just like its predecessor from Argentina four years ago, the Tango Espana had a design with 20 black triads on hexagonal panels, with each triangle combining to form 12 circles. The ball had designs that mimicked Aztec murals and was made entirely from synthetic material (for the first time in World Cup history), ensuring that absorption of water was minimised. The ball was named in honour of the Etruscan people, who lived in central and northern Italy from around 800 to 100 BC. The ball sported a design with heads of three lions roaring which was a common design in Etruscan culture, found on many stone sculptures. This football paid homage to USA's space exploration by having planets, rockets and stars printed on the ball. The ball had 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal panels. The first football to feature syntactic foam. This was also Adidas' first multi-coloured offering for the tournament. The balls had four trigonal designs on them, which were meant as a nod to wind turbines, in a celebration of alternative energy sources The hand-stitched balls boasted an improved layer of syntactic foam that provided extra cushioning for greater control and accuracy. Teamgeist (team spirit) was said to be less than one percent short of being a perfect sphere. Rather than the tried and tested hexagonal and pentagonal panels favoured by balls used in the previous eight tournaments, Teamgeist had 14 panels designed to resemble propellers which were thermally bonded, rather than being stitched together. Jabulani – which means to celebrate in Zulu language – had 11 colours on it. The Jabulani proved to be a bit controversial with goalkeepers such as Gianluigi Buffon of Italy and Julio Cesar of Brazil, unhappy at its unpredictable behaviour in the air. The Brazuca was tested by over 600 professional footballers besides 30 teams of scientists running it through laboratory tests. Over one million people voted for the name of the ball, with Brazuca emerging as the top choice – a term used by Brazilians to express pride in their way of life The design of Telstar 18 paid tribute to Adidas' iconic first World Cup match ball from almost 50 years earlier. The ball had a embedded NFC (near-field communication) chip, which allowed fans to interact with the ball using their smartphones. The ball was made of six textured panels which were glued together, rather than being stitched, which means it had no seams. Adidas marketted the Al Rihla ball as being faster in flight than any other in the tournament's history. Al Rihla means ‘the journey' in Arabic. Adidas said that Al Rihla included ‘Connected Ball' technology, which proved invaluable in helping match officials make faster and more accurate decisions during the tournament, particularly in relation to tight offside decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tickets for the 2026 FIFA World Cup officially hit secondary markets with prices rising as high as over $38,000 for the final. On Wednesday, FIFA opened the first window for ticket purchases through the Visa presale, with a select number of fans, out of over 4.5 million who applied, getting a first chance to buy tickets. From the primary market, ticket prices were already shocking for many fans worldwide. Meanwhile, the USMNT opener in Los Angeles saw tickets between $560 and $2,735, and Mexico's in Mexico City ranged from $370 to $1,825. Yet, as much as those initial prices shocked soccer fans worldwide, the secondary markets have seen prices astronomically skyrocket into small fortunes, especially for the final. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC (US Only). FIFA operates an official secondary market in the United States and Canada, charging both sellers and buyers a 15% fee, which in turn pushes prices even higher. In Mexico, though, the secondary market is regulated, and FIFA agreed to limit prices to face value on a ticket exchange platform. At the same time, tickets from resale sites carry a risk of scamming and issues related to the initial purchase through FIFA's Fan ID program. Unlike past World Cups, local fans were not given special access or pricing for tickets, and no official supporters' groups have been given ample access either. Each host nation's federation also received 8% of the tickets to their games, and has various avenues for distributing tickets among family, officials, alumni and other desired recipients. However, that amount has had little impact on the larger market. “Obviously, FIFA operates and runs a World Cup and sets policies, but I think the market is also important for people to consider,” Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue told Sports Illustrated, having launched the CanadaRed program to distribute some of the federation's 8% to supporters. “The market for high-end sports and entertainment has accelerated dramatically in the last little while ... We would want everybody who wants to experience the World Cup to be able to experience it, and we don't like the fact that if people are priced out, it results in a negative experience. While the prices in the initial sales and resales have skyrocketed, they could vary following the World Cup draw Dec. 6, when fans will have an idea of which teams are playing where.
