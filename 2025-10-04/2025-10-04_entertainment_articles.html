Director Paul Greengrass thrives on recreating real-life crisis, whether it's putting audiences aboard a commercial airplane hijacked on 9/11 (“United 93”) or a container-ship overrun by Somali pirates (“Captain Phillips”). However, his journey to discover how to recreate the 2018 Camp Fire that engulfed Paradise, California for “The Lost Bus” was filled with detours. “I'd [wanted] to make a movie about a wildfire that is the best that it can be done, up to now, with the technology available,” he said. Related Stories Essential Midnight Movies: 7 Cult Films to Worship If You've Got Plans to F*** with Hollywood, Too ‘Anemone,' ‘After the Hunt' Shake Up New York Film Festival as ‘One Battle' Heads Into Second Weekend — Screen Talk “So I was very taken with that and thought, ‘Ok, what we'll have to do is have a Sphere-type experience around the bus.” This meant embracing the LED virtual stages pioneered by Star Wars series “The Mandolorian.” Greengrass and his team got to work, spending pre-production dollars on feasibility studies and tests. “So we then went in entirely the opposite direction.” “The Lost Bus” locations team found an abandoned campus in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The enormous area supplied the production with different terrains, multiple winding tree-lined roads, and free rein to shoot with moving vehicles and to light its own controlled fires. “It enabled us to have a bedrock of reality,” said Greengrass. We weren't burning stuff that [sent] particles into the atmosphere that could create a forest fire, and we could control all the dangers.” “People talk about CGI as in computer-generated images, but the truth is nowadays some of them are not,” said Greengrass. Visual effects supervisor Charlie Noble's team created their own controlled burns to film in an effort to capture the wild and wide range of fire's unpredictable behavior. The Paradise inferno's movement, color, power could change in a split second. “It was the most painstaking piece of work I've seen. Perhaps the most painstaking adjustment Greengrass felt compelled to make came in form of light. Specifically, what happens when a fire produces so much smoke it blocks the daylight. It's both dark and light all at the same time. This meant a very different way of approaching the shoot day. Then, rather than split the action into different camera setups or shots, Greengrass would aim to get two or three longer takes of that day's action, which later could be cut together with additional, tighter coverage of the cast shot on a sound stage. “That gave the film its dramatic emotional intensity in terms of performance because it was a sort of once and only once kind of experience, in the light, rather than, 'Shot four, now we go on to shot seven,' and the orthodox way you might do it, so those are the elements,” Greengrass said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following her massive $2.2 billion Eras Tour and its global implications, Taylor Swift is hanging up her rhinestone feathered headpiece for a while. The 14x Grammy winner recently admitted that although Eras “exceeded any of our expectations,” she has no desire to take her 12th studio album The Life of a Showgirl on the road after its release on Friday. “I'm gonna be really honest with you,” said Swift on BBC Radio 1. Running March 2023 to December 2024, the Eras Tour encompassed Swift's entire repertoire, spanning 149 shows across 51 cities to become the highest-grossing tour of all time. “I had so much fun on that tour. My joints are good,” noted Swift of her life off the road, adding: “I could only do the Eras Tour when I was on the Eras Tour and that's two years of having no other hobbies. In August, Swift announced The Life of a Showgirl as her next album. Deadline later exclusively reported that AMC had secured an Oct. 3-5 release for the album's accompanying film of the same name. Last month, Deadline exclusively reported that Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl quickly earned $15 million in its first day of pre-sales, forecasting a $29M-$31M opening weekend at 3,700 theaters. Maybe a Vegas residency is more befitting Swift's showgirl era? Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So it would be bizarre if she didn't have an Elizabeth Taylor obsession. La Liz was an opulent mess her whole life. But “Elizabeth Taylor” is so much more than just the peak of her long-running Liz fascination. The showgirl yearns for true love — yet on her own fiercely independent terms. Swift has always identified with Liz, but this is where she claims the story as her own. Song for song, Showgirl is her best since the Folklore/Evermore double-shot of five years ago — that might look like an unbeatable zenith, but then so did Red before Folklore happened. So many contenders for the album's funniest line, yet “Elizabeth Taylor” has the winner: “We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank's / They call me bad news, I just say thanks.” (A close second: “I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness.”) (Sadly, “Wood” did not turn out to be about Natalie.) The whole world knew them as “Liz and Dick.” They were decades too early for a nickname like “Elizadick” or “Turton,” though they called themselves “Le Scandale.” The couple made eleven movies together, and battled through each one. But the Liz/Swift soul connection goes deep, way beyond their shared name. They turned into controversial women, denounced and slut-shamed as their lives became gossip fodder. “The rumors are terrible and cruel, but honey, most of them are true” — that's a line that could have come from Liz's lips in Butterfield 8. Both stars were married to other people, but who cared? When they went public, it was an international scandal. Republicans in Congress called for the Attorney General to revoke her passport and cancel his visa. The Vatican newspaper accused them of “erotic vagrancy,” which would make a great Swift song title (and someday probably will). Swift's always had a fascination with this power couple. On her 2018 Reputation Tour, her backstage Rep Room was decorated with a Liz-and-Dick theme, with vintage posters for their movies like Cleopatra and The V.I.Ps. Off Season Drops New Sports Apparel Line for WNBA Playoffs She also went Liz for her 2014 “Wildest Dreams” video, where she plays a brunette actress filming on location in Africa, falling in love with her co-star. Her leading man: Scott Eastwood, whose dad co-starred with Burton in Where Eagles Dare. Never accuse Taylor of not obsessing over the details. She once posted a photo of her cat sitting on a copy of the book Furious Love: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and the Marriage of the Century, by Sam Kushner and Nancy Schoenberger. Her caption: “Olivia loves to read historical Hollywood biographies.” In 2018, she discussed this bio in her interview with the rock & roll muse Pattie Boyd (who married both George Harrison and Eric Clapton). “I read a book about Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor recently, and how there was this crazy frenzy surrounding them,” Taylor said. But she goes all the way in “Elizabeth Taylor,” turning her life into folklore. (Did I mention Taylor obsesses over the details?) “Often times it doesn't feel so glamorous being me,” she laments. She might be the talk of Hollywood, but that's a place where you're only as hot as your last hit, baby, and she knows people are rooting for her to take a fall. She used to have herself paged, just so she could walk across the lunch room and try to turn heads. Even at 19, she was seen as a femme fatale. “But I think people have been unfairly severe.” She never got a chance to mature in private. Her first husband, whom she married at 18 and left at 19, told the press, “Every man should have the opportunity of sleeping with Elizabeth Taylor, and at the rate she's going every man will.” But the most bitter had to be crooner Eddie Fisher, her fourth husband, who suffered the public humiliation of leaving his wife Debbie Reynolds for her (as well as their daughter Carrie), then getting dumped for Burton. He did a revenge-theater show with a song called “Cleo, the Nympho of the Nile,” with lyrics such as “Just like Elvis/She used her pelvis.” (This story, like so many great Liz tales, comes from Kitty Kelley's classic Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star, one of the juiciest Hollywood dishfests ever.) When they first met, he was starring in a London production of Hamlet, and naturally having an affair with the actress playing Ophelia, Claire Bloom. (Just as Taylor plays Ophelia on the album cover.) But he and Liz fell in hate at first sight. He called her “MGM's Little Miss Mammary.” She called him “the Frank Sinatra of Shakespeare.” When he got cast as Mark Antony, he complained, “Well, I guess I've got to don my breastplate once more to play opposite Miss Tits.” But a week into filming, they were inseparable, sneaking off to his trailer between scenes. Burton wasn't her most likeable husband (that would be Michael Wilding) or her most attractive (Mike Todd), or even the hammiest actor (Fisher), but they were addicted to each other. Both were jet-set alcoholics; by the end, he drank three bottles of vodka a day. When he died in 1984, his widow banned Liz from the funeral. Even Bob Dylan, on his 1963 classic The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan — the folk poet spends the album pondering big themes like war, justice, and death, but his final punch line is “Make love to Elizabeth Taylor / Catch hell from Richard Burton.” Cleopatra was Liz's favorite role — she identified with the passionate queen. “To me,” she said, “Cleopatra was more like a tigress than a sex kitten, even at 19, when she first met Caesar and had been queen for only two years.” Taylor can relate to that — in the Speak Now vault track “When Emma Falls in Love,” she sings about a girl who's “like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town.” (And like Taylor, Cleo had some issues with snakes.) Liz won her first Oscar for Best Actress as the vamp in Butterfield 8, purring lines like “Flesh and blood can only stand so much voluptuous torture.” But in their movies together, she and Burton loved to play couples at war with each other, throwing their real-life conflicts into Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? That film might be a Tay fave, considering “Who's Afraid of Little Old Me,” where she sings about growing up in the fame machine as Liz did, sneering, “You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me.” But Elizabeth Taylor specialized in a very Swiftian kind of role: the woman who lives with a horrible secret she can never tell, because nobody would believe her. If she trusted anyone enough to confide in them, they'd call her insane. (“This you won't believe!” she screams in Suddenly Last Summer. Liz played this woman so many times — and so has Taylor, in songs from “Cassandra” to “Mad Woman” to the new album's “Cancelled!” But she has so many of these characters in plain sight — like in “Blank Space,” where she's got a long list of ex-lovers who'll tell you she's insaaaane. As she once asked, “When everyone believes you, what's that like?” When Liz died in 2011, at 79, it was the end of an era. “The last of the Hollywood greats,” in the words of George Michael  — another legend who gets a Showgirl showcase, in “Father Figure.” (It's George's song title, but it also sounds like his career story.) She married a “Father Figure” once—the distinguished British actor Michael Wilding, twice her age. By all accounts, this was one of her friendliest marriages, producing two sons and no hard feelings. Their son Christopher, now 70, has thanked Swift for writing a song about his mom. Taylor Swift Conquers Her Biggest Stage Ever on ‘The Life of a Showgirl' Hayley Williams Confirms Morgan Wallen Is the ‘Racist Country Singer' She Sings About The Terrifying New Memo Trump Could Use to Go After His Opposition She sued to stop a biopic in 1982, saying, “I am my own commodity. I am my own industry.” These words were much-mocked, like everything she said or did in those days. A few years ago, it was Lindsay Lohan.) Yet Taylor Swift is one of the few people who knows exactly what Liz was talking about. “I'm in the business of human emotion,” she said. “So I would so much rather lead heart-first in something like this, because to me this isn't something like, ‘I want to own this asset because of its return.' That's the real bond between these two Taylors — their lifelong fight to hold on to their independence, despite public exposure. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The reason I wanted to do a high school movie was that it has more interesting emotional stakes,” Derrickson told SFX Magazine of the sequel, which premieres Oct. 17 in theaters. After escaping the Grabber's (Ethan Hawke) clutches and putting his killing spree to a permanent end in The Black Phone, Finney investigates a winter camp with his younger sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who's had visions of the killer stalking three young boys from beyond the grave. “You just invariably are going to need to be more violent and more aggressive and maybe more shocking, to escalate aspects of the movie beyond what the first movie did, because a good portion of the audience, the teenagers who grew up really loving The Black Phone, they're older now. They're the kids who paid to see Terrifier. We were rated R, and one of the things we were rated R for was gore. There's no gore in the first movie at all.” Derrickson added, “The change that you go through between middle school and high school may be one of the biggest, most dramatic changes you go through in your lifetime, and I was really interested in who these characters have become, having gone through something so extraordinary. I was interested in being more mature, going deeper into the emotions of these characters and trying to make a movie that worked as a pair.” Black Phone 2 had its world premiere last month at Fantastic Fest in Austin, after the original 1978-set film saw the Grabber kidnap young Finney, who's guided to his escape by phantom phone calls from the killer's previous victims. The first movie was a surprise post-quarantine box office success, surpassing $161 million worldwide. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift‘s Life of a Showgirl special theatrical event is rocking at the domestic box office, where it's headed for a first-place finish with a weekend haul of at least $28 million to $32 million from 3,702 theaters, according to estimates from Swift's team and partner AMC Theatres. Rival distributors, however, have it earning north of $35 million. 'Smashing Machine' Subject Mark Kerr on "Gut-Wrenching" Ending and Cussing About Dwayne Johnson's Prosthetics The movie — an awards vehicle for Johnson — is looking at a third-place finish behind Showgirl and holdover One Battle After Another after getting slapped with a B- CinemaScore from audiences. (Critics have been more kind; it's current score on Rotten Tomatoes is an okay 77 percent.) Conversely, Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl earned a coveted A+ CinemaScore from her fans, just as her history-making concert film Eras Tour did. She announced the Oct. 3-5 special event on Sept. 19 in a well-orchestrated social media post informing fans that advance tickets would go sale that day at 12:12 local time for $12, in keeping with Swift's longtime relationship with numbers (Showgirl is her 12th studio album). Consumers can expect to pay notably more than $12 for premium large format screenings. Showgirl, playing in theaters for only three days, can best be described as a series of lyric videos for tracks on her new album, music videos and behind-the-scenes footage. In 2023, The Eras Tour concert pic catapulted Swift to box office fame when it opened to a huge $93.2 million domestically on its way to becoming the top-grossing concert film of all time with $261.6 million in global ticket sales. According to THR‘s review of Showgirl, “The 89-minute cinematic experience — neither visual album nor concert film, and not quite a documentary — is strictly for the diehards. But while there's something to be said for the communal experience of absorbing an album surrounded by dozens of like-minded fans, what's actually being served up on screen is more filler than killer.” Directed by Benny Safdie, Smashing Machine reunites Johnson with his Jungle Cruise co-star and good friend Emily Blunt, who played a key role in bringing Johnson and Safdie together. It marks Johnson's first time making a play in the awards space. The movie will be playing in 90 percent of all Imax auditoriums domestically, but will have to share Dolby Cinema screens and other premium large-format auditoriums.

A source close to the actress told People that while the decision wasn't easy, Kidman is finding peace in focusing on family. Now that it's out, she's just focused on what's ahead and her girls.” As per People magazine, the Oscar winner filed for divorce in Nashville on September 30, citing irreconcilable differences and listing the same day as their official date of separation. “Nicole didn't want this,” an insider said. “She has been fighting to save the marriage.” Page Six reported that the “Moulin Rouge!” star received strong support from her sister, Antonia Kidman, and close family members. The two were spotted walking together in Nashville on October 1, marking Nicole's first public sighting since the divorce news became public. People reported that just days after filing for divorce, Urban returned to the stage for his High and Alive World Tour stop in Hershey, Pennsylvania. While performing “Heart Like a Hometown,” he kept a family photo featuring Kidman and their daughters in the slideshow that plays during the song — a quiet but emotional nod to his loved ones. Before launching into the song, Urban shared a personal story with the crowd about how his parents had supported his dream of pursuing music full-time. His bandmate Natalie Stovall rejoined him for the show after sitting out previous dates. Stovall's earlier absence had sparked speculation over Urban's connection to guitarist Maggie Baugh, who temporarily filled in during his Chicago performance. At that show, Urban ad-libbed, “I'll be your guitar player,” to Baugh while performing “The Fighter,” a song inspired by his romance with Kidman. “My husband Keith once asked, ‘How's your heart?' As she steps into a new chapter, Kidman is keeping that same spirit. Sources indicate that she remains focused on her daughters and moving forward with grace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>defended his and other comedians' decision to perform at the controversial Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia amid a wave of criticism from fellow comics. said he initially had “mixed feelings” about taking the gig, and that he previously turned down opportunities to perform in Arab countries due to censorship concerns. However, he said Saudi Arabia has “kind of opened up.” “When this came up, they said there's only two restrictions; their religion and their government, and I don't have jokes about those two things. It used to be when I got offers from places like that, there would be a long list, and I'd just say, ‘No, I don't need that.' So, there's stuff going on that's unexpected in this thing.” (That aforementioned comedian, Jessica Kirson, has since issued a statement apologizing to fans for performing at Riyadh: “This decision has weighed heavily on my heart ever since. I like to express my sincere regret for having performed under a government that continues to violate fundamental human rights… As an openly gay person, when I was asked to perform in Riyadh, I was surprised. I requested a guarantee that I could be openly out as a lesbian on stage and perform gay material. I hoped that this could help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued. I am grateful that I was able to do precisely that — to my knowledge, I am the first openly gay comic to talk about it on stage in Saudi Arabia. I received messages from attendees sharing how much it meant to them to participate in a gay-affirming event. Earlier this week, comics like David Cross, Shane Gillis, Marc Maron, Atsuko Okatsuka, and more publicly criticized the comedians — including Dave Chappelle, Pete Davidson, Bill Burr, Kevin Hart, and more — who opted to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival. “The money is coming straight from the Crown Prince, who actively executes journalists, ppl with nonlethal drug offenses, bloggers, etc without due process,” Okatsuka wrote on social media. I'm glad these guys brought this stuff up, I'm glad that people are challenging this thing, because you shouldn't just pretend it's something it's not.” But for me, I think it cuts toward going.

During his Friday appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher, he defended his choice to perform at the comedy festival that has stirred up controversy since it kicked off last Friday. The topic of comics being prohibited to not make jokes about certain themes came up in his conversation with Bill Maher, to which C.K. said the fellow comedians he know who have been at the fest have “been really surprised by what's going on.” So, there's stuff going on that's unexpected in this thing,” he said.

Alongside C.K., Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings, Russell Peters, Gabriel Iglesias and Andrew Schulz, among others, are featured on the lineup. Last week, Atsuko Okatsuka shared details from her offer to appear at Riyadh, which outlined “censorship rules” against performing jokes on outlined topics. David Cross, too, slammed those who chose to perform, writing on his website, “I am disgusted, and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing. That people I admire, with unarguable talent, would condone this totalitarian fiefdom for…what, a fourth house? Before that, Marc Maron spoke out against those participating in the comedy festival. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don't miss it! “I mean, the same guy that's gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone saw [journalist] Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a fucking suitcase. But don't let that stop the yucks, it's gonna be a good time!” But for me, I think it cuts toward going. So, the fact that that's opening up and starting to bud, I wanna see it, I wanna be part of it. The six-time Emmy winner is slated to perform at Riyadh Fest on Monday alongside Carr.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new development in the ongoing drama surrounding Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Comedy Festival tonight, as one comedian participating in the festival has now issued a formal apology for doing so, and pledged to donate her payment for the show to human rights groups. This is per THR, which reports that comic Jessica Kirson has issued a statement in which she expresses her “sincere regret for having performed under a government that continues to violate fundamental human rights.” She added that, “I have donated the entirety of what I was paid to perform there to a human rights organization.” I requested a guarantee that I could be openly out as a lesbian on stage and perform gay material. I hoped that this could help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued. That being said, Kirson added that “I deeply regret participating under the auspices of the Saudi government,” and issued an especial apology to her fans, who've been vocal with criticisms on her social media accounts since her participation in the festival became public knowledge. “I have a special relationship with my fans because of the vulnerable nature of my comedy and the trust they place in me as part of the queer community,” Kirson wrote. Meanwhile, many of their contemporaries have called out participants for taking actions that can be seen as lending credibility to the country's royal family and government.

And yet, like the famous censorship decision passed down by the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court — a notoriously feckless group that was somehow still more fun than our current justice system — I must say, “I know it when I see it.” You can't really tell someone they're in a cult unless they're ready to leave one, and you can't really claim to have made a cult film until your movie behaves like that.

Iñárritu on Revisiting ‘Amores Perros' After 25 Years, and His New Tom Cruise Movie: ‘He Will Surprise the World' More entertainers are pushing the envelope to match the extreme feel of daily life, and Hollywood's top decision-makers are taking note of a trend IndieWire's Dana Harris-Bridson is already reporting. In some cases, where and when filmmakers find their niche audiences is as important as how and why studios decide to distribute their art. Think of it like an amateur open mic night, where novice comedians are required to sell tickets or buy a certain number of drinks if they want to perform. Some indie creatives say you've got a better shot at convincing the industry to give you multiple seats at the table for films with social scenes already attached — than they are inviting backers to dream up a culture with them on still-emerging IP. From the Pope of Trash and all that Divine goodness in 1972's “Pink Flamingos” — to Tommy Wiseau's melodramatic “The Room,” a so-bad-it's-good gem that's been tearing us apart since 2003, these are the timeless midnight masterpieces you've got to study if you want your film to hit after dark. What a movie actually is  and how people experience it are two very different things. Released in 1936, this morality tale against marijuana was financed by a long-defunct church group called the Motion Picture Guild. Something like the cinematic Sinclair Broadcasting of its day, the footage from this public service announcement, originally titled “Tell Your Children,” was recut and redistributed under a slew of different names throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Thanks to producer Dwain Esper, the black-and-white exploitation flick was also known as “Love Madness,” “Dope Addict,” “The Burning Question,” and more self-righteous monikers that made it easy to mock during that dormant period. This isn't really the first midnight movie in earnest — that's up next — but the sideways journey it took laid essential groundwork. Legalization activist Keith Stroup eventually co-opted the public domain film and used it to rebelliously bolster his own movement. George A. Romero's “Night of the Living Dead” almost didn't make this list. Still, there's no denying that horror is integral to the midnight movie, and the late Father of Zombies is widely credited with giving both genres their progressive political reputations. (Plus, this thing whips in every way a movie can whip. It isn't even a scary scene, but the line, “They're coming to get you Barbara!” lives in my head rent free. An unrated effort from 1968, Romero's very first feature was a true-blue indie with a weak distro plan that he financed and shot himself. At first, it was marketed like a normal horror release. But after reports of some disastrous screenings, including one Chicago matinee attended by critic Roger Ebert and a pack of hysterical children, “Night of the Living Dead” was increasingly considered “too scary” to show during the day. That PR gold helped launch Romero as a beloved cult film director, although he rarely shared in the profits of the revolutionary works he made. Not yet bested today, the most exquisite zombie movie ever created demanded to be seen by more audiences, and using late-night slots at drive-in theaters and rep cinemas as a cheap way to build out its reputation was brilliant. “Night of the Living Dead” served as a jangly prelude for the existential dread David Lynch would stir up in movie-goers with his debut, “Eraserhead,” less than a decade later. In light of “Reefer Madness,” it's fun to imagine what the prudish Motion Picture Group might have said about the violent psychosexual odyssey that is “El Topo.” Maybe… “Oh, holy fuck!” Alejandro Jodorowsky was a Chilean-French filmmaker and the patron saint of acid cinema whose shoestring Western — shot over six harsh months in Mexico's Chihuahuan Desert — brought unprecedented surrealism to cinema. He insisted on doing everything practically, dragging his team to remote locations and killing real animals for a “more truthful” effect on screen. As he pursues enlightenment, the repeated clashes El Topo has with various enemies along his winding journey mount an existential lesson that caught the attention of John Lennon among others. Jodorowsky is frequently credited as the “father of the midnight movie,” and while he indeed made an extraordinary film, if anyone deserves that title for their work on “El Topo” it's Ben Barenholtz. Before Ben Barenholtz left the Elgin and began the next phase of his career as a producer (he's credited on “Miller's Crossing,” “Requiem for a Dream,” and more all-time releases throughout the years), he programmed “Pink Flamingos” and catapulted Waters' reputation from challenging underground artist to internationally renowned provocateur. The best movies extract emotions from us, and watching the most objectionable material in Waters' masterpiece from 1972 can feel like trying to hold puke back behind your eyeballs. But advertised as a transgressive “exercise in bad taste,” that's what the Elgin was selling, and even despite themselves, audiences ate it up. If “El Topo” established the midnight format as assaulting and transformative, then “Pink Flamingos” anointed it a place of spectacle. The midnight screen became a no-holds-barred arena for freedom of expression through Waters — one that could turn trash into treasure and make filth feel at once frightening and fun. Also known as Harris Glenn Milstead, Divine should have monuments in every city. The legendary porn movie “Deep Throat” came out that year too, but people loved Divine because she turned their judgment of her depravity into a source of joy. That megawatt charisma steered midnight movies deeper into the drag world. In the film, the eventual “Hairspray!” star plays Babs Johnson, the “filthiest person alive.” That's a more coveted title than you'd think living in her candy-colored trailer park, and Waters escalates the battle of depravity that follows through a list of gross-out gags including incest, cannibalism, and that oh-so-whimsical canine feces eating. A group of batshit musical theater kids hit Hollywood in 1975, and midnight was never the same. Having opened “The Rocky Horror Show” on the West End two years earlier, director Jim Sharman and writer Richard O'Brien dreamed a new version of their glam-rock musical — about a conservative couple with a flat tire, who ask for help from a sexy mad scientist in a castle down the road — that would dominate the silver screen for the next 50 years. But finally unleashed on the mainstream American public, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” took about a year to find its sea legs. Known for its callbacks, prop comedy, shadow casts, and more, the result is a powerful pop culture institution that's created a mighty network of midnight movie fans. Developed when he was still a student at AFI, David Lynch's unconventional approach to filmmaking marked him an artistic talent to watch early but he had trouble distributing his soul-shaking first film. Boxed out of several locations by “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” Lynch steadily pushed “Eraserhead” at select locations until it broke through thanks to key offerings at Cinema Village in New York City and the Landmark's Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. As it grew, the buzz surrounding Lynch became a benchmark few could meet and midnights felt longer when he was alive with them. Too much has been written about the late Lynch and the countless talents he had as a sensitive filmmaker and human. So, in lieu of any more serious criticism, I'll take this time to remember him for his handsome ears. But that kind of rhetoric started to cause more of a stir among passionate genre fanbases when more of them felt empowered to argue both the outrageous art and the community experience they worshipped were extraordinary. Those debates rage on for some of the most vexing combinations of craft and camp — think “Showgirls,” “Striptease,” “Cats.” But “The Room” is a sincere and glorious work of dumb-assery that's genius by mistake with a mystery at its center that's still intoxicating today. How much Wiseau paid to cast himself in a bizarre melodrama about a love triangle has been debated for years, but half the fun when it came out was following the movie's rise and witnessing the filmmaker's strange evasiveness whenever he was asked about his background.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rachel Reilly isn't done with reality TV just yet. If she were to be cast, she would become the first contestant ever to complete CBS's “Reality Trifecta” of “Big Brother,” “The Amazing Race,” and “Survivor.” A post shared by CBS Big Brother (@bigbrothercbs) Reilly reshared a video of “Survivor” host Jeff Probst to her Instagram Story. Reilly then tagged a “Survivor” casting director in her post and wrote, “Working on that [audition] tape this week!” She has a lengthy reality television career with CBS. She also works as a casting agent for various unscripted shows. While nothing is guaranteed, if Reilly were given a spot on an upcoming season of “Survivor,” she would become the first person to complete the CBS “Reality Trifecta.” Reilly has competed on three seasons of “Big Brother” and three seasons on “The Amazing Race.” What's left to do? During that interview, Probst was told that Reilly was interested in competing on his show and becoming the first person to complete the trifecta. “I mean, come on, she's got to want it bad enough to send in a little two-minute video and say, ‘Here's why I should be on. This recent push for Reilly to compete on “Survivor” came after she was shockingly eliminated on “Big Brother” in September due to the “White Locust” twist. Fans and former houseguests thought this new twist was unfair. It sent the “Big Brother” legend home without facing an eviction vote. Ultimately, she voted for her ally, Ashley Hollis, to win the game.</p>

Rather than compromise, we're choosing to re-think and re-evaluate.” Tickets for the one-day event, which was being put on by Live Nation, will be refunded. The whole remit of Future Ruins was pretty clearly inspired by Reznor and Ross' own work in film composing, most recently expressed through their (decent, throwback-y) soundtrack for the upcoming Tron: Ares. The announced lineup for the festival was pretty stacked in terms of talent, tapping well-known names like John Carpenter, Mark Mothersbaugh, Questlove, and Danny Elfman to perform (or at least show off their existing tunes? (We'd list the whole slate but it is, uh, pretty moot at this point.) Marketing language around the festival suggested some sort of weird egalitarian structure with its bill, asserting there would be no headliner or hierarchies, and that the group would be a “stacked lineup of visionaries doing something you might not see again.” Or at all, as it turns out!
