                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex de Minaur is treading new ground in 2025. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Saturday eased past Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-4, 6-2 to kick-start his Rolex Shanghai Masters campaign. With his 88-minute victory against Argentine Carabelli, De Minaur registered a personal-best 48th tour-level win in a single season, making him the first Australian man to hit that tally since former World No. It's a great achievement to show the consistency,‚Äù said De Minaur after victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Carabelli. To come back this year and just show that consistency week-in and week-out, I'm very proud of my efforts. ‚ÄúSaying that, there's still a lot of tennis to be played, so hopefully I can keep adding wins to that tally. De Minaur, who did not face a break point against Carabelli according to Infosys ATP Stats, now owns a Tour-leading 35 wins on hard courts in 2025, ahead of Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz (both on 34). The Australian's next challenge in Shanghai will be a fourth-round meeting with Kamil Majchrzak, who defeated 29th seed Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 6-0 to advance. Another Top 10 star, Alexander Zverev, also notched a straight-sets victory in his Shanghai opener, although the German had to pull through a late injury scare before sinking Valentin Royer 6-4, 6-4. 3 from comfortably serving out for his win, but he later acknowledged to feeling uncertainty regarding how serious a problem it could be. ‚ÄúI'm very happy [to get through],‚Äù said Zverev. He is playing very well and moving forward, we will see if I will ever be healthy this year again, because it's been a struggle. Watch Zverev Survive Injury Scare In Shanghai Opener: In other early Saturday action, Felix Auger-Aliassime snapped the momentum of qualifier Alejandro Tabilo in commanding fashion with a 6-3, 6-3 triumph. The Canadian, playing his first match since the US Open and also his first since he got married on 20 September, saved all seven break points he faced to sink Chengdu champion Tabilo and set a meeting with Jesper de Jong, who upset 17th seed Jakub Mensik 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-4. With their second-round wins, Zverev, De Minaur and Auger-Aliassime have boosted their Nitto ATP Finals qualification hopes. Zverev is third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and in strong contention to seal his spot at the prestigious season finale, while De Minaur is seventh, just 325 points behind Ben Shelton. Auger-Aliassime remains in 10th place but is just 630 points behind Lorenzo Musetti, who defeated Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-0 on Saturday and currently occupies the final qualification spot. Zverev is aiming to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the eighth time, both De Minaur and Auger-Aliassime are chasing a second appearance, while Musetti seeks his debut appearance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniel Altmaier has built a reputation as a big-game player, and he has the arsenal to prove it. On Saturday, he will once again test his flair for the upset when he takes on defending Rolex Shanghai Masters champion Jannik Sinner. Altmaier toppled the Italian in their most recent meeting at Roland Garros in 2023, and one year before that, he pushed him to five sets at the US Open. So that's why I feel like I'm dangerous against those [top] guys,‚Äù Altmaier, the No. So that's where I'm also aiming to play constantly. Altmaier's numbers in 2025 back his conviction: He took down Taylor Fritz in the first round of Roland Garros ‚Äî his fifth Top 10 victory ‚Äî and produced a stirring five-set triumph over former World No. Now, facing Sinner in the Italian's opening match as defending champion in Shanghai, Altmaier arrives with the scent of another upset in the air. ‚ÄúI really love these challenges, that's what I play for,‚Äù said Altmaier, who is 1-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner. ‚ÄúI played some brilliant matches this year already. Taylor Fritz, last week [Denis] Shapovalov‚Ä¶ I put them all there [at the top] when they have a great day. Much of Altmaier's danger lies in his one-handed backhand, a shot that has both sting and subtlety. Against Sinner, he will need every ounce of that unpredictability to keep the World No. His deadly down-the-line backhand will make it risky for Sinner to give up too much court in the quest for inside-out forehands. ‚ÄúI think he has the ability to also adjust his game,‚Äù Altmaier said of Sinner. I think that one-handers do actually have a little bit more variety than two-handed backhands.‚Äù After overcoming qualifier Tristan Schoolkate in his Shanghai opener, Altmaier improved his 2025 record to 17-23 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. It's a steady rebound just four weeks after he was nursing a leg injury that forced him to retire from his third-round clash with Alex de Minaur in New York. ‚ÄúTokyo was my first tournament back after my little injury after the US Open, so I'm happy to have a two-set victory here playing some very good tennis,‚Äù Altmaier said. There were a lot of challenges throughout the season. The season is long and I'm getting to learn a lot from this year which is a crucial part in my career.‚Äù No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..
