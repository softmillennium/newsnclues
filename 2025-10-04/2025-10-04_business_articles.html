                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EUNICE, NEW MEXICO — Paul Lorskulsint was a shift manager at a brand new uranium enrichment facility deep in the American Southwest when catastrophe struck Japan in 2011. Thousands of miles away in Eunice, New Mexico, Lorskulsint turned on the television to make sure his team could witness what was happening across the Pacific Ocean. The plant where he was leading an operations shift had just opened in 2010, after the European uranium enricher Urenco had spent years building the facility in anticipation of growing demand. Over the ensuing decade, public support for nuclear power diminshed and a dozen reactors closed in the U.S. as the industry struggled to compete against a flood of cheap natural gas and renewable energy. Demand for the low enriched uranium that fuels nuclear plants dwindled. Fourteen years later, the situation has reversed once again. Urenco USA is racing to expand its enrichment capacity. Doubts persist about whether U.S. power supplies will ramp up quick enough to meet the needs. Increasing uranium enrichment will be a key part of the process, despite the history of past disappointments. Also, U.S. enriched uranium supplies are at risk. Nuclear plants like Palisades in Michigan, Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania and Duane Arnold in Iowa are planning to restart operations this decade after closing years ago. The tech sector is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to bring advanced reactors online in the 2030s to help power their computer warehouses that train and run AI applications. In deeply divided Washington, support for nuclear power is one of the few issues that can still muster some bipartisan support. President Donald Trump wants to quadruple nuclear power by 2050, a significant increase over President Joe Biden's previous goal to triple it by that date. The U.S. has only built one new nuclear plant from scratch in the past 30 years, raising doubts about whether such ambitious plans can be realized. But any effort big or small to expand nuclear power in the U.S. will run through Urenco's facility in New Mexico. The plant currently has capacity to supply about a third of U.S. demand with $5 billion invested in the facility to date. Urenco is expanding its capacity in New Mexico by 15% through 2027 as utilties replace Russian fuel. It has installed two new centrifuge cascades for enrichment this year. But Urenco's expansion alone won't fill the Russian supply gap, Lorskulsint said. "Our competitors will have to expand in order to make sure that as a whole the industry is still supplied," he said. "We're building quickly as we can to make sure that the the industry is not short handed." As Russian fuel is banned from the U.S., the Trump administration is pushing for 10 new large reactors to start construction this decade. The industry is worried about the supply gap, Lorskulsint said, but filling it "is not an insurmountable task." Urenco USA is a candidate to receive a contract from the Department of Energy to produce more low-enriched uranium, part of U.S. efforts to standup a domestic nuclear supply chain. Urenco's competitors are also seeking support from the Energy Department to build out U.S. enrichment capacity. France's Orano is planning to build a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennesse, with operations potentially starting in the 2030s. Publicly traded Centrus has a facility in Piketon, Ohio, where it plans to produce low-enriched uranium, but it hasn't yet started commercial operations. Centrus stock has gained more than 400% this year as investors bet on a growing demand for enriched uranium due to U.S. plans to expand nuclear power. But enrichment is just one stage in a long supply chain that will be stretched by growing demand. The enriched uranium is then shipped to fuel fabricators that manufacture the pellets that go into reactors in power plants. U.S. nuclear plants are facing cumulative supply gap of 184 million pounds of uranium through 2034, according to the Energy Information Administration.The biggest bottleneck right now for Urenco is the conversion of uranium into the feedstock for enrichment, Lorskulsint said. There are only three facilities in the Western world located in Canada, France and Illinois that convert uranium into feedstock. "Every portion of the supply chain is going to have to expand, it's not just about enrichment," Lorskulsint said. "We need more of everything but conversion right now is the bottleneck." The ageing U.S. electric grid could prove to be the real constraint on building new nuclear due how long it takes to complete upgrades, he said. While this could slow Urenco down, it won't stop the expansion, he said. And we are now expanding to make sure that we can still support as much as the market needs from us."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) It could be Warren Buffett's last major acquisition before he gives up his CEO role at the end of the year. It is Berkshire's biggest deal since it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Allegheny in 2022, but it is not the enormous "elephant" that Buffett has been hunting for that would put a significant dent in the company's roughly $340 billion in cash as of the end of June. The deal builds on an already close relationship between the companies:  Berkshire is Occidental's largest shareholder with a stake of almost 27% currently valued at $11.9 billion. As part of that deal, Berkshire also now holds warrants to buy nearly 84 million additional OXY common shares for just under $60 per share, which is higher than their current price just under $45. Despite those ties, Buffett told shareholders two years ago Berkshire will not try to acquire Occidental in its entirety. In a live interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" the morning of the announcement, CEO Vicki Hollub said it will use $6.5 billion of the OxyChem purchase price to reduce its debt, bringing it below the $15 billion target set when it bought Permian Basin producer CrownRock in late 2023 for $12 billion. "The thing that we needed to do was improve our balance sheet. So this is that last big step that we need and now I think we're off and running to value creation that's going to come at a much faster pace for our shareholders." Barron's is blunt in its assessment: "Score one for Warren Buffett at the expense of Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub." It says the purchase price "could be a bargain because earnings in the sector are depressed this year" and are expected to head higher. In addition, Occidental will be losing a chemical business that helped differentiate it from energy rivals. It will also be facing a $1.7 billion tax hit that would have been eliminated had Berkshire used its OXY preferred shares to pay for the deal, as some had anticipated. That means Occidental will probably continue to pay Berkshire more than $600 million in dividends each year until the preferred shares are scheduled to be redeemed in 2029. It quotes Wolfe Research analyst Doug Leggate calling the deal a "win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own [roughly] 30% of. That's the way Berkshire's Greg Abel played it in the deal's news release that, interestingly, never mentioned Buffett's name. Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors has changed the company's by-laws to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. An SEC filing today (Friday) says the board voted to make the revisions on Tuesday, almost three months before current Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel is scheduled to become CEO on January 1. Warren Buffett is no longer raising millions for charity by auctioning off the opportunity to have lunch with him as he has in years past. It is for the benefit of the Dakshana Foundation, which offers higher education entrance exam coaching to impoverished students in rural India as part of an effort to alleviate poverty. Warren Buffett explains how consistency helped him and Charlie Munger gradually build Berkshire Hathaway into what it is today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI launched short-form video app Sora this week, and users have flooded the platform with artificial intelligence-generated clips of popular brands and animated characters. The startup could soon face a deluge of copyright lawsuits, experts told CNBC. "A lot of the videos that people are going to generate of these cartoon characters are going to infringe copyright," Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, said in an interview. "OpenAI is opening itself up to quite a lot of copyright lawsuits by doing this." Sora allows users to create short videos for free by typing in a prompt. The app is only available on iOS devices and is invite-based, which means people need a code to access it. Since its launch on Tuesday, Sora has already climbed to the top of Apple's App Store. CNBC gained access to Sora on Wednesday and has viewed videos that included characters from shows like "SpongeBob SquarePants," "Rick and Morty" and "South Park," as well as movies like "Despicable Me." One video showed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman standing in a field with several Pokémon characters, where he says, "I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us." CNBC was also able to generate several characters and logos independently, including Ronald McDonald, Patrick Star from "SpongeBob SquarePants," Pikachu from the Pokémon franchise, a Starbucks coffee cup and characters from "The Simpsons." The other companies behind these characters and logos did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment. "People are eager to engage with their family and friends through their own imaginations, as well as stories, characters, and worlds they love, and we see new opportunities for creators to deepen their connection with the fans," Varun Shetty, OpenAI's head of media partnerships, told CNBC in a statement. As AI startups have rapidly changed the way that people can interact with content online, media companies and other brands have kicked off a series of fresh legal battles to try and protect their intellectual property. Disney and Universal have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI last week, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization. Characters are copyrightable — meaning third parties can't use copyrighted or original characters without permission — and Sora is primed to be a fresh breeding ground for infringement disputes. If a company loses control over what their copyrighted characters do and say in user-generated videos, it's going to be a problem, Lemley said. "You can imagine why Taylor Swift wouldn't want — even if pornography is off the table — wouldn't want videos of her purporting to say things she doesn't say," he said. "I think the same is going to be true of cartoon characters." OpenAI said it respects takedown requests that are submitted through its "Copyright Disputes" form, which allows content owners to flag specific content. That kind of an arrangement would be unusual, according to Jason Bloom, partner and chair of the intellectual property litigation practice group at the law firm Haynes Boone. OpenAI said it has taken steps to address potential safety concerns around the Sora app, including giving users explicit control over how their likeness is used on the platform. In practice, this means users can't generate videos of another person or public figure without that person's explicit permission. In a blog post late Friday, Altman said similar, more granular controls are coming for rights holders. "We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them," Altman wrote. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

China is making leaps and bounds with carrier technology. It recently showed off its newest aircraft carrier launching jets with electromagnetic catapults, a capability once unique to the US Navy's cutting-edge Ford-class flattops. But while Beijing's carriers may be nearing America's in technological capabilities, experts say they're still a long way from fighting like them. It's building the experience, crews, and doctrine to use them. "You can engineer and build something much quicker than you can build up a group of people to operate it," Bryan Clark, a retired US Navy submarine officer and defense expert at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider. The former two are Soviet designs with ski jumps for launching aircraft. Fujian is a major improvement with its electromagnetic catapults. All of China's vessels are conventionally powered, although there's evidence that it's pursuing a nuclear-powered design. Nimitz-class ships are equipped with steam-driven catapults, while the new first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford has electromagnetic ones. China's active carriers feature a fleet of fourth-gen fighters. The US ships carry a mix of fourth- and fifth-gen jets. While China has been building a carrier fleet for over a decade now, the US Navy has been operating carriers since the early 20th century. Last month, China released video footage of the Fujian launching a J-35 stealth fighter, J-15T carrier-based fighter, and KJ-600 early warning and control aircraft via its electromagnetic catapult systems. Expert observers noted how quickly China's navy moved from no aircraft carriers to Soviet designs to a modern one with electromagnetic catapults. The electromagnetic catapults on the Fujian let China launch a more diversified air wing of not just fighters but also airborne early warning and control assets. Whether that capability is fully mature remains to be seen. The recent launch footage was a test run filmed while the Fujian is still completing sea trials under managed conditions. It's a state-sponsored video that doesn't shed light on challenges. However, US Navy carriers, specifically Nimitz-class carriers, have not only launched and recovered but also deployed with the F-35C, a combat-proven platform. F-35Bs have also been deployed on amphibious warships and foreign carriers. Like the jets, American carriers have been tested in combat. China's primary carrier-based fighter is the Shenyang J-15, an exceptionally heavy derivative of a Soviet design. The Navy can notably employ its aircraft in greater numbers than China; US carriers can support a larger air wing, usually 60-70 aircraft. China's aircraft carriers can also support rotary-wing aircraft like the US Navy, and now with the Fujian, China's People's Liberation Army Navy can also field airborne control and early warning plans like the KJ-600. Serving in a role like the US E-2D Hawkeye, these planes allow a Chinese carrier group to see much farther than helicopters or ship radars, allowing for better coordination and more complex operations. China is still new to aircraft carrier operations and is likely relying on a smaller group of people who've gained experience over the past decade or so, meaning that the workforce isn't comparable yet. "They just don't have the kind of core you would need to do this on a multi-shift basis across an entire carrier fleet," Clark said, highlighting that while the US has officers managing catapult operations and recovering aircraft, those jobs on Chinese aircraft carriers are filled with much higher-ranking personnel, hinting that experience is limited to a smaller cadre of senior figures. The US has multi-generational institutional knowledge built into its Navy schools, training commands, and simulation centers. China is starting from scratch — its "first generation" of carrier sailors are only now moving into senior leadership roles. Likewise, China is still experimenting with its doctrine, while the US Navy has had the opportunity for extensive iterative innovation. China has been focused on training enlisted personnel for technician and operational carrier roles, "but it takes time because you have to build up an entire generation of people," Clark said. It can be expedited by having personnel doing more tours and increasing their experience, but it can't be skipped in the way that some technological and engineering hurdles can. There's also readiness at sea to consider for a carrier fleet. The US has spent decades learning how to keep complex vessels sailing and sophisticated warplanes flying in harsh environments. Warships are supported by a global web of supply ships, repair hubs, and carefully managed maintenance cycles. These are essential skills that only come with time and experience. As the US Navy continues to build Ford-class carriers, ships currently behind schedule, China is continuing to run its new aircraft carrier through sea trials. There are expectations that China will expand its carrier fleet further, and its massive shipbuilding juggernaut has the momentum to build that. China's carriers are all conventionally powered, meaning that without refueling support abroad, they have limited reach. Beijing appears to be working on nuclear-powered propulsion tech for a future carrier though. China already operates nuclear-powered submarines, but all surface ships are conventional. China is suspected to have begun work on a fourth carrier, but it's unclear if it will feature nuclear power.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump told Israel on Friday to immediately stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agreed to release hostages and some other terms in a U.S. plan to end the war, but vexing issues like disarmament appeared unresolved. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel was preparing for an "immediate implementation" of the first stage of Trump's Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas' response. The Palestinian militant group on Friday issued its response to Trump's 20-point plan after the U.S. president gave Hamas until Sunday to accept or face grave consequences. Trump, who has cast himself as the only person capable of achieving peace in Gaza, has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a two-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands and left U.S. ally Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage. Trump said he believed Hamas had shown it was "ready for a lasting PEACE" and he put the onus on Netanyahu's government. "We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. Netanyahu's office said Israel "will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set out by Israel, which align with President Trump's vision." There were also strikes on Khan Younis but no reports of casualties, residents said. Israel, which backs Trump's proposal, has not yet commented on the Hamas response or on Trump's demand for an end to bombing in Gaza. But Israel's parliamentary opposition leader Yair Lapid urged Netanyahu to move forward with the plan. Families of those being held by Hamas in Gaza called on Netanyahu "to immediately order negotiations for the return of all hostages." Domestically, the prime minister is caught between growing pressure to end the war — from hostage families and a war-weary public — and demands from hardline members of his far-right coalition who insist there must be no let-up in Israel's campaign in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron, who spearheaded efforts for wider recognition of a Palestinian state in a bid to help end the conflict, said in a post on X: "Hamas' commitment must be followed up without delay." Israel began its offensive in Gaza after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken as hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says 48 hostages remain, 20 of whom are alive. Its assault has destroyed much of the strip while aid restrictions have triggered a famine in parts of Gaza, with conditions dire across the enclave. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry and multiple human rights experts have concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. Netanyahu's government says it has acted in self-defense. Hamas, in a copy of its response seen by Reuters, did not say if it would agree to disarm and demilitarize Gaza — something Israel and the U.S. want but Hamas has rejected before. It also did not agree to an Israeli withdrawal in stages, as opposed to the immediate, full withdrawal Hamas demands. Qatar has begun coordination with mediator Egypt and the United States to continue talks on Trump's Gaza plan, the Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson said on X. Trump's plan specifies an immediate ceasefire, an exchange of all hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the introduction of a transitional government led by an international body. It said it was announcing its "approval of releasing all occupation prisoners — both living and remains — according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange." The group said it was ready "to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing." Hamas did not make clear whether it would agree to Trump's proposal that it be barred from exercising political power in Gaza. But the group said it should be "included and will contribute" to any Palestinian national discussion on Gaza's future. Earlier on Friday, Trump warned that "all HELL" would break out in Gaza if Hamas failed to agree to his proposal for the enclave by Sunday at 6 p.m. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young Brits are catching flak for their apparent lack of entrepreneurial drive, sparking a broader debate on whether the U.K. startup scene is facing an ambition deficit. It started when U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle criticized British university students for lacking the same interest in starting a business as their American peers. Kyle said at an event hosted by AI chipmaker Nvidia in London. However, only 16% of them actually took the leap into entrepreneurship, with most citing a lack of formal business education as holding them back. "There's definitely a large appetite to explore entrepreneurship from a very young age," Dama Sathianathan, senior partner at Bethnal Green Ventures, told CNBC Make It. Bristol-based entrepreneur Tom Wallace-Smith made Forbes 30 under 30 in Europe last year — but he said entrepreneurship feels out of reach to most people in the U.K. "From people's public perceptions, the whole track of Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg feels quite mythological to people, it's totally out of someone's reach," Wallace said in an interview with CNBC Make It. Wallace, who co-founded nuclear fusion startup Astral Systems in 2021 while finishing a PhD in nuclear physics at the University of Bristol, said he initially didn't know that entrepreneurship was a viable career path, and expected to end up in a big company or become an academic. He argued that the U.K. has no shortage of successful entrepreneurs, but the government and media "could do a better job of telling founders' stories" and increasing exposure to startup environments. A lot of people in the U.K. see entrepreneurship represented via comedic reality TV shows like The Apprentice or Dragons' Den, Wallace-Smith said, and are lacking role models. The FSB and Simply Business survey found that 15% of young current or aspiring entrepreneurs said that seeing others succeed would boost their confidence, but over a third hadn't recieved any guidance or support from local entrepreneurs or businesses. Instead, Stebbings — who's a champion of the 996 work week — said young people seem to aspire to work at corporate firms like Goldman Sachs, and McKinsey. Atomico's State of European Tech 2024 identified a talent leakage to the U.S., with at least 800 companies that could have been founded in Europe instead being established across the Atlantic. In fact, twice as many U.S. companies — 8.3% — raise rounds of $15 million or more, compared with Europe's 4.1%. Although risk appetite continues to exist among British entrepreneurs, it doesn't for investors, Sathianathan said, noting that VCs in the U.K. don't want to risk their money. with tax reliefs for both entrepreneurs and investors diminishing since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The lifetime allowance for Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) has been slashed from £10 million ($13.45 million) to £1 million, while Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rates have risen, leaving founders with smaller payouts when they sell their companies. "This all means it's harder to take the plunge and launch a business than to go for the safety of a PAYE [Pay As You Earn] grad job," he told CNBC Make It. Meanwhile, some early-stage funding incentives are considered generous, but are focused on investors, leaving many startups struggling to secure the capital they need to grow. "It's a structural issue, which then seeps into it becoming a cultural issue, because if you're faced with continuously having to struggle, why would you choose to struggle on this entrepreneur path?" It's not all doom and gloom, though, as the U.K. remains "Europe's premier startup hub," Routley said. Alongside Founders Factory, others include SETsquared, UCL's Hatchery, and Techstars. Additionally, 20VC's Stebbings recently launched Europe's equivalent of the Thiel Fellowship — a program which gives $200,000 to young people under the age of 22 who want to build innovative startups. Alumnis of the U.S. program include billionaire Lucy Guo to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Stebbing's Project Europe, backed by 128 different founders from firms including Klarna, Mistral and Soundcloud, is a fund which will award 200,000 euros ($234,684) to select founders who are 25 years old or younger. However, the U.K.'s House of Lords' Communications and Digital Committee warned earlier this year that the U.K. is at risk of becoming an "incubator economy" — as ideation remains strong, but the ability to scale and grow remains weak. "If we can't solve our pathways to capital markets and incentivise sovereign IP [intellectual property] to stay here, then we risk losing our best companies to better structured regimes with greater liquidity potential," Routley said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BEIJING — China's economic slowdown isn't discouraging U.S. and European brands from revamping their strategies to reach Chinese shoppers. In the case of Kraft Heinz, getting more people in China to buy ketchup this year also meant hiring a local agency to help create catchy campaigns — decorating subway station columns to mimic ketchup bottles and promoting the condiment as a fresh twist on a popular dish: stir-fried eggs and tomatoes. It's a hard market to tackle, even for Shanghai-based marketing firm Good Idea Growth Network (GGN). The agency has witnessed at least five different waves of consumer trends in its 14-year history, founder Stephy Liu, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. But GGN has succeeded even after rejecting an acquisition offer from British advertising giant WPP, Liu said, noting that about half of her clients are foreign brands. While Kraft Heinz isn't done with its China ketchup campaign yet, the company reported second-quarter net sales in emerging markets climbed by 4.2% from a year ago, helping offset declines in North America. WPP explored a potential acquisition of GGN but did not end up going far in the process, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. From Starbucks' struggles to Lululemon's successes in China, it's become clear that the right mix of localization is essential. "Among international brands in China, the winners are often dedicating more than 40% of revenue to marketing, especially content and platform-first marketing, while also iterating products locally based on market data," said Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps foreign brands sell in China. This year, Cooke said that Under Armour has created products under 100 yuan ($14) in order to attract a mass of buyers online, while using livestreams with dedicated users to then build fitness communities and sell more premium products offline. Adapting to that new social commerce ecosystem has become the biggest challenge for brands in the last two years, GGN's Liu said. She warned that success requires a complex strategy that can involve changing everything from how a team is structured to the kinds of products sold. "In half a year, it can help you sell more than you sold on [Alibaba's] Tmall in two years," Liu said. Chinese e-commerce platforms, including Alibaba's Tmall, share far more data on what's popular than Amazon.com does, WPIC's Cooke said. With that granular data, Chinese makeup brand Perfect Diary was able to succeed by identifying a market pain point and creating a lipstick targeted at that lower price segment, Cooke said. He noted that's pressured foreign brands to create China-specific products as well, a big shift over the last five years. E-commerce platforms in China also often show rough figures on how many orders were placed per product, while third-party companies such as Syntun offer significant amounts of product rankings and other online sales data for free. In the case of Apple's iPhone 17 launch on Sept. 19, it was Chinese e-commerce company JD.com that released sales data for mainland China. Some customers in Beijing told CNBC that they liked the iPhone's new cosmic orange color, and that more locals intended to buy their first iPhone this year since they'd heard about new attractive features such as larger internal storage. China's factories were quick to jump on the trend, releasing iPhone cases with a similar orange hue even before the 17 model was out. "Winning brands are those that have established local R&D centers and on-the-ground product teams," said Ashley Dudarenok, founder of ChoZan, a China marketing consultancy. "This allows them to spot trends early, develop products tailored to local needs, and launch them in months, not years. Even with the right data and social media platforms, cultural integration is becoming increasingly important, especially as Chinese brands find success in tapping the country's own history of artisanal craftsmanship. "Brands are moving beyond superficial nods to Chinese culture," Dudarenok said. And despite declining sales in China's luxury market, LVMH this summer opened an eye-catching ship-shaped store in Shanghai — immediately generating much local buzz. In contrast to LVMH's luggage-shaped store in Manhattan, the Shanghai location taps into the Chinese city's history as a port of entry for international travelers to Asia roughly a century ago. The new store also captures the European brand's roots in hand-crafted travel trunks — which contrasts with Chinese brands' inability to offer the same emotional appeal, Joe Ngai, chairman of greater China at McKinsey, pointed out in a LinkedIn post. "As Chinese customers grow in their confidence and desire for local elements," he said, "creating more crossovers between West and East is one of the unique opportunities for multinationals in China."
