Former assistant U.S. attorney Cully Stimson joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the violent anti-ICE protests surrounding Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois, and the dispute between federal and local governments on how to stop it. Federal agents were rammed and boxed in by 10 cars in Broadview, Ill., where anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crowds have been gathering for days, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. "Pritzker's Chicago Police Department is leaving the shooting scene and refuses to assist us in securing the area. There is a growing crowd, and we are deploying special operations to control the scene," McLauglin wrote in a post on X. One of the drivers accused of ramming into the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, according to McLaughlin. She said officers "were forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed U.S. Police clash with demonstrators during a protest outside an immigrant processing and detention center on Oct. 03, 2025 in Broadview, Ill. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) McLauglin noted the armed woman, who was a U.S. citizen, was named in a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intelligence bulletin. The woman allegedly doxxed agents and posted online, "Hey to all my gang let's f--- those motherf------ up, don't let them take anyone." No law enforcement officers were seriously injured during the incident, McLaughlin said, adding that the situation is evolving. The agents were reportedly performing a routine patrol in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, when the alleged assault occurred. On Friday, Fox News witnessed more than a dozen protesters being arrested in the streets near the facility. Local authorities charged at least five people. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem hosted a press conference on immigration near Gov. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Friday that she and her team were blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building, located about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago. Noem said she and her team were stopping for a "quick bathroom break." In the same post on X, Noem slammed Illinois Gov. She also posted a video on Saturday of what appeared to be law enforcement activity. The video was captioned, "Chicago, we're here for you." Earlier this month, ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz, describing the operation as one that, "will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets."

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin joins ‘Fox News Live' to explain how the Trump spending bill enhances Homeland Security's deportation operations and expands detention capacity. The Trump administration is now offering teen migrants a $2,500 stipend to leave the United States voluntarily, according to several reports citing a letter sent Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement to shelters housing migrant children. According to the letter seen by Reuters and other outlets, the department will provide a "one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500" to unaccompanied children 14 or older. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not confirm the monetary amount to Fox News Digital but said Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) could access financial support when returning home, should they choose that option. "Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin," Emily Covington, assistant director of ICE's Office of Public Affairs, said in a statement. She said the offer was first being made to 17-year-olds. Covington said that cartels had trafficked countless unaccompanied children into the United States during the Biden Administration, and that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and HHS have been working diligently to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those children. "Many of these UACs had no choice when they were dangerously smuggled into this country," she said. "ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families." The Associated Press reported that some immigration advocates had warned of a broader removal campaign they called "Freaky Friday." ICE rejected that claim, with Covington calling it "categorically false" and saying the phrase was fabricated to "instill fear and spread misinformation that drives the increased violence occurring against federal law enforcement." The move is part of President Donald Trump's campaign promise of carrying out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. President Donald Trump and deported migrants in Colombia. Last month, DHS said that two million illegal immigrants "have been removed or have self-deported" from the United States since Jan. 20, putting the Trump administration on pace to break records. In less than 250 days, an estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants voluntarily self-deported, while 400,000 were removed by federal law enforcement, the DHS said, describing the situation as a "new milestone." In May, Trump signed an executive order establishing the first-ever self-deportation program that incentivizes illegal migrants to voluntarily leave the country on a free flight and with a cash bonus. Homeland Security said that migrants were being offered a $1,000 stipend each to leave. The department said it is 70% cheaper for American taxpayers, as it currently costs DHS, on average, over $17,000 to arrest, detain and deport someone. In June, the State Department moved $250 million to DHS for voluntary deportations. Shaina Aber, the executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, a nonprofit that provides legal defense to immigrants, said in a statement that the $2,500 stipend undermines due process and may expose children to renewed trafficking cycles. She said some of these children were trafficked into the U.S., often by cartels or smugglers, and if they are sent back without safeguards, they could fall back into the hands of the same traffickers. "DHS's message is confusing and seems to fly in the face of established laws and protocols that Congress passed to protect children from cyclical trafficking risks," Aber said.

Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares says a Democratic prosecutor 'failed to do his job' against a transgender sex offender on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Glenn Youngkin said state Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones should abandon his campaign "in disgrace" after he once remarked on shooting a former Virginia House speaker in texts with another lawmaker. Texts obtained by Fox News Digital on Friday showed an August 2022 conversation involving Jones — then a recently departed delegate from Norfolk — and Delegate Carrie Coyner, R-Chester. At one point, Jones, referencing then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, wrote: "Three people, two bullets. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head." "This violent, disgusting rhetoric targeted at an elected official and his children is beyond disqualifying," Youngkin wrote in an X post Saturday. "Jay Jones said that ‘Gilbert gets two bullets to the head' and then hoped his children would die. "There is no ‘gosh, I'm sorry' here. Jones doesn't have the morality or character to drop out of this race, and his running mates, Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi, and every elected Democrat in Virginia don't have the courage to call on him to step away from this campaign in disgrace," he added. A spokesperson for Coyner's campaign confirmed the veracity of the texts first reported by National Review, saying they were "disturbing and disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office." "Jay Jones wished violence on the children of a colleague and joked about shooting Todd Gilbert. It's disgusting and unbecoming of any public official," the spokesperson said. Jones is running against incumbent Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican. The Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) also called on Jones to "immediately withdraw" from the race following "his abhorrent text messages." "There is no place for political violence, including joking about it — especially from an elected official. Jay Jones should drop out of the Attorney General's race. His comments are not acceptable from someone who wants to represent law enforcement," RAGA Chairman Kris Kobach said. In a statement released to the media, Jones said, "I take full responsibility for my actions, and I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family." "Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. A text message from Jay Jones to Del. "Virginians deserve honest leaders who admit when they are wrong and own up to their mistakes. This was a grave mistake, and I will work every day to prove to the people of Virginia that I will fight for them as Attorney General," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Virginia's Democratic candidate for attorney general Jay Jones is facing widespread criticism for text messages he sent in 2022 suggesting a colleague should be shot. In a private exchange between Jones and Republican Virginia Delegate Carrie Coyner, Jones griped about how the then Republican speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert was paying tribute to a former moderate Democratic lawmaker who died, according to screenshots of text messages obtained by CNN. The National Review first reported the news and reported that Jones tried to call Coyner after she objected to his language. He went on to say in the text messages that Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists” in reference to Gilbert's children, the Review reported. “I take full responsibility for my actions, and I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family. Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. Virginians deserve honest leaders who admit when they are wrong and own up to their mistakes. This was a grave mistake and I will work every day to prove to the people of Virginia that I will fight for them as Attorney General,” the statement reads. He reiterated those apologies in a local television interview with WRIC and told the outlet he would remain in the contest. Coyner condemned Jones' messages in a statement to CNN on Saturday. “What he said was not just disturbing but disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office. Jay Jones wished violence on the children of a colleague and talked about shooting Todd Gilbert. It's disgusting and unbecoming of any public official,” Coyner said. And a host of top state Republicans including Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running for governor, denounced Jones. He's also facing intense criticism over the texts from fellow Democrats. In a late night social media post Democratic US Sen. Mark Warner wrote in part that, “the comments attributed to Jay Jones are appalling, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the person I've known.” And Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger is also distancing herself from Jones in a statement that reads in part, “After learning of these comments earlier today, I spoke frankly with Jay about my disgust with what he had said and texted. I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words,” she said. There is heightened sensitivity towards language that leans into political violence in the wake of the assignation of Republican activist Charlie Kirk and the politically motivated execution of Democratic Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman in their home earlier this year. Polling indicated a tight race before the text messages surfaced. Jones lead  Miyares by six points, 51 percent to 45 percent, among likely voters, according to polling from the Washington Post and Schar School. Early voting for Virginia's statewide races in November is underway.</p>

Mac Jones found himself in a spooky situation Thursday before helping the San Francisco 49ers to an overtime win. But before heading to the stadium, Jones reportedly witnessed a dead body floating in the water outside the team's hotel in Marina del Rey, California. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Mac Jones reacts during the second half of an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams, Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, in Inglewood, California. "That morning at the team hotel in Marina del Rey, Jones told teammates he was on his balcony when he looked out at the water and saw a floating dead body," The Athletic reported. Despite the scary sight, Jones clearly was unfazed. He finished 33-of-49 with 342 passing yards and two touchdown passes as his resurgence continued. He started the game with a touchdown pass to Jake Tonges and followed it up with a touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Mac Jones (10) drops back to pass against the Los Angeles Rams during the first half at SoFi Stadium.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are at an impasse with Republicans and President Donald Trump over enhanced Obamacare subsidies. • Firings loom: Agencies and activities deemed essential are still open, but many employees will be working without a paycheck, and the Trump administration has signaled thousands of government layoffs could begin soon. Americans tell CNN they're starting to feel the impacts on everyday life. The Capital Area Food Bank is keeping its warehouse stocked, as it estimates around 75,000 federal workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. “We anticipate, if this goes on for a little while, we'll see many of those households be in need of extra support from us,” the food bank's CEO, Radha Muthiah, told WJLA. About 80% of federal employees work outside the Washington metropolitan area. It might be as simple as a trip to the museum thwarted, or finding that national parks are either closed or unstaffed. In communities where federal workers make up a significant portion of the economy — like in Atlanta or Dayton, Ohio — small business owners are watching anxiously to see if they'll receive fewer customers while furloughed employees go without a paycheck. Federal funding for WIC, the food assistance program for low-income women, infants and young children, could run out within one to two weeks if Congress doesn't allocate more money. What are your top concerns about the federal government shutdown? House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he and fellow Democrats are committed to extending the shutdown until they and Republicans can reach a deal to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. But Jeffries said high-level talks between both sides “are not” happening “at this moment.” Jeffries condemned what he sees as Trump and Republicans using “hardworking, federal civil servants” as expendable “pawns” because they face potential mass layoffs due to the shutdown. Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware says he hopes lawmakers strike a deal ending the government shutdown soon, but that GOP compromise on health care policy would have to be part of those negotiations. “I don't want to wait until those hospitals close … I want us to have a focused conversation this week that will hopefully put us on a path toward negotiating a resolution,” Coons said. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona slammed House Speaker Mike Johnson this morning, saying on MSNBC's “The Weekend” that Republican leadership doesn't actually want to negotiate. I'm ready to sit down with my Republican colleagues. Kelly said the issue is highly personal for his constituents: Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also spoke to MSNBC this morning, where she blamed the White House for holding up real talks: Behind closed doors or publicly, some Republican senators have signaled they're open to it. But Donald Trump is treating it as a joke.” Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia says protecting access to health care for her constituents is her top concern as the party digs in to a funding standoff with Republicans. “What I have heard consistently across the board is: ‘Don't give up on fighting for our health care,'” Williams said during an interview today on CNN's “First of All with Victor Blackwell.” Williams said residents in her district, which includes a large portion of Atlanta, had already been feeling the impact of President Donald Trump's efforts to massively shrink the federal government since his inauguration. “What I'm hearing across the board is a plea: ‘Please continue to stand up to this administration that is holding the American people hostage with their takeover and lack of compassion for what is happening in this country. A growing number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill say they will forgo their paychecks until federal operations continue. Several Democrats have also said they will withhold their pay during the shutdown, including Sen. Andy Kim and Reps. Josh Gottheimer, Nellie Pou, and Mikie Sherrill. Moody said she would donate her salary to the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay. Lawler requested his salary be withheld in a letter to the House Chief Administrative Office. “If our partners in the Senate are incapable of finding their senses and passing a clean Continuing Resolution… then no member of the House or Senate should receive a salary,” Lawler wrote. “We were not sent here to play partisan politics.” Most rank-and-file members of Congress earn $174,000 annually, while those in top leadership positions are paid more. Republican Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt defended the White House's decision to withhold funding for New York City infrastructure projects amid the government shutdown. They violate, because of DEI programs, the Civil Rights Act,” Schmitt told CNN yesterday on Capitol Hill. “So, I think they're taking a closer look at a lot of these Biden-era contracts, and I would expect more of that. His comments come after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced that the Trump administration is freezing roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects. Vought said the funds will be “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Vought's announcement received pushback from New York officials, with Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand calling the hold “just spiteful and political and probably illegal.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Vought of using New York and New Jersey residents as political pawns. “I'm not political, and it's affecting what we do,” he said. “My family is more Democratic, but right now I kind of blame Democrats, because that's who we're waiting on.” Toyoua Jackson, a 39-year-old factory worker in Dayton, blamed President Donald Trump for the shutdown. “He's taking from the people that don't have.” Tierra Freeman, the 23-year-old manager of the Fashion Remedy Boutique in Dayton, said when military members start not receiving paychecks and other federal workers are furloughed, she worries her newly opened business will feel the effects. Daniella Martinez, 35, is set to start a new job Monday after being laid off when her previous employer, a company that handled moves for military members, lost its government contract. However, she was also frustrated with Democrats, and said the shutdown is “everybody's fault.” Much of the attention during a government shutdown naturally centers on the nation's capital, where lawmakers negotiate stopgap funding bills and employees at major federal agencies face uncertainty at work. It's a new day but the same state of affairs, so far. Lawmakers have left Washington, with no votes planned over the weekend as of now. Here's a look at all that happened yesterday and where things stand moving forward: Over the past few days of live coverage, we've told you how Republican lawmakers remain publicly in lockstep with President Donald Trump, who has signaled he's ready to dig in his heels in the shutdown stalemate with Democrats. But privately, there are concerns within Trump's orbit that the politics of the shutdown may prove more complicated than they initially hoped, according to new reporting from our CNN colleagues Adam Cancryn and Sarah Ferris. Democrats are still largely unified behind their demands, defying some Republicans' predictions they would quickly fold under pressure. “But I don't think it helps either side, to be honest with you.” The mixed reaction has appeared to alleviate political pressure felt by Democrats to quickly seek an off-ramp, with some lawmakers instead beginning to broaden their messaging beyond the party's initial set of health care demands. Previously, officials said the centers would be open through Monday. You can see a full list of what is affected by the government shutdown here.</p>

What was meant to be a special night at the Emmy Awards turned into a hospital visit for actor Eric Dane. The 52-year-old "Grey's Anatomy" star, who revealed earlier this year that he is battling ALS, said in a new interview that he was hospitalized the night of the Emmys after falling in his kitchen. "Grey's Anatomy" star Eric Dane was hospitalized the night of the Emmy Awards after falling in his kitchen. He and fellow "Grey's Anatomy" alum Jesse Williams were scheduled to appear together to mark the show's 20th anniversary, but Williams ended up presenting the award for outstanding directing for a drama series alone. It would have been great to see Jesse and get reunited with some of my peers, and to be able to present in front of my colleagues I thought would have been a special moment," Dane said. "I was really upset about it, but you know, there was nothing I could do about it," he added. Dane announced in April 2025 that he was battling ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons — the nerve cells in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. As the actor continues to battle the disease, his wife, actress Rebecca Gayheart, recently shared how their family is coping. Rebecca Gayheart filed to dismiss her 2018 divorce petition from Eric Dane in March 2025 — one month before he went public with his diagnosis. In an interview with People, Gayheart, 54, spoke about the emotional toll on her and the couple's daughters — Billie, 15 and Georgia, 13. "We have some professional therapists who are helping us, and we're just trying to have some hope and do it with dignity, grace and love," the "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" star shared. My girls are really suffering, and we're just trying to get through it. Dane originally broke the news of his ALS diagnosis in an emotional statement to People. Eric Dane's wife Rebecca Gayheart previously shared an update on how her family is coping with his ALS diagnosis. "I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter," he said. The "Euphoria" actor's announcement came after Gayheart filed to dismiss her 2018 divorce petition in March 2025 — one month before he went public with his diagnosis. The couple, who wedded in 2004 after a year of dating, had previously split over "irreconcilable differences." During her recent interview with People, Gayheart admitted she has struggled to stay positive amid Dane's health challenges. Dane starred as Dr. Mark Sloan — nicknamed "McSteamy" — on "Grey's Anatomy" from 2006 to 2012. Gayheart continued, "I mean, we're definitely dealing with something that has brought us all together, and Eric will always be my family, whether we're married or not, or living in the same house or not, but yeah, we are closer, but we don't like the reason why."

Newly-elected leader of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Sanae Takaichi smiles while delivering a speech after winning the LDP leadership election in Tokyo, Japan, Saturday, Oct. 4, 2025. TOKYO (AP) — Japan's governing party on Saturday elected former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, a hard-line ultra-conservative and China hawk, as its new leader, making her likely to become the country's first female prime minister. In a country that ranks poorly internationally for gender equality, the 64-year-old Takaichi makes history as the first female leader of Japan's long-governing conservative Liberal Democratic Party. An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is a protege of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ‘s ultra-conservative vision and a regular at the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of Japan's wartime militarism, which could complicate Tokyo's relations with its Asian neighbors. Takaichi beat Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, in a runoff in a vote by the LDP on Saturday. Takaichi replaces Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba as the party hopes to regain public support and stay in power after major election losses. ”Now that the LDP has its first female president, its scenery will change a little,” Takaichi said as she tried out the president's chair. The LDP, which has been criticized by opposition leaders for creating a prolonged political vacuum, said Takaichi needs to hurry because the winner will soon face a diplomatic test: a possible summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who could demand that Japan increase its defense spending. A meeting is reportedly being planned for late October. Trump will travel to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea starting Oct. 31. Takaichi said ensuring the Japan-U.S. alliance is her top diplomatic priority. Takaichi stressed the importance of their cooperation through three-way frameworks that also include regional partners such as South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, pledging Japan's greater role in achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific. Takaichi will also need cooperation from key opposition groups to implement her party's policies. Ishiba, who achieved a 15% tariff deal with Washington and put Japan's ties with South Korea and other Asian countries on track during his one-year stint, said “I hope the LDP will band together under new (party) president Takaichi to serve for the country and the people, as well as the world and for the new era.” Ishiba, a centrist known as archrival of Abe, was virtually forced into resigning by ultra-conservative wings in the party. Five candidates — two currently serving and three former ministers — vied for the LDP presidency. Saturday's vote only involved 295 LDP parliamentarians and about 1 million dues-paying members. Takaichi on Saturday said the Yasukuni issue should not be a diplomatic issue and that she will think about how she can “pay respect to the war dead and pray for peace.” She supports bigger fiscal spending for growth, a stronger military and cybersecurity, as well as tougher regulations on increasing foreign tourists and laborers. She was criticized for citing unconfirmed reports to slam foreigners for kicking deer in Nara, her hometown, and saying many foreign law offenders escaped indictments due to a shortage of translators. Experts say candidates avoided discussing their usual political views on historical issues, same-sex marriage and other contentious topics, including the party's political funds scandal, which was the biggest reason for their election losses, and anti-corruption measures. Their avoidance of these subjects raised doubts over the party's ability to regain public trust, analysts said. Voters in downtown Tokyo said they hoped that Takaichi, as first female leader, will bring changes. “I do have expectations,” said Masami Nakagawa, though he expressed concern about her past nationalist comments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BOSTON (AP) — Over a span of a month this summer, four separate federal courts rejected President Donald Trump's executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of people in the country illegally or temporarily. On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that the Republican president cannot enforce the order. Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship. Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily — and by extension, their children — cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment. Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings. Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats — both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority — were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars. In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally. The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states. In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said. The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy. “The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,” Chief Judge David Barron wrote. “It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.” In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to “being vindicated by the Supreme Court.” To enforce the order, government officials would need to confirm parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers. Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crowd, according to several people in attendance, was skeptical. Zohran Mamdani had arrived to greet approximately 60 people, at least half of them Modern Orthodox, who for the most part are more religiously observant than the progressives in Mamdani's base. Mamdani told them he was sorry about what they had experienced and said he believed it wasn't helpful to either the Israeli or Palestinian causes if people supporting either side felt like they couldn't walk outside without fear. And while he reaffirmed his support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting the Israeli government and economy, Mamdani also promised he would keep in place police protection for the city's annual parade honoring Israel. Ever since his stunning victory in June's Democratic primary, Mamdani has built alliances with politically liberal Jewish officials while meeting with and listening to some of his most strident critics. Among some Jewish New Yorkers already on edge from the spike in antisemitism and attacks in recent years, fears highlighted by a deadly attack Thursday on a British synagogue, some of Mamdani's positions and perceived lack of sensitivity to their concerns have bred suspicion and anxiety. Those feelings cut across lines of age, religiosity and geography, even among otherwise committed progressive voters, and persist even as he has emphasized his commitment to fighting antisemitism. “Jewish New Yorkers are by no means a monolith, and Zohran has made clear that he's eager to meet with every part of the Jewish community, whether they disagree with him or helped power him to victory in the primary,” said Jeffrey Lerner, a campaign spokesperson, in a statement to CNN. In recent months, Mamdani has visited synagogues and sat for Friday evening Shabbat services. But he also in recent weeks met with Hasidic leaders, including two prominent rabbis from Williamsburg's Satmar community, an ultra-Orthodox sect with its own set of demands of city government. During Rosh Hashanah, Mamdani attended service at Kolot Chayeinu, one of Brooklyn's most progressive synagogues. He was accompanied by Rep. Jerry Nadler and City Comptroller Brad Lander, both prominent Jewish politicians in New York who have endorsed Mamdani. Mamdani received loud applause, according to three people in attendance, as he was seated in the front row while Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie delivered the sermon. Phylisa Wisdom, executive director of the New York Jewish Agenda, a nonpartisan advocacy organization that has met with Mamdani, said there is no “single Jewish feeling about this candidate.” “It's best for us all if he has a real familiarity with the full diversity of our community,” she added. But for others, Mamdani has fallen short, not doing enough to publicly assure the Jewish community that he is committed to their safety and well-being if elected mayor. They argue Mamdani has only met with audiences who are most likely to be friendly, which his campaign disputes. He responded by telling them he did not care if his future sanitation commissioner – or any other bureaucrat – disagreed with him on Israel. While no sitting New York City mayor has an explicit role in foreign policy, Israel remains a constant theme in the mayoral race. Mamdani, a Muslim who was born in Uganda to parents of Indian origin, has called Israel's offensive a genocide and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces a warrant from the International Criminal Court, should be arrested. Democrats and younger Americans across the political spectrum have grown more negative toward the Jewish state, even as support for Israel remains key for many Jewish voters. Pro-Israel Democrats try breaking with Netanyahu to stop party's shift amid Gaza crisis Mamdani wants to raise taxes on the rich and freeze rent hikes in city-stabilized apartments, a challenge to the real-estate industry, though several prominent developers and investors who oppose him cite his positions on Israel and antisemitism. Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau last month convened a meeting of real-estate leaders to hear from Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the June primary and is now running as an independent. During a different private meeting, a prominent CEO grilled Mamdani over his defense of the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which Mamdani has not himself used and has since said he would discourage others from using. Since Mayor Eric Adams announced he was dropping his re-election bid, Cuomo has ramped up his efforts to court the city's Orthodox Jewish community, which was seen as largely supportive of Adams. In a video posted to social media, Cuomo issued an apology for his response during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic when he was governor. Orthodox communities interpreted those limits as unfairly singling them out. Days earlier, Cuomo had secured the endorsement of a Crown Heights Jewish group representing Orthodox communities. Last year Cuomo said he was joining a legal defense team for Netanyahu. During the primary, Cuomo was critical of Mamdani's support for the BDS movement, pressing him multiple times during a primary debate about whether Israel should exist as a Jewish state. Mamdani has said Israel should provide equal rights to all residents. But Cuomo himself has pivoted since losing the primary,  calling for an end to the war in Gaza while continuing to accuse Mamdani of fueling antisemitism. “I think this whole thing speaks more about the psychology of the American Jewry and their organizations right now than (Mamdani),” said a board member of a prominent national organization that does not endorse in local elections but recently met with Mamdani.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of Palestinians attended funeral services Saturday for seven people who were killed the previous day by an Israeli strike in central Gaza. Relatives of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza called Saturday for the Israeli public to “stand firm” against “saboteurs” who might try to scuttle a possible deal to return them.

This picture taken during a media tour organised by the Israeli army shows a plume of smoke rising above Gaza City during an Israeli strike, Friday, Oct. 3, 2025. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli bombing of Gaza City has “significantly subsided” though at least five Palestinians were killed, a hospital official said Saturday, as Israel's army said the country's leaders had instructed it to prepare for the first phase of the U.S. plan to end the war in Gaza. Still, Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiyah told the AP that Israeli strikes killed five Palestinians across Gaza City, while bombing had “significantly subsided.” The army statement came hours after President Donald Trump ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza once Hamas said it had accepted some elements of his plan. Trump welcomed the Hamas statement but on Saturday warned that “Hamas must move quickly, or else all bets will be off.” He noted that Israel had “temporarily stopped the bombing.” His proposal unveiled earlier this week has widespread international support. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel was committed to ending the war that began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to end the conflict. The official also said a negotiating team was getting ready to travel. Egypt's state-run broadcaster Al-Qahera News, which is close to security agencies, reported that indirect talks between Hamas and Israel will start Sunday. A senior Egyptian official said U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Egypt to head the U.S. negotiating team in the talks to release the Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli detention. The official involved in the ceasefire negotiations also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians aimed at unifying their position toward Gaza's future. Under the plan, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages — around 20 of them believed to be alive — within three days. It also would give up power and disarm. Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli general and chairman of Israel's Defense and Security Forum, said while Israel can afford to stop firing for a few days in Gaza so the hostages can be released, it will resume its offensive if Hamas doesn't lay down its arms. Others said that while Hamas suggests a willingness to negotiate, its position fundamentally remains unchanged. This “yes, but” rhetoric “simply repackages old demands in softer language,” said Oded Ailam, a researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, who asserted that it serves more as a smoke screen than a signal of true movement toward resolution. A group representing some families of hostages said the prospect of seeing loved ones return “has never been closer.” They appealed to Trump to keep pushing “with full force” and warned that “extremists on both sides” will try to sabotage the plan. Meanwhile, protests have erupted across Europe calling for the war's end. We want a truce on the ground,” said Sameer Qudeeh in Khan Younis. He worried that talks will break down again. “I hope Hamas ends the war, because we are truly tired,” said Mohammad Shaat in Khan Younis, as anxious Palestinians roamed the shattered streets. Israeli troops were still laying siege to Gaza City, the focus of its latest offensive. Two Gaza City residents told the AP that since the morning, Israeli tanks and troops had not advanced but artillery shells and airstrikes were still heard. “We can still see the quadcopters everywhere,” Mohamed al-Nashar said. In southern Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said its Saraya field hospital received 10 bodies and over 70 injured after Israeli strikes on Saturday afternoon. The Health Ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Members of the Supreme Court sit for a new group portrait at the Supreme Court building in Washington, Oct. 7, 2022. WASHINGTON (AP) — A monumental Supreme Court term begins Monday with major tests of presidential power on the agenda along with pivotal cases on voting and the rights of LGBTQ people. The court's conservative majority has so far been receptive, at least in preliminary rulings, to many of President Donald Trump's aggressive assertions of authority. Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson invoked the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip after one such decision allowing the cut of $783 million in research funding. “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.” The conservative justices could be more skeptical when they conduct an in-depth examination of some Trump policies, including the president's imposition of tariffs and his desired restrictions on birthright citizenship. If the same conservative-liberal split that has marked so many of Trump's emergency appeals endures, “we are in for one of the most polarizing terms yet,” said Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University's law school. The justices are hearing a pivotal case for Trump's economic agenda in early November as they consider the legality of many of his sweeping tariffs. Two lower courts have found the Republican president does not have the power to unilaterally impose wide-ranging tariffs under an emergency powers law. The lawsuit filed by states and small businesses argues Trump cannot usurp Congress's taxation powers by declaring national emergencies and using tariffs to address them. Four dissenting judges on a federal appeals court in Washington bought that argument, mapping out a possible legal path at the high court. In December, the justices will take up Trump's power to fire independent agency members at will, a case that probably will lead the court to overturn, or drastically narrow, a 90-year-old decision. The three liberal justices have dissented each time. Another case that has arrived at the court but has yet to be considered involves Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The administration has appealed lower-court rulings blocking the order as unconstitutional, or likely so, flouting more than 125 years of general understanding and an 1898 Supreme Court ruling. Instead, Louisiana wants the court to reject any consideration of race in redistricting in a case that could bring major changes to the Voting Rights Act. Chief Justice John Roberts and the other five conservative justices have been skeptical of the consideration of race in public life, including a decision in 2023 that ended affirmative action in college admissions. Louisiana's position would allow it and other Republican-controlled states in the South to draw new political maps that eliminate virtually all majority Black House districts, which have been Democratic strongholds, voting rights experts say. Republicans, including the Trump administration, also are behind a drive to wipe away limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates for Congress and president. The justices are reviewing an appellate ruling that upheld a provision of federal election law that is more than 50 years old. But Roberts, who just marked his 20th anniversary as chief justice, has led a court that has struck down one campaign finance regulation after another. More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. The justices are hearing cases from Idaho and West Virginia, where transgender athletes won lower court rulings. The Supreme Court in June upheld a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, but pointedly did not decide any broader issues about transgender rights. They quickly agreed to take up the state appeals, which raised questions under the Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment and the federal law known as Title IX that dramatically expanded the participation of girls and women in sports in public schools and colleges. The court has yet to set an argument date. Alito turns 76 in April, young by Supreme Court standards. But he might not want to stay around and gamble on the possibility of Democrats flipping the Senate in next year's elections and seeing a Democrat capture the White House two years later. Retiring next summer would allow Trump to name a similarly conservative but much younger replacement who would almost certainly win confirmation from the Republican-led Senate. For close watchers of the court, Alito has done only one thing out of the ordinary: signed a contract to write a book that is expected out next year. Even as his junior colleagues have moved quickly to sign book deals. Clarence Thomas is 77, but he has shown no signs of leaving, certainly not before he is set to become the longest-serving justice in U.S. history in 2028.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is pointing to renewed unrest in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to justify an imminent deployment of federal troops to the two Democrat-led cities, seizing on new rounds of protests and the recent arrest of a conservative influencer. “We're sending in the Department of War … I put a request in today for them to come to Chicago,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson Friday during a visit to Illinois, where another round of protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility led to more than a dozen arrests. Sortor, of Washington, DC, was arrested amid protests outside an ICE facility in Portland during what police characterized as a fight. He was released hours later without bond but went on to decry his detention as a wrongful arrest. The agency said they “will continue to monitor protest activity.” “As a reminder, just because arrests are not made at the scene, when tensions are high, that does not mean that people are not being charged with crimes later,” the police department said. The rising tensions between the federal government and Portland officials also played out in court Friday as a federal judge weighed whether to grant a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deploying the roughly 200 Oregon National Guard soldiers that have been mobilized. US District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump nominee, presided over Friday's hearing in Oregon and is expected to issue a decision Saturday. As of Friday, National Guard units were still completing training and must finish preparations before arriving in Portland, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN. They were not able to say when training would be complete. As for Chicago, a Northern Command spokesperson said Friday there were no written orders for the National Guard to be deployed to the city, and there was no unit preparing for that mission. Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued the administration this week after President Donald Trump announced he would send the National Guard to protect “war-ravaged” Portland. The president and his administration have cited weekslong demonstrations outside the Portland ICE facility, framing them as “violent riots” tied to “Antifa domestic terrorists.” Local officials dispute that characterization, claiming in the lawsuit that protests were small until Trump's National Guard announcement brought renewed attention to them. US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton cited a variety of incidents he said make the National Guard deployment necessary. Hamilton accused demonstrators of blocking the entrance to the ICE facility, following ICE agents home and throwing incendiary devices, rocks and bricks at law enforcement. But Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said what ultimately is happening in Portland is a “perception versus reality problem.” “The president's perception is it's World War II out here. The reality is, it's a beautiful city and a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation,” Turco said. Federal law also orders this type of action to be made through state governors. Trump's crackdown in Portland follows similar efforts in Washington, DC, Los Angeles and Memphis – an effort met with impassioned pushback from Democratic leaders nationwide who argue the moves are politically motivated and lack justification. Last month, a federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration broke the law when it deployed thousands of federalized National Guard soldiers and hundreds of Marines to suppress protests against ICE actions in Los Angeles. At least five people were arrested for aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting and obstruction during demonstrations in Broadview, the Cook County Sheriff's Office told CNN. The protests near Chicago began weeks ago, after local leaders got word that “a large-scale enforcement campaign” would soon be underway in the Windy City as part of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration agenda. Fuentes received a call about ICE officers at the emergency room and learned a detainee had injured his leg in an incident involving ICE officers, she said at a news conference. Fuentes said she asked the officers if they have a warrant “to be in the emergency room and have him detained.” A detained immigrant “was arrested and later complained of a leg injury after attempting to flee law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a statement to CNN. “Our brave officers are facing a surge in increase in assaults against them, inducing sniper attacks, cars being used as weapons on them, and assaults by rioters. We will not be deterred by rioters and protesters in keeping America safe.” “Any attempt to block this work is a direct attack on democratic accountability and an assault on the rights of the people of Chicago,” he said in a statement posted on X. Pritzker warned that a “constitutional crisis is not on its way – it is here, and we all better start acting like it.” Earlier the Democratic governor condemned a sweeping overnight raid carried out by federal authorities at a Chicago apartment building earlier this week. Adults and children alike were pulled from their apartments, crying and screaming, during the raid, which one neighbor characterized as a military-style “invasion.” “Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. They fail to focus on violent criminals and instead create panic in our communities,” Pritzker said in a statement about the operation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Kathmandu to Lima, youth-led uprisings are driving thousands from their screens to the streets, demanding accountability, change and, in some cases, toppling governments. These Gen-Z protesters come from disparate backgrounds and have different demands. But the throughline is clear: Growing inequality and marginalization is destroying young people's hopes for the future – and the only way forward is to confront a broken social contract head on. Led by mostly students and unemployed graduates, the protesters are demanding sweeping reforms in healthcare, education and social justice – issues they say have been sidelined as the government pours billions into 2030 World Cup infrastructure. Morocco's education system, long underfunded, is churning out graduates with few job prospects: Youth unemployment sits at 36% – and nearly 1 in 5 university graduates are out of work. The government's response has been swift and brutal: Three people were killed and hundreds of others injured, authorities said. Riot police have been deployed across major cities, using force and arresting dozens. Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch said Thursday his government had “engaged” with the protesters' demands and was ready for “dialogue and discussion.” On Friday, GenZ 212 demanded the government resign. Thousands of miles away to the south, youth-led unrest is rocking Madagascar. For several days this week, cities across the Indian Ocean nation – one of Africa's poorest – have been flooded with young protesters outraged over water shortages and rolling blackouts. They quickly morphed into calls for systemic reform, with the protesters demanding the resignation of President Andry Rajoelina, who first came to power in a 2009 coup, and his government. The United Nations said Monday at least 22 people had been killed and more than 100 injured. Meanwhile, in the South American nation of Peru, youth demonstrations began on September 20 after the government announced reforms to a pension law. The protests then swelled to wider calls to stamp out corruption, repression and rising crime under President Dina Boluarte's rule. The Peruvian leader's approval ratings recently sank to 2.5%, with her government at 3%, according to the Institute of Peruvian Studies' July report, reflecting widespread economic anxiety, anger over corruption scandals and continued outrage over the killing of dozens of protesters after she took office in late 2022. In fewer than 48 hours, at least 22 people were killed and hundreds injured as demonstrators torched government buildings in the capital Kathmandu and toppled the prime minister. It mirrors other recent Gen Z-driven movements across South Asia: In 2024, Bangladeshis ousted Sheikh Hasina, who ruled the country for more than 15 years in power; in 2022, young Sri Lankans ended the Rajapaksa family dynasty that dominated the country's politics for two decades. Subir Sinha, director of SOAS South Asian Institute, noted the link between various Gen Z-led protests across the Global South. The priorities of ruling elites, “seems very far away from the everyday lives of and fears and anxieties that Gen Z is facing,” he told CNN, underlining a bleak economic outlook for many. As they've come of age, they've faced deepening political division, a growing climate crisis, economic uncertainty and a pandemic that has exposed deep inequalities. Bart Cammaerts, a professor of politics and communication at London School of Economics, told CNN this generation feels “short changed,” with “their interests not represented or taken into account.” As a result, Cammaerts said Gen Z is skeptical towards liberal representative democracy, although they still value democratic principles and democratic decision making. The rise of authoritarianism, xenophobia and nationalism is also fueling young people's desire to act, as opportunities that were once available to their parents' generations have nearly disappeared. “The exit option of at least temporary migration has been closed as a part of the authoritarian age we are living in,” Sinha said. It is also no surprise that the countries where this unrest is unfolding are experiencing the brunt of major extreme weather events, he said, where older generations are in power and often taking inadequate steps to stop global warming from getting worse. As traditional forms of challenging political discontent become more challenging, Gen Z are looking to their peers in other countries for a roadmap. “When they see that somewhere else has had a similar kind of situation, and people have had some degree of success … they might feel, let's try this out over here,” Singh said, pointing to Nepal's recent demonstrations. “It's as if they're holding each other's hands across national borders.” They've just got different tools to organize and mobilize. They have transformed activism over digital platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Discord – a messaging app first popularized by gamers – and Telegram. These tools enable decentralized, real-time coordination, rapid information sharing, and viral symbols that unify diverse groups from across the globe. “You don't need necessarily a big organization or mobilizing force,” Cammaerts said of the protesters' tactics. For example, in Morocco, the anonymous Discord server “GenZ 212” grew from 3,000 members to more than 130,000 in just a few days, Reuters reported, exemplifying how quickly an online presence can materialize into the streets. In Madagascar, an online youth-led movement known as Gen Z Mada first coordinated over Facebook and TikTok before organizing with more traditional civil society groups and trade unions. When Gen Z's digital protests manage to cut through class and generational lines they gain further momentum, power and the ability to drive greater change, Sinha said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a locator map for Iran with its capital, Tehran. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran executed six death-row inmates Saturday it alleged carried out attacks in the country's oil-rich southwest on behalf of Israel, the latest prisoners to be put to death in a wave of executions believed to be the highest in decades. The executions follow the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June, which ended with Tehran vowing it would target its enemies at home and abroad. However, activists warn Iran often relies on coerced confessions and closed-door trials in its death penalty cases, particularly those involving Israel. Iran said the men killed police officers and security forces, as well as orchestrated bombings targeting sites around Khorramshahr in Iran's restive Khuzestan province. A Kurdish group called the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights reported the men's execution, identifying them all as “Arab political prisoners” detained during protests in 2019. It said Iran had accused the men of having links to the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz, which has launched attacks against oil pipelines in Iran's southwest in the past and other attacks. “The six men were subjected to severe torture and coerced into giving televised ‘confessions' under duress,” Hengaw said. Iran separately put to death another inmate Saturday it accused of killing a Sunni cleric in 2009 in Iran's Kurdistan province, among other crimes. In response to those protests and the June war, Iran has been putting prisoners to death at a pace unseen since 1988, when it executed thousands at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the figure could be higher as Iran does not report on each execution. Independent human rights experts at the United Nations have also criticized Iran's executions. Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jones reportedly told a Republican colleague in 2022 that, in a hypothetical scenario, if he were in a room with then-Republican Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert, Adolf Hitler, and Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, and he had two bullets, he would shoot Gilbert twice. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” Jones texted Republican House Delegate Carrie Coyner. He had been expressing anger about the statements Republicans made eulogizing recently deceased former state legislator Joe Johnson Jr. Jones' opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, has not commented on the texts. “There is no place for political violence, including joking about it – especially from an elected official. His comments are not acceptable from someone who wants to represent law enforcement,” RAGA Chairman Kris Kobach told the Washington Examiner in a statement. The Republican State Legislative Campaign Committee, the top GOP campaign organization for state legislatures, did not call for Jones to drop out but said Virginia voters deserved “a full explanation.” “He owes Virginians a full explanation and an apology for his actions,” she added. “We urge leaders from both parties to denounce this behavior and reaffirm that threats — whether real or imagined —have no place in public service or our democracy. As political violence becomes more common, we need to rely on our public officials to lower the temperature and unite us, rather than divide us with such reprehensible comments.” Virginia Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle called Jones's comments, which also reportedly included wishing violence on Gilbert's children, “abhorrent.” The Virginia GOP asked whether Virginians should support a candidate who “fantasizes” about shooting a political opponent, or whether they should reject the violent rhetoric. “I believe that violent rhetoric has no place in our politics,” he said. “Let's be clear about what is happening in the Attorney General race right now: Jason Miyares is dropping smears through Trump-controlled media organizations to assault my character and rescue his desperate campaign. Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas and state Sen. Mamie Locke, chair of Virginia Senate Democrats, said in a statement that Jones should “take accountability,” and that the party should “remain united” in their support for him. Virginia's Attorney General race was considered one of the most competitive statewide races for 2025. A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll showed Jones ahead of Miyares 51% to 45% among likely voters. President Donald Trump will visit Jones's former district on Sunday to celebrate the Navy's birthday.</p>

A man inside said, “No, you cannot.” Noem and her crew then walk away before she noted that the resistance is “what Governor Pritzker calls cooperation.” Noem lamented the incident in an X post, noting “Broadview receives at least $1 million in federal funding every year.” “My team and I were just blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building in Illinois. We were stopping for a quick bathroom break. The Village of Broadview receives at least $1 million in federal funding every year. This is how JB Pritzker and his cronies treat our law enforcement. Noem said they were in the area to conduct “some operations” and arrest people with criminal convictions. Village spokesperson David Ormsby told NBC Chicago Noem appeared “unannounced” at the Village Hall, asking for a meeting while Mayor Katrina Thompson was out of the building.” The Trump administration is beginning its “Midway Blitz” immigration operations in Chicago and uses the Broadview ICE facility to assist in their campaign. “In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility,” the spokesperson said.</p>
