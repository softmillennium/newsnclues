                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Social event planning app Partiful, which calls itself “Facebook events for hot people,” has firmly replaced Facebook as the go-to platform for sending party invitations. But what Partiful also has in common with Facebook is that it's collecting a tsunami of user data, and Partiful could have done better at keeping that data secure. As Partiful grew more popular, some users became skeptical of the company's origins. One New York City promoter announced that it was boycotting Partiful because its founders and some staff are former employees of Palantir, Peter Thiel's data mining company, which produces the software that powers ICE's master database for the Trump administration's deportation crackdown. TechCrunch found it was possible for anyone, using only the developer tools in a web browser, to access raw user profile photos stored in Partiful's backend database hosted on Google Firebase. Almost all digital files, like the pictures you take on a smartphone, contain metadata, which includes information like the file size, when it was created, and by whom. Some Partiful user profile photos contained highly granular location data that could be used to identify the person's home or work, particularly in rural areas where individual homes are easier to distinguish on a map. It's common practice for companies that host user images and videos to automatically remove metadata upon upload to prevent privacy lapses like this. After discovering the security flaw, TechCrunch alerted Partiful co-founders Shreya Murthy and Joy Tao by email, as Partiful does not have a public means for reporting security flaws. Tao told TechCrunch on Friday that the vulnerability was “already on our team's radar, and was recently prioritized as an upcoming fix.” TechCrunch confirmed Saturday that metadata was removed from existing user-uploaded photos. When asked by TechCrunch if Partiful has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if there was any direct or bulk access to user profile photos stored in its database, Partiful spokesperson Jess Eames said this was “still under investigation but we have found no evidence of this yet.” Partiful has raised over $27 million from investors since its founding in 2022, including a $20 million Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz.

No weapon has ever been made that was not used to harm humanity. "My bombs only kill the bad guys" is either hopelessly ignorant, or willfully malicious. I don't want to get into an argument about the dangers involved, I agree with Taleb about the fat tails of violence, and how standard statistics breaks down when there is infinite variance. You need only look at the CCTV usage in the UK to see how you can have a reasonable society with strong surveillance. I live in what I believe to be one of the 5 most progressive municipalities in the United States† and I can tell you from recent experience that our community is sharply divided on it.† (we're a small inner-ring suburb of Chicago; I'm "cheating" in that Chicago as a whole is not one of the most progressive cities in the country, but our 50k person muni is up there with Berkeley and represented by the oldest DSA member in Congress) † (we're a small inner-ring suburb of Chicago; I'm "cheating" in that Chicago as a whole is not one of the most progressive cities in the country, but our 50k person muni is up there with Berkeley and represented by the oldest DSA member in Congress) It's an invasive surveillance technology that contributes to building the pervasive surveillance day to day reality.You're muddying the waters asking "why are you against this" without even hinting at an argument why anyone should not be against this.You can already see the progression.

Some things aren't mutually exclusive and a lot of people are capable of holding conflicting ideas in their head.> I'm commenting in good faith from actual experience.All good but you didn't say anything. You muddy the water by saying repeatedly how progressive and experienced you are without providing the obvious reasoning that multiple commenters here are missing: why not be against it?

This industry in general (and Flock in particular as per the article) have already been shown to continuously escalate things and change the deal to their benefit again and again? Federal police ignoring court orders with microphones on street corners is. Again I want to be clear that there's a difference between "bad idea" or "bad public policy tradeoff" and "red line". I believe it's pretty clear that when something is a live controversy with no clear winner in a municipality like Oak Park, whatever else it is, it isn't a "red line". I don't doubt that license plate readers are used primarily to solve crimes. But the fact that it is collected and can be made available to anyone essentially strips you of privacy in everyday life. Cops are people too; once the tech is available, it is sometimes abused to spy on spouses, neighbors, journalists critical of the local PD, and so on.There is also a more general argument: an ever-growing range of human activities is surveilled to root out crime, and we can probably agree that the end state of that would be dystopian: it'd be a place where your every word or even every thought is proactively monitored and flagged for wrongthink.

Still, I'm torn whenever I walk to the city center (Bavarian big city that is not Munich) and see how many rental bikes and rental e-scooters can be found thrown into the river that runs through the city. Or public trash cans that were actually put deep into the earth, with concrete too, lie broken with lots of earth and the long metal pipe with concrete attached because some people spent considerable effort to destroy public infrastructure. Or somebody must have jumped hard and repeatably on a weak point of a public bench, which has very thick wood and thick steel screws, but they still managed to destroy it.I want those people to be found, I'm very angry. If that means more surveillance, I would not oppose. They can't do anything for the bikes and scooters though, making them too heavy to lift and throw into the water is obviously not possible. Police do patrol, but they can't be everywhere all the time.For illustration: Two bikes of a public bike rental service found in the river. They are not old, all of them are new, but this is how they look after a few days or weeks in the river:https://img.mittelbayerische.de/ezplatform/images/4/4/8/8/40...Divers are called regularly to retrieve bikes, scooters, and other big items thrown into the city's river: https://images.nordbayern.de/image/contentid/policy:1.132184...

I doubt any more effort will be made against vandalism for a long time that reaquires to increase surveillance. The cameras and microphones will remain, though.Edit: I live in a dictatorship. State surveillance and policing has helped with vandalism. I would take more vandalism in a mediocre democracy any day. State surveillance and policing has helped with vandalism. I would take more vandalism in a mediocre democracy any day. If I want the second (less vandalism) I'll have to give up at least some of the first (freedom from surveillance while in public places). I served on a jury where a young woman slipped on ice while crossing the street and was run over by a negligent driver who was fleeing what he thought was the police, because he was on probation and not supposed to drive. Prior to that, much more primitive version of that technology being available, there would no chance of that case being solved.Personally, I think this technology is dangerous, lacks effective governance, is operated without transparency, and is prone to abuse. Events of late highlight how different jurisdictional boundaries at the city, state and federal levels can be in conflict. But the technology is not going away -- imo it's time to govern it and limit the inter-jurisdictional data sharing.

"Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on," Ellison said, describing what he sees as the benefits from automated oversight from AI and automated alerts for when crime takes place.Ellison, Vance, Musk, Thiel, Luckey, Zuckerberg and many of the tech oligarch assholes want us to live in their surveillance state.They're currently making good progress.

These people live in fantasyland bubbles, powered by their unshakeable belief in their own intelligence and "hyper rational" nonsense.People already film themselves committing crimes.

Why has the rate of stochastic terrorism only increased since the NSA and Palantir started spying on all of us? As it turns out: LEADS is stale as fuck: cars are listed stolen in LEADS long after they're returned. And, of course, the demography of owners of stolen cars is sharply biased towards Black and Latino owners (statistically, they live in poorer, higher-crime areas), which meant that Flock was consistently requesting the our PD pull over innocent Black drivers.We recently kicked Flock out (again: I'm not thrilled about this; long story) over the objections of our PD (who wanted to keep the cameras as essentially a better form of closed-circuit investigatory cameras; they'd essentially stopped responding to Flock alerts over a year ago). What they did manage to do was enforce a bunch of failure-to-appear warrants for neighboring munis; mostly, what Flock did to our PD was turn them into debt collectors.Whatever else you think about the importance of people showing up to court for their speeding tickets, this wasn't a good use our sworn officers' time.

Had we kept the cameras, we'd have some political capital to get our neighboring munis (and like-minded munis in Chicagoland like Schaumberg) to take our ordinances and general orders as models. We're not any safer: our actions don't meaningfully change our residents exposure to ALPRs (and our residents weren't the targets anyways; people transiting through Oak Park were) because of their prevalence outside our borders.What people don't get about this is that a lot of normal, reasonable people see these cameras as a very good thing. What people don't get about this is that a lot of normal, reasonable people see these cameras as a very good thing. For example, saying "there is a planned school shooting at a school in $metro_city",  even though there is absolutely nobody doing that - that causes terror. Doesn't have to be backed by any actions at all.Like, with the shooting of UHC CEO, there was no grandiose statements or otherwise causing terror ahead of time.

That's how we used to fight against the man. Now we scream, "rape" randomly in public.What a time to be alive. I will start screaming at the Flock cameras 2 weeks from now: Google and Apple remove AntiFlock apps; developers arrested(Only slightly sarcastic. Flock's CEO openly says the he intends that "Flock will help eliminate ALL crime", and has shown he has no concerns about how dystopian or Minority Report-esque Flock would need to be to accomplish that mission. My thoughts on that are probably not very popular on here and those are to just build larger jails and equip those with drug rehabilitation options. Another source of criminal behavior is mental illness. I have no clues on how to fix that except perhaps concentrate on the causes.All these cameras and recording devices exist for that same reason Advil exists in that it helps a toothache. All these cameras and recording devices exist for that same reason Advil exists in that it helps a toothache. I can certainly understand concerns about privacy but the other sides of this discussion should not be ignored.https://www.npr.org/2023/04/29/1172775448/people-murder-unso... Knowing this, wouldn't you prefer that we spend the money on crime prevention programs that "bribes" the underclass, instead of in a system that won't prevent crime at all but will rob all of us of privacy? That should go hand-in-hand with free birth control, free day-after pills, free abortions, comprehensive sexual education, etc.A large share of the bottom 1/3 in the US will never step foot outside of poverty, most of them will never hold a job on a sustained basis. Pay them to not have children, which simultaneously benefits their lives in the here and now, while preventing the mistake of bringing children into poverty. It would very rapidly improve poverty (and reduce crime) in the US.

Another officer, Detective Constable Niall Thubron of the Durham Constabulary, has been banned from returning to the police force after he resigned in May 2025. Before his resignation, Thubron reportedly pressed the H key over 30 times and the I key over 16,000 times across different occasions between December 2024 and January 2025. Remote work has enabled increased productivity, particularly for roles that do not require physical presence. It has also reduced wasted time caused by long commutes and heavy traffic. However, it's also more prone to abuse, mainly as staff members working outside the office aren't observed by their colleagues and supervisors. For example, Wells Fargo fired more than a dozen employees in 2024 after they were discovered using mouse jiggers and keyboard simulators to evade monitoring software. Companies understandably want to avoid this by using tools like screen recorders and keyloggers. However, workers are also pushing back, as it would seem that their corporation does not trust them. But news like this definitely makes it harder for management to implement work from home. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just when you thought it was safe to let your guard down, another food recall makes headlines. At least 20 people have been sickened by a listeria outbreak in prepared pasta products across the U.S., with four people dying, according to the CDC. Warnings have been issued for pasta from Walmart, Trader Joe's, and a host of other retailers across the country. Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Pasta Bowls (9.6-oz) have been recalled over listeria concerns. They include dates in 2027, so be sure to check your freezer. No illnesses have been reported from consuming Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi, but the product is being recalled because it contains pasta supplied by Nate's Fine Food. The recall for some pasta from Nate's Fine Food was first issued in June 2025 but has expanded ever since. And it's not clear if more brands will be added to the list. This new recall adds to the previously recalled pasta, which is listed below by retailer. Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo Albertson's pasta salads supplied by Nate's Fine Foods have also been recalled. Consumers with questions who may need to reach the company behind the recall can contact Nate's Fine Foods at 916-677-7303 between noon and 7 p.m. ET (9 a.m.-4 p.m. local time on the West Coast), Monday through Friday.

That's a fundamental feature of threads though; nothing to do with Rust. It might be quite small, as I found for Maps (if we're putting 5 things in the map then we can just do the very dumbest thing which I call `VecMap` and that's fine, but if it's 25 things the VecMap is a little worse than any actual hash table, and if it's 100 things the VecMap is laughably terrible) but it might be quite large, even say 10x number of cores might be just fine without stealing. But if you're going to sit down for a real world project, ie distributed system or OS component, interfacing with modern data formats, protocols, IDEs, people, etc is going to influence your choice on day one. Ada may have a storied success history in aerospace and life safety, etc, and it might have an okay standard lib which is fine for AOC problems and maybe embedded bit poking cases in which case it makes sense to compare to Rust.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon 4.9 out of 5-star rated products are a rare breed, but Star Wars LEGO sets always come close to that perfect score. The R2-D2 droid construction earned it, and the Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary set is part of that special club with well over 1,700 glowing reviews attesting to its excellence. Instead, the company quietly moves massive inventory through Amazon, where this iconic 921-piece Star Wars set has dropped from $84 to just $67. For collectors and fans who've been eyeing this mid-scale Millennium Falcon, this is the best opportunity to grab it without paying full retail. LEGO designed this 921-piece build specifically for adults who are looking for a difficult building experience that creates display-worthy decor. The construction itself is several hours of keen focus which is just the kind of screen-free downtime that appears to be so appealing for someone that's exhausted on constant digital input. With every step of the build is another degree of engineering brilliance as you recreate the Falcon's iconic details in LEGO. The brick-built replica translates the Falcon's greebled and lopsided look in terms of LEGO geometry but is still identifiable. It bridges the gap between LEGO's massive $800-plus Ultimate Collector Series pieces that are more than two feet in length and the diminutive playsets for children. Mid-scale represents the sweet spot for collectors seeking considerable shelf presence without dominating the entirety of one bookcase model. The stand that is provided holds the ship in a dynamic banking angle rather than on its flat. That partnership launched one of the most popular toy franchises in history and generates billions of dollars in sales and creating a collecting culture for limited-series sets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I recently went down a bright, RGB-laden hole with a mission: to satisfy my curiosity about smart lights that try to rip the colors off your TV and splash them onto the wall behind it. I've been skeptical of such TV lights muddying filmmakers' intent the same way modern TVs with motion smoothing and other AI image processing can. After toying with the Philips Hue Play Wall Washer, I wouldn't say I'm sold on the idea yet, but the good news is that's not all this little can full of LED modules can do. But it's equally adept as wall-coating accent lighting or a wake-up light in your bedroom, using the same interface that works for other colorful Hue smart lighting. The Wall Washer itself is a small, upright lamp inside an aluminum enclosure that feels very sturdy. It projects light outward and upward from three rows of LED lights, each working to produce smooth gradients and colors that are rich without being garishly oversaturated, which I've always appreciated about the whole Hue smart light line. At $219.99, it's not the most expensive RGB light in the usually-spendy Philips Hue lineup, but you would still need to either have or create an ideal space for it in your home to make it worthwhile. Signify calls the Play Wall Washer an “immersive surround lighting” experience for your home entertainment center. The smart light's product page shows two Play Wall Washers standing astride a giant TV, splaying green and blue gradients over a broad, near-featureless white wall. It takes a hefty investment—$384.99 for a two-pack of the smart lights; another $384.99 for the Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K; and $65.99 for a Hue Bridge—to achieve what Philips' image shows, but it ain't much easier on your wallet with just one Play Wall Washer. You don't actually need a Hue Bridge if you're not doing the TV-syncing thing—you can still use it as a fancy gradient-beaming light via the Hue app over Bluetooth—but you'll also lose Matter support, limiting your smart home ecosystem options to just Google Home and Amazon Alexa. I tested a single unit paired with the Sync Box 8K, which has four HDMI 2.1 inputs and one HDMI 2.1 output that can pass up to 4K content at 120Hz (or 8K at 60Hz) through to your TV using an included Ultra High-Speed HDMI cable. The disadvantage is that it being a single light source meansit'll cast harsh shadows if there's anything mounted on the wall above it. Once I cleared out some shadow-casting objects, the Sync Box and Play Wall Washer struck me as being good if what you're after is more of a vibe than seeing colors bleed out from the edge of your TV, or perhaps bias lighting, which can make watching a screen easier on your eyes. Incredible races to save a commuter bullet train from certain doom. But the light wasn't as precisely positioned around my TV as that you'd get from an LED strip slapped on the back of your TV. It seemed a bit more precise when I slipped it into gaming mode and played Donkey Kong Bananza on my Nintendo Switch 2, but the effect was still muted. Even so, this left me a lot more convinced by the whole TV backlight concept, at least for gaming—I'd even say I enjoyed the spectacle. Movies are presented as a piece of art meant to wash over you, but video games are inherently participatory—how you experience their stories is up to you, and for me at least, a synchronized light show feels more additive than distracting. So, price and precision are the Play Wall Washer's big weak points. I A/B tested it against the $149.99 Govee TV Backlight 3 Lite Kit (see the GIFs above), which uses an LED strip and two light bars, and the even cheaper $94.49 HDMI Sync Box from Wiz, another Signify brand—both produced much more localized lighting and aren't just cheaper than the Play Wall Washer on their own, and neither requires you to buy anything else to sync with your TV. Their colors are a lot more in-your-face than the Play Wall Washers, which is a good thing for some people, and if you don't like it, there are ways to tone things down in their respective apps. And sticking an LED strip to the back of your TV is a pain in both cases. But maybe you're only interested in the Play Wall Washer as a decorative item. Good for you; you'll save a little money, and the Play Wall Washer's ability to bathe a broad surface in colorful light is excellent. You can go with static lights or gradients—the Hue app has a ton of nice pre-made ones, but you can also roll your own with a color picker in the app—or you can choose from several effects like those that other colorful Hue bulbs and lightstrips use. It's meant to be stood on a hard surface—either your floor or a table—and with the light pointing upward, everything ends up being underlit, casting harsh shadows if the light encounters any texture or decorations, making it hard for me to find a wall it would work on. Its power cord is a generous 6.2-feet long, but it's embedded, rather than using something like USB-C, so you need a bulky extension cord if it doesn't reach. Also, there are no mounting screw holes, so you'd have to get creative if you want to put it anywhere other than the floor or a piece of furniture. The only hope for it in my house was my bedroom, which is a converted attic with walls that are only briefly vertical before angling to follow the roofline. Ultimately, if you don't have tons of space and an Apple-like minimalist sensibility, it's hard to see this smart light being practical for decoration outside of something like an art gallery. That approach—using a hub instead of giving the light Matter compatibility on its own—means I didn't have to do anything after setup to get it working in Apple Home, Google Home, my Flic Hub, and Amazon Alexa; it was just already there. Without a Hue Bridge, it'll only work with the last two in that list. That could be fine in the short term, but if some slick new platform emerges down the road, there's far less chance this light will be supported without Matter. It's also where you'll find Hue's various automations, like presence-mimicking that can randomly turn your lights on and off at night when you're away, or geofencing that toggles them off or on when you leave or come home. The Play Wall Washer is actually really nice with the Hue wake-up automation, which turns it slowly over a long stretch, because it can be both extremely dim and very bright. The $219.99 Hue Play Wall Washer is a really cool little smart lamp that's small enough that it won't call attention to itself beyond the lush colors it produces. It's not cheap, but for home decor purposes, the price may be right, so long as you have a big ol' wall to shine its light onto and the space to keep it from being underfoot. As a TV-syncing light, it might be too subdued and imprecise for many people, and it's limited to TVs that are placed a little away from the wall if you want even lighting from a single Play Wall Washer. But even if you do like its vibe and super easy setup, the costs ramp way up to unlock that functionality, requiring you to buy hardware that costs much more than the light itself or have one of very few specific TV sets that can do it for you, assuming you already have a Hue Bridge. Given that the market is absolutely lousy with TV backlight options, it may be best to save your money and skip the Hue Play Wall Washer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla's insurance arm, along with its partner State National Insurance Company, engaged in “willful unfair claims settlement practices” including “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps” of the process and “unreasonable denials,” CDI wrote. This has allegedly caused “financial harm” and “distress to policyholders.” CDI first approached Tesla about these issues in 2022, according to the filings, yet it claims things have only gotten worse. The enforcement action could have knock-on legal effects for Tesla. In July, the company was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit over allegations that the company purposely delayed and minimized claim payouts. CDI wrote Friday that Tesla's actions may have created “potential third-party liability exposure.” Tesla and State National did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The idea was to offer cheaper premiums and faster service. Still, Musk promised it would be a “revolutionary” product. Just three years later, according to CDI's filings, the regulator noticed a “marked uptick in claims-related consumer complaints” against Tesla. So in December 2022, CDI started meeting with Tesla and State National. The regulator said it learned Tesla's “Head of Claims” position had been vacant for months. As a result, CDI subjected Tesla and State National to a sort of probationary period: the regulator monitored the companies' efforts to reduce these violations for six months. It took Tesla until April 2023 to hire a new Head of Claims. In 775 of those cases, CDI found Tesla had violated the state's insurance code. Through September 22 of this year, the regulator has received 1,481 complaints against Tesla, and identified 1,969 insurance code violations. In total, since 2022, CDI said Tesla has accumulated nearly 3,000 violations of state insurance law.

Discord has just notified its users of a data breach that occurred a couple of weeks ago, on September 20, where hackers gained access to user information through third-party channels. Discord was not directly hacked; instead, the bad actors compromised one of its customer service providers, from which they gained access to mainly users' contact information, including email addresses and real names. This data was intended to be used as leverage to demand a financial ransom from Discord, but thankfully, the situation has now been aptly addressed. One of these providers was hacked, but Discord states that it has since severed the affected provider's access to its ticketing system and has involved law enforcement in investigating the matter. A select few users who provided their government-issued IDs, such as passports or driver's licenses, were also affected in the attack. Full passwords, residential addresses, or any other sensitive info seem to be safe, however. Messages shared between support and users were also compromised, but any other server chats or DMs remain untouched. Discord has begun sending e-mails notifications about a cybersecurity incident which occurred September 20th, 2025.It appears people who submitted support tickets are the ones primarily impacted.Literally peoples entire identity stolen from this shit pic.twitter.com/5WlhAYbihGOctober 3, 2025 Overall, it's an isolated incident that didn't spiral into something catastrophic. Discord highlighted its commitment to security in a blog post, mentioning that investigations into the matter have already begun and that they've reviewed their current threat detection systems and safety protocols to ensure this doesn't happen again.

A group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine, have developed a way to use the sensors in high-quality optical mice to capture subtle vibrations and convert them into audible data. According to the abstract of Mic-E-Mouse (full PDF here), the high polling rate and sensitivity of high-performance optical mice pick up acoustic vibrations from the surface where they sit. Mouse sensors with a 20,000 DPI or higher are vulnerable to this attack. Note that this compromise does not necessarily mean a complicated virus installed through a backdoor — it can be as simple as an infected FOSS that requires high-frequency mouse data, like creative apps or video games. "With only a vulnerable mouse, and a victim's computer running compromised or even benign software (in the case of a web-based attack surface), we show that it is possible to collect mouse packet data and extract audio waveforms," the researchers state. The processing works like this: the raw audio data is run through digital signal processing using a Wiener Filter, where you can start to hear some information. This is then further cleared up through a neural model, giving the researchers clear audio. Although this is a novel method for extracting audio from unsuspecting targets, it's not exactly the first time that someone has attempted to covertly record targets. However, this method is empowered by AI models, allowing the researchers to get a speech recognition accuracy of about 42 to 61%, effectively turning your mouse into an eavesdropping microphone, though. The proof of concept is certainly unnerving, but it will hopefully prompt future steps taken to prevent this sort of acoustic privacy violation, the kind that would have been unthinkable in a world before AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Adobe has had a busy year designing and redesigning a number of its most popular apps for mobile, and Premiere for iPhone is the latest—a mobile-first video editing workflow that adapts most of the tools from the desktop version of Premiere to a mobile user interface. You can trim, layer, edit, and even auto-generate captions, alongside all the basic editing features you'd expect, like color and exposure adjustments. The automatic resizing feature is particularly nice, adapting videos to both horizontal and landscape platforms, making sure your subject is centered for both cuts. As with anything Adobe releases these days, there are plenty of AI-powered features, including the ability to generate backgrounds from a prompt and create sound effects from your voice. Premiere for iPhone is free, though if you want to use the AI features, you'll have to buy credits within the app. According to Adobe, the Android version is still under development. No, Nothing isn't switching from Android to a custom AI-powered OS. However, the phone brand announced a new platform called Essential, which will lay the groundwork for a future in which users generate their own apps and user interface. We've heard these ideas before, often called generative user interfaces, and it's still early days for the technology. Just describe what you need—capture all the receipts in my camera roll and export a PDF every Friday—and this will be generated as a widget you can interact with on the home screen. Playground is a place where you can publish not just your Essential Apps but also other Nothing oddities, like Glyph Toys from the Phone (3), camera presets, and EQ profiles. You can download what the community has made and even “remix” them into your own. Eventually, these features will turn into what Nothing is calling Essential OS, which it expects to debut in 2028. Nothing debuted some of these AI features with the “Essential” branding earlier this year. Essential Space is a new app that debuted on the Phone (3a), triggered by a dedicated button; tap it to capture your screen and have AI pull insights and summarize the contents. Now, there's Essential Memory, which the company says “brings everything together by learning your habits, and surfacing forgotten details when you need them most.” It's coming soon, so we'll have to wait and see to learn more. Hot on the heels of Ultrahuman and Oura announcing that you will be able to schedule and take blood labs with their services, Whoop debuted Whoop Advanced Labs. Not only can you add your preexisting blood work to the Whoop app, but you can also book blood testing through the app (like Oura, Whoop has partnered with Quest Diagnostics). Labs are routine medical tests that let doctors screen things such as high cholesterol, high blood glucose, and diabetes, or hormone or ferritin tests to check if your thyroid is working or you're eating enough iron. Still, it's a sad statement on the current accessibility of health care that routine medical services are now being funneled into revenue streams for private companies. As much as I like the Oura Ring and the Whoop band, they're not doctors; they still can't actually treat you for a heart attack or colon cancer. Arlo's Essential 3 lineup includes indoor and outdoor pan/tilt cameras (a first for the company), alongside a new generation of regular outdoor and indoor cameras. Finally, there is an update for the Ultra Security Camera 4K ($200), which combines 4K footage, HDR, and a 180-degree field of view. What artificial intelligence can do for home security was talked up a lot this week, and Arlo was no exception, with its beefed-up AI promising real-time intelligence for Arlo Secure subscribers (plans start at $8 a month). The new AI can recognize known people and vehicles, detect animals and packages, alert you to fire by spotting flames, and even be trained to flag certain situations, such as you leaving the garage door open again. Babies should sleep on flat, firm surfaces, but these little critters love to fall asleep in bouncers and rockers, since those devices replicate the movement they felt in the womb. Elvie, maker of one of our favorite breast pumps, announced a solution earlier this year at CES that's now available for purchase: the Elvie Rise. It's a smart bouncer and bassinet in one device, letting you switch from a rocker chair into a flat bassinet without needing to pick up and relocate your little one (thus letting them stay asleep). It's a handy all-in-one device, if you can stomach the $900 cost. Maybe you've seen billboards for Back Market, the company that sells refurbished, used tech. Located in SoHo at 449 Broadway, the pop-up store will run from October 1 to December 21. The store isn't just a place to buy used gear, though. There's an area that makes it a game to spot the difference between new and refurbished tech, and you can even get your devices serviced. The pop-up offers device diagnostics, screen repairs, cleaning services, and trade-in options. Roland has announced its first analog drum machine in decades. Roland has been modeling its analog hardware with digital chips for decades now, but the new TR-1000 uses 16 analog circuits from the original drum machines, then adds a digital backend to the sound that allows you to shape sounds and sequences. It also has sampling tools that will let you chop up songs, time-stretch, and sequence them. It's a premium product for a tier of producer most of us will never achieve—the TR-1000 costs $2,700 at launch—but it will likely be used hip-hop, pop, and other music for the next several decades.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to an internal announcement reported in Bloomberg by serial Apple leaker Mark Gurman, Apple has deprioritized efforts to make a lighter, more affordable version of its Vision Pro headset in favor of focusing on AI-enabled smart glasses. Apple now seems to be aiming to launch a pair of Meta-style smart glasses in 2027, with another pair featuring a display on the lens aimed for release in 2028—if not before. The move makes sense—after all, this has been the year where smart glasses really gained a foothold—but it's a telling and somewhat embarrassing U-turn for Apple. The $3,499 Apple Vision Pro has widely been considered a failure for the company, after Apple moved uncharacteristically early in a field that was still finding its feet. While it was always clear that Apple intended the premium device to prove its use case to developers, widespread acceptance of Apple's tech simply hasn't followed. However, it had seemingly planned to double down on the tech regardless, working on a slimmer, more affordable version of Vision Pro, predicted to launch in 2027. But that has now apparently changed, with the company reportedly fast tracking resources to its smart glasses projects instead. This sudden change in focus feels unusual for a usually patient Cupertino, and is perhaps an acknowledgement of that fact. Having a device directly in front of your eyes that can take phone calls, snap photos and video, and use AI to answer questions or translate languages means that smart glasses can offload a lot of the core use cases that people would normally pull out their phones to accomplish. “A phone that stays in your pocket is not where Apple wants to see the iPhone,” he adds. Anshel Sag, a principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees that while Apple has long been interested in making smart glasses and already has multiple projects in place, it hadn't been adequately prepared for this shift in the market. “I don't believe their strategy had smart glasses as the base of the pyramid like Meta does,” Sag says about Apple's extended reality efforts. Even with some generosity around sales estimations, that means Apple Vision Pro could've brought in as little as 10 percent of what was invested in it. Of course, some of that will go forward into other products, but it still can't be the outcome the company had hoped for—even though Apple CEO Tim Cook himself predicted it. When discussing the development of AR and AR devices back in 2016, he said that most people wouldn't find it acceptable to be “enclosed in something … because we are sociable people at heart.” He was spot on. And no, Tim, that's not to watch Ted Lasso on their ceiling. Coming to smart glasses in 2027 will feel almost impossibly late for a market that is taking off now, and while Apple is no stranger to starting behind, it will need to ensure its judgment on what its customers want in smart glasses is much more attuned than it was with Apple Vision Pro. At this point, it simply can't afford another misstep. But Apple isn't giving up on Apple Vision Pro either, and reports suggest it may well revisit it once the more pressing issue of smart glasses is dealt with. He points to the boom in gaming consoles as an example. Rather than flatlining the gaming PC market as was predicted, the proliferation of consoles actually helped drive sales of PCs, with more people getting into gaming, so more wanting to level up their equipment in time. He predicts the same trend will happen with smart glasses. People will start with more basic, familiar frames, then migrate into the chunkier, fully featured versions. “The cheaper, simpler devices are going to reach the most people, but then there's going to be a lot of people who want more than this base level experience.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
