                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: Justin Tipping breaks down HIM's explosive, ambiguous ending When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. HIM director Justin Tipping says he knows he won't "necessarily satisfy everyone's ultimate, total wish" with the new horror movie's "wild" ending, but he can't imagine it wrapping up any other way. Starring Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox, and Marlon Wayans, the film follows up-and-coming football star Cameron Cade, whose dreams of getting drafted into the NFL are dashed when he's randomly attacked just a few days before the league's scouting combine. His luck changes when he's invited to train at the remote compound of his idol, San Antonio Saviors quarterback Isaiah White – as Isaiah promises to present Cam as his future successor if he impresses. Not long after he arrives, though, Isaiah's insecurities threaten to turn the dream deal into a nightmare... Major spoilers for the rest of HIM below! In the movie's final act, Isaiah kinda, sorta reveals to Cam that all those blood transfusions he's been doing during their time together are actually part of an age-old ritual, helping pass on the athleticism of history's football legends to the present-day "G.O.A.T". Cam winds up being the one to walk away from the brawl, having beaten Isaiah to death with a helmet. Tom can then be seen being dragged by an unseen force into a pentagram on the ground, before the camera cuts to Cam and you see Tom explode in the background. From all the occult imagery, it's clear something demonic is going on, but HIM never explicitly spells out anything. "There were so many conversations, between the studio, [Jordan Peele's production company] Monkeypaw, and myself; I have about 300 different edits of that final scene. I don't think you'll necessarily satisfy everyone's ultimate, total wish because it's just so wild. But that was also kind of the point. "Too many seconds on Julia, it went beyond camp. It's no longer Almodovar, it's becoming a parody in a way that's not in-step with the rest that came before. For more, check out our picks of the most exciting upcoming horror movies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let's put on our tinfoil-covered Blue Jays caps and have a run through some of the most enduring conspiracy theories from the baseball team's history. Let's put on our tinfoil-covered Blue Jays caps and have a run through some of the most enduring conspiracy theories from the baseball team's history. A diplomatic incident was barely avoided in 1992 when a U.S. Marines colour guard paraded the Canadian flag upside down before Game 2 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Atlanta Braves. Every long-time Blue Jays fan has experienced some hurt or heartbreak over something questionable that has happened to this team, and it's likely only a matter of time before something controversial happens in this playoff run that will have fans scratching their heads and asking some pointed questions. So, before that happens, let's put on our tinfoil-covered Blue Jays caps and have a run through some of the most famous and enduring conspiracy theories from this team's history: In 2011, the Jays were accused of sign stealing in an ESPN report, which stated visiting players were enraged when “they caught sight of a man dressed in white about 25 yards to their right, out among the blue center-field seats. There was a lot of talk about it at the time, but the Jays denied it, MLB said they never received an official complaint from other teams and some commentators simply dismissed it as a hoax. This long-time fan with amazing seats right behind home plate at the Rogers Centre has inspired fake accounts on X and went viral for not flinching when a ball was hit back toward her and then making fun of her nonreaction later. In fact, the CBC reported that she was just a long-time season ticket holder, who didn't have any connection to the team, other than being a fan beloved by other fans. As well, she wasn't in her seats at the beginning of this season, which led to media outlets inquiring about her whereabouts. She was reportedly missing this season due to some health issues. In important games there will almost always be close calls and Jays fans would love to strike out some umpires they believe have it in for the team. Of course, this is something every fan base has said at one time or another. There are also certain umpires who have reputations throughout the league, with the most famous likely being Angel Hernandez. He was hated by many throughout the league for his questionable calls, including by Jays fans, but he retired in May 2024. As well, during the Jays' most recent series against the Red Sox, George Springer hit a ball that was called foul that many fans thought was fair, which led Jays manager John Schneider to try to tamp down on the Jays vs. the Ump rhetoric. “I don't want to feed into the narrative that the umpires are screwing us because they're not. Being the only team outside of the U.S. has long led to the entire country of Jays fans to have a chip on their shoulders, and anything that makes it seems like the Jays aren't being treated fairly will lead to fans making this claim. Much more recently, there was a fake Truth Social post from U.S. President Donald Trump that also fed into these fears, saying “WE WILL BE INVESTIGATING THE UN AMERICAN BLUE JAYS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO STEAL OUR BELOVED WORLD SERIES. THEY WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.” But we will for sure hear that from fans if something controversial happens this series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Second Skin Studio worked directly with Wētā Workshop and the show's creators to bring their concepts for various extraterrestrial creatures to life. Second Skin founder Sarawut “Tor" Sakthamcharoen tells Polygon it gave the eggs a “wet, organic look.” Sakthamcharoen and his colleague Sarinnaree “Honey” Khamaiumcharean worked on many of the monstrous beings in Alien: Earth, including a monstrous ticks, face-melting flies, and, and of course, fan-favorite specimen t. ocellus (often referred to as “the eyeball alien,” or “Eye Midge” by the show's cast and crew). To learn even more about these terrifying specimens, Polygon caught up with Sakthamcharoen and Khamaiumcharean via email to learn more about their work on Alien: Earth, their theory for one of the show's biggest changes from the movie, and their plans for a potential season 2. Did you work on any additional creatures for Alien: Earth? Beyond that, we also created support creatures and props, such as a sheep stunt for the collapse and death scene [in episode 8], and a Xenomorph foam prop inside a bag for the moment when Morrow sprays [a substance] to catch the Xeno [in episode 2]. We also produced silicone dummies, a cat dummy with the Eye Midge, detailed hair work, and prosthetics for the Eye Midge sequence This was used on set to help the actors react more naturally and later became a reference element for the VFX team to build upon. The ticks are particularly terrifying in Episode 5, but we only get to see some of their lifecycle. Do you have any ideas for how that could continue if there's a second season of the show? Tor: I'm not entirely sure — that would really depend on the director's vision. But one thing's for certain: You still haven't seen how they build their nests. How did you decide what it would look like? Tor: Actually, the initial design came from Wētā [Workshop] as a 2D sketch. Once the scale was approved, we moved on to molding and casting it in a way that looked like translucent jelly. Honey: Yes, the embryo design originated from Wētā Workshop. In the original 1979 Alien film, the Xenomorph eggs have water on them that appears to be dripping upwards (rather than trickling downwards). The Xenomorph eggs in Alien: Earth don't seem to have this feature. Tor: That's something we never actually discussed with the director [Noah Hawley]. But from what I understand, in the original 1979 Alien, Ridley Scott used a clever camera trick — shooting upside down so that water droplets falling under gravity looked like they were dripping upwards — to make the eggs feel unsettling and alien. The props were also coated with vegetable glycerin to give them a wet, organic look. In some cases, we added new elements, and in others, we adjusted features so they matched the story and tone of this series. I've heard the “eyeball alien” referred to as “Species 64” or “t. The first time we heard “Eye Midge” was actually from Jeff Okun (VFX) and also from the Wētā design team. Honey: We're not exactly sure where the name first came from. But I believe it became a practical nickname so that our multinational crew could easily understand and communicate the physical traits of the creature. We really have to thank our team — they pushed through with so much patience and dedication, and that's what made it possible in the end. We also developed the internal layers of the eggs in a way that, I believe, audiences have never seen in any Alien film before. On top of that, keeping the eggs intact in Thailand's hot climate was a real test for us. Its size makes it kind of cute — big and chunky, almost like a giant beetle. It's got a trunk like an elephant and eyes like a spider, which makes it both strange and endearing at the same time. Even though there was a lot of VFX involved, the practical version we built looked both absolutely cute and absolutely weird at the same time. Which creature scene from this season of Alien: Earth is your favorite? Tor: My favorite has to be the Eye Midge with Shmuel. That scene was so exciting, and from my side it was a special blend of creature and prosthetic work — something we're really proud of. Honey: My favorite scene was the fly spitting acid saliva onto Issac. Since Issac is a synthetic body built to be extremely strong, watching how it reacts to the acid really shows both the creature's biology and its terrifying force. Was there a lot of back and forth with the show's creators? Honey: From my side, the process was very collaborative. The initial creature concepts came from the director and Wētā Workshop, but once they reached us, it was our responsibility to translate those designs into practical builds that could actually work on set. That meant testing materials, creating prototypes, and finding ways to combine prosthetics with VFX. The challenge and joy was turning a 2D concept into something physical that actors could interact with and the camera could capture. Were there any concepts for alien creatures you came up with that didn't make it into Alien: Earth season 1 that you'd want to pursue in future seasons? Tor: Yes, there were definitely some concepts we worked on that didn't make it into season 1. Honey: Yes, we had a few concepts that didn't make it into season 1. Hopefully, if there is a season 2, we might get the chance to bring them alive, maybe even something more terrifying, something that will leave fans completely jaw-dropped.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ed and Lorraine Warren's grandson is opening up about his family's paranormal work and legacy. Chris McKinnell, son of the Warren's daughter, Judy Spera, appeared on the Reel Appreciation podcast, where he spoke with hosts Maria Elizabeth Darnell and David Clair-Bennett about his experiences working in the paranormal space with his grandparents. Asked if one particular incident sticks out to him most, McKinnell explained, "Everything that I saw with them was extraordinary. I mean, not always evil, not always dangerous... but the first thing that comes to mind was a case I worked on with them. That would be because my grandfather almost died." Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. "We were working on the possession of a man named Maurice Theriault, better known as Frenchie in The Nun series," McKinnell recalled, pausing to note that the films are "absolute fantasies." My grandfather was 10 feet away from me with my grandmother, complaining he didn't feel well." "And my grandmother looked at him and said, 'Hey Ed, why don't you have a banana? However, in reality, McKinnell says his grandfather "was having a heart attack during the exorcism." Although his grandmother claimed to have been a clairvoyant and a light trance medium, McKinnell noted that "she couldn't see" her husband's health crisis. McKinnell says the experience left a lasting impression. That's a terrible average to bet your life on." McKinnell was also asked about how he balances his work in the paranormal, which he shares on his The Warren Files channels, while also honoring his family's legacy in the space. He admitted that it can be "a difficult line to walk." They were wonderful mentors, but I learned a lot both to do and not to do," he said. That has a lot to do with me, but the fact that they were my grandparents shouldn't put me on — put me up above anybody at all," he added. The two paranormal investigators founded the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR) in the '50s and worked on over 10,000 cases together, writing several books about their findings and experiences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Brian Snitker revealed that he was retiring as the Atlanta Braves manager, it sent a shockwave through the organization and their fans. However, there were also some that openly wondered if Snitker's decision was really in his hands. Yes, Snitker's long tenure and high levels of success understandably got him a long leash (as it should have) and much of what hurt the Braves in 2025 was outside his control, but there were some folks towards the end of the season that said that Atlanta needed a new voice at the top. There was a world where Snitker would have wanted to come back, but the Braves pushed him into his new advisory role  in order to turn the page without embarrassing their long-time coach. During his end-of-season media session on Saturday, Braves front office head Alex Anthopoulos said, without equivocation, that it was Snitker's choice to call it quits. Had he wanted to continue, Atlanta would have welcomed him back with open arms. Anthopoulos went out of his way before Snitker made his decision to not lobby one way or another and give Snit the space he needed. He also spoke at length about how important his relationship with Snitker was to him and credited Snit as the reason why he got a World Series ring. The optics of forcing Snitker out would have been terrible and it is a mortal lock that it would have gotten out somehow. Given how much Snitker has meant to the organization for so long, he earned the right to go out on his own terms. As for next steps, it does not sound like replacing Snitker is particularly imminent. Snitker moving into an advisory role was expected given the terms of his final extension with the team, but it does feel like there is a wide open field that the Braves are considering. Hopefully they don't wait too long so that Atlanta can go into the offseason with a new manager to sell prospective free agent targets on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many staff members believe a few highly active ghosts haunt the distillery at 624 W. Main St. in Louisville. At one point, Buzzard Roost's resident basement ghost “Gandano” may even select which bourbon is tried next. What I can tell you, though, is that some very curious things have happened on the 600 block of W. Main Street in downtown Louisville. Ryan Svab, who co-owns Hereafter, also bartends at Buzzard's Roost. When the distillery teamed up with Fen Alankus of Feralore and her paranormal investigative team for a two-night investigation, it made sense to do one at Hereafter, as well. Two centuries ago, the 600 block of W. Main Street was Louisville's hub for commerce. Local lore says the upstairs mezzanine at Hereafter was once a Civil War map room. Five firefighters died that day, and Alankus' team believes they've connected with two of them, “Captain Edward” and “John.” A couple of years after the fire, a tornado blew through and took out the north side of the street. That kind of history and devastation can be fertile ground for paranormal investigations. “There's certain parts of the building where you just feel like you're not alone,” Coomes told me ahead of the tour. As Coomes, Svab and Alankus carved out this experience, they knew they wanted to do more than tell ghost stories. They wanted to give their guests a chance to interact with the ghosts and decide for themselves whether they believed anything supernatural was there. “There's no guarantees of what you're going to see and experience, because we think it's going to be different every single time,” Coomes told me. “Even though we've planned it out, every person is going to have a different type of time." Beyond me, only two couples from Pennsylvania, who knew each other, had signed up for it. We started the tour in the still room where Buzzard's Roost brand ambassador Jimmy James Hamblin offered us a pour of whiskey, while Alankus and Coomes talked us through the building's history. Since Buzzard's Roost opened in 2023, the staff has experienced unexplained broken glasses, books falling off the shelf and many elevator and electronic glitches. Coomes has seen unexplained orbs fluttering in upstairs offices on the security cameras. Bartenders hear footsteps when they're alone, only to discover no one is there. Hamblin doesn't believe in ghosts, but he also doesn't have an explanation for the books he's seen fall around him. There, the paranormal investigators played us a recording of an unexplained noise they captured in this room during their investigation. In the middle of hours worth of silence, the recorder picked up what could be a muffled man's voice saying “dimes.” Then Alankus introduced us to “Gandano,” who had previously told her this nickname using a Ouija board. She held up a pendulum from which she showed our group how to use it to channel answers from beyond. In theory, you could use these yes or no questions to learn about his life and preferences. Or, you could use it to choose what type of Buzzard's Roost bourbon we should drink. “Are you cool with choosing the whiskey that we're going to try first,” Alankus asked him. The pendulum swung in a small circle near Buzzard's Roost's smoked barrel rye whiskey, which has previously won a double gold medal at the San Francisco World Spirits competition. Hamblin served the blended three-year-old rye finished in toasted barrel, which had a smooth, almost vanilla taste. As we sipped on that, Alankus showed us a pair of divining rods. Like the pendulum, Alankus explained that the position of these L-shaped rods could be used to answer yes or no questions. After a short test, we learned that when the rods swung apart, Gandano was saying “no” and if they crossed, it meant “yes.” And this is where the real fun began. So much so, eventually Hamblin ended up choosing the second and third pours of whiskey for us, instead of Gandano. Our little group was having too much fun trying to learn about the spirit to give him another shot at selecting a bourbon. “Gandano are you Italian,” one woman asked, and the rods positioned themselves into a “no.” This kind of banter went on for about 25 minutes, until finally it was time to head around the corner to Hereafter. “I would like to know if Gandano enjoyed himself this evening,” Hamblin asked, playfully. Whether or not we were speaking to the dead ― at very least we hadn't ticked this supposed spirit off. The paranormal team had set out stacks of tarot cards. Each card had a corresponding cocktail that went with it, which left the final drink of the night in fate's hands. Hereafter is one of the most active spaces Alankus has ever investigated. Co-owner Svab and some of her staff believe they've seen a male apparition in a dark work suit roaming the building. They worried someone might be in trouble inside, and then when the staff finally got the door open — no one was there. As we sipped our fortune cocktails, the team passed around a collection of sensors designed to detect electro-magnetic energy or unexplained changes in temperatures. They encouraged us to wander the bar and music venue to see if any of the decor might seem sensitive. Svab keeps a “cabinet of curiosities” filled with creepy dolls and bizarre antiques in the downstairs bar, and she said many of the objects seem to have a supernatural charge to them. She has several bubble portraits from the 1800s decorating the walls that her staff suspects might have a spirit connected to them. But really, most of the supernatural activity at Hereafter occurs when the building is quiet and only one or two people are there. So then the woman tried calling out to other significant names in her life. I was just about to put my sensor down and call it a night when conversation in the group turned back to those red-headed, mischievous, 20-somethings. “And I'm observing, and I'm watching what's going around, what would be my motivation to throw a picture or to mess with people?" Right as she said “mess with people” every light on my sensor went off, as though that was the answer. And candidly, that was enough to convince me it was time to call it a night and explore the spirits downtairs behind the bar ... rather than tempt these red heads into "messing" with me from the afterlife.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years it has been the subject of a hypothetical online meme with countless spoof images depicting the ironic situation occurring in which a psychic medium event is cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances". Now, however, the gag appears to have become a reality after a pub in Northumberland was unfortunately forced to reschedule their upcoming event. Newcastle resident Peter Larsen, spotted an Instagram post by the Snowy Owl pub in Cramlington and couldn't resist poking fun at it online. he wrote in delight on X alongside a screenshot of the pub's message, which indeed read: "Due to unforeseen circumstances." The Snowy Owl elaborated in between crystal ball emojis: "Sorry for any inconvenience caused we are having to rearrange our stand up physic [sic] night from Monday 6th October. It will now be taken place on Monday 3rd November at 6:30pm." The pub also provided its phone number for enquiries. One X user joked in response: "They probably should have seen that coming." A second person added: "I'm surprised they didn't see it coming, does the psychic powers only work sometimes during the day?" While a fourth X user laughed: "Worst psychic ever!" The pub, which has almost 1,000 Instagram followers, also saw a similar response directly, with one person agreeing: "Mustn't be a very good psychic then." "Our menus are full of hearty favourites and country pub classics, as well as our seasonal dishes, and we'll be ready with a well-stocked bar, including cask ales, fine wines and British gin to suit very taste - which will taste all the better when enjoyed either in our beautiful gardens or by our crackling log fires." In December, meanwhile, another scheduled psychic evening had to be cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances" - as ticketholders fumed the clairvoyant should have "seen that coming". At the time, customers were eagerly looking forward to the event at the Novar Arms in Dingwall, Scotland, which first announced it would be hosting a psychic night three months earlier. The pub had organised the event in partnership with Second Sight, a company that provides "authentic psychics specialising in floor shows and readings''.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HUNDREDS of sailors stood mesmerised as they gazed up at what they claim was a 40ft-wide "UFO orb" hovering above a US Navy aircraft carrier. Documentary filmmaker Dave C. Beaty - who produced 2019 film The Nimitz Encounters about another famous Navy UFO case - has been probing the mystery for years. Beaty has interviewed a number of sailors who, to this day, insist that what they saw off the East Coast that night in early 2004 was a UFO. Efforts to understand what took place have been hampered by the fact no official confirmation was ever given. And one witness claimed senior officers acted suspiciously in the aftermath. But Beaty told The Sun he believes there are more witnesses who can provide testimony - and believes their accounts are key to narrowing down when the event actually took place. Seaman Patrick Gokey, who was serving on the ship that night, said the object "did not move in ways that I've seen other aircraft maneuver and it was faster than anything I've ever seen". And former Navy quartermaster Karol Olesiak, who was on watch from 8pm to 12am and was responsible for the ship's logbook, also recalled the glowing orb. He claimed it was about 40ft wide and hovered above the carrier for four hours from around 8pm onwards. "I might have asked the conning officer and I don't remember exactly what he said, but the impression that I got was that this should not be in the official log." He also said there was an eerie calm among senior officers and bridge crew - as if they had seen such phenomena before. "The entire bridge team was pilots," he said. "My assumption is yes [they had seen something similar before], but I asked an officer if any of them were talking about it the next day and he said 'yes'." Olesiak believes its "possible" someone may have taken photos and videos of the object - but the incident occurred before camera phones were common and crew did not carry their mobiles. I can still visualise this object in my head to a tee regardless of 18 years having passed. Derek Smith, a former Boatswain's Mate Seaman, said he remembers the sighting "as if it occurred yesterday", calling it the "most mysterious thing" he has ever seen. He said the next day was simply "normal" - but his shipmates were discussing it, some dismissing the giant object as a "weather balloon" - to which he said "hell no". "I [can] still visualise this object in my head to a tee regardless of 18 years having passed," Smith previously told The Sun. Smith stressed he was "an average Joe" with no paranormal experiences before or since. And she also claims that while speaking to the ship's bridge, they said they were tracking the object on radar as it followed them doing "swoop" maneuvers. "The ship left Norfolk in May of 2004 with a partial crew to sail to its new home port in San Diego. "The command summary report shows what the vessel was doing during those months - at port or out to sea. "So there really are only a few times this event could have happened. He explained: "In reading Robert Hastings' book on nukes, many of his reports from Air Force bases had a similar-looking UFO - a glowing orange ball or oval. "In fact, one of his witnesses had a similar experience with all of these men seeing the UFO - and then seemingly have no interest in it moments later. "I tried to contact that veteran but he had passed. But it's certainly a curious part of this case." With UFOs a hot topic in Washington, Beaty admitted it would be "nice to have some answers" over what he saw on the Reagan - and believes the government "knows more than what they lead us to believe". But the Pentagon has been accused of not doing enough to probe unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) - the preferred term for UFOs. Those who claim to have seen UAPs argue this is a national security concern that successive U.S. governments have failed to take seriously. 757 cases from across the world were reported to US authorities between 1 May 2023 and 1 June 2024 - including 272 older sightings that had not previously been recorded. After reviewing the evidence, the Pentagon concluded in a report last November: “It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.” The report found hundreds of sightings were in fact misidentified balloons, birds, drones and satellites. Elon Musk's Starlink satellite network was also often mistaken for UFOs. Intelligence chiefs have urged servicemen to come forward and said they hoped the stigma around reporting was now breaking down. USS Ronald Reagan is a Nimitz-class, nuclear-powered supercarrier belonging to the US Navy. The ninth ship of her class, she was acquired in 2003 and named in honour of Ronald Reagan, who served as US president from 1981 to 1989. The 101,000-tonne, 1,092ft-long vessel is powered by two nuclear reactors. Her maiden active deployment came in 2006, when she conducted naval operations during the Iraq invasion and the war in Afghanistan.</p>
