Anthony Salisbury displayed chat about deployment of 82nd airborne division on cell phone while in Minnesota

A senior White House official accidentally leaked details of plans to send an elite army unit to Portland, in the latest intelligence leak by the Trump administration.

Anthony Salisbury, a top deputy to Stephen Miller, the influential White House policy adviser, was observed using Signal in a public place to discuss a plan to deploy the army's 82nd airborne division to Portland, the Democratic-run Oregon city which Donald Trump has repeatedly castigated as being “war-ravaged”.

The Minnesota Star Tribune obtained images of Salisbury's Signal messages, which it said were sent while the official was “in clear view of others” in Minnesota.

In the messages, sent last weekend, Salisbury chatted with Patrick Weaver, a senior adviser to the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and other high-ranking federal officials, the Star Tribune reported.

Weaver wrote that Hegseth wanted Trump to expressly tell him to send troops to Portland.

“Between you and I, I think Pete just wants the top cover from the boss if anything goes sideways with the troops there,” Weaver said. He wrote that Hegseth would prefer to send in the national guard due to potential backlash over using the army.

“82nd is like our top tier [quick reaction force] for abroad. So it will cause a lot of headlines,” he added. “Probably why he wants potus [Trump] to tell him to do it.”

The 82nd airborne division is an elite unit that specialises in parachute assaults and forcible entry operations. It was deployed in both world wars and the wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan. A recent commander was the last American soldier to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2021.

On Sunday, Hegseth said 200 members of the national guard would be deployed “immediately”. On Wednesday, Trump claimed the national guard was “now in place”; however, NBC News affiliate KGW reported that the guard had not yet been deployed.

Salisbury was appointed deputy homeland security adviser by Trump in January. Announcing his appointment, Trump said Salisbury “will bring his vast law enforcement, counter-narcotics and counter-cartel experience to the White House”.

In a statement to the Minnesota Star Tribune, Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, confirmed Salisbury had been in Minnesota to attend a funeral.

“Despite dealing with grief from the loss of a family member, Tony continued his important work on behalf of the American people,” Jackson told the Star Tribune. “Nothing in these private conversations, that are shamefully being reported on by morally bankrupt reporters, is new or classified information.”

The messages are the latest embarrassing leak by the Trump administration. In March, the editor in chief of the Atlantic was accidentally added to a Signal chat that was being used by senior Trump administration officials, including Hegseth and the vice-president, JD Vance, to discuss highly sensitive military strikes on Yemen.

A month later it emerged that Hegseth had used a second Signal group chat to send detailed information about the strikes to his wife, his brother and about a dozen other people.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Czechia's populist Ano (Yes) party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has won the Oct. 3-4 parliamentary elections with around 35% of the vote, according to preliminary results. 

With over 98% of votes counted, Ano leads with 34.6%, while the ruling Spolu (Together) party holds 23.27%. The liberal centrist STAN party follows with about 11% of the votes, followed by the liberal Pirates (8.8%) and far-right SPD (7.8%) . 

Ano has not won an outright majority and will have to cooperate with other factions to form a governing coalition. Current election results indicate the party has earned 81 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, Prague's 200-member lower house of parliament. 

The Ano party is opposed to Ukraine's membership in the European Union and does not support aid to Ukraine. The party will have the first opportunity to form a new coalition government and is expected to partner with populist, right-wing, and anti-NATO factions. 

Billionaire oligarch Babis, who previously served as prime minister from 2017-2021, surged in popularity due to concerns over the economy and criticisms of the current government, led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. 

Czechia has been one of Kyiv's staunchest allies since the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion. Prague has supplied tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and helicopters in military aid packages and hosted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees.

Most significantly, Czechia in 2024 launched its ammunition initiative to provide Ukraine with urgently needed artillery shells during a severe front-line shortage. Czechia served as an intermediary for 15 participating nations buying shells for Ukraine on global markets. 

The program has made a significant impact, with President Volodymyr Zelensky crediting the initiative for saving lifes on the battlefield and strengthening Ukrainian troops' positions.

Czechia plans to provide Ukraine with up to 1.8 million shells by the end of 2025. 

Ano's win threatens the future of the ammunition initiative, as Babis has sharply criticized the scheme and pledged to do away with it if his party regains power. 

Babis has also expressed sympathy for other European nationalist leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister and Kremlin ally Viktor Orban, and claimed Ukraine's membership in the EU would be a "complete catastrophe."

"The Russians have not abandoned their intentions to plunge Ukraine into darkness on the eve of the new heating season," Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said. 



The populist Ano party is opposed to Ukraine's membership in the European Union and does not support aid to Ukraine. 

A Russian drone struck the station in the city of Shostka, Sumy Oblast. Passengers and Ukrzaliznytsia workers were on the site at the moment of the attack, according to Zelensky.

Sergiy Kyslytsia warned that Europe needs to "get serious" about the existential threat posed by Russia.



China officially claims neutrality in Russia's war against Ukraine, but has indirectly supported Moscow in several ways.

 The city of Kupiansk has become a focal point of Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast. After crossing the Oskil River, Russian forces have begun infiltrating Ukrainian lines in small assault groups, while the battlefield becomes increasingly dominated by swarming drones.

Over the decades, Oleksa Shalayskyi became one of Ukraine's leading investigative journalists and is described by his colleagues as a pioneer of anti-corruption investigations.

The Russian missile ship was struck on Lake Onega in the Republic of Karelia at 04:31 a.m. local time on Oct. 4, according to the Special Operations Forces.

Russia launched 109 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as three Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles, the Air Force reported.

Drones struck the Kirishi oil refinery in Russia's Leningrad oblast overnight on Oct. 4, sparking a fire that was later extinguished, officials and local media reported.

"Today, all the rescued children are safe in Ukraine-controlled territory," Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, said.

The number includes 950 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Authorities at Munich International Airport ordered a suspension in flight operations shortly after 9:30 p.m. local time after multiple drones were spotted in the vicinity of the airport for the second time in less than 24 hours.

TBILISI, October 4. /TASS/. Candidates from Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia, are winning a landslide victory with over 70% of the vote in all municipalities across the country, Prime Minister Irakly Kobakhidze told a news briefing.

"According to our election headquarters, Georgian Dream is confidently in the lead in both mayoral and assembly elections in all municipalities. Moreover, according to our election headquarters, in all municipalities, including Tbilisi and other large cities, the vote is over 70% in favor of Georgian Dream," Kobakhidze stated.

The Georgian prime minister noted that the party highly appreciated the trust expressed by the country's population. He pledged that the authorities will do everything in their powers top rise to the people's expectations.

Georgia is electing mayors of five self-governing cities - Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Batumi, Rustavi, and Poti - and 59 municipalities, as well as members of 64 city councils. Twelve parties have registered with the Central Election Commission, with nine candidates vying for the Tbilisi mayoral post. The ruling Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia party has nominated incumbent Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze for a third term. The largest opposition parties running in the elections, Strong Georgia - Lelo and Gakharia for Georgia, have nominated a single mayoral candidate, former parliament member Irakly Kupradze.

Polling stations opened at 8:00 a.m. (7:00 a.m. Moscow time, GMT +3) across the country and will close at 8:00 p.m. (7:00 p.m. Moscow time, GMT +3). A total of 3,061 polling stations are open to more than 3.5 million voters. More than 90% of polling stations are equipped with electronic ballot boxes.

Nuclear deterrence is untenable. We need to pursue anti-colonial disarmament.

We are living through the most dangerous time in over a half-century when it comes to nuclear weapons and the prospect of them being used during an armed conflict. Nuclear treaties are unravelling. Rulers like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, who lead the two nations with around 87 percent of the world's nuclear inventory, are ratcheting up global tensions. The U.S. is set to spend $1.7 trillion on nuclear modernization over the coming decades. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised alarm around the use of nuclear weapons. A nuclear-armed Israel is regularly attacking Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Yemen. India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed nations, were recently in armed conflict over Kashmir and are constantly at odds. China is rapidly militarizing and bolstering its nuclear stockpile.

At the same time, there is hope and resistance to a nuclear-armed world. The majority of nations, especially those from the Global South, have ratified the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which broadly bans all aspects of nuclear weapons production, stockpiling, testing, and threats. Survivors of nuclear attacks, nuclear testing, and uranium mining — from Japan to Kazakhstan, from Marshall Islands to the U.S. Southwest — continue to boldly speak out and demand reparations and nuclear abolition. Across the world, thousands of people are plugged into regional and global antimilitarist networks and initiatives to confront a nuclear challenge that demands internationalist solidarity from us all.

What are the most urgent dangers around nuclear weapons today? What does an anticolonial stance toward nuclear weapons look like? What should be the concrete aims of a global movement against nuclear weapons?

Truthout posed these and other questions to three organizers and scholars from around the world working to advance nuclear abolition. Sara Haghdoosti is the Iranian-American executive director of Win Without War, a national grassroots organization advocating for a progressive U.S. foreign policy. Leila Hennaoui is an associate professor in international law at Hassiba Benbouali University of Chlef in Algeria, who has written about the Global South and nuclear colonialism. Achin Vanaik is a member of the Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament and Peace in India. He is a retired professor from the University of Delhi and the author of several books.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Derek Seidman: When you all look at the world today, what worries you the most about nuclear weapons?

Leila Hennaoui: These are very dangerous times. The nuclear threat is the greatest since the Cold War. Russia has talked about using tactical nuclear weapons. A sitting Israeli minister casually suggested a nuclear strike on Gaza. 

Nuclear armed states not only refuse to move forward with disarmament, but are actually modernizing and expanding their arsenals. There are talks of resuming nuclear testing. Russia has stepped back from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. 

All this is unprecedented. Nuclear rhetoric is being normalized, and that really worries me. Instead of normalizing the nuclear threat, we should talk about repairing harm and redirecting resources.

Achin Vanaik: The idea with tactical nuclear weapons is that nuclear weapons could be used in battle without mass annihilation. This undermines the already irrational deterrence logic that says nuclear weapons must not be used.

The U.S. also abandoned the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002 and has moved toward a nuclear shield, which aims via space interceptors to do no less than protect the whole territory of the U.S. from any possible nuclear attack. This accelerates the nuclear arms race because a country with a nuclear shield can consider a first strike on its nuclear opponent. There's also the militarization of outer space. 

The danger is greatest in South Asia. India and Pakistan are two nuclear powers in ongoing conflict that have had conventional wars. Pakistan, a much smaller country than India, has stated it would consider using tactical nuclear weapons if faced with economic strangulation, which is arguably what the Indian government has done by illegally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty. The likelihood of future armed conflict creates a situation where these two countries initially say they won't use nuclear weapons, but then progress to a situation where they very seriously consider it.

Sara Haghdoosti: The rising threat of authoritarianism makes nuclear war far more likely. We're seeing so many cavalier threats about the use of nukes, from Trump to Putin and from India to Pakistan. It's deeply alarming. We're seeing the old systems we had to help contain the threat of nuclear weapons crumble around us. 

If the New START Treaty [which is an arms reduction between the U.S. and Russia, and the last remaining arms control treaty between them] expires next year, we could enter a new arms race. There's also a new set of challenges around nuclear weapons with AI being integrated into some of their data control systems.

What are the costs of nuclear weapons for society? And who actually benefits or profits from nuclear weapons?

Hennaoui: For nuclear armed states, the economic costs are enormous. Budgets for nuclear weapons and modernizing stockpiles are huge. This swallows trillions in resources that could go to hospitals and schools and social programs.

While nuclear weapons may drain public resources in the North, for us in the South they cost us lives, health, and water. In my country, Algeria, the French conducted nuclear testing in the Sahara that left radioactive contamination that still impacts us today. It's the same in Kazakhstan and the Marshall Islands. There's uranium extraction in Niger or Namibia or the Navajo nation in the U.S. 

We need to reject nuclear apartheid, where a handful of nations hold permanent nuclear rights while the rest of the world is denied them. That's the first principle.

The health burden is intergenerational. In Algeria, we still have birth defects and cancer from France's nuclear testing. Nuclear arms impact humanity both north and south, but it's us in the south, the poorest, who have no say around nuclear weapons, who pay the highest price.

Haghdoosti: Everyone thinks about the detonation of nuclear weapons, but they have a huge impact at home that gets erased, from the legacy of nuclear testing, to workers without enough protections, to the environmental impacts on local communities. 

In the U.S., we're spending over a trillion dollars on nuclear weapons over the next decade. Much of that is going into the pockets of weapons manufacturers. Nukes are really good business for them. Weapons manufacturers lobby Congress and make big campaign donations, and then many of them get contracts. It's a legalized form of corruption.

Hennaoui: Nobody wants new nations acquiring nuclear weapons. This kind of horizontal proliferation benefits nobody. But vertical proliferation, or modernization of current arsenals, benefits the leaders of military and security bureaucracies. Nuclear weapons, sadly, are seen as symbols of prestige and power, and these bureaucracies and militaries guard their control over secretive nuclear infrastructures that eat up vast areas of the budget. 

What should be the short-term and long-term aims for a progressive antinuclear politics?

Hennaoui: The short-term priority should be strengthening the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). It's a great tool that we already have, but it needs to be empowered. There must be funding for its programs, such as victim assistance and environmental remediation. 

We need to continue stigmatizing and campaigning against nuclear weapons. We need public pressure, especially in P5 countries (China, France, Russia, U.K., U.S.). In a volatile area like the Middle East, we have proactive organizations that have drafted weapons of mass destruction free zone treaties that they bring to diplomats. We should support efforts like this. 

We should always strive to change the logic of security. The deterrence logic should be dismantled, combined with reparative justice and the relocation of resources for human security.

Haghdoosti: One short-term solution is diplomacy. The best case study here is the nuclear deal with Iran. It worked until Trump ripped it up. 

You can't fight successfully to get rid of nuclear weapons by only focusing on nuclear weapons. We have to connect that struggle to the struggle against expanding militarism and racist nationalism.

In the long term, we need to push for leaders who aren't focused on deterrence, which we know doesn't work. We need new strategies to work towards peace. People need to trust their common sense here. Yes, we have too many nuclear weapons, and we are better off without them. 

The key to nuclear abolition is realizing that our safety is bound up with everyone else's. Common thinking on national security assumes that you get more bombs and build higher walls and then people are safe. But this can't address the biggest threats we're facing, like climate change or nuclear war, whose impacts affect everyone.

Vanaik: As we push for more countries to sign onto the TPNW, we should also propose nuclear risk reduction measures. We need to set up a framework for a discussion about nuclear disarmament just like we have around climate. 

The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would ease the situation. If the U.S. ratified it, Russia would follow, and it would put tremendous pressure on India and Pakistan. We must also promote more nuclear weapons free zones. Most important would be a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction. The principal holdout is, of course, Israel.

Even if we don't achieve these, we should still raise them to propagate and raise general consciousness. 

While we don't want more nuclear weapons, we also don't want imperial powers dictating what Global South nations can and can't do. What should an anticolonial, antinuclear politics look like? 

Hennaoui: It's really complicated. We need to reject nuclear apartheid, where a handful of nations hold permanent nuclear rights while the rest of the world is denied them. That's the first principle.

We should listen to the voices of the people silenced during the manufacturing of the colonial system. Nuclear weapons today are a new form of colonization. We must support the agency of the Global South and their right to shape disarmament and demand reparations from the nuclear harm they were subjected to.

Don't underestimate the importance of a progressive mass politics. Mass politics can lead to the overthrow of even the most intense dictatorships, and it can provide resistance against countries that are considering using nuclear weapons.

It's understandable that the nuclear deterrence logic might appeal to Iran, which was just attacked by the U.S. and Israel. But we shouldn't support this. Instead, we should call out double standards and the coercive disarmament that is always imposed on the weak, and we should insist that all nuclear arsenals, including those of the P5 nations, Israel, and others, should be dismantled.

Vanaik: Nuclear elites always say that nuclear weapons offer leverage. The problem is they represent something so extreme that you can't actually use them to bully another country. Having nuclear weapons will not protect you from attacks. 

You can't fight successfully to get rid of nuclear weapons by only focusing on nuclear weapons. We have to connect that struggle to the struggle against expanding militarism and racist nationalism.

The danger of nuclear weapons has to be addressed at the international level. Regional efforts like nuclear weapons free zones are all steps in the generation of a consciousness to move beyond the terrain of nationalism and fight the interconnected crises, from militarism to climate, that impact us all. We need to be internationalists. 

What do you see as major challenges to nuclear abolition?

Hennaoui: The biggest challenge is the exclusion of the Global South. The current nuclear governance system, with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as its cornerstone, silences and excludes southern voices. Powerful states have also been pressuring countries not to engage with the TPNW. Persistent regional rivalries, like between India and Pakistan, also feed the deterrence logic. 

We can overcome these obstacles with grassroots and diplomatic pressure, credible technical assistance, and the push for new decolonial treaties. I think of the TPNW as a decolonial legal tool. It's difficult to dismantle this house built on colonial legacies. International law is a tool that has always been used, and we should use tools like the TPNW. 

Haghdoosti: Our movement can be shortsighted in evaluating our work. We need to realize the sum total of our efforts. The conversation about nukes isn't just about those weapons. It's really about a mindset of what keeps us safe and what doesn't. Opposing the genocide in Gaza, or critiquing the Pentagon budget, are linked to furthering the conversation about nuclear abolition. Every time you stand up to militarism, you're taking a chink out of the armor. 

The topic of nuclear weapons can feel overwhelming. What keeps you motivated in this struggle? 

Vanaik: Don't underestimate the importance of a progressive mass politics. Mass politics can lead to the overthrow of even the most intense dictatorships, and it can provide resistance against countries that are considering using nuclear weapons.

We also have no choice. The biggest problems of the world today are caused by the rich and the right. But the future is open ended. We can change it. It has changed before. We guarantee that it will only get worse if we don't fight. 

Haghdoosti: When you read this, do something. It feels overwhelming, but the only way to ensure nothing changes is to do nothing. Join an organization. Under authoritarianism, you're told that your voice means nothing and that collective action doesn't deliver. If we start to believe that, we will start to really lose any chance for change as well as our democracy.

Hennaoui: Hope lies with the survivors who are still telling their stories. They show us the human cost and bring voice to those who were silenced. Hope also lies with the energy of the youth and the new anti-nuclear movements. The struggle is alive with them.

Many things have been accomplished in the past that were unimaginable. The U.S. abolished slavery. We achieved a chemical weapons prohibition and a landmine ban. Disarmament is not naive. What seems impossible now, may, in the foreseeable future, become possible.

Exclusive: Activist tells Swedish officials she has been subjected to harsh treatment, including insufficient food and water

Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has told Swedish officials she is being subjected to harsh treatment in Israeli custody after her detention and removal from a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza, according to correspondence seen by the Guardian.

According to the correspondence, Israeli forces are also reported by another detainee to have taken photographs where Thunberg was allegedly forced to hold flags. The identity of the flags are unknown.

In an email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, and seen by the Guardian, an official who has visited the activist in prison said she claimed she was detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water.

“The embassy has been able to meet with Greta,” reads the email. “She informed of dehydration. She has received insufficient amounts of both water and food. She also stated that she had developed rashes which she suspects were caused by bedbugs. She spoke of harsh treatment and said she had been sitting for long periods on hard surfaces.”

“Another detainee reportedly told another embassy that they had seen her [Thunberg] being forced to hold flags while pictures were taken. She wondered whether images of her had been distributed,” the Swedish ministry's official added.

Thunberg is among 437 activists, parliamentarians and lawyers who are part of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), a coalition of more than 40 vessels carrying humanitarian aid whose goal was to breach Israel's 16-year maritime blockade of Gaza.

Between Thursday and Friday, Israeli forces intercepted all the boats and arrested every crew member onboard. Most of them are being held at Ketziot, also known as Ansar III, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinian security prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities.

In the past, activists detained by Israel were not criminally prosecuted and instead their presence was treated as an immigration matter.

According to lawyers from the NGO Adalah, the rights of the crew members have been “systematically violated”, reporting that activists were denied water, sanitation, medication and immediate access to their legal representatives, “in clear breach of their fundamental rights to due process, impartial trial and legal representation”.

The Italian legal team representing the flotilla confirmed those detained were left “for hours without food or water – until late last night”, with the exception of “a packet of crisps handed to Greta and shown to the cameras”. Lawyers also reported instances of verbal and physical abuse.

During a visit to Ashdod on Thursday night, Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was filmed calling the activists “terrorists” as he stood in front of them.

“These are the terrorists of the flotilla,” he said, speaking in Hebrew and pointing at dozens of people sitting on the ground. His spokesperson confirmed the video was filmed at Ashdod port on Thursday night.

Some activists were heard shouting: “Free Palestine.”

Ben-Gvir has previously called for the activists to be jailed rather than deported.

After their arrest, the flotilla's legal team expressed concern over the treatment the crew members might face, particularly those who had previously been detained by Israeli authorities after attempts to break Gaza's naval blockade. This marks the second time Thunberg has been arrested alongside other flotilla members, after a similar attempt earlier this year ended with the activists' arrest and deportation.

Baptiste André, a French doctor who was on one of the boats of the flotilla in June, told reporters upon his return to France that he witnessed Israeli border agents mock and deliberately deprive passengers of sleep, in particular Thunberg.

The Swedish official said in the email that Thunberg was asked by Israeli authorities to sign a document.

“She expressed uncertainty about what the document meant and did not want to sign anything she did not understand,” reads the email. The Swedish ministry's official wrote that Thunberg has had access to legal counsel.

Adalah said in an earlier statement about the legal process that although Israeli authorities would have a record of repeat participants in aid flotillas, activists, such as Thunberg, were generally treated in the same way as first-time participants, subject to short-term detention and deportation.

The Guardian contacted the Israel Prison Service, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israeli ministry for foreign affairs but none have yet responded to a request for comment.

Kyiv has evidence that China has provided Russia with satellite data which has been used to target missile strikes on Ukraine, including strikes on facilities used by foreign companies, a member of Ukraine's foreign intelligence service (SZRU) said on Oct. 4.

SZRU employee Oleh Alexandrov told  Ukrinform that there is evidence of "high-level cooperation between Russia and China in conducting satellite reconnaissance of Ukraine's territory."

According to Alexandrov, the goal of reconnaissance is to identify strategic targets for attacks.

"At the same time, as we have seen in recent months, these targets may belong to foreign investors," he added.

Alexandrov did not disclose additional details about the Ukrainian targets that were allegedly struck with Chinese satellite intelligence data.

China officially claims neutrality in Russia's war against Ukraine, but has indirectly supported Moscow's war through continued trade and by providing dual-use goods to Russia.

During Russian President Vladimir Putin's last visit to China, where he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the two countries signed more than 20 cooperation deals in energy, technology, and other sectors, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

Putin lauded the relationship between the two countries, saying they have reached an "unprecedented level."

Some protesters attempted to break through the palace fences, prompting Georgia's Interior Ministry to declare the demonstration illegal and order the crowd dispersed. 

The populist Ano party is opposed to Ukraine's membership in the European Union and does not support aid to Ukraine. 

"The Russians have not abandoned their intentions to plunge Ukraine into darkness on the eve of the new heating season," Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said. 



A Russian drone struck the station in the city of Shostka, Sumy Oblast. Passengers and Ukrzaliznytsia workers were on the site at the moment of the attack, according to Zelensky.

China officially claims neutrality in Russia's war against Ukraine, but has indirectly supported Moscow in several ways.

 The city of Kupiansk has become a focal point of Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast. After crossing the Oskil River, Russian forces have begun infiltrating Ukrainian lines in small assault groups, while the battlefield becomes increasingly dominated by swarming drones.

Over the decades, Oleksa Shalayskyi became one of Ukraine's leading investigative journalists and is described by his colleagues as a pioneer of anti-corruption investigations.

The Russian missile ship was struck on Lake Onega in the Republic of Karelia at 04:31 a.m. local time on Oct. 4, according to the Special Operations Forces.

Russia launched 109 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as three Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles, the Air Force reported.

Drones struck the Kirishi oil refinery in Russia's Leningrad oblast overnight on Oct. 4, sparking a fire that was later extinguished, officials and local media reported.

"Today, all the rescued children are safe in Ukraine-controlled territory," Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, said.

The number includes 950 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

MOSCOW, October 4. /TASS/. NASA may deploy nuclear weapons to the Moon under the cover of the Artemis program, Alexander Stepanov, military expert with the Institute of Law and National Security at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, told TASS.

"A manned base is part of the Artemis program, aimed at developing space exploration technologies, preparing for longer space missions, and adapting and training astronauts. The construction site will be the Shackleton Crater on the Moon's South Pole. Nuclear energy will be used to supply power. This particular aspect is probably the most important one because this marks a step towards bringing nuclear technologies not only to orbit but also to near space. The odds are high that nuclear weapons will be deployed in near-Earth and near-Moon space," he pointed out.

According to Stepanov, Washington is focused on expanding its launch capabilities for a potential deployment of offensive weapons to orbit, which may be equipped with special warheads, including nuclear ones. "For instance, the Boeing X-37 spacecraft is capable of carrying up to six nuclear warheads," the expert specified.

He stressed that in the past, the US had conducted explosions of nuclear weapons in order to assess their impact on space. "In 1962-1963, the US carried out Operation Dominic, which included a series of nuclear weapons tests. In particular, the Starfish Prime project was implemented to study the impact of nuclear explosions on objects in outer space. A PGM-17A Thor medium-range missile was used to deliver a thermonuclear weapon to low Earth orbit," Stepanov said.

Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SSO) struck a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, in Russia's republic of Karelia, the military reported on Oct. 4.

The Russian missile ship "Grad" was struck on Lake Onega in the Republic of Karelia at 04:31 a.m. local time on Oct. 4, according to the SSO.

"The missile carrier was travelling from the Baltic Sea to the Caspian Sea. The damage was to the right side of the ship's power plant compartment. Further details are being clarified," the SSO said in a statement.  

"Special Operations Forces continue to conduct asymmetric and sensitive actions to stop the enemy," the statement says. It did not state what weapon was used in the attack.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The Buyan-M-class ship, also designated Project 21631, is a small but heavily armed corvette capable of operating in shallow waters. The vessel was among the first Russian surface ships used to launch Kalibr missiles which regularly target Ukrainian cities in mass missile strikes.

Repeated Ukrainian attacks using naval drones, missiles, and long-range drones have forced the Kremlin to reduce its naval presence in occupied Crimea.

Ukraine has destroyed several Russian vessels, including the Caesar Kunikov landing ship, the Sergei Kotov patrol ship, the Ivanovets missile corvette, and multiple high-speed landing crafts.

HUR also claimed on Aug. 21 that it had struck a Russian patrol boat in the Black Sea near the occupied town of Zaliznyi Port in Kherson Oblast, killing five crew members.

MOSCOW, October 4. /TASS/. US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff was the "key driving force" behind Donald Trump's plan to resolve the conflict in the Gaza Strip, said Kirill Dmitriev, Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO and special presidential envoy for economic cooperation with other countries.

"President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff was the key driving force behind Trump's Gaza peace plan—built for lasting Middle East peace. Legacy media, led by the New York Times, tried to undermine Witkoff's work—and in doing so, to undermine peace itself," he wrote on the X social media platform.

On September 29, the White House unveiled the US president's comprehensive plan to resolve the Gaza conflict. The proposal includes temporary external administration of the enclave and the deployment of international stabilization forces. Israel accepted the plan.

In the early hours of Saturday, Hamas expressed readiness to release all living Israeli hostages held in the enclave and hand over the bodies. The movement also confirmed its willingness to turn over the responsibility of running Gaza to a Palestinian body of independent technocrat politicians. However, Hamas noted that the remaining points of Trump's plan regarding the future of Gaza should be discussed within a "comprehensive Palestinian national framework.".

Michael Ben'Ary says he was fired based on a social media post by a January 6 conspiracy theorist

A senior national security prosecutor in the eastern district of Virginia said in a farewell note taped to his door to colleagues on Friday that he was apparently fired this week because a January 6 conspiracy theorist denounced him on social media for having worked for the deputy attorney general in the Biden administration.

The veteran federal prosecutor, Michael Ben'Ary, was fired on Wednesday, the same day that Julie Kelly, a pro-Trump commentator who once called a Capitol police officer beaten by the pro-Trump mob on January 6 a “crisis actor”, suggested on social media that Ben'Ary was an ally of his former boss, Lisa Monaco, a senior justice department official who helped drive the investigation of Donald Trump's role in the Capitol riot.

“It appears that my termination was based on little more than a single social media post containing false information,” Ben'Ary wrote. “The leadership is more concerned with punishing the President's perceived enemies than they are with protecting our national security.”

“I am troubled that I was removed so abruptly in the middle of important work,” Ben'Ary wrote, making specific mention of his role in the prosecution of a suspected member of the Islamic State's Afghan branch for planning the deadly suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate entrance to the Kabul airport during the US withdrawal in 2021 which killed 13 American service members and scores of Afghan civilians.

When charges against the suspected orchestrator of the attack were announced in March by Erik Siebert, then interim US attorney, the two assistant US attorneys named to lead the prosecution were Ben'Ary and Troy Edwards. All three career prosecutors are now gone for political reasons.

Siebert was forced out by Donald Trump for declining to bring charges against James Comey, citing a lack of evidence that the former FBI director committed any crime. Edwards, a national security prosecutor and Comey's son-in-law, resigned after the former Trump aide installed to take Siebert's place brought charges against Comey anyway. On Wednesday, Ben'Ary was informed in writing that he had been terminated with immediate effect, shortly after Kelly made a conspiratorial post about him.

“Justice for Americans killed and injured by our enemies should not be contingent on what someone in the Department of Justice sees in their social media feed that day,” Ben'Ary wrote.

In January, the day after Trump returned to office and pardoned all of the Capitol rioters, including those who had attacked police officers, Charlie Kirk revealed on his podcast that Kelly had helped him convince Trump to issue those pardons in a phone call days before Trump's second inaugural.

People with Canadian addresses have on average made up 1.5 per cent of buyers in the Phoenix area since 2007. In the past year, that has dropped to 0.27 per cent.Mario Tama/Getty Images

Canadians do not appear to be getting over it.

When President Donald Trump returned to office with tariffs and declarations of Canada as the 51st state, snowbirds turned tail across the U.S. That was spring, an easy time to head back north.

Now, however, as fall colours signal winter's imminent arrival, new data show little sign of Canadians flocking back to the sunny south for the cold months. 

In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, fully 6 per cent of homes registered to people with Canadian mailing addresses have sold in the past 12 months. Another 2 per cent are for sale, according to data compiled by Mike Orr, owner of The Cromford Report, which analyzes property markets in Arizona.

“What is most extraordinary is the low number of buyers from Canada,” said Mr. Orr. Those numbers have contracted 43 per cent from the previous year, to numbers beneath even pandemic lows. 

Canadian travel companies adapt as clients avoid U.S. travel

Since 2007, people with Canadian addresses have on average made up 1.5 per cent of buyers in the Phoenix area. In the past year, that has fallen to 0.27 per cent, even as numbers of other out-of-state buyers, such as Californians, have held steady. 

The data do not capture Canadians who use a U.S. tax address. Nor do they reflect other U.S. activity by Canadians, including investors and small business owners who, some real estate agents say, appear to be doing the inverse, moving themselves and their money south in increasing number. 

But the virtual disappearance of Canadian vacation home buyers from some of Arizona's most coveted neighbourhoods suggests that the political ruptures of the Trump era have taken an enduring toll. 

“Things have changed for sure. People who have been coming down for a number of years have decided this is a good time to exit, whether it's for a political reason or a financial reason,” said Miles Zimbaluk, a Canadian in Arizona who specializes in cross-border real estate. 

Mr. Zimbaluk moved to Arizona from Saskatchewan a decade ago, and his clientele is almost exclusively Canadian. It wasn't long ago that they were roughly split between buyers and sellers. “Now, pretty much everybody we talk to is selling,” he said. 

“I've had calls from lots of people who said, ‘we want to list it this fall. We'll come back, clean out our personal items, maybe use it for a month or two, and then we want to sell it.'”

Mr. Zimbaluk's experience is reflected at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, where the number of available commercial carrier seats from Canada is down 12 per cent from a year ago. (That decline will be offset by new Porter Airline flights, announced this week, from Ottawa and Vancouver.)

Canadians made three million fewer trips to the U.S. during summer travel boycott

The mood has changed, said Oriana Lehman Wood, who specializes in luxury properties with Russ Lyon Sotheby's International Realty.

She polled 72 of her colleagues from across the U.S. and Canada. Canadian clients, they reported, have taken new interest in Mexico, Costa Rica and Portugal.

“It parallels a lot of what the U.S. buyer is looking at when they look at external purchases,” she said.

Canadians first flocked in large numbers to Arizona in the wake of the great financial crisis, when the loonie rose to par as the U.S. housing market collapsed. In 2009 and 2010, Canadian homebuyers even outnumbered Californians, Mr. Orr said. (In 2010, foreclosures made up 39 per cent of Arizona home transactions.)

Much has changed since then. Arizona home prices have tripled, while the U.S. dollar has considerably strengthened. Canadians who bought 15 years ago have seen enormous gains.

There are, however, signs that at least some of the departed snowbirds are being replaced.

“I do agree, tons of Canadians are leaving,” said Cole Cummins, a real estate agent who moved from Toronto to Naples, Fla., several years ago. 

“But there's way more coming, in my opinion, than there are leaving.”

His clients include small business owners who are giving up on Canada, convinced Florida offers a better place to build wealth and pay less in tax.

“It's not that they like Trump or dislike Mark Carney, or dislike Trudeau – or vice versa. It's more that the policies just cater to them a bit better,” he said.

Time to sell U.S. property? Read this before you list it

Among those still working to move to the U.S. is Safa Ahmed, a real estate agent who lives just outside Hamilton. She has applied for an immigrant visa for unskilled workers. She expects processing to take four or five years. 

Life in Canada has gotten too expensive, she says. She believes the U.S. offers better affordability. She wants “a permanent solution, where I can just start a new life,” she said.

In Arizona, too, Canadian investors have come down in new numbers. Former Vancouver Canucks goaltender Eddie Läck, who is now a real estate agent and homebuilder in the Phoenix area, counts a half-dozen Canadian clients who are buying property to develop and sell. 

The time to build and the return margins “are impossible to get in Canada right now,” he said.

“The people that I talk to believe a whole lot more in the future of the U.S. economy compared to the Canadian, and that's why they're moving money down here,” he added. 

At the same time, some Canadians are reconsidering their decision to pull out, especially with cold temperatures ahead, he said. “We've had multiple conversations with people that want to pull their listings, and come back down and use their place.”

TOKYO, October 4. /TASS/. Japan's former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi has been elected leader of the ruling party in the second round of voting.

Takaichi received 185 out of 341 votes, while her rival, Shinjiro Koizumi, son of ex-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, gained 156 votes.

Takaichi is set to become the next Japanese prime minister after Shigeru Ishiba's resignation, which is expected in the coming days. The reason is that Japan's opposition parties have too many fundamental differences to agree on a single candidate for prime minister.

Takaichi is poised to be the first female prime minister in Japan's history.

Sanae Takaichi was elected president of the Liberal Democratic Party in a runoff vote on Saturday. She is the first female president of the LDP.

Takaichi is poised to be the next prime minister following an election for the post at an extraordinary Diet session likely to be convened on Oct. 15.

After the presidential election, Takaichi said, “Rather than feeling happy, I see really tough road ahead,” and called for cooperation from lawmakers to rebuild the party. She also said, “We will make the LDP a vibrant and energetic party.”

            Pope Leo XIV has adopted a more low-key, less combative style to his predecessor in the early months of his papacy. Pope Francis's openness to the LGBTQ community, advocacy for migrants and critiques of unrestrained capitalism saw him run up against strong conservative opposition inside and outside the church.
    


            Leo, after gently dipping his toe into the US political fray, is now facing criticism from similar quarters to Francis. The opposition is coming from conservative Catholics in the US and MAGA supporters, some of whom, after Leo's election, had hoped he would take the church in a different direction from Pope Francis.
    


            The first American pope was asked on Tuesday about plans by the cardinal in Leo's home city of Chicago to give an award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership. Cardinal Blase Cupich, an ally and friend of the pope, was planning to give Durbin a “Lifetime Achievement Award for support to immigrants,” but the move faced a backlash given Durbin's support for abortion rights. Durbin decided to refuse the honor.
    


            Unusually, around 10 US bishops even spoke out publicly against the award. Two of those who did – Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone and Bishop Thomas Paprocki – were both appointed a religious liberty advisory body by US President Donald Trump and had been at odds with decisions made by Francis.
    


            Rather than condemn the award, Leo said it was important to look at Durbin's “40 years of service in the United States Senate.” The pope then said that it's “not really pro-life” to oppose abortion and support the death penalty, while also questioning whether it was “pro-life” to support the “inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States.”
    


            Leo's comments were immediately criticized. One conservative Catholic described it as “disappointing” and “largely irrelevant”, right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh said it was a “terrible answer from Pope Leo” and Jack Posobiec, an influencer who is supportive of Trump, posted on X simply: “Some popes are a blessing. Some popes are a penance.” Joseph Strickland, the outspoken retired bishop of Tyler, Texas, said Leo's remarks had created “much confusion”.
    


            The day after, however, Leo generated more MAGA opposition when he took part in climate conference where he called for action on protecting the planet and blessed some ice. It all comes during a period when Leo had a private meeting with Reverend James Martin, a leading advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, spoke up against the “pandemic of arms” following the Minnesota school shooting and criticised huge CEO salaries and singling out Elon Musk.



            Is the Chicago-born pontiff positioning his papacy as a counterbalance to the Trump administration? Along with his comments about abortion and immigration, he described Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent speech to generals as “worrying”.
    


            Elise Ann Allen, who recently interviewed Leo for her biography of the pope for her book “Leo XIV: Citizen of the World, Missionary of the XXI Century,” said Leo does not want to be “anti-Trump”.
    


            “He's open to helping and dialoguing with him. He wants to be an interlocutor,” she told CNN. “His remarks are aimed at Catholics and what he's saying is there is a ‘consistent life ethic'. Yes, abortion is wrong but being pro-life respects human dignity in all its forms, whether it concerns the death penalty or immigrants. Being from the United States, Leo is aware that the term ‘pro-life' is often pigeon-holed into abortion.”
    


            For some Catholics abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, while they question Francis' decision to update church teaching and make the death penalty “inadmissible.”
    


            Francis' critics hoped that Leo's distinct style – such as his decision to wear the red mozzetta cape after his election – might signal a course correction.
    


            “Conservative Catholics had hoped that Pope Francis' reforms would follow him into the tomb, that the universal church would view his papacy the way they did, as a bit of bad weather that had finally and thankfully passed,” Michael Sean Winters, a Catholic commentator, wrote in the National Catholic Reporter.
    


            This week they were disappointed. Leo has shown he will, like Francis, try and avoid the culture wars. He doesn't want to fuel any polarization. “They are very complex issues, and I don't know if anyone has all the truth on them,” the Pope pointed out when asked about Durbin's award. Leo will also speak up, when necessary, particularly on the treatment of immigrants, an issue close to his heart from his time as a bishop in Peru. While Leo's aim is to be a peacemaker his intervention this week show he's unafraid to face opposition when drawing lines on where the church stands.

Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in Kirishi, in Russia's Leningrad region, overnight Oct. 4, sparking a fire that was later extinguished, Ukraine's General Staff has said.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing the fire break out at the Kirishi refinery. Regional Governor Alexander Drozdenko confirmed the drone attack and fire but did not identify the facility, adding the fire had been extinguished.

"Air defense forces destroyed seven UAVs in the skies over Kirishi. The fire in the industrial zone has been extinguished," Drozdenko wrote on Telegram.

Video and photos published by Astra, an independent Russian news channel, appeared to show a large explosion and flames rising from the refinery. The strike was later confirmed by the General Staff in a post on social media. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports.

The refinery, more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Ukraine's border, is one of Russia's largest, was only opened in 2017, and accounts for 6.6% of Russia's total oil refining volumes.

It has been targeted at least three other times — in September and March this year and in March 2024.

Ukraine's military claimed responsibility for the September and March 2025 strikes, but has yet to comment on the latest attack.

Just a day earlier, Ukrainian drones targeted a chemical plant in Russia's Perm Krai, briefly disrupting production at one of the country's largest nitrogen fertilizer producers, which also supplies chemicals used in explosives. Separately, Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery in Russia's Orenburg Oblast on the same day.

Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks on Russia's oil industry and other parts of its military-industrial complex over the past year, disrupting operations and worsening a nationwide fuel shortage.

Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries to be legitimate military targets that fund and fuel Moscow's war effort.

"The Russians have not abandoned their intentions to plunge Ukraine into darkness on the eve of the new heating season," Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said. 



The populist Ano party is opposed to Ukraine's membership in the European Union and does not support aid to Ukraine. 

A Russian drone struck the station in the city of Shostka, Sumy Oblast. Passengers and Ukrzaliznytsia workers were on the site at the moment of the attack, according to Zelensky.

Sergiy Kyslytsia warned that Europe needs to "get serious" about the existential threat posed by Russia.



China officially claims neutrality in Russia's war against Ukraine, but has indirectly supported Moscow in several ways.

 The city of Kupiansk has become a focal point of Russia's renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast. After crossing the Oskil River, Russian forces have begun infiltrating Ukrainian lines in small assault groups, while the battlefield becomes increasingly dominated by swarming drones.

Over the decades, Oleksa Shalayskyi became one of Ukraine's leading investigative journalists and is described by his colleagues as a pioneer of anti-corruption investigations.

The Russian missile ship was struck on Lake Onega in the Republic of Karelia at 04:31 a.m. local time on Oct. 4, according to the Special Operations Forces.

Russia launched 109 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as three Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles, the Air Force reported.

Drones struck the Kirishi oil refinery in Russia's Leningrad oblast overnight on Oct. 4, sparking a fire that was later extinguished, officials and local media reported.

"Today, all the rescued children are safe in Ukraine-controlled territory," Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, said.

The number includes 950 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Authorities at Munich International Airport ordered a suspension in flight operations shortly after 9:30 p.m. local time after multiple drones were spotted in the vicinity of the airport for the second time in less than 24 hours.

Former assistant U.S. attorney Cully Stimson joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the violent anti-ICE protests surrounding Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois, and the dispute between federal and local governments on how to stop it.

Federal agents were rammed and boxed in by 10 cars in Broadview, Ill., where anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crowds have been gathering for days, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

"Pritzker's Chicago Police Department is leaving the shooting scene and refuses to assist us in securing the area. There is a growing crowd, and we are deploying special operations to control the scene," McLauglin wrote in a post on X.

DHS said agents were unable to move their vehicles and had to exit. One of the drivers accused of ramming into the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, according to McLaughlin. She said officers "were forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed U.S. citizen."

McLauglin noted the armed woman, who was a U.S. citizen, was named in a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intelligence bulletin. The woman allegedly doxxed agents and posted online, "Hey to all my gang let's f--- those motherf------ up, don't let them take anyone."

No law enforcement officers were seriously injured during the incident, McLaughlin said, adding that the situation is evolving.

The agents were reportedly performing a routine patrol in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, when the alleged assault occurred. 

The ICE processing center in Broadview has become a flashpoint for the protests. On Friday, Fox News witnessed more than a dozen protesters being arrested in the streets near the facility. Local authorities charged at least five people.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Friday that she and her team were blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building, located about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago. Noem said she and her team were stopping for a "quick bathroom break." In the same post on X, Noem slammed Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker "and his cronies."

She also posted a video on Saturday of what appeared to be law enforcement activity. The video was captioned, "Chicago, we're here for you."

Earlier this month, ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz, describing the operation as one that, "will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets."

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin joins ‘Fox News Live' to explain how the Trump spending bill enhances Homeland Security's deportation operations and expands detention capacity.

The Trump administration is now offering teen migrants a $2,500 stipend to leave the United States voluntarily, according to several reports citing a letter sent Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement to shelters housing migrant children.

According to the letter seen by Reuters and other outlets, the department will provide a "one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500" to unaccompanied children 14 or older. 

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not confirm the monetary amount to Fox News Digital but said Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) could access financial support when returning home, should they choose that option.

"Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin," Emily Covington, assistant director of ICE's Office of Public Affairs, said in a statement. She said the offer was first being made to 17-year-olds. 

Covington said that cartels had trafficked countless unaccompanied children into the United States during the Biden Administration, and that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and HHS have been working diligently to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those children.

"Many of these UACs had no choice when they were dangerously smuggled into this country," she said. "ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families."

Minors from Mexico are not eligible for the program, but children who had already volunteered to leave the U.S. as of Friday would be covered, the letter reportedly says.

The Associated Press reported that some immigration advocates had warned of a broader removal campaign they called "Freaky Friday." 

ICE rejected that claim, with Covington calling it "categorically false" and saying the phrase was fabricated to "instill fear and spread misinformation that drives the increased violence occurring against federal law enforcement."

The move is part of President Donald Trump's campaign promise of carrying out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.

ICE DETAINERS IN TOP SANCTUARY CITY HAVE SKYROCKETED UNDER TRUMP COMPARED TO BIDEN'S 4-YEAR TERM: DHS 

Last month, DHS said that two million illegal immigrants "have been removed or have self-deported" from the United States since Jan. 20, putting the Trump administration on pace to break records.

In less than 250 days, an estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants voluntarily self-deported, while 400,000 were removed by federal law enforcement, the DHS said, describing the situation as a "new milestone."

In May, Trump signed an executive order establishing the first-ever self-deportation program that incentivizes illegal migrants to voluntarily leave the country on a free flight and with a cash bonus.

Homeland Security said that migrants were being offered a $1,000 stipend each to leave. The department said it is 70% cheaper for American taxpayers, as it currently costs DHS, on average, over $17,000 to arrest, detain and deport someone.

In June, the State Department moved $250 million to DHS for voluntary deportations.

Shaina Aber, the executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, a nonprofit that provides legal defense to immigrants, said in a statement that the $2,500 stipend undermines due process and may expose children to renewed trafficking cycles.

She said some of these children were trafficked into the U.S., often by cartels or smugglers, and if they are sent back without safeguards, they could fall back into the hands of the same traffickers.

"DHS's message is confusing and seems to fly in the face of established laws and protocols that Congress passed to protect children from cyclical trafficking risks," Aber said.

Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares says a Democratic prosecutor 'failed to do his job' against a transgender sex offender on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said state Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones should abandon his campaign "in disgrace" after he once remarked on shooting a former Virginia House speaker in texts with another lawmaker. 

Texts obtained by Fox News Digital on Friday showed an August 2022 conversation involving Jones — then a recently departed delegate from Norfolk — and Delegate Carrie Coyner, R-Chester. At one point, Jones, referencing then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, wrote: "Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head." 

"This violent, disgusting rhetoric targeted at an elected official and his children is beyond disqualifying," Youngkin wrote in an X post Saturday. "Jay Jones said that ‘Gilbert gets two bullets to the head' and then hoped his children would die. Read those words again." 

"There is no ‘gosh, I'm sorry' here. Jones doesn't have the morality or character to drop out of this race, and his running mates, Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi, and every elected Democrat in Virginia don't have the courage to call on him to step away from this campaign in disgrace," he added.

A spokesperson for Coyner's campaign confirmed the veracity of the texts first reported by National Review, saying they were "disturbing and disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office." 

"Jay Jones wished violence on the children of a colleague and joked about shooting Todd Gilbert. It's disgusting and unbecoming of any public official," the spokesperson said. 

Jones is running against incumbent Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican. 

The Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) also called on Jones to "immediately withdraw" from the race following "his abhorrent text messages."

"There is no place for political violence, including joking about it — especially from an elected official. Jay Jones should drop out of the Attorney General's race. His comments are not acceptable from someone who wants to represent law enforcement," RAGA Chairman Kris Kobach said. 

In a statement released to the media, Jones said, "I take full responsibility for my actions, and I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family."  

"Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry. I have reached out to Speaker Gilbert to apologize directly to him, his wife Jennifer, and their children. I cannot take back what I said; I can only take full accountability and offer my sincere apology," Jones continued.

 "Virginians deserve honest leaders who admit when they are wrong and own up to their mistakes. This was a grave mistake, and I will work every day to prove to the people of Virginia that I will fight for them as Attorney General," he added.

            Virginia's Democratic candidate for attorney general Jay Jones is facing widespread criticism for text messages he sent in 2022 suggesting a colleague should be shot.
    


            In a private exchange between Jones and Republican Virginia Delegate Carrie Coyner, Jones griped about how the then Republican speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert was paying tribute to a former moderate Democratic lawmaker who died, according to screenshots of text messages obtained by CNN.
    


            “Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” the text reads in part, referring to Gilbert and the two dictators.
    


            The National Review first reported the news and reported that Jones tried to call Coyner after she objected to his language. He went on to say in the text messages that Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists” in reference to Gilbert's children, the Review reported.
    


            In a statement to CNN, Jones apologized to Gilbert and voiced regret for the text messages.
    


            “I take full responsibility for my actions, and I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family. Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry,” he said.
    


            “I have reached out to Speaker Gilbert to apologize directly to him, his wife Jennifer, and their children. I cannot take back what I said; I can only take full accountability and offer my sincere apology. Virginians deserve honest leaders who admit when they are wrong and own up to their mistakes. This was a grave mistake and I will work every day to prove to the people of Virginia that I will fight for them as Attorney General,” the statement reads.
    


            He reiterated those apologies in a local television interview with WRIC and told the outlet he would remain in the contest.
    


            Coyner condemned Jones' messages in a statement to CNN on Saturday.
    


            “What he said was not just disturbing but disqualifying for anyone who wants to seek public office. Jay Jones wished violence on the children of a colleague and talked about shooting Todd Gilbert. It's disgusting and unbecoming of any public official,” Coyner said.
    


            Jones was objecting to tributes of deceased former state legislator Joe Johnson Jr., who was a longtime moderate Democrat, the Review reported. Jones was no longer a member of the Virginia House of Delegates at the time of the messages.
    


            The Republican Attorneys General Association is calling for Jones to drop out of the race against incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and created a website, ‘jayjonestexts.com,' with screenshots of the messages. And a host of top state Republicans including Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Lieutenant Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running for governor, denounced Jones. He's also facing intense criticism over the texts from fellow Democrats.
    


            In a late night social media post Democratic US Sen. Mark Warner wrote in part that, “the comments attributed to Jay Jones are appalling, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the person I've known.”
    


            And Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger is also distancing herself from Jones in a statement that reads in part, “After learning of these comments earlier today, I spoke frankly with Jay about my disgust with what he had said and texted. I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words,” she said.
    


            There is heightened sensitivity towards language that leans into political violence in the wake of the assignation of Republican activist Charlie Kirk and the politically motivated execution of Democratic Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman in their home earlier this year.
    


            Polling indicated a tight race before the text messages surfaced. Jones lead  Miyares by six points, 51 percent to 45 percent, among likely voters, according to polling from the Washington Post and Schar School.  That's not statistically significant since the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.
    


            Early voting for Virginia's statewide races in November is underway.

Mac Jones found himself in a spooky situation Thursday before helping the San Francisco 49ers to an overtime win.

Jones got the start as Brock Purdy continues to deal with an injury, and the Niners earned a 26-23 win over the Los Angeles Rams on the road.

But before heading to the stadium, Jones reportedly witnessed a dead body floating in the water outside the team's hotel in Marina del Rey, California.

"That morning at the team hotel in Marina del Rey, Jones told teammates he was on his balcony when he looked out at the water and saw a floating dead body," The Athletic reported. "Someone called the police. As the 49ers loaded buses for the stadium, players watched investigators and even a coroner's van pull into the marina," 

The Athletic added that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the incident was still under investigation Friday afternoon.

Despite the scary sight, Jones clearly was unfazed. He finished 33-of-49 with 342 passing yards and two touchdown passes as his resurgence continued. He started the game with a touchdown pass to Jake Tonges and followed it up with a touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey.

The 49ers moved up the field in the overtime period and got close enough for Eddy Pineiro to attempt a field goal. He hit the 41-yarder off the post and through the uprights with 5:51 to go in overtime.

The Rams moved down the field, but they stuffed Kyren Williams on fourth-and-1 to preserve the victory.

            • Shutdown, day 4: Lawmakers left Washington for the weekend appearing no closer to a deal to fund the federal government. Democrats are at an impasse with Republicans and President Donald Trump over enhanced Obamacare subsidies. With no votes expected over the weekend, the shutdown will drag into next week.
    


            • Firings loom: Agencies and activities deemed essential are still open, but many employees will be working without a paycheck, and the Trump administration has signaled thousands of government layoffs could begin soon.
    


            • Impact around the country: Federal workers are spread across the US, with many living far from Washington. Americans tell CNN they're starting to feel the impacts on everyday life. Is the shutdown affecting you? Tell us about it.



            As the government shutdown continues with no end in sight, a food bank in Washington, DC, is gearing up to help additional people in need who may have been furloughed or are working without pay.
    


            The Capital Area Food Bank is keeping its warehouse stocked, as it estimates around 75,000 federal workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, according to CNN affiliate WJLA.
    


                    “We anticipate, if this goes on for a little while, we'll see many of those households be in need of extra support from us,” the food bank's CEO, Radha Muthiah, told WJLA. “Those are the households we are really gearing up to be able to support.”
                





            And the shutdown's impacts stretch well beyond Washington. In Iowa, food banks are similarly preparing for possible increase in demand.
    


            Patty Sneddon-Kisting, CEO of the Urbandale Food Pantry, told CNN affiliate KCCI that she predicts the food bank will serve more people in the coming days.
    


                    “We typically try to increase our food orders, cross-check inventories and bring on more products, source more food just to make sure we have enough available to meet the need of the community and the families that are coming to see us,” Sneddon-Kisting told KCCI. 
                





            About 80% of federal employees work outside the Washington metropolitan area.
    


            Outside the halls of the Capitol and far from Washington, the way a government shutdown affects life in the US can range from minor inconvenience to serious concern.
    


            It might be as simple as a trip to the museum thwarted, or finding that national parks are either closed or unstaffed.
    


            In communities where federal workers make up a significant portion of the economy — like in Atlanta or Dayton, Ohio — small business owners are watching anxiously to see if they'll receive fewer customers while furloughed employees go without a paycheck.
    


            Federal funding for WIC, the food assistance program for low-income women, infants and young children, could run out within one to two weeks if Congress doesn't allocate more money.
    


What are your top concerns about the federal government shutdown? Share your story in the form below:



CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.



            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he and fellow Democrats are committed to extending the shutdown until they and Republicans can reach a deal to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.
    


            “Our fight is to make sure we continue to stand up to address the Republican health care crisis,” Jeffries told MSNBC today. “Democrats are not going to break because we're standing up for the health care of working-class Americans, middle class Americans and everyday Americans.”
    


            But Jeffries said high-level talks between both sides “are not” happening “at this moment.”
    


            “The White House and Republicans have gone radio silent since the Oval Office meeting on Monday,” Jeffries said. “It's because they wanted to shut the government down, and they don't want to provide health care to everyday Americans.”
    


            Jeffries condemned what he sees as Trump and Republicans using “hardworking, federal civil servants” as expendable “pawns” because they face potential mass layoffs due to the shutdown.
    


            “(The Trump administration has) been engaging in mass firing since January 20… And so, to the extent that they're claiming that a government shutdown may force their hand, that's just pretext for something that they've already been doing,” Jeffries said. “This is why it's important for us as Democrats to continue to hold the line on behalf of the American people while also making it clear we'll sit down with the Republicans.”
    


            “This administration is trying to bully us, and we're not going to be bullied,” he added.
    


            Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware says he hopes lawmakers strike a deal ending the government shutdown soon, but that GOP compromise on health care policy would have to be part of those negotiations.
    


            In an interview on CNN's “Smerconish,” the senator acknowledged that a months-long standoff could benefit Democrats politically but said the consequences for Americans and the US health care system would be devastating.
    


                    “I don't want to wait until those hospitals close … I want us to have a focused conversation this week that will hopefully put us on a path toward negotiating a resolution,” Coons said.
                





            Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona slammed House Speaker Mike Johnson this morning, saying on MSNBC's “The Weekend” that Republican leadership doesn't actually want to negotiate.
    


            “I'm here in Washington, DC. I'm ready to sit down with my Republican colleagues. Many of them left,” he said.
    


            Kelly called for “real negotation” around extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which is the central sticking point for a funding deal. Kelly said the issue is highly personal for his constituents:
    


                    “We could wind up in a situation in Arizona where 109,000 people lose their health insurance. That means they are one accident or one illness away, maybe with a kid, and now they're bankrupt because they're not going to let their kid go without health care.”
                





            Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also spoke to MSNBC this morning, where she blamed the White House for holding up real talks:
    


                    “We want them to come to the table and work with us. Behind closed doors or publicly, some Republican senators have signaled they're open to it. But Donald Trump is treating it as a joke.”
                





            Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia says protecting access to health care for her constituents is her top concern as the party digs in to a funding standoff with Republicans.
    


                    “What I have heard consistently across the board is: ‘Don't give up on fighting for our health care,'” Williams said during an interview today on CNN's “First of All with Victor Blackwell.”
                





            Williams said residents in her district, which includes a large portion of Atlanta, had already been feeling the impact of President Donald Trump's efforts to massively shrink the federal government since his inauguration.
    


            “People in Atlanta — at the CDC, at the EPA, at the Veterans Affairs Administration, at the airport — they've been faced with these layoffs and this threat of what is going to happen,” she told CNN.
    


                    “What I'm hearing across the board is a plea: ‘Please continue to stand up to this administration that is holding the American people hostage with their takeover and lack of compassion for what is happening in this country.'”
                





            A growing number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill say they will forgo their paychecks until federal operations continue. Some lawmakers are saying they will donate their salaries, while others have formally requested that their pay be withheld.
    


            “If a shutdown forces servicemembers and veterans to go without pay… members of Congress should not be collecting a paycheck,” said Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks in a statement.
    


            Among those announcing plans to give up their salaries are Republican Sen. Ashley Moody and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Mike Lawler and John James. Several Democrats have also said they will withhold their pay during the shutdown, including Sen. Andy Kim and Reps. Josh Gottheimer, Nellie Pou, and Mikie Sherrill.
    


            Moody said she would donate her salary to the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay.
    


            Lawler requested his salary be withheld in a letter to the House Chief Administrative Office.
    


            “If our partners in the Senate are incapable of finding their senses and passing a clean Continuing Resolution… then no member of the House or Senate should receive a salary,” Lawler wrote. “We were not sent here to play partisan politics.”
    


            Most rank-and-file members of Congress earn $174,000 annually, while those in top leadership positions are paid more.
    


            Republican Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt defended the White House's decision to withhold funding for New York City infrastructure projects amid the government shutdown.
    


            “My understanding is that those are unconstitutional programs. They violate, because of DEI programs, the Civil Rights Act,” Schmitt told CNN yesterday on Capitol Hill. “So, I think they're taking a closer look at a lot of these Biden-era contracts, and I would expect more of that. I mean, when you shut down the government like the Democrats have, there's going to be consequences. It's needless. It's stupid.”
    


            His comments come after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced that the Trump administration is freezing roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects.
    


            Vought said the funds will be “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion policies. The Trump administration has focused on dismantling programs considered to promote DEI initiatives since President Donald Trump returned to office.
    


            Vought's announcement received pushback from New York officials, with Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand calling the hold “just spiteful and political and probably illegal.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Vought of using New York and New Jersey residents as political pawns.
    


            We were in Dayton, Ohio, yesterday talking to residents about the way the ripple effects of the shutdown are being felt by average Americans.
    


Howard Patterson, a 44-year-old DHL worker, had hoped to visit the National Museum of the US Air Force and the Wright Cycle Company on his day off, but found the doors to both centers closed due to the shutdown.
    


                    “I'm not political, and it's affecting what we do,” he said. “My family is more Democratic, but right now I kind of blame Democrats, because that's who we're waiting on.”
                





Toyoua Jackson, a 39-year-old factory worker in Dayton, blamed President Donald Trump for the shutdown. She pointed to GOP cuts to health care spending.
    


                    “He needs to do things different,” she said. “He's taking from the people that don't have.”
                





Tierra Freeman, the 23-year-old manager of the Fashion Remedy Boutique in Dayton, said when military members start not receiving paychecks and other federal workers are furloughed, she worries her newly opened business will feel the effects.
    


                    “You can tell when people get their checks, because that's when they're in the shop,” she said.
                





Daniella Martinez, 35, is set to start a new job Monday after being laid off when her previous employer, a company that handled moves for military members, lost its government contract.
    


                    “I think with an incompetent president and the rest of his lackeys running Congress and the other branches, that it was an inevitable possibility,” Martinez said of the shutdown. However, she was also frustrated with Democrats, and said the shutdown is “everybody's fault.”
                





            Much of the attention during a government shutdown naturally centers on the nation's capital, where lawmakers negotiate stopgap funding bills and employees at major federal agencies face uncertainty at work.
    


            But it's worth keeping in mind that many federal workers clock in for government jobs far from the DC area:
    


            Welcome to our live coverage. It's a new day but the same state of affairs, so far.
    


            The government shutdown looks very likely to stretch into next week after competing Democratic and Republican proposals to fund the government failed again in the Senate yesterday afternoon.
    


            Lawmakers have left Washington, with no votes planned over the weekend as of now.
    


Here's a look at all that happened yesterday and where things stand moving forward:



            Over the past few days of live coverage, we've told you how Republican lawmakers remain publicly in lockstep with President Donald Trump, who has signaled he's ready to dig in his heels in the shutdown stalemate with Democrats.
    


            But privately, there are concerns within Trump's orbit that the politics of the shutdown may prove more complicated than they initially hoped, according to new reporting from our CNN colleagues Adam Cancryn and Sarah Ferris.
    


            Democrats are still largely unified behind their demands, defying some Republicans' predictions they would quickly fold under pressure. In early polling, Americans are just as likely to fault Trump as they are congressional Democrats.
    


            And as the White House prepares a wave of retaliatory mass layoffs, there's little certainty over how Trump's efforts to ramp up the pressure will play with the broader public.
    


            “I'm supposed to say this is killing the Democrats,” one Trump adviser said of the shutdown. “But I don't think it helps either side, to be honest with you.”
    


            The mixed reaction has appeared to alleviate political pressure felt by Democrats to quickly seek an off-ramp, with some lawmakers instead beginning to broaden their messaging beyond the party's initial set of health care demands.

            The Smithsonian says its museums, research centers and the National Zoo will remain open through at least October 11 despite the ongoing government shutdown.
    


            Previously, officials said the centers would be open through Monday.

"Countdown" star Eric Dane told Fox News Digital that hes taking his disease day by day.

What was meant to be a special night at the Emmy Awards turned into a hospital visit for actor Eric Dane.

The 52-year-old "Grey's Anatomy" star, who revealed earlier this year that he is battling ALS, said in a new interview that he was hospitalized the night of the Emmys after falling in his kitchen. 

"ALS is a nasty disease. … So I was in the hospital during the Emmys getting stitches put in my head," Dane told The Washington Post.

The actor had been slated to present at the awards ceremony, which took place in September. He and fellow "Grey's Anatomy" alum Jesse Williams were scheduled to appear together to mark the show's 20th anniversary, but Williams ended up presenting the award for outstanding directing for a drama series alone.

"I missed an opportunity I was really looking forward to. It would have been great to see Jesse and get reunited with some of my peers, and to be able to present in front of my colleagues I thought would have been a special moment," Dane said."I was really upset about it, but you know, there was nothing I could do about it," he added.

Dane announced in April 2025 that he was battling ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons — the nerve cells in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

As the actor continues to battle the disease, his wife, actress Rebecca Gayheart, recently shared how their family is coping.

In an interview with People, Gayheart, 54, spoke about the emotional toll on her and the couple's daughters — Billie, 15 and Georgia, 13."We have some professional therapists who are helping us, and we're just trying to have some hope and do it with dignity, grace and love," the "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" star shared.

"I mean, it's heartbreaking. My girls are really suffering, and we're just trying to get through it. It's a tough time," Gayheart said.

Dane originally broke the news of his ALS diagnosis in an emotional statement to People.

"I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter," he said. "I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time."

The "Euphoria" actor's announcement came after Gayheart filed to dismiss her 2018 divorce petition in March 2025 — one month before he went public with his diagnosis.

The couple, who wedded in 2004 after a year of dating, had previously split over "irreconcilable differences."

During her recent interview with People, Gayheart admitted she has struggled to stay positive amid Dane's health challenges.

"I don't think I'm at a place yet where I can pull out a positive nugget. I'm not there yet," she said.

Gayheart continued, "I mean, we're definitely dealing with something that has brought us all together, and Eric will always be my family, whether we're married or not, or living in the same house or not, but yeah, we are closer, but we don't like the reason why."

Buffalo Bills fans have long wondered why they're often excluded from the "New York sports" conversation, but they may now have their answer.

The "New York sports" list has normally been composed of the New York Yankees, Mets, Rangers, Islanders, Giants, Jets, Knicks, New Jersey Devils and Brooklyn Nets - yes, even a team on the other side of the Hudson River would be in that conversation.

But the Devils play in Newark, which is well within the New York metro area. Buffalo, on the other hand, is a roughly six-hour drive to Midtown Manhattan.

Well, the Bills showed their true colors on Friday by wishing "good luck" to their "friends up north" in the Toronto Blue Jays, who match up against the Yankees in the American League Division Series.

"Yeah don't call yourself a New York team again," wrote one X user.

Even pro tennis player Jessica Pegula, whose parents own the team, was shocked.

"Ohhh???" she wrote.

"This is blasphemous," added Gary Sheffield Jr.

"Shouldn't we root for teams that actually play in the great state of New York?" wrote another user. "It's the National Football League... National to America. The United States. There's not even an NFL team in Canada."

The Blue Jays, however, replied by posting a photo of Josh Allen in a Blue Jays jersey.

Since the Montreal Expos left after the 2005 season, the Blue Jays remain the only MLB team in Canada. They won the AL East over the Yankees due to the tiebreaker of head-to-head matchups in the regular season.

Child safety advocate Callahan Walsh warns sextortion schemes targeting teen boys are surging and devastating families nationwide.

DENVER - The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) is sounding the alarm over a surge in financial sextortion schemes that are targeting teenage boys at unprecedented levels, often with devastating consequences.

Callahan Walsh, son of child safety advocates John and Revé Walsh and a key leader at NCMEC, says the surge in cases is unlike anything they've seen.

"We saw a massive shift in sextortion after COVID," Walsh told Fox News Digital. "Teenage boys were now being targeted at a much higher rate for financial gain, often by overseas criminal enterprises."

These predators often pose as peers on gaming platforms and social media apps, Walsh explained, luring boys into sharing explicit images. The second a photo is sent, the blackmail begins.

"The threat is real and it's relentless. The message is: pay up or we expose you to your school, your family, your entire online world," Walsh said.

During a Sept. 16 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., emphasized the urgency of addressing sextortion and online exploitation of minors, calling it a crisis that demands a more "targeted approach."

"We need answers. I want to talk about child sexual exploitation," Britt said, thanking FBI Director Kash Patel for making child protection a top priority. "We know that that is the greatest gift that we have. That is our greatest treasure here in the United States — the next generation. And finally, we have an FBI director that is putting that at the top of his list."

Britt, who noted she is raising teenagers herself, described the toll sextortion is taking on American families. "I have had a number of parents sit in front of me telling me terrible, heartbreaking stories about their children ultimately taking their own life because of being blackmailed," she said. 

Patel acknowledged the severity of the problem. "That is a problem that we are seeing explode on generative AI and private sector and social media companies," he testified.

Citing alarming data from the NCMEC, Patel warned: "They have seen a 1,325% increase in generative AI leading to sextortion and child sexual abuse."

The FBI, Patel said, has stepped up its response through operations under its Violent Crimes Against Children initiative, noting that agents had arrested 1,500 child predators and 300 human traffickers, while identifying and saving 4,700 children in the past year.

"We arrested 400 individuals in one month," he added, calling it evidence of "a mission that our agents and intel analysts have never left."

NCMEC, founded after the 1981 abduction and murder of 6-year-old Adam Walsh, now runs the nation's CyberTipline, which received over 36 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation in 2023 alone.

"Obviously, our number one goal is to analyze those reports, try to find out who are these children that are being exploited and fight back against it, and recover those children and find the perpetrator," Walsh continued. 

FBI REVEALS 1.3M CRIMES AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. A NIGHTMARE OF VIOLENCE AWAITS OUR KIDS

The organization is currently working on approximately 30,000 active missing-child cases, a scale Walsh says requires cutting-edge tools, robust data analysis, and unwavering public support.

"We've helped recover over 480,000 missing children since our inception," he said. 

Founded in a Florida garage with "a card table and a landline," NCMEC, which was originally named "The Adam Walsh Center," now leverages high-tech tools like digital billboards, social media campaigns, genetic genealogy, and real-time analytics to help law enforcement identify and locate missing children faster than ever before.

"DNA is the fingerprint of the 21st century… and it's revolutionizing the way we find missing kids," Walsh noted.

One of NCMEC's current battles isn't just against predators – it's against misinformation.

"You do not have to wait 24 hours to report a missing child. Call law enforcement immediately," Walsh emphasized.

He also urges the public to rethink how they talk about "runaways."

"That label can hide grooming or abuse. These kids may be in the custody of a predator and those cases deserve to be taken seriously."

The organization relies on both federal funding and private donations, but Walsh emphasized that greater action is needed from lawmakers and technology platforms.

"We need the tech industry and Congress to keep the lights on," he said. "These aren't just statistics – they're kids, families, and futures on the line."

Still, Patel cautioned that law enforcement alone cannot solve the problem. "That cannot be countermanded by the FBI alone," he said. "We need help from social media companies. We need help from the private sector and the internet service providers that allow this generative AI to be hosted on their platforms. We have got to get a resolution on that with our partners in Congress, in the private sector."

Britt pledged to continue working with the FBI and her Senate colleagues to bring an end to sextortion, framing it as a national emergency requiring coordination, urgency, and new tools. 

"What are you doing to protect children and specifically sextortion?" she demanded, underscoring the hearing's central question.

Walsh, who now co-hosts "America's Most Wanted" with his father, says the pain of his brother Adam's loss continues to drive NCMEC's mission.

"We always said we need to make sure Adam didn't die in vain. And if his song is to continue that, we must do the singing. We try to do that every day," Walsh said about keeping his brother's legacy alive. 

"Adam's disappearance changed the way we look for and protect children in America," he continued. "Every child deserves a safe childhood."

When asked about his goals for the coming years, Walsh smiled and said he hoped to one day be out of a job.

"I would love to say every missing child's been found. There's not going to be any more missing children. And we've eradicated exploitation online. That's our goal," Walsh shared. "We want to put ourselves out of a job. Unfortunately, we're not there yet, and I don't know if that's going to happen in 5 or 10 years, but we're trying, and we really look towards the tech industry to help us with that."

TOKYO (AP) — Japan's governing party on Saturday elected former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, a hard-line ultra-conservative and China hawk, as its new leader, making her likely to become the country's first female prime minister.

In a country that ranks poorly internationally for gender equality, the 64-year-old Takaichi makes history as the first female leader of Japan's long-governing conservative Liberal Democratic Party. Takaichi is one of the most conservative members of the male-dominated party.

An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is a protege of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ‘s ultra-conservative vision and a regular at the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of Japan's wartime militarism, which could complicate Tokyo's relations with its Asian neighbors.

Takaichi beat Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, in a runoff in a vote by the LDP on Saturday. 

Takaichi replaces Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba as the party hopes to regain public support and stay in power after major election losses. 

She is likely to be Japan's next prime minister because the party remains by far the largest in the lower house, which determines the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.

”Now that the LDP has its first female president, its scenery will change a little,” Takaichi said as she tried out the president's chair.




Takaichi later said she will immediately work on stemming rising prices, while also focusing on diplomatic and security challenges. 

A parliamentary vote is expected in mid-October. The LDP, which has been criticized by opposition leaders for creating a prolonged political vacuum, said Takaichi needs to hurry because the winner will soon face a diplomatic test: a possible summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who could demand that Japan increase its defense spending.

A meeting is reportedly being planned for late October. Trump will travel to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea starting Oct. 31.

Takaichi said ensuring the Japan-U.S. alliance is her top diplomatic priority.

“It is essential to ... confirm the reinforcement of the Japan-U.S. alliance,” she said. Takaichi stressed the importance of their cooperation through three-way frameworks that also include regional partners such as South Korea, Australia and the Philippines, pledging Japan's greater role in achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific. 

She said she respects all tariffs and investment agreements struck between Tokyo and Washington under the Ishiba government. 

The LDP, whose consecutive losses in parliamentary elections in the past year have left it in the minority in both houses, needs its new leader to quickly bring back voter confidence and stability and to address challenges in and outside Japan. Takaichi will also need cooperation from key opposition groups to implement her party's policies.

Ishiba, who achieved a 15% tariff deal with Washington and put Japan's ties with South Korea and other Asian countries on track during his one-year stint, said “I hope the LDP will band together under new (party) president Takaichi to serve for the country and the people, as well as the world and for the new era.” 

Ishiba, a centrist known as archrival of Abe, was virtually forced into resigning by ultra-conservative wings in the party.

Five candidates — two currently serving and three former ministers — vied for the LDP presidency.

Saturday's vote only involved 295 LDP parliamentarians and about 1 million dues-paying members. It only reflected 1% of the Japanese public.

The LDP's choice of Takaichi, instead of the more centrist-to-liberal Koizumi, apparently underscores the party's hope to win back conservative voters who supported emerging far-right groups such as Sanseito in the July parliamentary election.

But the LDP also needs help from the opposition, which it has long neglected. The party will likely look to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito with at least one of the key opposition parties, which are more centrist.

Takaichi like other candidates called herself a “moderate conservative” during the run-up to the election to show their willingness to work with the opposition and stayed away from stressing her opposition to liberal social issues or anti-China policies.

Takaichi on Saturday said the Yasukuni issue should not be a diplomatic issue and that she will think about how she can “pay respect to the war dead and pray for peace.”

She supports bigger fiscal spending for growth, a stronger military and cybersecurity, as well as tougher regulations on increasing foreign tourists and laborers. She was criticized for citing unconfirmed reports to slam foreigners for kicking deer in Nara, her hometown, and saying many foreign law offenders escaped indictments due to a shortage of translators.

Experts say candidates avoided discussing their usual political views on historical issues, same-sex marriage and other contentious topics, including the party's political funds scandal, which was the biggest reason for their election losses, and anti-corruption measures. Their avoidance of these subjects raised doubts over the party's ability to regain public trust, analysts said.

Voters in downtown Tokyo said they hoped that Takaichi, as first female leader, will bring changes.

“I do have expectations,” said Masami Nakagawa, though he expressed concern about her past nationalist comments. “I'm hopeful that she'll develop a stronger sense of balance once she becomes prime minister.”

BOSTON (AP) — Over a span of a month this summer, four separate federal courts rejected President Donald Trump's executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of people in the country illegally or temporarily. 

On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different.

A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that the Republican president cannot enforce the order. The court joined the four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue. 

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.




The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily — and by extension, their children — cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats — both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority — were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration. 

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order's February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said. 

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

“The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,” Chief Judge David Barron wrote. “It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.”

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to “being vindicated by the Supreme Court.”

To enforce the order, government officials would need to confirm parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers. Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.

            The gathering was inside the Brooklyn home of a Jewish film director. The crowd, according to several people in attendance, was skeptical.
    


Zohran Mamdani had arrived to greet approximately 60 people, at least half of them Modern Orthodox, who for the most part are more religiously observant than the progressives in Mamdani's base.
    


            Some guests, according to sources who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss the private mid-August event, wondered if a potential Mamdani administration would stop dispatching the New York Police Department to stand watch at synagogues when needed. Mamdani, without hesitation, said he would provide the security.
    


            One of the attendees told him that their friend, a Jewish woman, had recently been harassed and called a slur while pushing a stroller down a city street.
    


            Mamdani told them he was sorry about what they had experienced and said he believed it wasn't helpful to either the Israeli or Palestinian causes if people supporting either side felt like they couldn't walk outside without fear.
    


            And while he reaffirmed his support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting the Israeli government and economy, Mamdani also promised he would keep in place police protection for the city's annual parade honoring Israel.
    


            “It's obvious that he grew up around Jews and that he is comfortable, he can crack a culturally relevant joke, he recognizes people in the crowd,” said one person who attended the gathering.
    


            Mamdani is both a prominent and unapologetic critic of Israel as well as the front-runner to be the next mayor of New York, home to the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. Ever since his stunning victory in June's Democratic primary, Mamdani has built alliances with politically liberal Jewish officials while meeting with and listening to some of his most strident critics.
    


            Among some Jewish New Yorkers already on edge from the spike in antisemitism and attacks in recent years, fears highlighted by a deadly attack Thursday on a British synagogue, some of Mamdani's positions and perceived lack of sensitivity to their concerns have bred suspicion and anxiety.
    


            Those feelings cut across lines of age, religiosity and geography, even among otherwise committed progressive voters, and persist even as he has emphasized his commitment to fighting antisemitism. Facing pressure and persistent media questions, Mamdani has condemned Hamas and discouraged use of the phrase “globalize the intifada.”
    


            “Jewish New Yorkers are by no means a monolith, and Zohran has made clear that he's eager to meet with every part of the Jewish community, whether they disagree with him or helped power him to victory in the primary,” said Jeffrey Lerner, a campaign spokesperson, in a statement to CNN.
    


            In recent months, Mamdani has visited synagogues and sat for Friday evening Shabbat services. His campaign receives informal advice from some of the more progressive Jewish groups in the city. But he also in recent weeks met with Hasidic leaders, including two prominent rabbis from Williamsburg's Satmar community, an ultra-Orthodox sect with its own set of demands of city government.
    


            During Rosh Hashanah, Mamdani attended service at Kolot Chayeinu, one of Brooklyn's most progressive synagogues. For Yom Kippur, considered the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Mamdani attended service at Lab Shul, a non-denominational Jewish congregation. He was accompanied by Rep. Jerry Nadler and City Comptroller Brad Lander, both prominent Jewish politicians in New York who have endorsed Mamdani.
    


            Mamdani received loud applause, according to three people in attendance, as he was seated in the front row while Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie delivered the sermon.
    


            But one thing is consistent: There is a general skittishness even from left-leaning groups about publicly admitting they have hosted Mamdani. Some synagogues have welcomed him but have not wanted to publicize it. None of the mainstream Jewish organizations who met with Mamdani would disclose details about their meetings on the record.
    


            Phylisa Wisdom, executive director of the New York Jewish Agenda, a nonpartisan advocacy organization that has met with Mamdani, said there is no “single Jewish feeling about this candidate.”
    


            “The divisions are increasingly painful for us, but the fact that we would have voted for different candidates is not new for us,” Wisdom said. “Should he be mayor, which polls suggest is a very likely outcome, I would encourage him to continue to reach out to all parts of New York's Jewish community and also encourage all parts of our community to be receptive to meeting with him.
    


            “It's best for us all if he has a real familiarity with the full diversity of our community,” she added.
    


            For some, Mamdani's visits, meetings and private conversations are evidence he has worked to deliver on a promise he made on primary night when he told the crowd he would work to “understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.”
    


            But for others, Mamdani has fallen short, not doing enough to publicly assure the Jewish community that he is committed to their safety and well-being if elected mayor. They argue Mamdani has only met with audiences who are most likely to be friendly, which his campaign disputes.
    


            At the Brooklyn meeting, people wanted to know if Mamdani planned on holding his future top hires to ideological litmus tests. He responded by telling them he did not care if his future sanitation commissioner – or any other bureaucrat – disagreed with him on Israel.
    


            Instead, he said, he planned to hire whoever would be the best person to oversee pickup   of the 44 million pounds of waste the city produces every day.
    


            While no sitting New York City mayor has an explicit role in foreign policy, Israel remains a constant theme in the mayoral race. The conversation has become even more focused in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks and Israel's subsequent offensive in Gaza.
    


            Mamdani, a Muslim who was born in Uganda to parents of Indian origin, has called Israel's offensive a genocide and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces a warrant from the International Criminal Court, should be arrested.
    


            Democrats and younger Americans across the political spectrum have grown more negative toward the Jewish state, even as support for Israel remains key for many Jewish voters.

            Some of Mamdani's Jewish critics also point to his agenda and connections to the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani wants to raise taxes on the rich and freeze rent hikes in city-stabilized apartments, a challenge to the real-estate industry, though several prominent developers and investors who oppose him cite his positions on Israel and antisemitism.
    


            Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau last month convened a meeting of real-estate leaders to hear from Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the June primary and is now running as an independent.
    


            During a different private meeting, a prominent CEO grilled Mamdani over his defense of the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which Mamdani has not himself used and has since said he would discourage others from using.
    


            Since Mayor Eric Adams announced he was dropping his re-election bid, Cuomo has ramped up his efforts to court the city's Orthodox Jewish community, which was seen as largely supportive of Adams.
    


            In a video posted to social media, Cuomo issued an apology for his response during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic when he was governor. In the video, posted on the eve of Yom Kippur, Cuomo said he regretted placing limits on the size of religious gatherings during the pandemic. Orthodox communities interpreted those limits as unfairly singling them out.
    


            Days earlier, Cuomo had secured the endorsement of a Crown Heights Jewish group representing Orthodox communities.
    


            Cuomo has long aligned himself with pro-Israel groups. Last year Cuomo said he was joining a legal defense team for Netanyahu. During the primary, Cuomo was critical of Mamdani's support for the BDS movement, pressing him multiple times during a primary debate about whether Israel should exist as a Jewish state. Mamdani has said Israel should provide equal rights to all residents.
    


            But Cuomo himself has pivoted since losing the primary,  calling for an end to the war in Gaza while continuing to accuse Mamdani of fueling antisemitism.
    


            “I think this whole thing speaks more about the psychology of the American Jewry and their organizations right now than (Mamdani),” said a board member of a prominent national organization that does not endorse in local elections but recently met with Mamdani. “His position is a winning one and it could be like a canary in a coal mine that this is going to play out even more in national politics, and it won't be comfortable.”

Iran reportedly executed six prisoners Saturday who the regime claimed carried out deadly attacks in the country's oil-rich southwest on behalf of Israel, marking the latest surge in executions that rights groups say have reached levels unseen in decades.

The six executions were reported by The Associated Press, as well as Iranian news agency Mizan. 

A seventh prisoner, accused of killing a Sunni cleric in 2009, along with other crimes, was executed in Kurdistan province. 

Saturday's executions follow the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June, which ended with Tehran vowing it would target its enemies at home and abroad.

According to Amnesty International, Iranian authorities have executed more than 1,000 people so far in 2025, the highest annual figure recorded by the group in at least 15 years.

Iran said the six men linked to Israel killed police officers and security forces, as well as orchestrated bombings targeting sites around Khorramshahr in Iran's restive Khuzestan province. Iranian state television aired footage of one of the men talking about the attacks, saying it was the first time the details were being made public.

A Kurdish group called the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights said the six were actually Arab political prisoners who had been arrested during the 2019 protests. Hengaw said Iran accused them of having links to the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz, a separatist group blamed for pipeline bombings and other attacks in the region.

IRAN RAMPS UP STATE EXECUTIONS AMID NUCLEAR TALKS WITH US

The seventh prisoner, Saman Mohammadi Khiyareh, a Kurd, was convicted over the 2009 assassination of Mamousta Sheikh al-Islam, a pro-government Sunni cleric in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj.

Activists have questioned Khiyareh's case, noting he was only 15 or 16 at the time of the assassination, was arrested at 19 and was held for more than a decade before his execution. His conviction, they said, relied on confessions extracted under torture — a practice activists accuse Iranian courts of using regularly.

The number of state executions has drastically escalated since President Massoud Pezeshkian took office in July 2024. At least 975 people were executed in 2024, according to figures from the United Nations. Pezeshkian answers to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority in the country.

Iran has been putting prisoners to death at a pace unseen since 1988, when it executed thousands at the end of the Iran-Iraq war.

Independent U.N. human rights experts have sounded the alarm about the sheer number of executions, calling it "a dramatic escalation that violates international human rights law," according to a recent press release from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

"With an average of more than nine hangings per day in recent weeks, Iran appears to be conducting executions at an industrial scale that defies all accepted standards of human rights protection," the body said.

Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Saturday offered a cautious welcome to Hamas' response to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to stop the war in the coastal enclave.

Relatives of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza called Saturday for the Israeli public to “stand firm” against “saboteurs” who might try to scuttle a possible deal to return them.

A Hamas official on Friday said the group accepted parts of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to end the war in Gaza but it would refuse foreign administration of the Strip and that the entry of foreign forces would be “unacceptable.”

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli bombing of Gaza City has “significantly subsided” though at least five Palestinians were killed, a hospital official said Saturday, as Israel's army said the country's leaders had instructed it to prepare for the first phase of the U.S. plan to end the war in Gaza.

Israel has moved to a defensive-only position in Gaza and will not actively strike, said an official who was not authorized to speak to the media on the record. The official said no forces have been removed from the territory.

Still, Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiyah told the AP that Israeli strikes killed five Palestinians across Gaza City, while bombing had “significantly subsided.”

The army statement came hours after President Donald Trump ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza once Hamas said it had accepted some elements of his plan. Trump welcomed the Hamas statement but on Saturday warned that “Hamas must move quickly, or else all bets will be off.” He noted that Israel had “temporarily stopped the bombing.”

Trump appears determined to deliver on pledges to end the war and return all hostages ahead of the second anniversary on Tuesday of the attack that sparked it. His proposal unveiled earlier this week has widespread international support.

On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel was committed to ending the war that began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to end the conflict. The official told the AP that Netanyahu put out the rare late-night statement on the Sabbath, saying that Israel has started to prepare for Trump's plan due to pressure from the U.S.




The official also said a negotiating team was getting ready to travel. Egypt's state-run broadcaster Al-Qahera News, which is close to security agencies, reported that indirect talks between Hamas and Israel will start Sunday.

A senior Egyptian official said U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Egypt to head the U.S. negotiating team in the talks to release the Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli detention. The talks also will discuss maps showing the expected withdrawal of Israeli forces from certain areas in Gaza, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to brief the media.

The official involved in the ceasefire negotiations also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians aimed at unifying their position toward Gaza's future.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful militant group in Gaza, said it accepted Hamas' response to the Trump plan. The group had rejected the proposal days earlier.

Under the plan, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages — around 20 of them believed to be alive — within three days. It also would give up power and disarm.

In return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of Gaza, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction.

Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Its statement also didn't address the issue of Hamas demilitarizing, a key part of the deal.

Amir Avivi, a retired Israeli general and chairman of Israel's Defense and Security Forum, said while Israel can afford to stop firing for a few days in Gaza so the hostages can be released, it will resume its offensive if Hamas doesn't lay down its arms.

Others said that while Hamas suggests a willingness to negotiate, its position fundamentally remains unchanged.

This “yes, but” rhetoric “simply repackages old demands in softer language,” said Oded Ailam, a researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, who asserted that it serves more as a smoke screen than a signal of true movement toward resolution.

Still, some Israelis expressed cautious hope.

A group representing some families of hostages said the prospect of seeing loved ones return “has never been closer.” They appealed to Trump to keep pushing “with full force” and warned that “extremists on both sides” will try to sabotage the plan.

Meanwhile, protests have erupted across Europe calling for the war's end.

Palestinians in Gaza tried to piece together what the plan means in real terms.

“We want practical implementation. We want a truce on the ground,” said Sameer Qudeeh in Khan Younis. He worried that talks will break down again.

“I hope Hamas ends the war, because we are truly tired,” said Mohammad Shaat in Khan Younis, as anxious Palestinians roamed the shattered streets.

Israeli troops were still laying siege to Gaza City, the focus of its latest offensive. On Saturday, Israel's army warned Palestinians against trying to return to the city, calling it a “dangerous combat zone.”

Two Gaza City residents told the AP that since the morning, Israeli tanks and troops had not advanced but artillery shells and airstrikes were still heard.

“We can still see the quadcopters everywhere,” Mohamed al-Nashar said.

In southern Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said its Saraya field hospital received 10 bodies and over 70 injured after Israeli strikes on Saturday afternoon.

Gaza's Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the war has topped 67,000. The toll jumped after the ministry said it added more than 700 names to the list whose data had been verified.

The Health Ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A monumental Supreme Court term begins Monday with major tests of presidential power on the agenda along with pivotal cases on voting and the rights of LGBTQ people.

The court's conservative majority has so far been receptive, at least in preliminary rulings, to many of President Donald Trump's aggressive assertions of authority. Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson invoked the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip after one such decision allowing the cut of $783 million in research funding.

“This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”

The conservative justices could be more skeptical when they conduct an in-depth examination of some Trump policies, including the president's imposition of tariffs and his desired restrictions on birthright citizenship.

If the same conservative-liberal split that has marked so many of Trump's emergency appeals endures, “we are in for one of the most polarizing terms yet,” said Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University's law school. 

The justices will pass judgment in the next 10 months on some of Trump's most controversial efforts.

The justices are hearing a pivotal case for Trump's economic agenda in early November as they consider the legality of many of his sweeping tariffs. Two lower courts have found the Republican president does not have the power to unilaterally impose wide-ranging tariffs under an emergency powers law.




The lawsuit filed by states and small businesses argues Trump cannot usurp Congress's taxation powers by declaring national emergencies and using tariffs to address them.

The administration, though, says the law does give the president the power to regulate importation, and that includes tariffs. Four dissenting judges on a federal appeals court in Washington bought that argument, mapping out a possible legal path at the high court.

In December, the justices will take up Trump's power to fire independent agency members at will, a case that probably will lead the court to overturn, or drastically narrow, a 90-year-old decision. It required a cause, like neglect of duty, before a president could remove the Senate-confirmed officials from their jobs.

The outcome appears to be in little doubt because the conservatives have allowed the firings to take effect while the case plays out, even after lower-court judges found the firings illegal. The three liberal justices have dissented each time.

Another case that has arrived at the court but has yet to be considered involves Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. 

The administration has appealed lower-court rulings blocking the order as unconstitutional, or likely so, flouting more than 125 years of general understanding and an 1898 Supreme Court ruling. The case could be argued in the late winter or early spring.

The future of electoral districts with majorities of Black, Hispanic or Native American voters hangs in the balance in a case about congressional redistricting in Louisiana that will be argued in mid-October.

The Republican-led state has abandoned its defense of a political map that elected two Black members of Congress. Instead, Louisiana wants the court to reject any consideration of race in redistricting in a case that could bring major changes to the Voting Rights Act.

Chief Justice John Roberts and the other five conservative justices have been skeptical of the consideration of race in public life, including a decision in 2023 that ended affirmative action in college admissions.

Louisiana's position would allow it and other Republican-controlled states in the South to draw new political maps that eliminate virtually all majority Black House districts, which have been Democratic strongholds, voting rights experts say.

The justices failed to decide the case in June after hearing arguments a first time last winter. The court does not need to go as far as Louisiana wants to reject the congressional map.

But a second round of arguments is a rare occurrence at the Supreme Court, and sometimes presages a major change by the justices. The Citizens United decision in 2010 that led to dramatic increases in independent spending in U.S. elections came after it was argued a second time.

Republicans, including the Trump administration, also are behind a drive to wipe away limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates for Congress and president.

The justices are reviewing an appellate ruling that upheld a provision of federal election law that is more than 50 years old. Democrats had asked the court to leave the law in place, and the Supreme Court upheld it in 2001.

But Roberts, who just marked his 20th anniversary as chief justice, has led a court that has struck down one campaign finance regulation after another.

No date for arguments has been set. 

More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions.

The justices are hearing cases from Idaho and West Virginia, where transgender athletes won lower court rulings.

The Supreme Court in June upheld a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, but pointedly did not decide any broader issues about transgender rights.

They quickly agreed to take up the state appeals, which raised questions under the Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment and the federal law known as Title IX that dramatically expanded the participation of girls and women in sports in public schools and colleges.

The court has yet to set an argument date.

Alito turns 76 in April, young by Supreme Court standards. But he might not want to stay around and gamble on the possibility of Democrats flipping the Senate in next year's elections and seeing a Democrat capture the White House two years later.

Retiring next summer would allow Trump to name a similarly conservative but much younger replacement who would almost certainly win confirmation from the Republican-led Senate.

For close watchers of the court, Alito has done only one thing out of the ordinary: signed a contract to write a book that is expected out next year. Even as his junior colleagues have moved quickly to sign book deals. Alito, by contrast, waited nearly 20 years.

He did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Alito is not the oldest justice. Clarence Thomas is 77, but he has shown no signs of leaving, certainly not before he is set to become the longest-serving justice in U.S. history in 2028.

            The Trump administration is pointing to renewed unrest in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to justify an imminent deployment of federal troops to the two Democrat-led cities, seizing on new rounds of protests and the recent arrest of a conservative influencer.
    


            “We're sending in the Department of War … I put a request in today for them to come to Chicago,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson Friday during a visit to Illinois, where another round of protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility led to more than a dozen arrests.
    


            Federal troops would also be “rolling in” to Portland “within the next 24 hours,” the DHS secretary said, appearing to cite the arrest late Thursday of conservative influencer Nick Sortor as one of the justifications for federal intervention.
    


            “What we saw happen to that journalist, will not happen again,” Noem said.
    


            Sortor, of Washington, DC, was arrested amid protests outside an ICE facility in Portland during what police characterized as a fight. He was released hours later without bond but went on to decry his detention as a wrongful arrest. Soon after, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into “potential viewpoint discrimination” on the part of Portland police, something the department denied.
    


            Two more people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct at a protest in Portland Friday evening, including one person who had “a can of chemical spray and a collapsible metal coil baton,” the Portland Police Bureau said in a news release.
    


            The agency said they “will continue to monitor protest activity.”
    


            “As a reminder, just because arrests are not made at the scene, when tensions are high, that does not mean that people are not being charged with crimes later,” the police department said.
    


            The rising tensions between the federal government and Portland officials also played out in court Friday as a federal judge weighed whether to grant a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deploying the roughly 200 Oregon National Guard soldiers that have been mobilized.
    


            US District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump nominee, presided over Friday's hearing in Oregon and is expected to issue a decision Saturday.
    


            As of Friday, National Guard units were still completing training and must finish preparations before arriving in Portland, a US Northern Command spokesperson told CNN. They were not able to say when training would be complete.
    


            As for Chicago, a Northern Command spokesperson said Friday there were no written orders for the National Guard to be deployed to the city, and there was no unit preparing for that mission.
    


            Here's what else we know about the situations in the two cities.
    


            Oregon and Portland officials jointly sued the administration this week after President Donald Trump announced he would send the National Guard to protect “war-ravaged” Portland. The state says the order is illegal and has called the president's portrayal of the city “wildly hyperbolic.”
    


            The president and his administration have cited weekslong demonstrations outside the Portland ICE facility, framing them as “violent riots” tied to “Antifa domestic terrorists.” Local officials dispute that characterization, claiming in the lawsuit that protests were small until Trump's National Guard announcement brought renewed attention to them.
    


            On Friday the judge heard nearly two hours of testimony over the legality of the possible deployment.
    


            US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton cited a variety of incidents he said make the National Guard deployment necessary.
    


            Hamilton accused demonstrators of blocking the entrance to the ICE facility, following ICE agents home and throwing incendiary devices, rocks and bricks at law enforcement. The facility closed for three weeks over the summer “because of the violence,” he said. CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for more details on the facility closure.
    


            But Caroline Turco, an attorney for the city of Portland, said what ultimately is happening in Portland is a “perception versus reality problem.”
    


            “The president's perception is it's World War II out here. The reality is, it's a beautiful city and a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation,” Turco said.
    


            Oregon state attorneys said the use of Oregon's National Guard for civilian law enforcement does not fall within the narrow circumstances – including “rebellion” or invasion by a foreign nation – under which the president has the power to call state troops into federal action.
    


            Federal law also orders this type of action to be made through state governors. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has fiercely opposed the deployment.



            Trump's crackdown in Portland follows similar efforts in Washington, DC, Los Angeles and Memphis – an effort met with impassioned pushback from Democratic leaders nationwide who argue the moves are politically motivated and lack justification.
    


            Last month, a federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration broke the law when it deployed thousands of federalized National Guard soldiers and hundreds of Marines to suppress protests against ICE actions in Los Angeles.
    


            The decision barred troops from carrying out law enforcement in the state, but the White House has appealed the decision.
    


            Meanwhile, the latest round of protests outside an ICE facility in Illinois resulted in the arrests of at least 18 people, as tensions over federal involvement in the state was set in relief by Noem's visit.
    


            At least five people were arrested for aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting and obstruction during demonstrations in Broadview, the Cook County Sheriff's Office told CNN. DHS reported 13 additional arrests Friday evening.
    


            Protesters filled the streets as Noem was perched on the rooftop of the ICE building, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew, according to CNN affiliate WLS.
    


            The protests near Chicago began weeks ago, after local leaders got word that “a large-scale enforcement campaign” would soon be underway in the Windy City as part of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration agenda. That widespread operation has so far resulted in more than 1,000 arrests, DHS said in a news release Friday.
    


            In a separate incident on Friday, Alderperson Jessie Fuentes said she was handcuffed by agents for a brief period of time at a hospital in Chicago.
    


            Fuentes received a call about ICE officers at the emergency room and learned a detainee had injured his leg in an incident involving ICE officers, she said at a news conference.
    


            Fuentes said she asked the officers if they have a warrant “to be in the emergency room and have him detained.”
    


            “Not only do they refuse to respond, but they respond with violence by shoving me in the emergency room, and then I continue to ask if they have a signed judicial warrant, and then they handcuff me … and they threaten arrest because I'm exercising my constitutional right to ask a question,” Fuentes said.
    


            A detained immigrant “was arrested and later complained of a leg injury after attempting to flee law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a statement to CNN. The man was taken to the hospital for treatment and “nearly 30 protesters, attempted to break into where the detainee was receiving medical care,” she said.
    


            “Our brave officers are facing a surge in increase in assaults against them, inducing sniper attacks, cars being used as weapons on them, and assaults by rioters. This violence against law enforcement must END. We will not be deterred by rioters and protesters in keeping America safe.”
    


            Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said elected officials have to right “to document ICE's actions and to inform their constituents of their rights without federal interference.”
    


             “Any attempt to block this work is a direct attack on democratic accountability and an assault on the rights of the people of Chicago,” he said in a statement posted on X.
    


            In his latest rebuke of the Trump administration's actions in his state, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker delivered a “message of alarm” at a fundraiser held by Georgia Democrats Friday.
    


            Pritzker warned that a “constitutional crisis is not on its way – it is here, and we all better start acting like it.”
    


            Earlier the Democratic governor condemned a sweeping overnight raid carried out by federal authorities at a Chicago apartment building earlier this week. The multiagency operation led to the arrest of 37 undocumented immigrants – but also left the building's tenants and neighbors shaken.
    


            Adults and children alike were pulled from their apartments, crying and screaming, during the raid, which one neighbor characterized as a military-style “invasion.”
    


            “Federal agents reporting to Secretary Noem have spent weeks snatching up families, scaring law-abiding residents, violating due process rights, and even detaining U.S. citizens. They fail to focus on violent criminals and instead create panic in our communities,” Pritzker said in a statement about the operation.
    


            “Masked men going into people's homes in the middle of the night, pointing long guns in the faces of Black and brown and working people and poor people is unconstitutional, reprehensible and, in the city of Chicago, we're gonna fight back,” Johnson, the mayor, told MSNBC on Saturday.

            From Kathmandu to Lima, youth-led uprisings are driving thousands from their screens to the streets, demanding accountability, change and, in some cases, toppling governments.
    


            These Gen-Z protesters come from disparate backgrounds and have different demands.
    


            But the throughline is clear: Growing inequality and marginalization is destroying young people's hopes for the future – and the only way forward is to confront a broken social contract head on.
    


            Here's what you need to know.
    


            On consecutive nights this week, cities and towns across Morocco have pulsed with the anger of young people mobilized under the umbrella “GenZ 212” – the country's international dialing code. Led by mostly students and unemployed graduates, the protesters are demanding sweeping reforms in healthcare, education and social justice – issues they say have been sidelined as the government pours billions into 2030 World Cup infrastructure.
    


            While stadiums and luxury hotels are erected, hospitals remain overcrowded and rural areas underserved. Morocco's education system, long underfunded, is churning out graduates with few job prospects: Youth unemployment sits at 36% – and nearly 1 in 5 university graduates are out of work.
    


            The recent protests were triggered by the deaths of several pregnant women following routine C-sections in the coastal city of Agadir, spotlighting the crumbling healthcare system. The government's response has been swift and brutal: Three people were killed and hundreds of others injured, authorities said. Riot police have been deployed across major cities, using force and arresting dozens. Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch said Thursday his government had “engaged” with the protesters' demands and was ready for “dialogue and discussion.” On Friday, GenZ 212 demanded the government resign.
    


            But protests aren't fading.
    


            Thousands of miles away to the south, youth-led unrest is rocking Madagascar. For several days this week, cities across the Indian Ocean nation – one of Africa's poorest – have been flooded with young protesters outraged over water shortages and rolling blackouts. They quickly morphed into calls for systemic reform, with the protesters demanding the resignation of President Andry Rajoelina, who first came to power in a 2009 coup, and his government.
    


            Rajoelina responded by dissolving the government this week, saying, “I heard the call, I felt the suffering,” but authorities continue to crack down on dissent. The United Nations said Monday at least 22 people had been killed and more than 100 injured. The government disputes these figures.
    


            Meanwhile, in the South American nation of Peru, youth demonstrations began on September 20 after the government announced reforms to a pension law. The protests then swelled to wider calls to stamp out corruption, repression and rising crime under President Dina Boluarte's rule. The Peruvian leader's approval ratings recently sank to 2.5%, with her government at 3%, according to the Institute of Peruvian Studies' July report, reflecting widespread economic anxiety, anger over corruption scandals and continued outrage over the killing of dozens of protesters after she took office in late 2022.
    


            The unrest comes in the wake of Gen Z's extraordinary and unprecedented take down of the Nepali government in September. What began as a protest against a government social media ban quickly morphed into a broader revolt against corruption and economic stagnation. In fewer than 48 hours, at least 22 people were killed and hundreds injured as demonstrators torched government buildings in the capital Kathmandu and toppled the prime minister.
    


            It mirrors other recent Gen Z-driven movements across South Asia: In 2024, Bangladeshis ousted Sheikh Hasina, who ruled the country for more than 15 years in power; in 2022, young Sri Lankans ended the Rajapaksa family dynasty that dominated the country's politics for two decades.
    


            And it adds to youth-led protests across Indonesia, the Philippines and Kenya this year.
    


            Subir Sinha, director of SOAS South Asian Institute, noted the link between various Gen Z-led protests across the Global South.
    


            The priorities of ruling elites, “seems very far away from the everyday lives of and fears and anxieties that Gen Z is facing,” he told CNN, underlining a bleak economic outlook for many.
    


            “There is a kind of a catastrophic feeling around, with a kind of end days of liberal democracy (felt) in country after country,” he said.
    


            Gen Z – born between 1997 and 2012 – grew up in the shadow of the 2008 financial crash. As they've come of age, they've faced deepening political division, a growing climate crisis, economic uncertainty and a pandemic that has exposed deep inequalities.
    


            Bart Cammaerts, a professor of politics and communication at London School of Economics, told CNN this generation feels “short changed,” with “their interests not represented or taken into account.”
    


            As a result, Cammaerts said Gen Z is skeptical towards liberal representative democracy, although they still value democratic principles and democratic decision making.
    


            The protests that are now unfolding are a result of that skepticism.
    


            The rise of authoritarianism, xenophobia and nationalism is also fueling young people's desire to act, as opportunities that were once available to their parents' generations have nearly disappeared.
    


            “The exit option of at least temporary migration has been closed as a part of the authoritarian age we are living in,” Sinha said.
    


            It is also no surprise that the countries where this unrest is unfolding are experiencing the brunt of major extreme weather events, he said, where older generations are in power and often taking inadequate steps to stop global warming from getting worse.
    


            For young people, “the idea of the future being cancelled appears to be very real – – and I think that is partly the sort of contagion we see,” Sinha said.
    


            As traditional forms of challenging political discontent become more challenging, Gen Z are looking to their peers in other countries for a roadmap.
    


            “When they see that somewhere else has had a similar kind of situation, and people have had some degree of success … they might feel, let's try this out over here,” Singh said, pointing to Nepal's recent demonstrations.
    


            “It's as if they're holding each other's hands across national borders.”
    


            For as long as there's been protest, young people have been leading the charge. From the student-led uprisings of May 1968 in France to the Vietnam War demonstrations and Civil Rights Movements in the United States – to the Occupy movement and the Arab spring, youths have always played a central role in driving change.
    


            Gen Z are no different. They've just got different tools to organize and mobilize.
    


            They have transformed activism over digital platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Discord – a messaging app first popularized by gamers – and Telegram. These tools enable decentralized, real-time coordination, rapid information sharing, and viral symbols that unify diverse groups from across the globe.
    


            “You don't need necessarily a big organization or mobilizing force,” Cammaerts said of the protesters' tactics.
    


            That's because they're all online.
    


            For example, in Morocco, the anonymous Discord server “GenZ 212” grew from 3,000 members to more than 130,000 in just a few days, Reuters reported, exemplifying how quickly an online presence can materialize into the streets.
    


            That sort of online capability allows protests to be more spontaneous, decentralized and leaderless, making them harder for authorities to dismantle, and therefore appealing to young people who are sometimes risking their lives to demonstrate, Cammaerts said.
    


            “The online infrastructure facilitates that,” he said.
    


            In Madagascar, an online youth-led movement known as Gen Z Mada first coordinated over Facebook and TikTok before organizing with more traditional civil society groups and trade unions.
    


            When Gen Z's digital protests manage to cut through class and generational lines they gain further momentum, power and the ability to drive greater change, Sinha said.
    


            “When they do that, then it becomes not just a Gen Z thing … it goes beyond that, and it becomes a much bigger kind of movement altogether,” he said.

            Howard Patterson stood outside the Wright Cycle Company — part of the national park complex dedicated to the aviation pioneers who honed their mechanical skills repairing bicycles in Dayton — on Friday, and found locked doors with a sign taped to the window.
    


            “Due to the current lapse in federal government appropriations this site is closed to the public,” the sign said.
    


            The 44-year-old DHL worker said he'd hoped to use a day off to visit a site he'd often taken his family to see. He also wanted to visit the National Museum of the US Air Force, but it was closed, too — the result of a federal government shutdown that started October 1, with no end in sight.
    


            “I'm not political, and it's affecting what we do,” he said. “My family is more Democratic, but right now I kind of blame Democrats, because that's who we're waiting on.”
    


            Toyoua Jackson, a 39-year-old factory worker in Dayton, blamed President Donald Trump for the shutdown. She pointed to GOP cuts to health care spending.
    


            “He needs to do things different,” she said. “He's taking from the people that don't have.”
    


            In Washington, where the shutdown is expected to drag at least into next week, Trump and congressional leaders in both parties are playing the blame game — assigning fault to the other side for a lapse in appropriations that could leave active-duty military service members without paychecks, hundreds of thousands of government workers furloughed, national parks closed and many other services limited or delayed.
    


            Republicans fully control the federal government, but they don't have the 60 votes necessary to advance a funding measure in the Senate without Democratic support.
    


            Democrats are demanding an extension of tax credits to make plans on Obamacare's health insurance market more affordable and a reversal of Medicaid cuts that Trump signed into law earlier this year. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday said the GOP has refused to negotiate “and barreled us into a shutdown.”
    


            Republicans are seeking to shift the focus from health care to immigration, with Trump, Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson and others claiming that Democrats want to give free health care to undocumented immigrants. The Democratic proposal would repeal the health provisions in a section of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which limits access to Affordable Care Act subsidies, Medicaid and Medicare for certain immigrants who have been approved for some form of lawful status in the country, though Republicans argue some of these immigrants were improperly given this status by the Biden administration.
    


            Instead, Republican leaders insist they want a vote on a “clean” government funding extension into November — with no policy negotiations before that measure is approved.
    


            “I don't think there's at this point a lot to negotiate and honestly, I think that the more productive conversations are happening outside of the leader office at the moment,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Friday.
    


            As the blame game unfolds in Washington, Americans' views of what's happening — and who is at fault — are still evolving.
    


            The Washington Post's one-day survey of 1,010 Americans on the shutdown's first day found that 47% blamed Trump and majority Republicans in Congress, 30% blamed Democrats in Congress and 23% weren't sure.
    


            That poll largely echoed others conducted before the shutdown that found the public was generally more likely to fault Republicans than Democrats.
    


            It's a repeat of a pattern that has played out several times in recent years: Voters tend to blame the GOP for shutdowns. That's what polls found in 2013, when the Republican-led House sought to gut funding for then-President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, and then twice in Trump's first term, when standoffs over immigration and funding for his border wall led to standoffs.
    


            About one-quarter of those surveyed by The Washington Post said they were “very concerned” about the shutdown. Another 41% were “somewhat concerned.” However, that concern came largely from Democrats and independents; less than half of Republicans said they were concerned.
    


            The Trump administration is using many of the tools at its disposal to try to pin blame on the Democrats.
    


            The White House said thousands of federal workers could be permanently laid off soon, and had compiled a list of agencies to target. Meanwhile, messages on government websites — including that of the White House, Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration — blame the left for the shutdown.
    


            Multiple furloughed workers from the Department of Education had out-of-office messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown automatically sent from their email accounts without their consent or knowledge, according to four sources familiar with the situation.
    


            Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat, said on CNN the Trump administration was violating the Hatch Act, which is intended to stop the government from conducting its business in a partisan manner aimed at affecting elections.
    


            “Instead of just saying, ‘We're currently in a shutdown,' you decided to play partisan politics on an official website,” Crockett said.
    


            The White House dismissed the notion that it was unusual for an administration to publicly assign blame to the other party. “It's an objective fact that Democrats are responsible for the government shutdown,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, are responding with a social media blitz that included New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders walking together in a video lambasting Republicans' health care spending cuts.
    


            The House is not scheduled to be in session next week — as Johnson argues that the GOP has already done its job by approving a government funding extension there.
    


            In the hours following a private call with GOP lawmakers that Johnson held Monday in which he said Schumer would be to blame if government funding lapsed, accounts from various House Republicans flooded social media with variations of “we did our job.”
    


            Thune held up the 24-page bill to keep the government open in front of the White House on Monday, arguing that there is nothing partisan or controversial in a clean extension of government funding.
    


            As the shutdown stretches on, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries claimed Trump is “missing in action” and House Republicans are “on vacation.” Meantime, he said Democrats wouldn't back the bill Senate Republicans keep bringing up for a vote “because it guts the health care of the American people.”
    


            In Dayton, though, the details of the government shutdown and the partisan finger-pointing were largely being ignored, as people blamed both parties and politics generally.
    


            Residents were also more worried about what the shutdown would mean for them.
    


            The Miami Valley is home to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, with about 38,000 military members, civilian workers and contractors — by far the region's largest employer. It's also home to federal museums and parks honoring the Air Force and the Wright brothers. That means federal employees make up a huge share of Dayton's residents and its businesses' customers.
    


            It's also a battleground: Montgomery County, the home of Dayton, split nearly evenly between Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The region could prove critical again in 2026, with Democratic former Sen. Sherrod Brown challenging Republican Sen. Jon Husted in what's expected to be one of the nation's most closely watched Senate contests.
    


            Memories of the shutdown could have faded by then. But in a region where the federal government's role is so visible, many people did say they were anxious.
    


            Tierra Freeman, the 23-year-old manager of the Fashion Remedy Boutique, said with military members not receiving paychecks and other federal workers furloughed, she worried about the customers of the business that opened just a month ago.
    


            “You can tell when people get their checks, because that's when they're in the shop,” she said.
    


            She said she isn't sure which party is to blame for the shutdown, and had largely brushed it off because of the increasing regularity of government spending battles in Washington.
    


            But, she said, she now believes that “this one does seem to be impacting people a lot differently. That part is a little nerve-wracking. It seems to be a bit bigger than what's happened in the past.”
    


            Daniella Martinez, a 35-year-old Dayton resident, is set to start a new job Monday after being laid off when her previous employer, a company that handled moves for military members, lost its government contract.
    


            She said she wasn't surprised by the shutdown.
    


            “I think with an incompetent president and the rest of his lackeys running Congress and the other branches, that it was an inevitable possibility,” Martinez said.
    


            However, she was also frustrated with Democrats, and said the shutdown is “everybody's fault.”
    


            “The Democrats haven't done anything to help anybody either for years, which has forced people to think that Republicans can do better, which has only helped prove that nobody can get anything done,” Martinez said. “The government stops when the Democrats are in charge of it too. It's an all-the-time thing.”
    


            Addy Turner, a 20-year-old mechanical engineering major at the University of Dayton, said she thinks both parties are to blame for the impasse in Washington.
    


            “I just think people can't get along, and nobody wants to compromise, and that goes for both sides,” she said.
    


            The shutdown, Turner said, is the fault of “dumb politicians and a dumb president.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran executed six death-row inmates Saturday it alleged carried out attacks in the country's oil-rich southwest on behalf of Israel, the latest prisoners to be put to death in a wave of executions believed to be the highest in decades.

The executions follow the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June, which ended with Tehran vowing it would target its enemies at home and abroad. However, activists warn Iran often relies on coerced confessions and closed-door trials in its death penalty cases, particularly those involving Israel. 

Iran said the men killed police officers and security forces, as well as orchestrated bombings targeting sites around Khorramshahr in Iran's restive Khuzestan province. Iranian state television aired footage of one of the men talking about the attacks, saying it was the first time the details were being made public. 

A Kurdish group called the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights reported the men's execution, identifying them all as “Arab political prisoners” detained during protests in 2019. It said Iran had accused the men of having links to the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz, which has launched attacks against oil pipelines in Iran's southwest in the past and other attacks.

“The six men were subjected to severe torture and coerced into giving televised ‘confessions' under duress,” Hengaw said.




The Arab population of Khuzestan has long complained of discrimination by Iran's central government. The region also has been roiled like other parts of Iran in the waves of nationwide protests the country has seen in recent years. 

Iran separately put to death another inmate Saturday it accused of killing a Sunni cleric in 2009 in Iran's Kurdistan province, among other crimes.

In response to those protests and the June war, Iran has been putting prisoners to death at a pace unseen since 1988, when it executed thousands at the end of the Iran-Iraq war.

The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the figure could be higher as Iran does not report on each execution.

Independent human rights experts at the United Nations have also criticized Iran's executions.

MIAMI (AP) — Federal prosecutors are seeking to return to custody a former Green Beret accused of plotting to invade Venezuela in 2020, arguing he is at risk of fleeing the United States after allegedly threatening a filmmaker who posted a $2 million bond for his release.

Over the objections of prosecutors, a judge in Tampa last year ordered Jordan Goudreau's release a few weeks after he was arrested on weapons smuggling charges tied to the failed coup attempt.

Filmmaker Jen Gatien's had pledged her $2 million Manhattan apartment as collateral. In a court filing Friday, prosecutors said the court would have likely kept Goudreau jailed pending trial had it known about an “undisclosed side agreement” for the three-time Bronze Star recipient to surrender to his attorney “significant cryptocurrency holdings” and other assets to mitigate her financial risk.

Gatien is the co-director of “Men of War,” based on Goudreau's account of the raid that ended with several combatants killed by security forces and two of his U.S. Special Forces buddies locked away in a Venezuelan prison. The documentary debuted last month on Amazon Prime.

Despite their once-close relationship, Gatien said she fears Goudreau may attempt to flee. In a court filing this week, she said that Goudreau threatened her and tried to elicit defamatory statements about her from unnamed individuals to block her from backing out of the bond agreement.

“I'm not going back to prison,” Goudreau wrote Gatien in a text message she included among other profanity-filled exchanges as part of her request to be released from the bond.




Goudreau, who at Gatien's request earlier asked the court to remove her as a guarantor, said he regretted that a “personal disagreement” over his decision to end contact with the filmmaker was now playing out in court. 

“My connection to her was unhealthy. I want to be free from her control over me and my life,” he said in a statement through his lawyer. “There is only one thing that Gatien gets right. I do not intend to go back to prison because I am innocent.”

An attorney for Gatien said she acted “entirely appropriately” and any claim to contrary was false.

The 2020 plot against President Nicolás Maduro, exposed by The Associated Press two days before the incursion, was carried out by a ragtag group of Venezuelan army deserters whom Goudreau said he helped arm and train in neighboring Colombia.

The Trump administration has denied any role in the bloody fiasco, which came to be known as the Bay of Piglets.

Gatien's documentary echoes Goudreau's claims that he acted in concert with Venezuela's U.S.-backed opposition and was guided by a $15 million bounty — boosted this year to $50 million — for Maduro's arrest. Goudreau has said he received frequent winks and encouraging words from officials and people close to the White House with whom he was in close contact at the time, including Donald Trump's former bodyguard Keith Schiller.

Despite the denials of U.S. involvement in the operation, Trump has made no secret of his desire to see Maduro gone. In August, he deployed multiple warships, equipped with fighter jets and thousands of marines, to the Caribbean waters near Venezuela with orders to strike against drug runners allegedly working for a Venezuelan gang Trump designated a terrorist organization. To date, 17 people have been killed.

Goudreau, 49, said he became a believer in the cause of Venezuelan democracy after working security at a benefit concert held in Colombia to deliver humanitarian aid across the border.

Despite a lack of Spanish, he drew close to several exiled allies of opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who the U.S. then recognized as Venezuela's legitimate leader. Over several months, a plan was hatched to invade Venezuela with the goal of sparking a popular rebellion.

In 2024, Goudreau was arrested outside Gatien's apartment and charged with failing to obtain an export license to ship roughly 60 AR-15 rifles to clandestine camps where would-be freedom fighters were being trained.

Two of the rifles seized in Colombia contain traces of Goudreau's DNA, while suppressors, night-vision goggles and other equipment had serial numbers matching those purchased by Goudreau and his Melbourne, Florida-based security firm Silvercorp, according to prosecutors.

Gatien on Tuesday filed a motion seeking to part ways financially with Goudreau. In the filing, she said Goudreau became “verbally abusive” and threatening when she confronted him.

“I WILL NOT BE VERBALLY ASSAULTED FOR PROTECTING MYSELF. I DON'T EVER WANT TO REHASH THE PAST WITH YOUR DELUSIONAL VERSION,” she wrote in all-caps in an email last year about their financial dispute. “STOP TAKING ADVANTAGE OF KINDNESS—DO THE CHRISTIAN THING.”

Gatien registered a Florida production company with Goudreau in 2021 and is described in court records as his girlfriend. His attorney at the bond hearing said the two had been living together for two years while Goudreau attended the New York Film Academy. But upon being handcuffed outside Gatien's apartment, Goudreau used an expletive to tell the FBI she wasn't his girlfriend.

Trial in the case is currently scheduled for February.

Hundreds of people fled Gaza city to safer areas in the central and southern areas of the Gaza Strip as Israeli strikes and gunfire overnight and into Thursday killed at least 41 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to hospitals.

Protester blocked troops en route to Gaza on Friday, calling on the Israeli government to allow a flotilla into the enclave.

Hamas said Friday that it has accepted some elements of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in the Gaza Strip, including giving up power and releasing all remaining hostages, but that others require further consultations among Palestinians.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday ordered Israel to stop bombing the Gaza Strip after Hamas said it had accepted some elements of his plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for the implementation of the “first stage” of Trump's plan, apparently referring to the release of hostages. But his office said in a statement that Israel was committed to ending the war based on principles it has set out before, without addressing potential gaps with Hamas.

Trump welcomed the Hamas statement, saying: “I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.”

“Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,” he wrote on social media.

Hamas said aspects of the proposal touching on the future of the Gaza Strip and Palestinian rights should be decided on the basis of a “unanimous Palestinian stance” reached with other factions and based on international law.

The statement also made no mention of Hamas disarming, a key Israeli demand included in Trump's proposal.

Trump appears keen to deliver on pledges to end the war and return dozens of hostages ahead of the second anniversary of the attack on Tuesday.

Key mediators Egypt and Qatar welcomed the latest developments, and Majed Al Ansari, a spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, said they would “continue discussions on the plan.” 

A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said he “urges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end.” French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on social media that “the release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach!”

The main organization representing the families of Israeli hostages said Trump's demand to halt the fighting “is essential to prevent serious and irreversible harm to the hostages.” It called on Netanyahu “to immediately begin efficient and swift negotiations to bring all our hostages home.”

Earlier, Trump had warned that Hamas must agree to the deal by Sunday evening, threatening an even greater military onslaught. 

“If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote Friday on social media. “THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”

Under the plan, which Trump unveiled earlier this week alongside Netanyahu, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages — around 20 of them believed to be alive — within three days. It would also give up power and disarm.

In return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of the territory, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction. Plans to relocate much of Gaza's population to other countries would be shelved.

The territory of some 2 million Palestinians would be placed under international governance, with Trump himself and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it. The plan provides no path for eventual reunification with the Israeli-occupied West Bank in a future Palestinian state.

Palestinians long for an end to the war, but many view this and previous U.S. proposals as strongly favoring Israel.

Trump's proposal “cannot be implemented without negotiations,” Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official based outside of Gaza, told the Al Jazeera network on Friday.

The Hamas statement said it was willing to return all remaining hostages according to the plan's “formula,” apparently referring to an exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It also reiterated its longstanding openness to handing power over to a politically independent Palestinian body. 

But Abu Marzouk said it might be difficult for Hamas to release all the hostages within 72 hours, because it could take days or weeks to locate the remains of some of the captives.

He said Hamas was willing to hand over its weapons to a future Palestinian body that runs Gaza, but there was no mention of that in the official statement.

Another Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Araby television that Hamas would refuse foreign administration of the Gaza Strip and that the entry of foreign forces would be “unacceptable.”

Israel has sought to ramp up pressure on Hamas since ending an earlier ceasefire in March. It sealed the territory off from food, medicine and other goods for 2 1/2 months and has seized, flattened and largely depopulated large areas.

Experts determined that Gaza City had slid into famine shortly before Israel launched a major offensive aimed at occupying it. An estimated 400,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks, but hundreds of thousands more have stayed behind.

Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. humanitarian office, said she saw several displaced families staying in the parking lot of Shifa Hospital during a visit on Thursday.

“They are not able to move south because they just cannot afford it,” Cherevko told The Associated Press. “One of the families had three children and the woman was pregnant with her fourth. And there were many other vulnerable cases there, including elderly people and people with disabilities.”

Most of Hamas' top leaders in Gaza and thousands of its fighters have already been killed, but it still has influence in areas not controlled by the Israeli military and launches sporadic attacks.

Hamas has long insisted it will only release the remaining hostages — its sole bargaining chip and potential human shields — in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Hamas must surrender and disarm.

Thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, attacking army bases, farming communities and an outdoor music festival, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. They abducted 251 others, most of them since released in ceasefires or other deals.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

The offensive has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and left much of the territory uninhabitable.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations have tried to end the fighting and bring back the hostages while providing extensive military and diplomatic support to Israel.

Republicans have condemned Democratic Virginia Attorney General candidate Jay Jones after text messages emerged in which he talked about shooting a former Virginia House Speaker.

Jones reportedly told a Republican colleague in 2022 that, in a hypothetical scenario, if he were in a room with then-Republican Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert, Adolf Hitler, and Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, and he had two bullets, he would shoot Gilbert twice.

“Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” Jones texted Republican House Delegate Carrie Coyner.

Jones made the statements after recently resigning from the state's House. He had been expressing anger about the statements Republicans made eulogizing recently deceased former state legislator Joe Johnson Jr. He said that he would “piss” on the graves of the Republicans wishing Johnson peace.

Jones' opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, has not commented on the texts. However, the Republican Attorneys General Association told the Washington Examiner they believed Jones should “immediately” withdraw from the race.

“There is no place for political violence, including joking about it – especially from an elected official. Jay Jones should drop out of the Attorney General's race. His comments are not acceptable from someone who wants to represent law enforcement,” RAGA Chairman Kris Kobach told the Washington Examiner in a statement.

The Republican State Legislative Campaign Committee, the top GOP campaign organization for state legislatures, did not call for Jones to drop out but said Virginia voters deserved “a full explanation.”

“Jay Jones' recent comments have crossed a line that should never be crossed,” RSLC President Edith Jorge-Tuñón told the Washington Examiner in a statement.

“He owes Virginians a full explanation and an apology for his actions,” she added. “We urge leaders from both parties to denounce this behavior and reaffirm that threats — whether real or imagined —have no place in public service or our democracy. As political violence becomes more common, we need to rely on our public officials to lower the temperature and unite us, rather than divide us with such reprehensible comments.”

Virginia Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle called Jones's comments, which also reportedly included wishing violence on Gilbert's children, “abhorrent.” The Virginia GOP asked whether Virginians should support a candidate who “fantasizes” about shooting a political opponent, or whether they should reject the violent rhetoric.

In a statement to the Virginia Scope, Jones did not apologize but said, “like all people,” he's sent text messages that he regrets.

“I believe that violent rhetoric has no place in our politics,” he said. “Let's be clear about what is happening in the Attorney General race right now: Jason Miyares is dropping smears through Trump-controlled media organizations to assault my character and rescue his desperate campaign. This is a strategy that ensures Jason Miyares will continue to be accountable to Donald Trump, not the people of Virginia. This race is about whether Trump can control Virginia or Virginians control Virginia.”

Jones later apologized directly to Gilbert and his family.

Virginia Democrats have said publicly that Jones should apologize. Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, a Democrat, said Jones “needs to apologize now” and that his comments were “harmful, reckless, and wrong.”

Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas and state Sen. Mamie Locke, chair of Virginia Senate Democrats, said in a statement that Jones should “take accountability,” and that the party should “remain united” in their support for him.

Virginia's Attorney General race was considered one of the most competitive statewide races for 2025. 

A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll showed Jones ahead of Miyares 51% to 45% among likely voters. 

JASON MIYARES'S RACE FOR VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL JUST GOT MORE COMPELLING

Jones is the youngest major party candidate running for statewide executive office in Virginia at 36 years old, over a decade younger than the 49-year-old Miyares.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was denied entry to Broadview City Hall in the Chicago suburbs as she attempted to use the building's bathroom.

A video shows Noem and others attempting to enter the building before a man held the door shut.

Noem asks, “[Are we] not allowed in?” A different person asks if they can use the “restroom.”

A man inside said, “No, you cannot.” Noem and her crew then walk away before she noted that the resistance is “what Governor Pritzker calls cooperation.”

Noem lamented the incident in an X post, noting “Broadview receives at least $1 million in federal funding every year.”

“My team and I were just blocked from accessing the Village of Broadview Municipal Building in Illinois. We were stopping for a quick bathroom break. This is a public building. The Village of Broadview receives at least $1 million in federal funding every year. This is how JB Pritzker and his cronies treat our law enforcement. Absolutely shameful,” she wrote.

Noem said they were in the area to conduct “some operations” and arrest people with criminal convictions.

A Broadview village spokesperson disputed that the bathroom was the only reason she was at the building. Village spokesperson David Ormsby told NBC Chicago Noem appeared “unannounced” at the Village Hall, asking for a meeting while Mayor Katrina Thompson was out of the building.”

“Mayor Thompson went to the ICE center, accompanied by the Broadview Police Chief Thomas and officers, to ask for the illegal fence to be dismantled. The mayor was told by agents at the gate the secretary was unavailable to meet,” Ormsby said. “Additionally, we are distressed to hear that the bathrooms are unavailable at the ICE facility.”

Noem was seen at the Broadview ICE facility earlier in the day with Border Control Commander Greg Bovino. Like many others within the country, demonstrations have been ongoing outside the facility.

The Trump administration is beginning its “Midway Blitz” immigration operations in Chicago and uses the Broadview ICE facility to assist in their campaign.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO RAM ICE OFFICERS IN ILLINOIS

Gov. JB Pritkzer's (D-IL) spokesperson criticized the actions of law enforcement near the ICE facility and the enforcement methods of immigration agents.

“In addition to their inhumane tactics on immigration enforcement, they have grossly mishandled and incited tensions at the Broadview facility,” the spokesperson said. “This includes firing chemical agents at protesters and media, arresting a reporter, slamming people to the ground, and wreaking havoc on Broadview residents and nearby businesses.”

EUNICE, NEW MEXICO — Paul Lorskulsint was a shift manager at a brand new uranium enrichment facility deep in the American Southwest when catastrophe struck Japan in 2011.

A massive tsunami and earthquake had caused a severe accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Thousands of miles away in Eunice, New Mexico, Lorskulsint turned on the television to make sure his team could witness what was happening across the Pacific Ocean.

Lorskulsint knew the disaster in Japan was a watershed moment for the nuclear industry. The plant where he was leading an operations shift had just opened in 2010, after the European uranium enricher Urenco had spent years building the facility in anticipation of growing demand.

Over the ensuing decade, public support for nuclear power diminshed and a dozen reactors closed in the U.S. as the industry struggled to compete against a flood of cheap natural gas and renewable energy. Demand for the low enriched uranium that fuels nuclear plants dwindled.

"The price of what we sold basically went through the floor," Lorskulsint, who is now the chief nuclear officer at Urenco USA, told CNBC. Urenco's long-term contracts with utilities insulated the facility during the downturn, he said, but the price drop put further expansion plans on hold.

Headquartered outside London, Urenco is joinly owned by the British and Dutch goverments and two German utilities. Its New Mexico facility is the only commercial enrichment facility left in the U.S. The last U.S.-owned commercial facility in Paducah, Kentucky, closed in 2013 and its owner the United States Enrichment Corporation went bankrupt during the downturn after Fukushima.

Fourteen years later, the situation has reversed once again. Urenco USA is racing to expand its enrichment capacity. The nuclear industry is gaining momentum as electricity demand in the U.S. is projected to surge from artificial intelligence and the push to expand domestic manufacturing. Doubts persist about whether U.S. power supplies will ramp up quick enough to meet the needs. Increasing uranium enrichment will be a key part of the process, despite the history of past disappointments. 

Also, U.S. enriched uranium supplies are at risk. The U.S. still imported 20% of its enriched uranium from Russia in 2024, a legacy of the now shattered hope for friendship between the two countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War.

The U.S. will completely ban the import Russian uranium by 2028 in repsonse to Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leaving a gapping supply deficit just when Washington, the utilities and the tech sector are developing the most ambitious plans in decades to build new reactors.

Nuclear plants like Palisades in Michigan, Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania and Duane Arnold in Iowa are planning to restart operations this decade after closing years ago. The tech sector is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to bring advanced reactors online in the 2030s to help power their computer warehouses that train and run AI applications.

"It is a pivotal moment, the next five to 10 years for the nuclear industry," Lorskulsint said. "We're going to have to have to deliver on time, on schedule and continue to maintain that momentum, which is a significant challenge."

In deeply divided Washington, support for nuclear power is one of the few issues that can still muster some bipartisan support. President Donald Trump wants to quadruple nuclear power by 2050, a significant increase over President Joe Biden's previous goal to triple it by that date.

The U.S. has only built one new nuclear plant from scratch in the past 30 years, raising doubts about whether such ambitious plans can be realized. But any effort big or small to expand nuclear power in the U.S. will run through Urenco's facility in New Mexico.

The plant currently has capacity to supply about a third of U.S. demand with $5 billion invested in the facility to date. Urenco is expanding its capacity in New Mexico by 15% through 2027 as utilties replace Russian fuel. It has installed two new centrifuge cascades for enrichment this year. But Urenco's expansion alone won't fill the Russian supply gap, Lorskulsint said.

"Our competitors will have to expand in order to make sure that as a whole the industry is still supplied," he said. "We're building quickly as we can to make sure that the the industry is not short handed."

As Russian fuel is banned from the U.S., the Trump administration is pushing for 10 new large reactors to start construction this decade. Alphabet is investing in about 2 gigawatts of new nuclear, Amazon has committed to more than 5 gigawatts, and Meta wants to bring up to 4 gigawatts online.

The industry is worried about the supply gap, Lorskulsint said, but filling it "is not an insurmountable task."

Urenco USA is a candidate to receive a contract from the Department of Energy to produce more low-enriched uranium, part of U.S. efforts to standup a domestic nuclear supply chain. The contract would allow the New Mexico facility to expand further with the construction of a fourth production building.

Urenco's competitors are also seeking support from the Energy Department to build out U.S. enrichment capacity. France's Orano is planning to build a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennesse, with operations potentially starting in the 2030s.

Publicly traded Centrus has a facility in Piketon, Ohio, where it plans to produce low-enriched uranium, but it hasn't yet started commercial operations. Centrus is the successor company to the United States Enrichment Corporation that went bankrupt in 2013.

Centrus stock has gained more than 400% this year as investors bet on a growing demand for enriched uranium due to U.S. plans to expand nuclear power.

But enrichment is just one stage in a long supply chain that will be stretched by growing demand. Uranium delivered to the U.S is often mined in Canada and it is then converted into intermediate state called uranium hexafluoride that is the feedstock for enrichment.

The feedstock is spun in Urenco's centrifuges to increase the presence of the isotope Uranium-235 to 5%, the level needed for most nuclear plants. The enriched uranium is then shipped to fuel fabricators that manufacture the pellets that go into reactors in power plants.

U.S. nuclear plants are facing cumulative supply gap of 184 million pounds of uranium through 2034, according to the Energy Information Administration.The biggest bottleneck right now for Urenco is the conversion of uranium into the feedstock for enrichment, Lorskulsint said. There are only three facilities in the Western world located in Canada, France and Illinois that convert uranium into feedstock.

"Every portion of the supply chain is going to have to expand, it's not just about enrichment," Lorskulsint said. "We need more of everything but conversion right now is the bottleneck."

The nuclear supply chain may not be the biggest challenge in the end, the executive said. The ageing U.S. electric grid could prove to be the real constraint on building new nuclear due how long it takes to complete upgrades, he said. While this could slow Urenco down, it won't stop the expansion, he said.

"We came here when the market demanded it," Lorskulsint said of Urenco's investment in the U.S. "We were here when the market didn't demand it. And we are now expanding to make sure that we can still support as much as the market needs from us."

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Berkshire Hathaway has a deal to pay $9.7 billion in cash to buy OxyChem, Occidental Petroleum's chemical business.

It could be Warren Buffett's last major acquisition before he gives up his CEO role at the end of the year.

It is Berkshire's biggest deal since it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Allegheny in 2022, but it is not the enormous "elephant" that Buffett has been hunting for that would put a significant dent in the company's roughly $340 billion in cash as of the end of June.

The deal builds on an already close relationship between the companies:  Berkshire is Occidental's largest shareholder with a stake of almost 27% currently valued at $11.9 billion.

In addition, Occidental is paying an 8% dividend on more than $8 billion in preferred shares held by Berkshire after what was, in effect, a loan to help OXY buy Anadarko Petroleum in 2019.

As part of that deal, Berkshire also now holds warrants to buy nearly 84 million additional OXY common shares for just under $60 per share, which is higher than their current price just under $45.

Despite those ties, Buffett told shareholders two years ago Berkshire will not try to acquire Occidental in its entirety.

In a live interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" the morning of the announcement, CEO Vicki Hollub said it will use $6.5 billion of the OxyChem purchase price to reduce its debt, bringing it below the $15 billion target set when it bought Permian Basin producer CrownRock in late 2023 for $12 billion.

"Now we're going to be able to start our share repurchase program again ...

"The thing that we needed to do was improve our balance sheet. So this is that last big step that we need and now I think we're off and running to value creation that's going to come at a much faster pace for our shareholders."

Wall Street isn't as positive as Hollub is about the deal.

Occidental Petroleum shares fell as much 8.1% on Thursday, the day of the announcement, but then bounced back a bit to close out the week with a 5.5% drop.

Barron's is blunt in its assessment: "Score one for Warren Buffett at the expense of Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub."

It says the purchase price "could be a bargain because earnings in the sector are depressed this year" and are expected to head higher.

In addition, Occidental will be losing a chemical business that helped differentiate it from energy rivals.

It will also be facing a $1.7 billion tax hit that would have been eliminated had Berkshire used its OXY preferred shares to pay for the deal, as some had anticipated.

That means Occidental will probably continue to pay Berkshire more than $600 million in dividends each year until the preferred shares are scheduled to be redeemed in 2029.

Fortune, on the other hand, highlights the benefits to Occidental of reducing its debt load.

It quotes Wolfe Research analyst Doug Leggate calling the deal a "win-plus for Berkshire because it also helps the company that they own [roughly] 30% of. It's completely self-serving, it's logical, and—not in any nefarious way—definitely helpful."

That's the way Berkshire's Greg Abel played it in the deal's news release that, interestingly, never mentioned Buffett's name.

"We commend Vicki and the Occidental team for their commitment to Occidental's long-term financial stability, as demonstrated by their plan to use proceeds to reinforce the company's balance sheet."

Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors has changed the company's by-laws to separate the roles of chairman and CEO.

An SEC filing today (Friday) says the board voted to make the revisions on Tuesday, almost three months before current Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel is scheduled to become CEO on January 1.

As Warren Buffett said in May when he announced he would step down from the CEO job, he will remain chairman of the board.

Warren Buffett is no longer raising millions for charity by auctioning off the opportunity to have lunch with him as he has in years past.

But a bronze bust of him sold this week for $26,201 in an eBay sale organized by Mohnish Pabrai, an investor who calls himself an "ardent disciple" of Buffett.

It is for the benefit of the Dakshana Foundation, which offers higher education entrance exam coaching to impoverished students in rural India as part of an effort to alleviate poverty.

OpenAI launched short-form video app Sora this week, and users have flooded the platform with artificial intelligence-generated clips of popular brands and animated characters.

The startup could soon face a deluge of copyright lawsuits, experts told CNBC.

"A lot of the videos that people are going to generate of these cartoon characters are going to infringe copyright," Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School, said in an interview. "OpenAI is opening itself up to quite a lot of copyright lawsuits by doing this." 

Sora allows users to create short videos for free by typing in a prompt. The app is only available on iOS devices and is invite-based, which means people need a code to access it.

Since its launch on Tuesday, Sora has already climbed to the top of Apple's App Store.  

CNBC gained access to Sora on Wednesday and has viewed videos that included characters from shows like "SpongeBob SquarePants," "Rick and Morty" and "South Park," as well as movies like "Despicable Me."

One video showed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman standing in a field with several Pokémon characters, where he says, "I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us." Another shows the fictional McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald fleeing from police in a car shaped like a burger. 

CNBC was also able to generate several characters and logos independently, including Ronald McDonald, Patrick Star from "SpongeBob SquarePants," Pikachu from the Pokémon franchise, a Starbucks coffee cup and characters from "The Simpsons."

McDonald's declined to comment. The other companies behind these characters and logos did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

"People are eager to engage with their family and friends through their own imaginations, as well as stories, characters, and worlds they love, and we see new opportunities for creators to deepen their connection with the fans," Varun Shetty, OpenAI's head of media partnerships, told CNBC in a statement. "We'll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests."

As AI startups have rapidly changed the way that people can interact with content online, media companies and other brands have kicked off a series of fresh legal battles to try and protect their intellectual property.

Disney and Universal have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI last week, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.

Characters are copyrightable — meaning third parties can't use copyrighted or original characters without permission — and Sora is primed to be a fresh breeding ground for infringement disputes.

If a company loses control over what their copyrighted characters do and say in user-generated videos, it's going to be a problem, Lemley said. 

"You can imagine why Taylor Swift wouldn't want — even if pornography is off the table — wouldn't want videos of her purporting to say things she doesn't say," he said. "I think the same is going to be true of cartoon characters."

OpenAI said it respects takedown requests that are submitted through its "Copyright Disputes" form, which allows content owners to flag specific content. Users can also report videos for copyright infringement and trademark infringement directly through the app. 

The company said these actions provide granularity on a character-by-character basis, and they are different from a blanket opt-out. 

OpenAI reportedly gave some talent agencies and studios the option to opt-out of Sora and exclude their copyrighted material ahead of the app's launch, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

That kind of an arrangement would be unusual, according to Jason Bloom, partner and chair of the intellectual property litigation practice group at the law firm Haynes Boone. Typically, third parties have to get explicit permission to use someone's work under copyright law.

"You can't just post a notice to the public saying we're going to use everybody's works, unless you tell us not to," he said. "That's not how copyright works." 

OpenAI said it has taken steps to address potential safety concerns around the Sora app, including giving users explicit control over how their likeness is used on the platform. 

Users can choose to create a "cameo" of themselves that they can insert into videos, and they have direct control over who can access it. In practice, this means users can't generate videos of another person or public figure without that person's explicit permission. 

In a blog post late Friday, Altman said similar, more granular controls are coming for rights holders.

"We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them," Altman wrote. "But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rightsholders decide how to proceed (our aim of course is to make it so compelling that many people want to)."

China is making leaps and bounds with carrier technology. It recently showed off its newest aircraft carrier launching jets with electromagnetic catapults, a capability once unique to the US Navy's cutting-edge Ford-class flattops. And it did it with stealth jets, something the US has yet to do.

But while Beijing's carriers may be nearing America's in technological capabilities, experts say they're still a long way from fighting like them. The real challenge isn't building ships. It's building the experience, crews, and doctrine to use them.

"You can engineer and build something much quicker than you can build up a group of people to operate it," Bryan Clark, a retired US Navy submarine officer and defense expert at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider.

China has three aircraft carriers. The first two, the Liaoning and Shandong, are operational, but the newest one, Fujian, is completing sea trials. The former two are Soviet designs with ski jumps for launching aircraft. Fujian is a major improvement with its electromagnetic catapults.

The US Navy, on the other hand, has 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. All of China's vessels are conventionally powered, although there's evidence that it's pursuing a nuclear-powered design. Furthermore, while only one of China's carriers has a catapult, all of the US carriers have catapults. Nimitz-class ships are equipped with steam-driven catapults, while the new first-in-class USS Gerald R. Ford has electromagnetic ones.

China's active carriers feature a fleet of fourth-gen fighters. The US ships carry a mix of fourth- and fifth-gen jets. But the main difference in the fleets is in the depth of experience. While China has been building a carrier fleet for over a decade now, the US Navy has been operating carriers since the early 20th century.

Last month, China released video footage of the Fujian launching a J-35 stealth fighter, J-15T carrier-based fighter, and KJ-600 early warning and control aircraft via its electromagnetic catapult systems. The clips were distributed by state media and show carrier crews readying the aircraft for takeoff, launching them off the top deck, and recovering them using arresting cables and tailhooks.

Expert observers noted how quickly China's navy moved from no aircraft carriers to Soviet designs to a modern one with electromagnetic catapults. Not only is China catching up to the latest technology, but it skipped the steam-driven catapults completely.

The electromagnetic catapults on the Fujian let China launch a more diversified air wing of not just fighters but also airborne early warning and control assets. Combat aircraft can take off fully fueled and also fully armed for improved combat effectiveness.

Whether that capability is fully mature remains to be seen.

The recent launch footage was a test run filmed while the Fujian is still completing sea trials under managed conditions. It's a state-sponsored video that doesn't shed light on challenges. The videos alone are not enough to assess whether the Fujian's systems are ready to operate reliably in all weather, day and night, under the stress of combat.

"The Chinese have reached this milestone," Clark said. "But they probably lacked the capacity on board the ship to do it at scale and over a sustained period."

In the recent footage, China showed sailors launching the Shenyang J-35, a fifth-generation stealth fighter widely viewed as Beijing's answer to the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter. The launch made China the first nation to launch a stealth aircraft with electromagnetic catapults. The Gerald R. Ford has yet to be certified fully for launches of the F-35C, the stealth fighter's carrier-based variant.

However, US Navy carriers, specifically Nimitz-class carriers, have not only launched and recovered but also deployed with the F-35C, a combat-proven platform. F-35Bs have also been deployed on amphibious warships and foreign carriers. Like the jets, American carriers have been tested in combat. China's J-35 is a relative black box.

China's primary carrier-based fighter is the Shenyang J-15, an exceptionally heavy derivative of a Soviet design. The ski jumps limit the effectiveness of the jet by putting takeoff weight constraints on it, while the new catapults allow China to maximize the jet's combat power while employing upgraded variants.

The US Navy, on the other hand, still predominantly relies on the F/A-18 Super Hornet and electronic warfare EA-18 Growlers. The Navy can notably employ its aircraft in greater numbers than China; US carriers can support a larger air wing, usually 60-70 aircraft.

China's aircraft carriers can also support rotary-wing aircraft like the US Navy, and now with the Fujian, China's People's Liberation Army Navy can also field airborne control and early warning plans like the KJ-600. Serving in a role like the US E-2D Hawkeye, these planes allow a Chinese carrier group to see much farther than helicopters or ship radars, allowing for better coordination and more complex operations.

The US Navy has decades of experience with carrier operations with highly skilled technicians and operators. The Navy has run continuous global carrier deployments for decades, from peacetime patrols to major wars, from WWII to Vietnam to the Gulf War to more recent wars and fighting in the Middle East.

China is still new to aircraft carrier operations and is likely relying on a smaller group of people who've gained experience over the past decade or so, meaning that the workforce isn't comparable yet. China's carriers have only recently begun sailing beyond coastal waters, mostly in the Western Pacific, with very limited long-duration missions, so the fleet has not yet been stress-tested in the same way.

"They just don't have the kind of core you would need to do this on a multi-shift basis across an entire carrier fleet," Clark said, highlighting that while the US has officers managing catapult operations and recovering aircraft, those jobs on Chinese aircraft carriers are filled with much higher-ranking personnel, hinting that experience is limited to a smaller cadre of senior figures.

The US has multi-generational institutional knowledge built into its Navy schools, training commands, and simulation centers. China is starting from scratch — its "first generation" of carrier sailors are only now moving into senior leadership roles. Likewise, China is still experimenting with its doctrine, while the US Navy has had the opportunity for extensive iterative innovation.

China has been focused on training enlisted personnel for technician and operational carrier roles, "but it takes time because you have to build up an entire generation of people," Clark said. It can be expedited by having personnel doing more tours and increasing their experience, but it can't be skipped in the way that some technological and engineering hurdles can.

To run these carrier operations, especially in a conflict scenario, China will need to build that out.

There's also readiness at sea to consider for a carrier fleet. The US has spent decades learning how to keep complex vessels sailing and sophisticated warplanes flying in harsh environments.

Warships are supported by a global web of supply ships, repair hubs, and carefully managed maintenance cycles. China may have a massive manufacturing workforce and can bring in personnel with technical backgrounds, but it's still learning how to handle the wear and tear on carrier-based aircraft and how to sustain large flattops with regular overhauls and at-sea resupply. These are essential skills that only come with time and experience.

As the US Navy continues to build Ford-class carriers, ships currently behind schedule, China is continuing to run its new aircraft carrier through sea trials. Once it's certified for operational status, the Fujian will join the Liaoning and Shandong and help expand Beijing's maritime presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

There are expectations that China will expand its carrier fleet further, and its massive shipbuilding juggernaut has the momentum to build that. But there's a technological hurdle it may seek to overcome beforehand to facilitate its blue-water ambitions.

China's carriers are all conventionally powered, meaning that without refueling support abroad, they have limited reach. Beijing appears to be working on nuclear-powered propulsion tech for a future carrier though. China already operates nuclear-powered submarines, but all surface ships are conventional.

China is suspected to have begun work on a fourth carrier, but it's unclear if it will feature nuclear power. If it is, it'll be another significant example of the leaps China is making in aircraft carrier technology. But like everything else, new technology also comes with a host of new challenges and learning curves. China will need to continue to build personnel with experience and skillsets to clear those obstacles to effective operational use.

President Donald Trump told Israel on Friday to immediately stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agreed to release hostages and some other terms in a U.S. plan to end the war, but vexing issues like disarmament appeared unresolved.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel was preparing for an "immediate implementation" of the first stage of Trump's Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas' response.

The Palestinian militant group on Friday issued its response to Trump's 20-point plan after the U.S. president gave Hamas until Sunday to accept or face grave consequences.

Trump, who has cast himself as the only person capable of achieving peace in Gaza, has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a two-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands and left U.S. ally Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage.

Trump said he believed Hamas had shown it was "ready for a lasting PEACE" and he put the onus on Netanyahu's government.

"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 

"We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East."

Netanyahu's office said Israel "will continue to work in full cooperation with the President and his team to end the war in accordance with the principles set out by Israel, which align with President Trump's vision."

According to residents, Israeli tanks bombarded Talateeni Street, a major artery in the heart of Gaza City, after Trump's message to Israel to stop.

Witnesses said Israeli military planes also intensified bombing in Gaza City in the hour after Hamas issued its statement, hitting several houses in the Remal neighborhood.

There were also strikes on Khan Younis but no reports of casualties, residents said.

Israel, which backs Trump's proposal, has not yet commented on the Hamas response or on Trump's demand for an end to bombing in Gaza.

But Israel's parliamentary opposition leader Yair Lapid urged Netanyahu to move forward with the plan. In a post on X he said: "Israel should announce it is joining the discussions led by the president to finalize the details of the deal."

Families of those being held by Hamas in Gaza called on Netanyahu "to immediately order negotiations for the return of all hostages."

Domestically, the prime minister is caught between growing pressure to end the war — from hostage families and a war-weary public — and demands from hardline members of his far-right coalition who insist there must be no let-up in Israel's campaign in Gaza.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who spearheaded efforts for wider recognition of a Palestinian state in a bid to help end the conflict, said in a post on X: "Hamas' commitment must be followed up without delay."

Israel began its offensive in Gaza after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken as hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says 48 hostages remain, 20 of whom are alive.

Israel's military campaign has killed more than 66,000 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health authorities. Its assault has destroyed much of the strip while aid restrictions have triggered a famine in parts of Gaza, with conditions dire across the enclave.

A U.N. Commission of Inquiry and multiple human rights experts have concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza. Netanyahu's government says it has acted in self-defense.

Hamas, in a copy of its response seen by Reuters, did not say if it would agree to disarm and demilitarize Gaza — something Israel and the U.S. want but Hamas has rejected before.

It also did not agree to an Israeli withdrawal in stages, as opposed to the immediate, full withdrawal Hamas demands.

A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel's occupation of the enclave ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties as the war approaches its two-year mark.

Qatar has begun coordination with mediator Egypt and the United States to continue talks on Trump's Gaza plan, the Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson said on X.

Trump's plan specifies an immediate ceasefire, an exchange of all hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the introduction of a transitional government led by an international body.

In its response to Trump's plan, Hamas said it "appreciates the Arab, Islamic, and international efforts, as well as the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump, calling for an end to the war on the Gaza Strip, the exchange of prisoners, (and) the immediate entry of aid," among other terms.

It said it was announcing its "approval of releasing all occupation prisoners — both living and remains — according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange."

But Hamas added: "In this context, the movement affirms its readiness to immediately enter, through the mediators, into negotiations to discuss the details."

The group said it was ready "to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing."

Hamas did not make clear whether it would agree to Trump's proposal that it be barred from exercising political power in Gaza. But the group said it should be "included and will contribute" to any Palestinian national discussion on Gaza's future.

Hamas has previously offered to release all hostages and to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a different body.

Earlier on Friday, Trump warned that "all HELL" would break out in Gaza if Hamas failed to agree to his proposal for the enclave by Sunday at 6 p.m. ET.

Hamas was not involved in the negotiations that led to the proposal.

Young Brits are catching flak for their apparent lack of entrepreneurial drive, sparking a broader debate on whether the U.K. startup scene is facing an ambition deficit.

It started when U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle criticized British university students for lacking the same interest in starting a business as their American peers.

"In Britain, if you went to a group of undergraduates, how big would that group have to be before you found someone that said their choice of going to university…was because they wanted to become a founder?" Kyle said at an event hosted by AI chipmaker Nvidia in London.

"The entrepreneurialism simply isn't there – the drive, the vigour."

He's not alone; the tech and startup scene in the U.K. is often viewed as lacking the same intensity and speed as its counterparts in the U.S. and China.

It's led some venture capitalists to suggest that European founders need to work harder and adopt the rigorous "996" work schedule — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week — infamous at China's tech companies.

The stereotypes are not necessarily backed up by the data, however. Almost 60% of young British people were interested in starting their own business, according to a recent study conducted by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) and Simply Business of 2,079 people between the ages of 18 and 34 in the U.K.

However, only 16% of them actually took the leap into entrepreneurship, with most citing a lack of formal business education as holding them back.

"There's definitely a large appetite to explore entrepreneurship from a very young age," Dama Sathianathan, senior partner at Bethnal Green Ventures, told CNBC Make It.

"It's just getting really hard to show ambition when the system is rigged against you … You don't have the right supportive infrastructure to be able to tap into money, to really have the drive to aim high."

Bristol-based entrepreneur Tom Wallace-Smith made Forbes 30 under 30 in Europe last year — but he said entrepreneurship feels out of reach to most people in the U.K.

"From people's public perceptions, the whole track of Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg feels quite mythological to people, it's totally out of someone's reach," Wallace said in an interview with CNBC Make It.

Wallace, who co-founded nuclear fusion startup Astral Systems in 2021 while finishing a PhD in nuclear physics at the University of Bristol, said he initially didn't know that entrepreneurship was a viable career path, and expected to end up in a big company or become an academic.

He argued that the U.K. has no shortage of successful entrepreneurs, but the government and media "could do a better job of telling founders' stories" and increasing exposure to startup environments.

A lot of people in the U.K. see entrepreneurship represented via comedic reality TV shows like The Apprentice or Dragons' Den, Wallace-Smith said, and are lacking role models. "It's more about making fun of them rather than championing them."  

The FSB and Simply Business survey found that 15% of young current or aspiring entrepreneurs said that seeing others succeed would boost their confidence, but over a third hadn't recieved any guidance or support from local entrepreneurs or businesses.

Harry Stebbings, venture capitalist and founder of the 20VC podcast, puts some of the blame at the door of "risk-off" British parents, with the instability surrounding entrepreneurship making it an unattractive career path.

Instead, Stebbings — who's a champion of the 996 work week — said young people seem to aspire to work at corporate firms like Goldman Sachs, and McKinsey.

Astral System's Wallace-Smith said many U.K. entrepreneurs aren't seeing enough "direct incentive" to scale and grow in the U.K. as opposed to the U.S. — indicating that it's largely a structural issue that's fueling the entrepreneurship deficit.

"The ones that are left in the U.K. are here with gritted teeth, like by hook or by crook, to make sure that we have success in the U.K. because I just care about the country and I want to see this succeed here… It's more of an outlier than the standard," he said.

Atomico's State of European Tech 2024 identified a talent leakage to the U.S., with at least 800 companies that could have been founded in Europe instead being established across the Atlantic.

It also found that established startups trying to scale up past the seed funding stage tend to struggle to secure investment. In fact, twice as many U.S. companies — 8.3% — raise rounds of $15 million or more, compared with Europe's 4.1%.

Additionally, half of European companies have tuned to the U.S. to secure a lead investor since 2015, according to the report.

Although risk appetite continues to exist among British entrepreneurs, it doesn't for investors, Sathianathan said, noting that VCs in the U.K. don't want to risk their money.

Damian Routley, a chief operating officer at venture studio and startup accelerator Founders Factory, said the financial incentives for founding a company as a young person are "increasingly weak." with tax reliefs for both entrepreneurs and investors diminishing since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.

The lifetime allowance for Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) has been slashed from £10 million ($13.45 million) to £1 million, while Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rates have risen, leaving founders with smaller payouts when they sell their companies.

"This all means it's harder to take the plunge and launch a business than to go for the safety of a PAYE [Pay As You Earn] grad job," he told CNBC Make It.

Meanwhile, some early-stage funding incentives are considered generous, but are focused on investors, leaving many startups struggling to secure the capital they need to grow.

"It's a structural issue, which then seeps into it becoming a cultural issue, because if you're faced with continuously having to struggle, why would you choose to struggle on this entrepreneur path?" Sathianathan added.

It's not all doom and gloom, though, as the U.K. remains "Europe's premier startup hub," Routley said.

In 2024, £9 billion was invested into venture-backed businesses in the U.K., maintaining the country's position as the third-largest VC market behind the U.S. and China, according to the British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association's Venture Capital in the UK 2025 report.

Various incubators and accelerators have also been set up to encourage young people to go into business. Alongside Founders Factory, others include SETsquared, UCL's Hatchery, and Techstars.

Additionally, 20VC's Stebbings recently launched Europe's equivalent of the Thiel Fellowship — a program which gives $200,000 to young people under the age of 22 who want to build innovative startups. Alumnis of the U.S. program include billionaire Lucy Guo to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

Stebbing's Project Europe, backed by 128 different founders from firms including Klarna, Mistral and Soundcloud, is a fund which will award 200,000 euros ($234,684) to select founders who are 25 years old or younger.

However, the U.K.'s House of Lords' Communications and Digital Committee warned earlier this year that the U.K. is at risk of becoming an "incubator economy" — as ideation remains strong, but the ability to scale and grow remains weak.

"If we can't solve our pathways to capital markets and incentivise sovereign IP [intellectual property] to stay here, then we risk losing our best companies to better structured regimes with greater liquidity potential," Routley said. "The ambition is there, but the ladder is missing a few rungs."

BEIJING — China's economic slowdown isn't discouraging U.S. and European brands from revamping their strategies to reach Chinese shoppers.

Instead, the allure of the world's second-largest consumer market is forcing companies to adapt in the face of growing competition from local brands.

In the case of Kraft Heinz, getting more people in China to buy ketchup this year also meant hiring a local agency to help create catchy campaigns — decorating subway station columns to mimic ketchup bottles and promoting the condiment as a fresh twist on a popular dish: stir-fried eggs and tomatoes.

It's a hard market to tackle, even for Shanghai-based marketing firm Good Idea Growth Network (GGN). The agency has witnessed at least five different waves of consumer trends in its 14-year history, founder Stephy Liu, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. "The gameplay keeps on changing."

But GGN has succeeded even after rejecting an acquisition offer from British advertising giant WPP, Liu said, noting that about half of her clients are foreign brands.

While Kraft Heinz isn't done with its China ketchup campaign yet, the company reported second-quarter net sales in emerging markets climbed by 4.2% from a year ago, helping offset declines in North America.

WPP explored a potential acquisition of GGN but did not end up going far in the process, according to a person familiar with the discussions.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

From Starbucks' struggles to Lululemon's successes in China, it's become clear that the right mix of localization is essential.

"Among international brands in China, the winners are often dedicating more than 40% of revenue to marketing, especially content and platform-first marketing, while also iterating products locally based on market data," said Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps foreign brands sell in China.

This year, Cooke said that Under Armour has created products under 100 yuan ($14) in order to attract a mass of buyers online, while using livestreams with dedicated users to then build fitness communities and sell more premium products offline.

ByteDance-owned Douyin has become an e-commerce force in the last few years since celebrities and companies started using the app for livestreaming sales during the pandemic. And by the numbers, there's little question that jumping into the Xiaohongshu and Douyin world is worthwhile for businesses.

Adapting to that new social commerce ecosystem has become the biggest challenge for brands in the last two years, GGN's Liu said. "Foreign brands will think, 'Isn't this just TikTok?'"

She warned that success requires a complex strategy that can involve changing everything from how a team is structured to the kinds of products sold. But the payoff is significant.

"In half a year, it can help you sell more than you sold on [Alibaba's] Tmall in two years," Liu said.

In addition to social media, a critical factor in many companies' strategies is access to hordes of data on what consumers in China are buying.

Chinese e-commerce platforms, including Alibaba's Tmall, share far more data on what's popular than Amazon.com does, WPIC's Cooke said. In China, "people generally know what their competitors are selling and what they're selling for."

With that granular data, Chinese makeup brand Perfect Diary was able to succeed by identifying a market pain point and creating a lipstick targeted at that lower price segment, Cooke said. He noted that's pressured foreign brands to create China-specific products as well, a big shift over the last five years.

E-commerce platforms in China also often show rough figures on how many orders were placed per product, while third-party companies such as Syntun offer significant amounts of product rankings and other online sales data for free.

In the case of Apple's iPhone 17 launch on Sept. 19, it was Chinese e-commerce company JD.com that released sales data for mainland China. The electronics-focused platform announced that the first minute of iPhone 17 series preorders surpassed the first-day preorder volume of last year's iPhone 16 series.

Apple's story also underscores how it's possible to reignite local interest despite losing market share to domestic competition. Some customers in Beijing told CNBC that they liked the iPhone's new cosmic orange color, and that more locals intended to buy their first iPhone this year since they'd heard about new attractive features such as larger internal storage.

China's factories were quick to jump on the trend, releasing iPhone cases with a similar orange hue even before the 17 model was out.

"Winning brands are those that have established local R&D centers and on-the-ground product teams," said Ashley Dudarenok, founder of ChoZan, a China marketing consultancy. "This allows them to spot trends early, develop products tailored to local needs, and launch them in months, not years. This is a significant departure from the past, where global products were often simply rolled out in the Chinese market."

Even with the right data and social media platforms, cultural integration is becoming increasingly important, especially as Chinese brands find success in tapping the country's own history of artisanal craftsmanship.

"Brands are moving beyond superficial nods to Chinese culture," Dudarenok said. She pointed out that Loewe partnered with jade carving masters, while Burberry teamed up with bamboo-weaving artists.

And despite declining sales in China's luxury market, LVMH this summer opened an eye-catching ship-shaped store in Shanghai — immediately generating much local buzz.

In contrast to LVMH's luggage-shaped store in Manhattan, the Shanghai location taps into the Chinese city's history as a port of entry for international travelers to Asia roughly a century ago.

The new store also captures the European brand's roots in hand-crafted travel trunks — which contrasts with Chinese brands' inability to offer the same emotional appeal, Joe Ngai, chairman of greater China at McKinsey, pointed out in a LinkedIn post.

"As Chinese customers grow in their confidence and desire for local elements," he said, "creating more crossovers between West and East is one of the unique opportunities for multinationals in China."

Oops, something went wrong

President Donald Trump said this week that his administration is exploring a “distribution” of as much as $2,000 apiece to the American people on account of the funds generated by his tariff policies.

“We also might make a distribution to the people, almost like a dividend to the people of America," the president said in an interview with One America News. “We're thinking maybe $1,000-$2,000.” 

The last time stimulus checks hit the bank accounts of American citizens, up to an estimated $40 billion was expected to be used to buy stocks and Bitcoin.

Stimulus checks were sent to American citizens as part of a $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed under the first Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, leading to a surge in Bitcoin and stocks. 

In 2021, with President Joe Biden then in office, another round of stimulus was approved, once more providing Americans with annual incomes below $150,000 with additional checks of up to $1,400. 

If you had invested that first $1,200 into Bitcoin, which was changing hands at $6,878 at the close of April 11, 2020—the first day of direct deposit stimulus payments—then you would have around 0.1744 BTC, worth about $21,270 today. That represents a gain of 1,672%.

Injecting the other two checks into Bitcoin as soon as possible would have provided around another 0.0424 BTC or $5,170 based on the current price

In total, around $3,200 in stimulus checks could have netted you more than $26,000 in Bitcoin if invested in the leading cryptocurrency during those windows.

Though a strong gain, the number pales in comparison to the gains accumulated should you have jammed the funds immediately into Dogecoin. At the meme coin's 2021 peak, which took place just after the final stimulus, the three stimulus checks would have netted you around 600,000 Dogecoin (DOGE)—about $438,000 worth at its peak.

What Next for the UK's $7 Billion in Seized Bitcoin?

If you held it all until today, you'd still have nearly $150,000—a gain of more than 4,576%. 

Formal details about the Trump administration's teased tariff checks remain outstanding, but $2,000 would allow investors to snatch about 0.0165 BTC at present time—over 1.6% of a full coin. Who knows how much that'll be worth in five years, but if Bitcoin's history is any indication, then it could be a bet worth making.

Many investors are currently viewing bitcoin through an end-of-cycle lens, suggesting that Q4 could mark the close of the current market cycle. However, two key metrics point to the possibility that the bull market may actually be in its early stages.

Glassnode data shows that the 200-week moving average (200WMA), which smooths bitcoin's price over a long-term horizon and has historically only trended upwards, has just breached $53,000. 

Meanwhile, the realized price, the average price at which all bitcoin in circulation last moved onchain, has just risen above the 200-WMA at $54,000.

Looking back at previous cycles, we see a consistent pattern. In bull markets, the realized price tends to stay above the 200-WMA, while in bear markets, the opposite occurs. 

For example, in the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, the realized price steadily climbed higher and widened its gap above the 200-WMA, before eventually collapsing below it and signaling the start of the bear markets. 

While, during the downturn of 2022, the realized price fell below the 200-WMA, it has only recently moved above it. Historically, once the realized price remains above this long-term moving average, bitcoin has tended to push higher as the bull market progresses.

This period is marked by strategic collaborations, groundbreaking technological advancements, and a renewed focus on integrating AI, decentralized technologies, and sustainable solutions, setting the stage for a future where digital and physical worlds increasingly converge.

The immediate implications of this innovation wave are multi-faceted. In the tech sphere, artificial intelligence is transcending its foundational applications, evolving into sophisticated agentic systems capable of autonomous planning and execution, while spatial computing begins to blur the lines between reality and digital overlays. Concurrently, the crypto landscape is shedding its speculative skin, maturing into a robust financial ecosystem driven by regulatory clarity, mainstream institutional adoption, and the tokenization of real-world assets. This dual evolution signals not just a technological shift but a fundamental re-architecture of economic and social paradigms.

The current wave of innovation is characterized by several distinct, yet interconnected, frontiers. In the realm of technology, Agentic AI has emerged as a significant development, with autonomous systems now capable of planning and executing complex tasks to achieve user-defined goals. This is complemented by a growing emphasis on AI governance, providing frameworks to manage the ethical, legal, and operational performance of these increasingly intelligent systems. Concurrently, Spatial Computing, encompassing augmented and virtual reality, is digitally enhancing our physical world, offering immersive experiences across diverse sectors from gaming to e-commerce.

Beyond AI, advanced computing paradigms are pushing boundaries. Hybrid computing is gaining traction for its ability to combine various compute, storage, and network mechanisms, creating highly efficient innovation environments. The imperative for future security is also driving advancements in Post-Quantum Cryptography, anticipating and addressing the threats posed by nascent quantum computing capabilities. Furthermore, Sustainability Tech is witnessing substantial investment, driven by both consumer demand and regulatory mandates. Innovations in hydrogen fuel cells, advanced solar technologies, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are becoming pivotal, with major players like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) committing to carbon-negative operations by 2030. Companies like Agnikul, pioneering 3D-printed rockets, and Astroforge, developing spacecraft for asteroid mining, exemplify the audacious spirit of these tech pioneers.

In the cryptocurrency domain, October 2025 finds a market invigorated by regulatory clarity. The U.S. has seen significant progress with legislation such as the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act" (GENIUS Act), which provides a comprehensive framework for stablecoin regulation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also showing a more accommodating stance, easing requirements for exchange-traded products (ETPs) and inviting discussions on tokenized securities. This newfound clarity has fueled institutional integration, with traditional finance (TradFi) giants like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Fidelity, Stripe, and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) deepening their engagement with crypto, driving innovation in tokenized assets and payments. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) is actively pursuing a National Trust Company Charter to further bridge the crypto economy with the traditional financial system. A cornerstone of this maturation is Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization, enabling fractional ownership and improved liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate and bonds. The convergence of AI and Crypto is also a transformative trend, with AI being leveraged for market analysis, risk management, optimization of trading strategies, and even managing blockchain scalability, as seen in projects like Aiccelsrate. Bitcoin's performance, fluctuating between $110,000 and $120,000, has further energized the market, contributing to an "Uptober" sentiment and a thriving presale market for new altcoins.

This era of intense innovation is creating clear winners and posing significant challenges for others. Technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are positioned to win big, not only through their aggressive investments in AI and cloud computing but also through their commitment to sustainability, which resonates with increasingly environmentally conscious markets and regulatory bodies. Their strategic roadmapping, leveraging cloud technologies for scalability and integrating advanced enterprise applications, solidifies their leadership. Similarly, innovative startups such as Agnikul and Astroforge, though not publicly traded, represent the leading edge of disruptive technology, attracting significant venture capital and potentially setting the stage for future public offerings or acquisitions. Companies like Exowatt and Sweetch Energy, focused on modular energy systems and osmotic energy, are also poised for substantial growth in the green tech sector.

In the crypto space, established financial institutions that have embraced digital assets are emerging as significant winners. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Fidelity, and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) are leveraging their vast resources and client bases to integrate Bitcoin ETFs, tokenized funds, and explore direct acquisitions of digital assets. Their ability to navigate regulatory landscapes and build trust within traditional finance makes them crucial conduits for broader crypto adoption. Crypto-native companies like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) are also strong contenders, expanding their regulated offerings and actively fostering broader development through initiatives like open-sourcing design systems. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), with its substantial Bitcoin holdings, continues to benefit from the asset's upward trajectory. Furthermore, blockchain infrastructure developers and platforms that facilitate RWA tokenization are set to thrive, as this trend unlocks immense value from previously illiquid assets.

Conversely, companies that are slow to adapt to these rapid changes risk falling behind. Legacy tech companies that fail to integrate AI effectively into their products and services, or those neglecting sustainable practices, may face declining market relevance and increased regulatory scrutiny. Similarly, traditional financial institutions that resist engaging with tokenized assets and decentralized finance risk losing market share to more agile competitors. The increasing demand for sustainable solutions means that industries and companies with high carbon footprints and no clear transition strategy could face significant financial and reputational penalties. The "developer shortage" in highly specialized tech areas also poses a challenge; companies that don't invest in talent development or leverage low-code/no-code platforms may struggle to innovate at the required pace.

The current innovation surge is not merely about new products; it represents a fundamental reshaping of industries and societies. The trend of Ubiquitous AI signifies that AI is transitioning from an exploratory technology to a fundamental enabler across all sectors. Generative AI, in particular, is becoming deeply embedded in business workflows, enhancing everything from customer engagement to product development. This deep integration will necessitate a skilled workforce capable of collaborating with AI, potentially leading to new job categories and a redefinition of existing roles.

The convergence of technologies—specifically AI, IoT, and blockchain—is creating powerful synergies. This integration, particularly within industry-specific cloud platforms, is leading to more profound insights, streamlined processes, and the creation of more agile and AI-assisted supply chains. This will likely result in increased efficiency and transparency across global commerce. Human-Machine Synergy, driven by innovations like spatial computing and neurological enhancement, is poised to bring together the physical and digital worlds, leading to augmented human capabilities and new forms of interaction with technology.

Regulatory and policy implications are significant. The progress with stablecoin legislation (GENIUS Act) and the SEC's evolving stance on ETPs and tokenized securities signal a global trend towards more structured oversight, which, while providing certainty, will also demand compliance from market participants. This regulatory clarity is crucial for fostering continued institutional investment. Historically, periods of rapid technological advancement, such as the internet boom or the industrial revolution, have always been accompanied by the need for new regulatory frameworks to manage growth, mitigate risks, and ensure equitable access. The emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in several nations is another critical development, potentially altering global financial systems and even becoming a tool for nation-states to advance geopolitical interests, mirroring historical shifts in currency dominance.

Looking ahead, the short-term and long-term possibilities emanating from this innovation wave are vast and transformative. In the immediate future, widespread adoption of blockchain technology by financial institutions is anticipated, alongside increased retail adoption fueled by traditional financial instruments integrating digital assets. The DeFi (Decentralized Finance) sector is projected to reach new heights, with trading volumes potentially exceeding $4 trillion and Total Value Locked (TVL) nearing $200 billion by year-end 2025, signaling a maturation and mainstreaming of decentralized financial services.

Longer-term, the emergence of new use cases for Web3 will drive further adoption. This includes continued innovation in NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), the expansion of the metaverse, the evolution of gaming (particularly "Play-to-Own" models), and the growth of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs). These applications will fundamentally change how we interact with digital assets, create value, and build communities. The continued development and potential introduction of CBDCs by various nations will also be a critical area to watch, as they could reshape monetary policy and cross-border transactions.

Strategic pivots and adaptations will be required across all sectors. Businesses must prioritize responsible innovation, leveraging cloud technologies for scalability, integrating advanced enterprise applications for efficiency, and strengthening cybersecurity to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. For investors, market opportunities will emerge in companies leading in AI development, sustainable technologies, and robust blockchain infrastructure. Challenges include navigating the inherent volatility of nascent technologies, managing regulatory uncertainties, and addressing concerns about the potential for AI market power to become too centralized, which could stifle open experimentation. Potential scenarios range from a seamless, integrated digital future to one marked by significant regulatory hurdles and geopolitical competition over technological dominance.

The current epoch of tech and crypto innovation represents a pivotal moment in our digital evolution. The key takeaways are clear: AI is becoming ubiquitous, transforming industries with agentic systems and deep integration into workflows. Crypto is maturing, driven by regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and the tokenization of real-world assets. The convergence of AI and blockchain is creating powerful synergies, offering solutions for optimization, security, and decentralization. Furthermore, sustainability is no longer an afterthought but a core driver of innovation, with green tech attracting significant investment.

Moving forward, the market is poised for continued dynamism. Investors should assess companies based on their ability to adapt and lead in these interconnected domains. Those with strong AI integration strategies, a commitment to sustainable practices, and a clear vision for leveraging decentralized technologies are likely to outperform. The increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets suggests a growing stability in the crypto market, though volatility remains an inherent characteristic.

The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market, once a glittering beacon of digital innovation and speculative wealth, finds itself in a profound state of recalibration as of October 2025. What began as a meteoric rise, fueled by celebrity endorsements and unprecedented hype, has largely given way to a sobering reality where many investors are counting significant losses. The initial gold rush mentality, where digital JPEGs commanded millions, has dissipated, replaced by a cautious, often skeptical, sentiment as the market grapples with maturity, utility, and the harsh realities of speculative bubbles.

MarketMinute's analysis reveals a sector attempting to pivot from pure speculation to tangible utility, yet still reeling from a dramatic contraction. While overall market capitalization shows some resilience, trading volumes have plummeted from their 2021-2022 peaks, and revenue projections for 2025 indicate a significant decline. This downturn is largely attributed to fading speculative hype, a strong correlation with volatile cryptocurrency prices, dwindling retail interest, and the inherent illiquidity of many NFT assets, leaving countless early adopters trapped in holdings now deemed "essentially worthless."

The genesis of NFTs can be traced back to the niche corners of the blockchain world in the mid-2010s, with early projects like CryptoPunks (Ethereum) (Larva Labs) in 2017 laying the groundwork for digital ownership. However, it was the phenomenon of CryptoKitties (Ethereum) in late 2017 that first demonstrated the mainstream appeal and potential for digital collectibles, causing significant network congestion and sparking early interest in platforms like OpenSea (Ethereum). The market steadily grew, with 2020 seeing a 299% surge in transaction value, but the true explosion occurred in 2021. This year marked the "NFT Summer," propelled by digital artist Beeple's historic sale of "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" for a staggering $69 million at Christie's in March, catapulting NFTs into global headlines and attracting a wave of new investors and creators.

The boom intensified with the emergence of iconic collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (Ethereum) (Yuga Labs), launched in April 2021, which quickly became a cultural touchstone and a status symbol for celebrities and early adopters. Other major players included Axie Infinity (Ethereum), pioneering the play-to-earn gaming model, and NBA Top Shot (Flow) (Dapper Labs), offering licensed digital sports moments. Marketplaces like OpenSea (Ethereum) dominated trading, handling billions in volume, while platforms like Rarible (Ethereum) and Foundation (Ethereum) also saw significant activity. Celebrities played a crucial role in amplifying the hype, with figures like Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Justin Bieber, and Mila Kunis either purchasing high-value NFTs, launching their own collections, or openly endorsing the technology, further fueling the speculative frenzy. January 2022 marked the peak, with a record $17.2 billion in monthly sales volume.

However, the euphoria was short-lived. By early 2022, the market began a sharp decline, turning into a "long winter" by Q2 2025. This precipitous fall was driven by a confluence of factors: market saturation with countless low-quality projects, the inevitable bursting of a speculative bubble where prices became detached from intrinsic value, and a broader economic downturn that shifted investor focus away from risky assets. Furthermore, the inherent lack of real-world utility for many NFTs, coupled with rampant scams, fraud, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty, eroded investor confidence. High transaction costs on popular blockchains and environmental concerns also contributed to the exodus. The once-dominant OpenSea (Ethereum) saw its daily trading volumes shrink from $200 million daily peaks to under $5 million by May 2025, a stark indicator of the market's contraction. The shift in market dynamics moved from a focus on quick profits and PFP collections to a demand for utility, real-world applications, and more robust, sustainable projects.

The dramatic shift in the NFT market from speculative fervor to a demand for tangible utility has profoundly impacted companies operating within this ecosystem, creating clear winners and those facing significant headwinds. Marketplaces, once solely focused on high-volume PFP sales, are now adapting to a more discerning user base. OpenSea (Private), the former titan of NFT trading, is aggressively pivoting to become a multi-asset on-chain trading portal, launching its native token (SEA) and expanding support across 19 blockchains to incentivize engagement. While this demonstrates a proactive strategy, its mixed outlook reflects the challenge of reclaiming dominance amidst fierce competition from platforms like Blur (Private), which has successfully captured professional traders with its reward-based incentives and lower fees, and Magic Eden (Private), which continues to thrive on the Solana (SOL) blockchain due to its efficiency and lower transaction costs.

Game developers and luxury brands are proving to be fertile ground for utility-driven NFTs. Animoca Brands (Private), a powerhouse in blockchain gaming and Web3 investment, is strategically diversifying its portfolio beyond just game development into advisory services and AI, reporting substantial growth in 2024. This broad investment and focus on digital property rights position it strongly. Similarly, Yuga Labs (Private), the creator of Bored Ape Yacht Club (Ethereum), is undergoing a significant restructuring, with co-founder Greg Solano returning as CEO to refocus on its Otherside (Ethereum) metaverse and deliver tangible utility to its token holders. Their success hinges on effective execution of this ambitious metaverse vision. In the luxury sector, brands like Louis Vuitton (LVMH:PA) and Gucci (KER:PA) are clear winners, leveraging NFTs for exclusive "phygital" products, enhancing customer engagement, and combating counterfeits through initiatives like Louis Vuitton's "Via" NFT project and Gucci's "Gucci Vault." Nike (NKE:NYSE), despite winding down its RTFKT acquisition, is strategically integrating Web3 elements directly into its core brand through platforms like .SWOOSH, indicating a shift towards direct customer engagement and loyalty.

Underpinning this evolving landscape are the blockchain infrastructure providers. Layer-2 solutions like Immutable X (Private) and Polygon Labs (Private) (oversees Polygon blockchain) are emerging as critical enablers, particularly for gaming NFTs. Immutable X's focus on scalable, cost-effective infrastructure for gaming has led to a 25% annual increase in active wallets linked to gaming NFTs. Polygon's affordability and speed make it attractive for high-transaction-volume applications. Similarly, the Solana (SOL) blockchain continues to gain traction for its fast transaction speeds and lower fees, becoming a preferred platform for developers building utility-focused NFTs. These infrastructure providers are essential for the long-term health and expansion of the utility-driven NFT market, facilitating the shift away from speculative assets towards functional digital tools and experiences.

The tumultuous journey of the NFT market, from a speculative frenzy to a more discerning landscape, holds profound wider significance for the burgeoning Web3 and digital economy. At its core, NFTs are foundational to the Web3 ethos, enabling true digital ownership and empowering creators by providing verifiable proof of authenticity and allowing for new monetization models, including direct sales and automated royalties. They are the "silent engines" driving metaverse economies, representing everything from virtual real estate to in-game assets, and are increasingly integrating with decentralized finance (DeFi) and the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). This shift towards utility-driven NFTs signifies a maturation, moving beyond mere collectibles to becoming integral components of a decentralized digital future.

The ripple effects of this evolution are reshaping traditional industries. In the art world, NFTs have democratized access, allowing artists to bypass traditional gatekeepers and directly monetize digital creations, while also introducing new forms like generative and interactive art. The gaming industry is undergoing a paradigm shift with "Play-to-Earn" models and true ownership of in-game assets, fostering new player economies and potential interoperability across different virtual worlds. Financial services are also being transformed, with NFTs enabling fractional ownership of real estate and other securities, enhancing liquidity, and streamlining trading processes through tokenization. This creates entirely new asset classes and financial products, pushing the boundaries of traditional finance.

As of October 2025, the regulatory landscape for NFTs is finally gaining some much-needed clarity, particularly in the United States. A pivotal U.S. federal court ruling recently dismissed a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs (Private) regarding Bored Ape Yacht Club (Ethereum) NFTs and ApeCoin, asserting that these assets do not qualify as securities under the Howey Test. This decision provides a crucial precedent, narrowing the scope of SEC enforcement for digital collectibles marketed with access-based perks rather than as speculative financial instruments. Furthermore, reports indicate a potential reclassification of meme coins and NFTs as "collectibles" under the Trump administration, shifting oversight from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this move towards principles-based regulation is seen as a catalyst for innovation, challenges persist, including market illiquidity, metadata centralization risks, and ongoing global regulatory fragmentation, alongside potential tax implications for collectibles.

The NFT market's boom and bust cycle draws striking parallels to historical asset bubbles, most notably the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Both periods were characterized by intense speculative hype, overconfidence, and investments driven by the promise of rapid gains, often detached from underlying fundamentals, leading to exponential growth followed by a sharp correction. However, a key distinction lies in the current emphasis on utility. Unlike many dot-com ventures that lacked viable business models, the evolving NFT market is increasingly focused on practical applications across diverse industries. While still susceptible to volatility, this pivot towards tangible use cases suggests a potential for long-term value creation that extends beyond pure speculation, marking a critical phase in its development.

As of October 2025, the NFT market is charting a course towards a more mature and utility-driven future, moving decisively beyond the speculative excesses of its early boom. In the short term, the market is solidifying its pivot towards practical applications, with a notable increase in the number of transactions, even as overall trading volumes have tempered. The global NFT market is projected to reach approximately $61 billion this year, buoyed by continuous infrastructure improvements like more efficient Layer 2 solutions and heightened competition among alternative Layer 1 blockchains, which collectively reduce transaction fees and enhance user experience. The recent rally in Bitcoin, nearing $115,000, has also injected renewed enthusiasm and investor interest into the broader crypto and NFT ecosystem.

Looking further ahead, the long-term outlook for NFTs is one of dramatic expansion. Projections suggest the global NFT market could soar to between $211.7 billion and $247 billion by 2030, potentially reaching $703.47 billion by 2034. NFTs are increasingly recognized as an indispensable component of the Web3 infrastructure, poised to fundamentally redefine digital ownership and intellectual property rights. They are seen as a crucial gateway for mainstream crypto adoption, attracting millions through engaging and practical applications that extend far beyond simple digital collectibles.

This evolving landscape presents significant market opportunities and strategic pivots. Web3 gaming and the metaverse are emerging as major catalysts, with "Play-to-Earn" and "Play-to-Own" models empowering players with true ownership of in-game assets and fostering new virtual economies. The virtual real estate market, where NFTs represent property deeds, is also projected for substantial growth. Perhaps the most disruptive trend is Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, where NFTs are used to tokenize physical assets like real estate, art, and luxury goods, enabling fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity, and reducing fraud. This market is projected to hit $50 billion in 2025, signaling its deep integration into mainstream finance. Additionally, NFTs are finding applications in digital identity, AI-generated content, event ticketing, supply chain transparency, and customer loyalty programs.

Despite the optimistic trajectory, challenges remain. Technical knowledge requirements, high costs (though improving), market saturation, and security concerns continue to be hurdles for creators. While regulatory clarity is emerging, especially in the U.S., global inconsistencies and the inherent volatility linked to broader cryptocurrency prices still pose risks. However, ongoing innovations promise to address these challenges. Improved blockchain infrastructure, cross-chain interoperability, advanced AI integration for dynamic content and automation, and the development of dynamic and hybrid NFTs, along with fractionalization, are all on the horizon. These advancements, coupled with clearer regulatory frameworks, are set to foster a more secure, legitimate, and accessible NFT market, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The likely scenario is a "maturation" of the ecosystem, driven by innovation, institutional adoption, and a relentless focus on real-world utility.

The journey of the NFT market has been a spectacular, albeit turbulent, ride. From the dizzying heights of its speculative boom in 2021-2022, fueled by digital art and PFP collections commanding exorbitant prices, to the sobering market correction of 2023-2024, the sector has shed its initial froth. The key takeaway from this journey is a profound and irreversible pivot: from pure speculation and aesthetic appeal to a demand for practical applications and tangible utility. The "NFT Summer" may be a distant memory, but the underlying technology is now recognized as a legitimate digital asset class with diverse functionalities, moving beyond fleeting trends to become a foundational component of the digital economy.

As of October 2025, the NFT market is in a crucial phase of maturation. While overall trading volumes have tempered, the sheer number of transactions is on an upward trajectory, indicating broader adoption. The market is projected to reach approximately $61 billion this year, driven by the dominance of utility-driven NFTs, particularly in gaming, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and integrations with decentralized finance (DeFi). Technological advancements, including more efficient Layer 2 solutions and alternative Layer 1 blockchains, are enhancing accessibility and reducing costs. Crucially, recent regulatory clarity in the U.S., such as the dismissal of the Yuga Labs (Private) lawsuit and the potential reclassification of some NFTs as "collectibles," is providing much-needed legitimacy and easing investor apprehension.

Looking ahead, the future trajectory promises significant growth, with projections soaring into the hundreds of billions by 2030 and beyond. NFTs are poised to become the "silent engines of the digital economy," enabling stronger digital rights, streamlining systems, and unlocking novel opportunities across gaming, real estate, music, fashion, identity, and supply chain management. This enduring impact will redefine our perception of digital ownership, empower creators, foster new forms of community engagement, and bridge the gap between digital and physical realms. The "gold rush" is over; the market has entered a "real building phase" where sustainable projects with genuine utility will thrive.

For investors navigating this evolving landscape, a strategic and cautious approach is paramount. Prioritize utility and value over speculative hype, focusing on projects that offer clear, tangible benefits. Conduct thorough due diligence on the team, roadmap, community, and smart contracts. Understand your risk profile and allocate only a small, diversified percentage of your portfolio, as NFTs remain high-risk, low-liquidity investments. Stay informed on regulatory developments and monitor technological innovations like Layer 2s, cross-chain interoperability, and AI integration. Finally, consider the environmental sustainability of projects. The market is no longer about quick flips but about identifying robust, long-term value propositions in a rapidly maturing ecosystem.

Bank of England is at crossroads over the use of crytocurrencies and establishing a financial framework for transactions

There are those among us who like the idea of swiping and tapping their way through life, armed with a lifetime of digital information as they enter buildings, book online appointments and take train rides to work.

Others are not so keen, fearing that big brother databases chock full of personal details will one day control their movements, if that is not happening already.

In the case of cryptocurrencies, and even their nicer sounding cousins – stablecoins – the potential for users to be tracked and traced is writ large, with the added prospect of a shift to digital money leading to unemployment-inducing financial crashes even more frequently than in the past.

All the big financial centres, including London, have begun passing laws and consulting on rules to govern a future that is lubricated by digital money, pushing cash very much to one side.

The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said last week that he wanted to “put the UK at the forefront of exciting innovation” and that meant finding a way to facilitate competing stablecoins, backed by a robust regulatory regime.

While Bailey did not rule out the most secure form of digital currency – one issued by the central bank itself – it is clear from the way his officials are tackling the subject, this ship has sailed.

A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price.

Others, known as "algorithmic stablecoins", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse.

Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens.

So, like it or not, many and varied digital currencies are coming, bamboozling all but a minority of the population with impenetrable jargon and an impossibly long list of options.

As with all financial services, the urge to prey on customers' fear and greed is irresistible when it means the provider can get its hands on someone's savings and turn it into something more exciting, more profitable, and with the risk of default passed back to the customer (sorry, you've lost all your money) or the taxpayer (sorry, my bank is bust, can you bail it out).

A government that backed a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be justifiably saying to the finance industry, we need to control this thing because we are on the hook when it goes wrong.

The argument in favour of privatisation rests on the moral hazard created by an explicit promise by the public sector to bail out the losers. Much better to keep up the pretence that financial services companies, when caught in a collective tailspin, will be allowed to crash.

Rachel Reeves is one of many who want to go down the private route, attracting more and bigger finance companies to the UK.

There could be some immediate and practical benefits. Costs will also be lower, we are told, because without a bank standing in between the customer and the seller, charges on credit transactions could fall from 1.5%-3% towards 0.1%. Weekend payments would not have to wait until Monday to be reconciled.

Donald Trump is the architect of the most extreme version of private digital money. A well-known crypto currency supporter, he has also pushed for a financial services regime that supports dollar-backed stablecoins.

Congress has yet to fill in the vast gaps in the Genius Act, which was passed in the summer with bi-partisan backing, so it is difficult to know exactly how risky US stablecoins will be.

A clue can be found in the explicit ban on the Federal Reserve participating in the new regime. Such a move, in contrast with China's newly-minted, state-run stablecoin, tells us that the US will truly be the wild west of the world's digital currencies.

As the economics professor and Nobel prize winner Simon Johnson told the Guardian: “We have been here before. I couldn't tell you when the [stablecoin] crash will come or how severe it will be, but you know it's coming.”

Health warning: Nigel Farage would favour the Trumpian free-for-all.

For the UK, following mainland Europe was an option. It has already committed itself to a CBDC and has nine European banks in a consortium lining up a stablecoin for launch next year.

While the UK has rejected the US model, it must be legitimate to fear the knock-on effects from Trump's recklessness when so many US banks have outposts in London, along with many of the world's shadiest financial firms.

In 2021, when former deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe kicked off the stablecoin debate in a series of speeches, the message was clear: however tight the regulation, it would be too cumbersome and too slow to prevent risky behaviour from quickly becoming a systemic problem and even a full-blown banking crisis.

At the time, it looked like the UK and the EU would move in lockstep. In the years since, London's stance has moved westwards, to a mid-Atlantic spot that is supposed to capture the safety Brussels seeks with the competitive spirit that underpins the US model.

Maybe the UK central bank is clever enough to develop a system both safe and competitive. It's a tall order.

The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with whispers of a potential price recovery for Pi Coin, a digital currency associated with the Pi Network. Despite operating in a closed mainnet environment without official public trading, speculative IOU markets and fervent community engagement have fueled discussions about its future trajectory. As of October 4, 2025, the Pi Network remains in its Enclosed Mainnet phase, meaning any "recovery" is based on unofficial valuations and community sentiment rather than an open market listing. This unique situation presents both intrigue and caution for observers keen on understanding its immediate implications for the broader crypto landscape.

The narrative of Pi Coin's "recovery" is largely rooted in the persistent activity within its extensive community and the ongoing development efforts by the core team. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies launched on open mainnets, Pi Coin is "mined" through a mobile application, with users contributing to the network's security by simply checking in daily. The project has been in development for several years, with its initial launch in 2019. The timeline leading to this current state includes the launch of its Enclosed Mainnet in December 2021, which allowed for internal transactions and app development within the ecosystem but restricted external connectivity and official exchange listings.

Key players are primarily the Pi Core Team, led by Stanford Ph.D.s Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, who have consistently emphasized a utility-first approach before an open mainnet launch. The community, comprising tens of millions of "Pioneers" globally, acts as a significant stakeholder, driving adoption and engagement. Initial "market" reactions to positive development updates or increased utility within the enclosed ecosystem often manifest as heightened community enthusiasm and, in some speculative corners, increased IOU valuations. However, the true test will come with the eventual transition to an Open Mainnet, which is contingent on achieving specific utility and KYC (Know Your Customer) migration milestones.

Given Pi Coin's current status, there are no public companies directly trading Pi Coin on major exchanges that would immediately "win" or "lose" from its speculative recovery. However, the broader cryptocurrency infrastructure and certain tech companies could be indirectly affected. If Pi Network successfully transitions to an Open Mainnet and achieves widespread adoption, cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), Binance) could benefit from listing Pi Coin, attracting new users and trading volume. Similarly, Web3 infrastructure providers and decentralized application (dApp) developers building on the Pi ecosystem could see increased engagement and potential revenue streams.

Conversely, established payment networks or traditional financial institutions might view a highly successful, widely adopted Pi Network as a potential long-term competitor, particularly if it facilitates low-cost, cross-border transactions. Companies heavily invested in alternative mobile-first crypto projects might also face increased competition for user attention and developer talent. The "winners" in the short term are primarily the Pi Core Team and the dedicated Pioneers who have invested time in mining, hoping for a significant return on their early participation. The "losers" are harder to define, but overly speculative investors in IOU markets without understanding the project's fundamentals could face significant risks.

Pi Coin's journey, particularly its mobile-first mining approach and gradual rollout, represents a unique experiment in mass cryptocurrency adoption. Its potential recovery and eventual open mainnet launch could significantly influence broader industry trends, particularly concerning user acquisition and the development of real-world utility for digital currencies. If successful, it could validate the model of "mining" through non-intensive mobile engagement, potentially inspiring other projects to explore similar low-barrier-to-entry mechanisms.

The ripple effects could extend to competitors focusing on mobile crypto solutions or those aiming for widespread mainstream adoption. A successful Pi Network could demonstrate the power of community-driven growth and a deliberate, phased launch strategy. Regulatory or policy implications are substantial; a project with tens of millions of users would undoubtedly attract scrutiny from financial regulators worldwide regarding KYC, anti-money laundering (AML), and consumer protection. Historically, few projects have attempted such a broad, grassroots adoption strategy before a full market launch, making Pi Network a unique case study. Comparisons could be drawn to early Bitcoin (BTC) mining or even the initial phases of Ethereum (ETH), where community building preceded widespread market recognition, though Pi's mobile-centric and closed-network approach sets it apart.

The immediate future for Pi Coin hinges entirely on the Pi Core Team's ability to transition from the Enclosed Mainnet to an Open Mainnet. This critical step requires achieving two primary objectives: significant progress in the mass KYC verification of its user base and the development of substantial utility within the Pi ecosystem, demonstrated by a robust array of dApps and real-world use cases. Short-term possibilities include continued growth in the Enclosed Mainnet's utility and user migration, while long-term success depends on a successful open mainnet launch and subsequent listing on major exchanges.

Strategic pivots may involve focusing on specific geographic markets for utility development or partnering with established businesses to integrate Pi payments. Market opportunities could emerge for developers building on the Pi platform, creating innovative applications that leverage its massive user base. Challenges include overcoming regulatory hurdles, maintaining community engagement, and ensuring the network's security and scalability once fully open. Potential scenarios range from a highly successful launch that sees Pi Coin become a widely adopted digital currency to a more modest integration into the broader crypto ecosystem, or even a failure to meet the open mainnet conditions.

The discussion around Pi Coin's "price recovery" is a testament to its massive community and the anticipation surrounding its future. As of October 4, 2025, it's crucial to remember that Pi Coin is not yet publicly traded, and any valuations are speculative. Key takeaways include the unique mobile-mining model, the extensive community, and the deliberate, phased approach to its mainnet launch. The market moving forward will closely watch the Pi Core Team's progress on KYC and utility development, as these are the prerequisites for an Open Mainnet.

The lasting impact of Pi Network, should it succeed, could be in demonstrating a new model for crypto adoption and utility creation. Investors and enthusiasts should watch for official announcements regarding the Open Mainnet launch, the expansion of its ecosystem's utility, and any partnerships that could bolster its real-world use. Until then, Pi Coin remains an intriguing, yet largely speculative, player in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, with its true market value awaiting its official debut.

Walmart-backed fintech OnePay plans to roll out cryptocurrency trading and custody features in its app by the end of the year.

The service will let users buy, hold, and convert bitcoin and ether within the app, with crypto infrastructure provided by Chicago-based Zerohash, CNBC reports , citing sources familiar with the matter.

Though OnePay hasn't publicly confirmed the rollout, the move would put it in line with competitors like Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal, which already offer crypto trading to U.S. users.

Founded in 2021 by Walmart and venture firm Ribbit Capital, OnePay has been building what it calls an “everything app” for digital finance. Its existing services include high-yield savings accounts, debit and credit cards, peer-to-peer payments, and buy now, pay later options.

By adding crypto, OnePay is banking on the idea that its users, many of whom shop at Walmart's nearly 4,600 U.S. stores, will want to spend, save, or transfer crypto on the same platform they handle cash.

Though OnePay is closely tied to Walmart, the app is operated as a separate company to appeal to a broader user base, particularly Americans underserved by traditional banks.

Last month, Zerohash raised $104 million+ from firms including Morgan Stanley and Interactive Brokers to expand its crypto services for banks and fintechs.

Twelve years after launching as a cryptocurrency exchange, Mercado Bitcoin aims to be something entirely different.

Less focused on price charts and trading pairs, the São Paulo-based company now talks more about Brazil's central bank's PIX payments, digital fixed income, and streamlined remittances.

Mercado Bitcoin's head of corporate development, Daniel Cunha, told CoinDesk in an interview on the sidelines of the exchange's DAC 2025 conference that the firm wants to become the app where Brazilians manage their financial lives. A kind of “super app” for spending, saving, and investing.

Yet, calling MB a “super app” may not quite capture the essence of the strategy. Its leadership prefers a different term: a financial hub that blends legacy finance with blockchain, letting users tap into both without needing to understand either.

“The revolution happens when the protocol disappears,” Cunha told CoinDesk. “The customer doesn't want to hear about blockchains and tokens. They want to know the rate, the risk, and the maturity date,” he said, referring to the exchange's tokenized fixed income offerings.

That thinking has reshaped how MB presents itself to users. Instead of relying on crypto-native vocabulary, the company now emphasizes features in its offering. One major change involved scrapping the term “tokenization” in user-facing materials altogether, Cunha said.

“We tried a ton of variations,” Cunha said. “When we stopped saying ‘token' and started saying ‘digital fixed income,' things took off.” The idea is to have a product whose backend is powered by blockchain technology, but the frontend remains more recognizable to the masses. 

Essentially, MB's bet is that “invisible blockchain” is the next frontier.

“We're going to see a lot of people use blockchain without realizing they're using blockchain,” MB said. “That's when you know the revolution has happened.”

The firm's flagship blockchain-based investment products focus on tokenized private credit, a segment it believes is underserved and ripe for disruption in Brazil. 

Brazil ranks among the top five countries for retail crypto usage, according to Chainalysis' Global Crypto Adoption Index. MB is positioning itself as an answer to a pain point common in the country through a stablecoin-based remittance service.

Despite all the new initiatives, MB's core business, crypto trading, still accounts for the majority of its revenue. But that balance is shifting.

At its peak, trading made up 95% of the firm's income. Today, that number is closer to 60%, with the rest coming from payments, custody, tokenized investments, and services like asset management. Over time, the company expects trading to fall below 30%, Cunha revealed.

As part of that shift, the firm is also expanding geographically. It now has a client-facing operation in Portugal and is building institutional channels in the U.S., aiming to link capital and investment opportunities across markets.

Mercado Bitcoin, where a significant portion of assets under management are made up of small and medium enterprises' treasuries, expects to surpass 3 billion reais ($563 million) in tokenized credit issuance by year-end. About 20% of assets under custody on the platform are now tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), up from virtually zero just a few years ago.

The pivot sits within a wider push to build “financial super apps.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said Coinbase aims to be a crypto-powered “super app” that would provide “all types of financial services.”

Beyond crypto, fintechs such as Revolut and Paytm are bundling payments, lending and investing. The playbook borrows from WeChat and Alipay, apps that bundle social, financial, and other features.

Robinhood's decision to list Strategy's four preferred stocks marks a rare break from its own investment policies — and could strengthen Michael Saylor's bitcoin playbook without diluting holders of the firm's common stock, MSTR.

The brokerage began offering trading in four Strategy (MSTR) preferred stocks on Oct. 2, with tickers STRC, STRD, STRF, and STRK now available on the platform. 

The next day, CEO Vlad Tenev confirmed the move on X, saying Robinhood had “heard from many Strategy investors that this was an important factor before moving their accounts.”

That detail matters because Robinhood's own website still states that it does not currently support preferred stocks, grouping them with foreign equities and mutual funds under “unsupported assets.” 

The inclusion of Strategy's securities is therefore a rare policy shift, suggesting unusual demand from retail investors seeking exposure to the company's bitcoin-linked products.

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has developed a suite of four preferred stocks —STRC, STRD, STRF, and STRK — as an alternative way to raise capital for its bitcoin acquisition strategy. These instruments function like digital credit products, giving the company fresh funding without directly diluting holders of its common equity (MSTR).

Each class offers a different blend of yield, seniority and conversion terms:

For investors, this structure is important because it enables Strategy to aggressively expand its bitcoin holdings while limiting equity dilution for existing MSTR shareholders. 

It also creates yield-bearing securities tied indirectly to the company's bitcoin playbook — something traditional yield-bearing stablecoins have struggled to achieve under U.S. regulation.

On X, Stony Chambers, a Seeking Alpha analyst, called $STRC “the iPhone moment” for crypto-linked securities — arguing that its debut as Robinhood's first-ever preferred listing shows “real product-market fit.” 

Chambers speculated that future catalysts such as ratings coverage, tokenization, or even stablecoin allocation could trigger “vertical jumps” in demand for STRC. While his projections are highly speculative, his comments underscore how the new listings could expand retail participation in Strategy's ecosystem.

Ultimately, the change gives Saylor's firm a potentially powerful new funding avenue — and for bitcoin, another indirect demand driver as one of its largest corporate holders gains easier retail access to capital.

 The $300 billion record stablecoin supply may act as “rocket fuel” for the crypto market, while signaling a growing integration with global finance, industry watchers told Cointelegraph. 

The record $300 billion stablecoin market capitalization may signal that more investor capital is flowing onchain, which could act as “rocket fuel” for cryptocurrency valuations, according to market analysts.

The total stablecoin supply has reached a new record of over $300 billion on Friday, marking a 46.8% year-to-date growth rate that may outpace the previous year's stablecoin market growth, Cointelegraph reported.

The record comes at the start of October, historically the second-best month for Bitcoin (BTC), reinforcing investor optimism around a potential “Uptober” rally.

“Stablecoin supply may have crossed 300 billion dollars, but this is not capital waiting on the sidelines. It is moving through markets with purpose,” according to Andrei Grachev, founding partner at synthetic dollar protocol Falcon Finance.

“Transfer volumes are in the trillions each month. Velocity metrics show constant activity across networks,” Grachev told Cointelegraph. “They are being used—not just held. This is capital at work, not capital on hold.” 

“Stablecoins are settling trades, funding positions, and giving users dollar access where banks fall short,” he added. 

Stablecoins have several use cases beyond investment, including in payments, remittances, merchant payments and as a means of saving. A growing supply may also indicate more stablecoin usage for daily payments or institutional settlements.

The $300 billion milestone may signal a “rebound in digital assets” along with the growing integration of stablecoins in global finance, according to Ricardo Santos, the chief technical officer at stablecoin-based fintech payment company Mansa Finance.

The stablecoin supply's “expansion is often interpreted as a sign of fresh dollar-equivalent liquidity that can quickly rotate into Bitcoin, Ethereum or altcoins,” he told Cointelegraph. “In this sense, the $300 billion threshold looks like rocket fuel for the next market cycle.”

Santos pointed to stablecoin adoption in countries such as Nigeria, Turkey and Argentina, where residents use US dollar-pegged tokens as “de facto dollars” for everyday transactions.

Stablecoins are also being integrated into payment systems by global financial players such as Visa, further embedding them into mainstream financial infrastructure.

During the past month, Circle minted $8 billion worth of USDC (USDC) on the Solana network alone, with $750 million minted on Thursday, according to blockchain data platform Lookonchain's X post.

“Capital doesn't stay idle for long,” according to technical analyst and popular crypto trader Kyle Doops, who expects the record stablecoin supply to start flowing into the cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum (ETH) has reignited optimism in the market after rallying 8% to reclaim the $4,400 level, with institutional inflows on the rise and on-chain activity rising as anticipation for the next giant upgrade grows. This new excitement has investors searching for the next altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to outperform ETH's gains in the next few months. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance is one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, with its dual lending protocol bypassing massive inefficiencies in decentralized lending. 

Its Stage 6 presale is already over 55% sold out. Attracting more than 16,750 owners and raising more than $16.8 million, reflecting growing market sentiment. With its 50x potential for growth, Mutuum Finance is increasingly considered a special early-stage investment opportunity that can do even better than Ethereum's next bull cycle as the bull market continues to gain traction.

Ethereum (ETH) has officially shattered three years of horizontal price action, drawing what analysts call the “holy grail” breakout, a technical move that eliminates prolonged consolidation and allows the foundation for a powerful vertical rally. As momentum gains pace and on-chain indicators flash green, it is widely expected ETH's future destination could be in the five-digit realm, a level previously thought to be years in the making. 

The breakout is the moment of truth for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, cementing its place as the backbone of decentralized finance and smart contracts. With institutional funds pouring in and optimism in the air, increasingly large chunks of investors are also exploring emerging altcoins with greater growth prospects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also starting to draw that forward-thinking capital.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its sixth all-time presale round. The project has already broken 16,750 registered members and more than $16.8 million, all-time high milestones, and continues to show growing trust in the market for its long-term project. Investors who are seeking sustainable yield and long-term value will find Mutuum Finance's growing ecosystem at a quick rate as an investment prospect to consider.

The platform also has a very robust Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation mechanism that adjusts in real-time to shock collateral price. This is supported by another impediment of protection through management of a 10% to 35% reserve multiplier on riskier classes of collateral. Open architecture and security by design enable Mutuum Finance to be a long-term, stable, and secure DeFi platform designed for the long term and to put the times to the test.

The project classifies vulnerabilities into four categories, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, and provides a rational model for discovery and prevention of such pitfalls before impacting users.

Mutuum Finance has announced a new lending and borrowing protocol for its decentralized finance ecosystem. Version 1 (V1) is set to go live on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will include major pieces such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. On the launch day, lending, borrowing, and collateralization support for ETH and USDT is set to go live, ushering in the stage for a simple and open-ended DeFi experience.

The Ethereum breakout above $4,400 is a sure sign that the next big bull rally is imminent, but the biggest profits might not come from ETH itself. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at the moment is trading at just $0.035 and significantly more than 55% presale sold out, is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting early-stage DeFi plays of 2025. With more than 16,750 investors, who have raised $16.8 million, a double lending infrastructure, and robust security architecture, MUTM represents a rare chance at 50× potential gain. For investors betting on the next altcoin to surge and drive even Ethereum's rally, MUTM is the obvious choice.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum's next major network upgrade, Fusaka, could reshape how users experience the blockchain by lowering costs and boosting efficiency, according to asset manager VanEck.

In its September crypto market recap, VanEck's research team said Fusaka, expected to go live in December, is designed to tackle one of Ethereum's biggest hurdles: data availability for rollups, the scaling solutions that bundle many transactions together before settling them on Ethereum.

The centerpiece of the upgrade is a technique called Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS). Instead of requiring every Ethereum validator to download all transaction data, PeerDAS allows them to verify blocks by sampling smaller pieces.

VanEck explained that this reduces bandwidth and storage demands, making it possible to safely raise Ethereum's “blob” capacity — the data slots used by rollups — without putting strain on the network.

This matters because Ethereum developers have already doubled blob limits once this year, and demand continues to rise.

Coinbase's Base and Worldcoin's World Chain now account for about 60% of all rollup data submitted, VanEck noted, showing how central L2s have become to the network's growth. By expanding capacity further, Fusaka is expected to cut costs for rollups, which should translate into cheaper transactions for end users.

VanEck argued that the upgrade underscores Ethereum's shift away from being driven by base layer fees.

As more activity moves to rollups, mainnet fee revenue has declined, but the firm stressed this does not diminish ETH's importance. Instead, Ethereum's security role in settling rollup transactions increases, reinforcing ETH's position as a monetary asset rather than just a fee-yielding one.

VanEck analysts also warned that unstaked ETH holders face dilution risk as institutional actors — from exchange-traded products to crypto treasury firms — continue accumulating ETH positions to stake for yield.

In that context, they believe, Fusaka strengthens Ethereum's appeal by lowering L2 costs and reinforcing its centrality in a scaling ecosystem that is expected to attract more institutional adoption.

VanEck concluded that while technical challenges remain, Fusaka marks a pivotal step in Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap, with “significant implications” for both users and long-term holders.

 Bitcoin ETFs are the market's “clearest sentiment barometer,” indicating an incoming breakout for “Uptober,” analysts told Cointelegraph. 

US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began the historically bullish month of October with their second-best week of inflows since launch, signaling renewed investor optimism.

Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs recorded $3.24 billion worth of cumulative net positive inflows over the past week, nearly matching their record of $3.38 billion in the week ending Nov. 22, 2024, according to data from SoSoValue.

The figure marks a sharp rebound from the previous week's $902 million in outflows. Analysts attributed the turnaround to growing expectations of another US interest rate cut, which has improved sentiment toward risk assets.

Growing expectations of another US interest rate cut triggered a “shift in sentiment,” attracting renewed investor demand for Bitcoin ETFs, “bringing four-week inflows to nearly $4 billion,” Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph. “At current run-rates, Q4 flows could retire over 100,000 BTC from circulation — more than double new issuance.“

“ETF absorption is accelerating while long-term holder distribution eases, helping BTC build a stronger base,” near key technical support levels, he added.

Continued ETF inflows may provide significant tailwinds for Bitcoin in October, which is the second-best month for Bitcoin in terms of average historical returns, often referred to as “Uptober” by crypto investors.

This week's $3.2 billion briefly pushed Bitcoin's price above $123,996 on Friday, marking an over six-week high last seen on Aug. 14 for the world's first cryptocurrency, TradingView data shows.

Bitcoin's breakout above $120,000 may invite a “very quick move” above the $150,000 all-time high before the end of 2025, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, told Cointelegraph during an interview at Token2049 in Singapore.

Bitcoin ETFs now serve as the “clearest sentiment barometer” for the cryptocurrency industry, indicating a potential breakout for October, Kalchev said.

However, Bitcoin's momentum will depend on several key events next week, including US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech, as well as the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

Investors are also looking forward to the delayed US jobs report, but its publication date depends on the length of the current US government shutdown, the first such instance since 2018.

Meanwhile, investors are expecting a strong month for Bitcoin's momentum, as October is the second-best month in terms of Bitcoin's historical performance.

BTC averaged monthly returns of around 20% in October, 46% in November and around 4% in December, according to CoinGlass data.

 Bitcoin ETFs are the market's “clearest sentiment barometer,” indicating an incoming breakout for “Uptober,” analysts told Cointelegraph. 

US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began the historically bullish month of October with their second-best week of inflows since launch, signaling renewed investor optimism.

Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs recorded $3.24 billion worth of cumulative net positive inflows over the past week, nearly matching their record of $3.38 billion in the week ending Nov. 22, 2024, according to data from SoSoValue.

The figure marks a sharp rebound from the previous week's $902 million in outflows. Analysts attributed the turnaround to growing expectations of another US interest rate cut, which has improved sentiment toward risk assets.

Growing expectations of another US interest rate cut triggered a “shift in sentiment,” attracting renewed investor demand for Bitcoin ETFs, “bringing four-week inflows to nearly $4 billion,” Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph. “At current run-rates, Q4 flows could retire over 100,000 BTC from circulation — more than double new issuance.“

“ETF absorption is accelerating while long-term holder distribution eases, helping BTC build a stronger base,” near key technical support levels, he added.

Continued ETF inflows may provide significant tailwinds for Bitcoin in October, which is the second-best month for Bitcoin in terms of average historical returns, often referred to as “Uptober” by crypto investors.

This week's $3.2 billion briefly pushed Bitcoin's price above $123,996 on Friday, marking an over six-week high last seen on Aug. 14 for the world's first cryptocurrency, TradingView data shows.

Bitcoin's breakout above $120,000 may invite a “very quick move” above the $150,000 all-time high before the end of 2025, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, told Cointelegraph during an interview at Token2049 in Singapore.

Bitcoin ETFs now serve as the “clearest sentiment barometer” for the cryptocurrency industry, indicating a potential breakout for October, Kalchev said.

However, Bitcoin's momentum will depend on several key events next week, including US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech, as well as the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

Investors are also looking forward to the delayed US jobs report, but its publication date depends on the length of the current US government shutdown, the first such instance since 2018.

Meanwhile, investors are expecting a strong month for Bitcoin's momentum, as October is the second-best month in terms of Bitcoin's historical performance.

BTC averaged monthly returns of around 20% in October, 46% in November and around 4% in December, according to CoinGlass data.

Something went wrong

Donald Trump has wasted no time making cryptocurrency a centerpiece of his presidency. During his campaign, Trump vowed to make America the crypto capital of the world, and since taking office on January 20, he has made good on that promise.

One of his first major actions in office was signing an executive order to establish an internal working group dedicated to advancing cryptocurrency adoption.

He also appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

The shift toward digital currency — with fewer restrictions from banks and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — has become a defining feature of Trump's 47th presidency.

“You like (cryptocurrency)?” Trump said, upon signing the executive order on January 23, “We're gonna make a lot of money for the country.”

His aggressive pro-crypto stance has reignited the industry. After struggling through disappointing years, Bitcoin surged over 36% between November 6 — when Trump's election win was certified — and December 31. They have also been the best-performing asset class in 2024, raising almost 125% year-over-year.

During his 2024 election campaign, Trump positioned himself as a “pro-Bitcoin” candidate, claiming it “stands for freedom sovereignty, and independence from government, coercion and control.”

Trump has touted his 47th presidency as a “golden age for America,” and the cryptocurrency industry stands to benefit.

“The reign of terror against crypto is over,” said Sacks, the newly appointed AI and crypto czar, at the Crypto Ball in New York on January 17, “The beginning of innovation in America for crypto has just begun.”

Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time since December 2024, hitting an all-time high of over $109,000 on Trump's inauguration day.

Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, predicts this momentum will continue through 2025, with Bitcoin potentially surpassing $200,000 by year-end.

With Robinhood Crypto, you can buy and sell cryptocurrency for as little as $1 — without having to pay commission or other charges. You can also get up to a 1% deposit match on all crypto deposits and transfers.

The platform has the lowest trading costs (on average) in the US. Meaning, you could get up to 3.6% more crypto when you buy through Robinhood Crypto.

However, investing in crypto comes with risks. Bitcoin has already pulled back by over 3% in the past week as initial enthusiasm around Trump's presidency fades.

“Investors should also recognize that volatility can work in both directions: while it presents the possibility of substantial upside gains, it equally entails the risk of significant losses,” said Dovile Silenskyte, Director of Digital Assets Research at WisdomTree Investments.

To mitigate risk, consider diversifying your investments. Allocating a portion of your total portfolio to tried-and-true assets can help reduce exposure to crypto volatility. You may want to seek help from an expert to do this properly.

Gold has long been a hedge against inflation and stock market downturns. With geopolitical tensions rising, analysts at JPMorgan predict gold prices could reach $3,000 in 2025.

And because of the precious metal's safe-haven status, investors often rush toward it in times of crisis.

One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.

Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

Real estate is another way to hedge against market risks while building wealth. As commercial real estate makes a comeback, investing in grocery-anchored properties could provide a stable passive income stream amid uncertainty.

Real estate can also diversify your portfolio while remaining hedged against other risks, such as inflation or geopolitical influences. Commercial real estate is poised to make a come-back this year, with Trump and Elon Musk preaching the benefits of working from office.

The retail sector has been the most resilient — entering 2025 with the lowest vacancy rate. CBRE Group predicts the demand for retail commercial real estate to continue growing through the year, especially in suburban areas and Sun Belt cities.

Accredited investors can tap into this momentum by investing in institutional-quality commercial real estate through First National Realty Partners (FNRP).

FNRP leases properties to some of the most popular necessity-backed retail chains, like Walmart, CVS, Kroger, and Whole Foods. The company does all the legwork — so you can become a commercial landlord without having to deal with any of the hassles of property ownership.

FNRP distributes any positive cash flows as cash distributions to investors every quarter, helping you set up a potential passive income stream.

Compared to Circle, which has deployed USDC across 28 blockchain networks, Tether has traditionally been more selective, only issuing native USDT on 12 chains. This has led platforms like BNB and Linea to rely on wrapped tokens, ported in via a third-party bridge. 

USDT0 aims to resolve this. Using Layerzero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, the stablecoin is already live on eight networks, despite being less than a year old.

The goal is to create a “unified liquidity layer” where tokens can move between any chain, “without slippage in a matter of seconds,” USDT0 CEO and co-founder, Lorenzo R. told CCN at TOKEN2049.

The concept is most powerful for small chains, which have often struggled to attract capital Lorenzo observed. 

So far, on-chain metrics suggest the concept is working. Cross-chain transfer volume was already running as high as $350 million per day when USDT0 went live on Plasma in September, Lorenzo added. Since then, it has climbed even higher.

Without a multi-chain transfer mechanism like Circle Gateway, users encounter friction moving classic USDT between networks. 

Because Tether doesn't operate its own canonical bridges, swapping Ethereum USDT for Tron USDT, for example, requires a third-party bridge or centralized exchange, both of which incur fees and introduce counterparty risk.

In contrast, USDT0 moves more freely. Compared to legacy stablecoin bridges, cross-chain transfers are much cheaper than with native USDT. Users only need to pay gas and a small LayerZero relay fee.

Moreover, depending on the source and destination chains, moving USDT0 between networks may not even require other tokens.

Stable, which is among a new cohort of dedicated stablecoin chains, uses USDT0 as its native gas currency, removing the need for wallets to hold multiple assets. Meanwhile, Plasma, which is also optimized for stablecoins, abstracts away gas fees entirely for basic transfers.

According to Lorenzo, a number of use cases have emerged for USDT0's enhanced cross-chain liquidity:

“You see centralized exchanges rebalancing the treasuries. You see payment providers and payment infrastructures converging their treasuries on one network. You see DeFi protocols processing liquidations, or tapping into larger liquidity pools.”

With these use cases driving adoption, USDT0's daily transfer volume has climbed from less than a million dollars in January, to $869 million on Oct. 2, Lorenzo said.

For now, that remains just a small fraction of USDT's overall volume, which frequently exceeds $200 billion a day. But as users increasingly demand more frictionless ways of moving value between blockchains, USDT0 could transform the stablecoin into a truly liquid cross-chain asset.

 The Bitcoin four-year cycle is driven more by "human emotion" and will likely continue to play out in “some form,” according to a crypto executive. 

While Bitcoin's four-year cycle may not play out exactly as it has in the past, that doesn't mean the concept is entirely dead, according to a crypto executive.

“I think when it comes to the four-year cycle, the reality is that it's very likely that we'll continue to see some form of a cycle,” crypto exchange Gemini's head of APAC region, Saad Ahmed, told Cointelegraph during a sit-down interview at Token2049 in Singapore.

“It ultimately stems from people get really excited and overextend themselves, and then you kind of see a crash, and then it kind of corrects to an equilibrium,” Ahmed said.

However, Ahmed said growing institutional involvement in the crypto industry could help the market absorb some of the volatility. “You'll see some of the volatility, kind of flag off, but you'll still see some sort of a cycle, because ultimately, it's driven by human emotion,” Ahmed said.

The debate over whether the four-year cycle is still relevant to Bitcoin (BTC) has been ongoing within the crypto industry recently.

On Aug. 21, crypto analytics company Glassnode said Bitcoin's recent price action may still be tracking its historic four-year halving cycle.

However, the deadline for Bitcoin's cycle peak may fall this month if past patterns hold, according to crypto analyst Rekt Capital. 

In July, he said that if the cycle mirrors 2020, the market would likely peak in October, approximately 550 days after the April 2024 halving.

“We have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left,” Rekt said. However, Oct. 1 marked the beginning of Q4, historically Bitcoin's strongest quarter since 2013, with an average return of 79.39%, according to CoinGlass.

It comes as Bitcoin surged 11.5% over the past seven days, climbing to $123,850 on Friday, just short of its $124,100 all-time high set on Aug. 14, according to CoinMarketCap.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said on July 26 he doesn't expect Bitcoin's price to follow the cycle as it has in the past.

“I bet 2026 is an up year,” Hougan said. “I broadly think we're in for a good few years,” Hougan added.

An American national based in Bengaluru has taken social media by storm after proudly displaying his new five-year Indian visa, using the moment to draw a sharp contrast between the immigration policies of India and the United States.

Klor Anthony Louis, popularly known as Tony Klor on the internet, posted a message congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his strategy to lure global talent in new-age tech areas, while doing a sharp dig at US President Donald Trump.

Tony Klor's tweet turned viral within minutes, had his endorsed visa picture with a strong message of India's increasing friendliness to foreign talent.

"It's official! India is opening its doors to foreign blockchain & AI builders. I've just been granted a girthy 5-year India visa," Klor wrote.

He then added the political commentary that fueled the post's virality: “Trump says foreigners go kick rocks. Modi says welcome home bhai.”

The photo verified the visa category as a B-1 (Business Visa), dated September 23, 2025, and effective to September 22, 2030. The visa recommends that the duration of stay in India should not be more than 180 days.

The post received considerable buzz, particularly from Indians on social media, most of whom observed the changing attitude towards the Indian visa.

"Finally, congrats—this is my first time ever seeing an Indian Visa Flex," one person wrote, and others just said, "Welcome home."

Most reactions centered around India's smart move to welcome high-tech talent in the face of growing restrictive immigration policies in nations such as the US.

One user remarked, "India knows the future is being written in blockchain and AI. A 5-year visa like this sends an important signal—while others push talent away, India is saying ‘come build with us'. Welcome to India, Tony.”

The B-1 visa is a long-term category for foreigners intending to establish or explore business opportunities in India.

As per the official website of the Embassies of India, the B-1 Business Visa is issued to people who may come to India to:

The issuance of this five-year, multiple-entry visa to a foreigner actively involved in emerging areas such as blockchain and AI is being considered by many as an open government indication of India's desire to be the world hub for future technologies.

Jakarta, Pintu News – Amid the rising costs and uncertainty of revenues from crypto mining, some companies have decided to shift focus to artificial intelligence . This change in strategy not only reduces risk, but also promises higher profit margins.

These companies are now leveraging existing infrastructure to usher in a new era of AI technology, which offers the potential for very attractive returns on investment.

HIVE Digital Technologies, which previously focused on Bitcoin  mining, is now shifting most of its operations to AI infrastructure. The company has successfully increased their Bitcoin (BTC) mining capacity to 10.4 EH/s as of May 2025, and plans to reach 25 EH/s by the end of 2025.

This transformation not only increases their capacity, but also expands revenue opportunities through the utilization of Nvidia's AI chips. HIVE has strategically invested in Nvidia's GPU cluster, which allows the company to scale operations significantly.

With a focus on renewable energy in Canada, Sweden and Paraguay, HIVE is positioning itself as a leader in the transition from mining to AI. This approach not only reduces operational costs but also enhances the company's reputation as a pioneer in green technology.

Core Scientific, which is also making the transition from crypto mining to AI data center infrastructure, has announced plans to have an almost equal revenue split between crypto mining and AI by 2025. The company has announced a $1.2 billion expansion project for its data center in Denton, Texas, which will support AI and high-performance cloud computing.

In addition, Core Scientific plans to open a new AI data center in Georgia by July 2026. With the acquisition by CoreWeave in a stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion, Core Scientific has the potential to save more than $500 million per year in operations and lease payments by the end of 2027.

This vertical integration eliminates lease payments previously paid to Core Scientific, while securing the critical infrastructure capacity needed to support growing AI data center demand.

IREN Limited has recorded significant growth after transitioning from Bitcoin (BTC) mining to AI-ready data centers. With extremely low energy costs of $0.033 per kWh, IREN has managed to create a significant competitive advantage compared to other companies making a similar transition.

Annual revenue from their AI cloud services now stands at $26 million, with 1,896 GPUs capable of supporting AI. A massive investment of $674 million in 12,400 new GPUs has doubled IREN's AI cloud capacity to 23,000 units.

It is expected to generate around $500 million in annual sales by early next year. IREN's Horizon 1 and Sweetwater facilities are designed to support up to 700,000 liquid-cooled Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, marking a major step in the company's evolution towards AI technology.

The strategic changes made by these companies demonstrate smart adaptation in the face of economic and technological challenges. By leveraging existing infrastructure and investing in AI technologies, they are not only increasing revenue potential but also positioning themselves at the forefront of the coming industrial revolution. This is a new era for technology, where AI not only supports businesses but also drives global economic growth.

 Crypto exchange Coinbase is pursuing a National Trust Company Charter in the US, but said it has "no intention of becoming a bank." 

Crypto exchange Coinbase has applied for a National Trust Company Charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), joining a growing number of US-based crypto companies pursuing the same license.

“Coinbase is taking a significant step in expanding our business capabilities and regulatory oversight beyond the existing framework, paving the way for innovation and growth in building a modern financial system powered by digital assets,” Coinbase said in a statement on Friday.

According to Coinbase, pursuing the license is part of its strategy “to bridge the gap between the crypto economy and traditional financial system.” However, it has no interest in changing the core focus of its operations:

Luke Youngblood, a former Coinbase employee who led the creation of Coinbase staking rewards, explained in a podcast published on Friday that the license would enable Coinbase to “offer basically built-in on-ramp, off-ramp, and no longer have to use partner banks on-ramps, off-ramps.”

Coinbase said that approval of the license would allow the exchange to expand beyond custody services, opening the door to payments and other related offerings under clearer regulatory guidance.

However, political commentator Brendan Pedersen added, “Trusts theoretically have more limitations than other types of banks when it comes to business activities, but the distinction has blurred over the years.”

Youngblood said the Coinbase retail application has improved significantly since he stopped working at the exchange in 2022. “When I worked there back in 2022, before I left, it was not that great. The features, like the Coinbase debit card, didn't work very well,” Youngblood said.

“You can really tell they've hired some top engineering talent,” Youngblood said.

It comes as several other crypto companies have also recently applied for the National Trust Charter.

On July 1, stablecoin issuer Circle applied to establish a national trust bank in the US. A couple of days later, Ripple Labs applied for the same license. 

Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said if the license is approved, it would be a “new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.”

Breaking news from the trading floors reveals unexpected results: BTC price action triggers celebration headlines but institutional money managers are quietly rotating into altcoin positions that offer superior infrastructure and yield opportunities. The latest market data shows over $1.5 billion in crypto liquidations as Bitcoin tests critical resistance levels, yet expert analysis points toward Dogecoin, XRP and emerging Layer 2 projects like Layer Brett as the real winners.

The reality behind Bitcoin's recent price celebration tells a sobering infrastructure story. While BTC price headlines grab attention, the underlying network experienced devastating liquidation cascades totaling $1.5 billion across major exchanges, exposing fundamental scalability limitations plaguing Layer 1 networks.

Market makers witnessed how Bitcoin's technical structure creates volatility traps during high-volume periods, with leveraged positions getting demolished by network congestion and delayed transaction confirmations. The bearish trendline penetration reveals deeper concerns about BTC's ability to handle institutional-scale adoption without creating dangerous bottlenecks.



Despite impressive technical signals—DOGE posting 6-9% gains with emerging golden cross formations and whale accumulation of 680 million tokens—even these altcoin darlings face infrastructure bottlenecks during peak trading periods.

Dogecoin's momentum above the $0.24 support level demonstrates strong community backing, yet the underlying network struggles with volume-handling limitations plaguing most legacy blockchain systems. XRP shows similar patterns, maintaining institutional support above $2.85 while CME futures adoption signals growing institutional confidence.

The fundamental issue isn't market sentiment—it's infrastructure capacity. XRP's anticipation around potential ETF approvals creates positive momentum, but the network's ability to handle surge-driven institutional volume remains questionable. Both Dogecoin and XRP experienced significant liquidations ($35.8 million and $58.8 million respectively) during recent volatility spikes, revealing how even technically sound altcoins can become victims of their own success when infrastructure cannot match demand.

Layer Brett represents a change in how blockchain infrastructure approaches surge-driven market events, utilizing purpose-built Layer 2 architecture specifically designed to absorb volume spikes without creating devastating liquidation cascades now plaguing legacy networks.

While Bitcoin, Dogecoin and XRP struggle with network congestion during high-volume periods, Layer Brett's Ethereum Layer 2 foundation delivers lightning-fast transactions and low gas fees that maintain stability regardless of trading intensity.

The project's nearly $4.2 million raised during its crypto presale phase validates institutional interest in infrastructure-first blockchain solutions. Unlike traditional memecoins that offer speculation without substance, Layer Brett combines meme energy with real Layer 2 utility, creating an ecosystem built for scalability rather than speculation.

As DOGE demonstrates golden cross patterns and XRP holding institutional support above $2.85, the question now becomes whether traditional Bitcoin maximalism can compete against infrastructure-focused alternatives.

While it's true that BTC price movements can create headlines and Dogecoin technical patterns do generate social media buzz, droves of investors are coming to realise that sustainable returns require networks capable of handling real-world usage without creating systemic risks.

Next-generation blockchain projects are gearing up to deliver both performance and personality, placing their ceilings beyond the conventional with their smarter, two-tiered approach to the markets. With the Layer Brett presale perfectly exemplifying how to pull off the tactic, the question now is just how far and how fast the altcoin push looks set to take it.

Whoops.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A metal detectorist recently came across a cache of more than 100 gold and silver coins buried underground in the Netherlands, prompting archaeologists to come further investigate the site. But knowing now what the coins were there for, perhaps the archaeologists should've left them alone.

According to a study published in Medieval Archaeology, the coins, which sat buried for 1,300 years in the Netherlands, were likely used in cult rituals, and further around the site, archaeologists uncovered the remains of a seventh-century open-air cult site. It's more than plausible that the cache of coins was what was known as “devil's money,” coin offerings common at pagan cult sites.

The metal detectorists made the find near Hezingen, a hamlet near the Netherland's border with Germany. The coins are from around 700 A.D.—including some rare finds from the mints of the Frankish Empire—and were found along with metal jewelry in 2020 and 2021.

There were a number of clues that helped the archaeologists deduce that the site where the coins were found was once the stomping grounds for a cult. There were rows of posts, evidence of a large residence in a clearing near an ancient road junction on a prominent elevated landscape, remnants of animal sacrifices, and more. They also determined that the gold coins and jewelry were placed there in intervals over 100 years and interspersed with the animal sacrifices, making it clear that the site once served as a ritual sacrifice location for pagan gods. 

The archaeologists, led by Jan-Willem de Kort of the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, located the signs of an old structure, likely from the sixth century, as well as 17 postholes for wooden posts that aligned with spring and autumn equinoxes, which tied the site to seasonal harvest rituals. 

“The cult site was probably linked to a nearby high-status settlement with an enclosed cult house or ceremonial building,” the study authors wrote. “The offerings may have been linked to fertility rites as the posts were aligned with the rising and setting of the sun during the spring and autumn equinoxes.”

In all, the gold and silver coins were discovered in three areas. One site had a single gold coin, while another had 24 fragmented or complete gold coins, along with silver and gold jewelry. The third site featured gold coins and jewelry. “I think that this cult site was mainly used by local elites to emphasize their own status, and of course, you do that preeminently with valuables,” de Kort said, according to Phys.org. “The finds at the other cult sites are probably more the result of personal offerings and thus less precious.” 

The use of the site by elites and the timing of it all raises questions about the rise of Christianity in the area. The site's use curtailed in the 700s A.D., the study claims, earlier than the rise of Christianity in the region, leading the study authors to theorize that the area's leaders could have turned to Christianity earlier than others. 

As prominent missionary texts spelled out, to have pre-Christian groups convert to Christianity, they would need to stop worshiping pagan gods and cease the sacrifice of the so-called “devil's money.” Since Hezingen was abandoned by the early eighth century when Christianity began to spread, the study authors suggest the leaders of the town—wealthy, as shown by the value of the gold and silver—were some of the first in the area to convert to Christianity.

The ancient mystery needed a bit of high-tech help to come to light

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

The artworks of Leonardo da Vinci are vast and storied. The Last Supper. The Vitruvian Man. The Mona Lisa,for goodness sake. But even amongst such a storied and well-studied body of work, there can still be a few surprises left to discover. And recently, a team of researchers discovered one of those surprises: a drawing of a tunnel from a 1400s-era castle. 

The drawing was of Sforza Castle, and it included depictions of numerous underground tunnels, which have never been found.

The team, which included experts from Polytechnic University of Milan, Codevintec, and Sforza Castel, teamed up to employ ground-penetrating radar and laser scanning that mapped multiple feet under the castle. In doing so, they discovered not only that the tunnels Leonardo alluded to in his drawings existed, but that they may only be a small piece of an intricate system weaving throughout the site. 

“The ground-penetrating radar enriched the 3D model with data on known, but inaccessible, spaces, bringing to light unknown walkways and ideas for further studies on secret passages,” Francesca Biolo, researcher at Polytechnic University of Milan, said in a statement.

The castle took on new life in the 1400s when the duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza, reconstructed an ancient site. He turned it into the Sforza Castle, complete with towers, courtyards, and frescoed-lined halls. In 1494, Francesco's successor, Ludovico Sforza, built on the castle's tradition and hired Leonardo da Vinci to create art for the castle. According to Art Net, in his effort to complete that project, Leonardo ocumented the castle's unseen tunnel system, as recorded in Codex Forster I. 

Experts believe the tunnels were once likely used for military operations, but other portions of the system could have included personal touches as well. One passageway, for instance, connects the castle to the Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a church built by Francesco that houses Leonardo's “The Last Supper.” It is also the site of Sforza family burials, which may have afforded those living in the castle quicker access to the tombs of loved ones, such as Ludovico's wife, Beatrice d'Este. 

Nowadays, the castle complex is home to three different museums—Pinacoteca del Castello Sforzesco, the Museum of the Rondanini Pieta, and the Museum of Ancient Art.

While the underground system may not currently be fully accessible, the ground-penetrating radar and laser scanning used to confirm its presence could still unlock a fresh perspective on the Sforza Castel's underground world. 

“The goal is to create a digital twin of the Sforza Castle, a digital model that not only represents the current appearances of the castle but also allows you to explore the past, recovering historical elements that are no longer visible,” Franco Guzzetti, professor of geomatics at Polytechnic University of Milan, said in a statement.

Adding augmented reality to the virtual paths could invite visitors to explore the underground environments and inaccessible historical places in a fresh museum experience. The artwork of Leonardo has enabled the delight of modern audiences yet again.

More than a third of the world's population is affected by metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, the most common chronic liver disease in the world.

MASLD occurs when fat builds up in the liver and is associated with one or more of five conditions: obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and low HDL cholesterol, known as "good" cholesterol. These conditions are characterized as cardiometabolic risk factors because they affect the heart or metabolism.

MASLD can lead to serious illness, such as advanced liver, heart and kidney disease, but little research has been done to examine if certain cardiometabolic risk factors for those with MASLD are more associated with death than others.

The deadliest cardiometabolic risk factors 

Now, a new study from Keck Medicine of USC published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology reveals that three of the cardiometabolic risk factors carry the greatest risk of death for those with MASLD: high blood pressure, pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes, and low HDL, which raise the risk of death by 40%, 25% and 15%, respectively.

These results were independent of how many or which combination of cardiometabolic risk factors patients had, and held steady despite individuals' gender, sex, race or ethnicity.

"MASLD is a complicated disease, and this study sheds new light on where doctors may want to focus their efforts when treating patients," said Norah A. Terrault, MD, a hepatologist with Keck Medicine and a senior author of the study. "Knowing which aspects of MASLD might lead to poorer outcomes can help us offer patients the best possible care."

Researchers were especially surprised to discover that high blood pressure was associated with a higher chance of death than diabetes, said Matthew Dukewich, MD, PharmD, MS, a USC transplant hepatology fellow and lead author of the study. "Until now, it was commonly thought that diabetes was the most pressing health problem for MASLD patients, which is a key insight."

The study also found that obesity, the most common cardiometabolic risk factor of MASLD, can substantially raise the risk of mortality depending on a patient's body mass index (BMI), which is a formula used to estimate body fat percentage based on an individual's height and weight. The higher a patient's BMI, the higher the association with death.

Additionally, the research adds to the growing body of research that patients with more cardiometabolic risk factors have poorer outcomes. The study found that the risk of death in MASLD patients increased by 15% for each additional cardiometabolic risk factor present.

How the study was conducted 

Researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which collected health information about children and adults in the United States from 1988-2018, the most current year for which data was available for their study. Out of 134,515 participants 20 years or older, some 21,000 patients qualified as having MASLD.

The study authors tracked all-cause mortality rates by individual cardiometabolic risk factors to reach their conclusions.

Looking ahead, the study authors hope to conduct further studies examining patients' genetic background, dietary habits and alcohol use in relation to MASLD outcomes to provide more comprehensive risk profiles. "The more we can understand about the drivers of the disease, the more we can identify those most in need of interventions and prioritize our resources for enhanced outcomes," said Terrault.

Liyun Yuan, MD, a transplant hepatologist with Keck Medicine, is also a study author.

Social event planning app Partiful, which calls itself “Facebook events for hot people,” has firmly replaced Facebook as the go-to platform for sending party invitations. But what Partiful also has in common with Facebook is that it's collecting a tsunami of user data, and Partiful could have done better at keeping that data secure.

On Partiful, hosts can create online invitations with a retro, maximalist vibe, allowing guests to RSVP to events with the ease of ordering a salad on a touch-screen. Partiful aims to be user-friendly and trendy, propelling the app to #9 on the iOS App Store's Lifestyle charts. Google called Partiful the “best app” of 2024. 

Now, Partiful has evolved into a powerful Facebook-like social graph, easily mapping who your friends are and who your friends' friends are, what you do, where you go, and all of your phone numbers.

As Partiful grew more popular, some users became skeptical of the company's origins. One New York City promoter announced that it was boycotting Partiful because its founders and some staff are former employees of Palantir, Peter Thiel's data mining company, which produces the software that powers ICE's master database for the Trump administration's deportation crackdown.

Given some of the speculation around the app, TechCrunch set up a new account and tested Partiful. We soon found that the app was not stripping the location data of user-uploaded images, including public profile photos.

TechCrunch found it was possible for anyone, using only the developer tools in a web browser, to access raw user profile photos stored in Partiful's backend database hosted on Google Firebase. If the user's photo contained the precise real-world location of where it was taken, anyone else could have also viewed the precise coordinates of where that photo was taken.

Almost all digital files, like the pictures you take on a smartphone, contain metadata, which includes information like the file size, when it was created, and by whom. In the case of photos and videos, metadata can include information about the kind of camera used and its settings, as well as the precise latitude and longitude coordinates of where the image was captured.

The security flaw is problematic because anyone using Partiful could have revealed the location of where a person's profile photo was snapped. Some Partiful user profile photos contained highly granular location data that could be used to identify the person's home or work, particularly in rural areas where individual homes are easier to distinguish on a map.

It's common practice for companies that host user images and videos to automatically remove metadata upon upload to prevent privacy lapses like this. 

TechCrunch verified the bug ourselves by uploading a new Partiful profile photo that we had previously captured from outside of the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco, which contained the photo's precise location. When we checked the metadata of the photo stored on Partiful's server, it still contained the exact coordinates of where the image was taken down to a few feet.

After discovering the security flaw, TechCrunch alerted Partiful co-founders Shreya Murthy and Joy Tao by email, as Partiful does not have a public means for reporting security flaws. TechCrunch shared a link to a Partiful user's raw profile photo containing that user's real-world location at the time the photo was taken, a residential address in Manhattan.

Tao told TechCrunch on Friday that the vulnerability was “already on our team's radar, and was recently prioritized as an upcoming fix.” 

Partiful initially provided a timeline to fix the flaw by “next week,” but given the sensitivity of the data involved, Partiful fixed the bug by Saturday at TechCrunch's request.

TechCrunch confirmed Saturday that metadata was removed from existing user-uploaded photos. The profile photo that we uploaded with our real-world location also had the metadata removed. 

Partiful disclosed the security lapse in a tweet shortly before the publishing of this story.

When asked by TechCrunch if Partiful has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if there was any direct or bulk access to user profile photos stored in its database, Partiful spokesperson Jess Eames said this was “still under investigation but we have found no evidence of this yet.”

Eames said the company “regularly perform security reviews with experts in the field, not just as a one-time action but as part of our ongoing processes.” Partiful did not provide TechCrunch with the name of the experts when asked.

Partiful has raised over $27 million from investors since its founding in 2022, including a $20 million Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. TechCrunch asked Partiful's co-founders if they had commissioned a security review of their product before launch, but they would not say.

Isn't it getting harder to say this, hearing this kind of rhetoric? "My bombs only kill the bad guys" is either hopelessly ignorant, or willfully malicious.

I don't want to get into an argument about the dangers involved, I agree with Taleb about the fat tails of violence, and how standard statistics breaks down when there is infinite variance. My point is just that Tan's point is reasonable, even if there is risk. You need only look at the CCTV usage in the UK to see how you can have a reasonable society with strong surveillance.

It's an invasive surveillance technology that contributes to building the pervasive surveillance day to day reality.You're muddying the waters asking "why are you against this" without even hinting at an argument why anyone should not be against this.You can already see the progression.

ALPRs are not an obvious red line. Federal police ignoring court orders with microphones on street corners is.

Again I want to be clear that there's a difference between "bad idea" or "bad public policy tradeoff" and "red line". I believe it's pretty clear that when something is a live controversy with no clear winner in a municipality like Oak Park, whatever else it is, it isn't a "red line".

I don't doubt that license plate readers are used primarily to solve crimes. But the fact that it is collected and can be made available to anyone essentially strips you of privacy in everyday life. Cops are people too; once the tech is available, it is sometimes abused to spy on spouses, neighbors, journalists critical of the local PD, and so on.There is also a more general argument: an ever-growing range of human activities is surveilled to root out crime, and we can probably agree that the end state of that would be dystopian: it'd be a place where your every word or even every thought is proactively monitored and flagged for wrongthink. We're ways off, but with every decade, we're getting closer. I'm not saying that Flock-listening-to-conversations is the line we can't cross, but if not this, then what?

Still, I'm torn whenever I walk to the city center (Bavarian big city that is not Munich) and see how many rental bikes and rental e-scooters can be found thrown into the river that runs through the city. Or public trash cans that were actually put deep into the earth, with concrete too, lie broken with lots of earth and the long metal pipe with concrete attached because some people spent considerable effort to destroy public infrastructure. Or somebody must have jumped hard and repeatably on a weak point of a public bench, which has very thick wood and thick steel screws, but they still managed to destroy it.I want those people to be found, I'm very angry. This is a frequent occurrence. If that means more surveillance, I would not oppose. I'm tired of seeing this happen again and again and again.The city had to start using trashcans that look more and more like little war bunkers. They can't do anything for the bikes and scooters though, making them too heavy to lift and throw into the water is obviously not possible. Police do patrol, but they can't be everywhere all the time.For illustration: Two bikes of a public bike rental service found in the river. They are not old, all of them are new, but this is how they look after a few days or weeks in the river:https://img.mittelbayerische.de/ezplatform/images/4/4/8/8/40...Divers are called regularly to retrieve bikes, scooters, and other big items thrown into the city's river: https://images.nordbayern.de/image/contentid/policy:1.132184...

I doubt any more effort will be made against vandalism for a long time that reaquires to increase surveillance. The cameras and microphones will remain, though.Edit: I live in a dictatorship. State surveillance and policing has helped with vandalism. But the drawbacks are obvious and nefarious. I would take more vandalism in a mediocre democracy any day.

Obviously I pointed to a conflict (of my interests), that's why I said I'm torn. If I want the second (less vandalism) I'll have to give up at least some of the first (freedom from surveillance while in public places).

I served on a jury where a young woman slipped on ice while crossing the street and was run over by a negligent driver who was fleeing what he thought was the police, because he was on probation and not supposed to drive. With private surveillance, red light cameras and some other sources, they were able to track down the vehicle and apprehend the individual within 45 minutes of the event. Prior to that, much more primitive version of that technology being available, there would no chance of that case being solved.Personally, I think this technology is dangerous, lacks effective governance, is operated without transparency, and is prone to abuse. Events of late highlight how different jurisdictional boundaries at the city, state and federal levels can be in conflict. But the technology is not going away -- imo it's time to govern it and limit the inter-jurisdictional data sharing.

We ran a pilot with the cameras in hot spots (the entrances to the village from I-290, etc).Just on stolen cars alone, roughly half the flags our PD reacted to turned out to be bogus. In Illinois, Flock runs off the Illinois LEADS database (the "hotlist"). As it turns out: LEADS is stale as fuck: cars are listed stolen in LEADS long after they're returned. And, of course, the demography of owners of stolen cars is sharply biased towards Black and Latino owners (statistically, they live in poorer, higher-crime areas), which meant that Flock was consistently requesting the our PD pull over innocent Black drivers.We recently kicked Flock out (again: I'm not thrilled about this; long story) over the objections of our PD (who wanted to keep the cameras as essentially a better form of closed-circuit investigatory cameras; they'd essentially stopped responding to Flock alerts over a year ago). In making a case for the cameras, our PD was unable to present a single compelling case of the cameras making a difference for us. What they did manage to do was enforce a bunch of failure-to-appear warrants for neighboring munis; mostly, what Flock did to our PD was turn them into debt collectors.Whatever else you think about the importance of people showing up to court for their speeding tickets, this wasn't a good use our sworn officers' time.

Had we kept the cameras, we'd have some political capital to get our neighboring munis (and like-minded munis in Chicagoland like Schaumberg) to take our ordinances and general orders as models. Now we don't. We're not any safer: our actions don't meaningfully change our residents exposure to ALPRs (and our residents weren't the targets anyways; people transiting through Oak Park were) because of their prevalence outside our borders.What people don't get about this is that a lot of normal, reasonable people see these cameras as a very good thing. You can be upset about that or you can work with it to accomplish real goals. We got upset about it.

My thoughts on that are probably not very popular on here and those are to just build larger jails and equip those with drug rehabilitation options. The larger jails allow us to not just kick the people back on the streets immediately but compel steps that help eliminate recidivism. Another source of criminal behavior is mental illness. I have no clues on how to fix that except perhaps concentrate on the causes.All these cameras and recording devices exist for that same reason Advil exists in that it helps a toothache. Doesn't really solve the problem but fights the symptoms.

Knowing this, wouldn't you prefer that we spend the money on crime prevention programs that "bribes" the underclass, instead of in a system that won't prevent crime at all but will rob all of us of privacy?

reply

The single best way to reduce poverty is to pay (bribe) the poor to stop having children, which ends the cycle of poverty (which is extraordinarily difficult to break and tends to trap generations). That should go hand-in-hand with free birth control, free day-after pills, free abortions, comprehensive sexual education, etc.A large share of the bottom 1/3 in the US will never step foot outside of poverty, most of them will never hold a job on a sustained basis. Pay them to not have children, which simultaneously benefits their lives in the here and now, while preventing the mistake of bringing children into poverty. It's one of the most humane things the US could do as a society. It would very rapidly improve poverty (and reduce crime) in the US.

"It was my cat, I swear."

The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) in the U.K. has recently suspended work-from-home privileges for the entire department after several officers, staff, and contractors were discovered to be cheating the system. According to The Register, at least 26 people are accused of misconduct after an anti-corruption investigation found that they were likely “key jamming” — using an object to hold a key down on the keyboard — to fake productivity.

“The abnormal keystroke behavior comes from repeated key presses and could be from an item left on a keypad, pressing down one key,” GMP Chief Constable Terry Woods said in a statement. “Our communities deserve to see value for money, and where deliberate behavior is proven, you can be confident we will take decisive action in this matter.” These instances were discovered after the department installed keyloggers to ensure that work-issued laptops and other devices are only used for official business.

Unfortunately for the U.K. police forces, this isn't the first time that an incident like this has been reported and investigated. Another officer, Detective Constable Niall Thubron of the Durham Constabulary, has been banned from returning to the police force after he resigned in May 2025.

“The data from the FO's (former officer's) laptop shows lengthy periods where the only activity is single keystrokes,” the report on Thubron's misconduct hearing said. Before his resignation, Thubron reportedly pressed the H key over 30 times and the I key over 16,000 times across different occasions between December 2024 and January 2025.

Remote work has enabled increased productivity, particularly for roles that do not require physical presence. It has also reduced wasted time caused by long commutes and heavy traffic.

However, it's also more prone to abuse, mainly as staff members working outside the office aren't observed by their colleagues and supervisors. For example, Wells Fargo fired more than a dozen employees in 2024 after they were discovered using mouse jiggers and keyboard simulators to evade monitoring software.

Companies understandably want to avoid this by using tools like screen recorders and keyloggers. However, workers are also pushing back, as it would seem that their corporation does not trust them. But news like this definitely makes it harder for management to implement work from home.

Just when you thought it was safe to let your guard down, another food recall makes headlines.

At least 20 people have been sickened by a listeria outbreak in prepared pasta products across the U.S., with four people dying, according to the CDC. Warnings have been issued for pasta from Walmart, Trader Joe's, and a host of other retailers across the country.

Yet another pasta has been added to the list of things to avoid. Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Pasta Bowls (9.6-oz) have been recalled over listeria concerns. The FDA has not issued a list of retailers where the product was sold, but did provide the best-by dates to look for. They include dates in 2027, so be sure to check your freezer.

Best if used by dates:

No illnesses have been reported from consuming Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi, but the product is being recalled because it contains pasta supplied by Nate's Fine Food. Kroger stores also added recalled deli bowtie and penne pasta salads sold from Aug 29, 2025 to Oct. 2, 2025 to the list.

The CDC has identified illnesses tied to the listeria outbreak in 15 states, with the largest number of cases identified so far in Texas. The recall for some pasta from Nate's Fine Food was first issued in June 2025 but has expanded ever since. And it's not clear if more brands will be added to the list.

This new recall adds to the previously recalled pasta, which is listed below by retailer.

Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo

Best-by dates:

This week on the GeekWire Podcast: A deep dive on the ways that AI and agents are changing how companies are created, built, and operated. 

We're on location at Pioneer Square Labs in Seattle with investor and entrepreneur T.A. McCann, managing director at the startup studio and venture capital firm.

He explains how AI agents are automating complex functions, letting small teams do the work that once required large groups of people. As AI makes product development easier, he says, the key strategic moat for many startups is now shifting to distribution and data.

Other topics include:

PSL companies and projects discussed: 

Other tools and startups mentioned include BluePill for AI-persona market research; Gumshoe for optimizing content for AI search; the AI code editor Cursor as an example of product-led growth; and Bloks for AI-powered relationship management.

How does the cancellation story differ between threads and async in Rust? Or vs async in other languages?There's no inherent reason they should be different, but in my experience (in C++, Python, C#) cancellation is much better in async then simple threads and blocking calls. It's near impossible to have organised socket shutdown in many languages with blocking calls, assuming a standard read thread + write thread per socket. Often the only reliable way to interrupt a socket thread it's to close the socket, which may not be what you want, and in principle can leave you vulnerable to file handle reuse bugs.Async cancellation is, depending on the language, somewhere between hard but achievable (already an improvement) and fabulous. With Trio [1] you even get the guarantee that non-compared socket operations are either completed or have no effect.Did this work any better in Rust threads / blocking calls? My uneducated understanding is that things are actually worse in async than other languages because there's no way to catch and handle cancellations (unlike e.g. Python which uses exceptions for that).I'm also guessing things are no better in Ada but very happy to hear about that too.

There is... They're totally different things.And yeah Rust thread cancellation is pretty much the same as in any other language - awkward to impossible. That's a fundamental feature of threads though; nothing to do with Rust.

It might be quite small, as I found for Maps (if we're putting 5 things in the map then we can just do the very dumbest thing which I call `VecMap` and that's fine, but if it's 25 things the VecMap is a little worse than any actual hash table, and if it's 100 things the VecMap is laughably terrible) but it might be quite large, even say 10x number of cores might be just fine without stealing.

But the most obvious difference, and maybe most important to a user, was left unstated: the adoption and ecosystem such as tooling, libraries, and community.Ada may have a storied success history in aerospace and life safety, etc, and it might have an okay standard lib which is fine for AOC problems and maybe embedded bit poking cases in which case it makes sense to compare to Rust. But if you're going to sit down for a real world project, ie distributed system or OS component, interfacing with modern data formats, protocols, IDEs, people, etc is going to influence your choice on day one.

This is part of the effort of Ferrocene to provide a safety certificate compiler. And they are already available now.

reply

I can't help but feel that we just went through a huge period of growth at all costs and now there is a desire to return, after 30-years of anything goes, to trying to make software that is safer again. Would be nice to start to build languages based on all the safety learnings over the decades to build some better languages, the good ideas keep getting lost in obscure languages and forgotten about.

reply

This is a feature I use a lot in C++. It is not part of the standard library but is trivial to programmatically generate range-restricted numeric types in modern C++. Some safety checks can even be done at compile-time instead of runtime.It should be a standard feature in programming languages.

It should be a standard feature in programming languages.

Yes! I would kill to get Ada's number range feature in Rust!

In ADA you can subtype the index type into an array, i.e. constraining the size of the allowed values.

Amazon 4.9 out of 5-star rated products are a rare breed, but Star Wars LEGO sets always come close to that perfect score. The R2-D2 droid construction earned it, and the Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary set is part of that special club with well over 1,700 glowing reviews attesting to its excellence.

LEGO never offers discounts on its website, particularly on Star Wars offerings from its most popular franchise. Instead, the company quietly moves massive inventory through Amazon, where this iconic 921-piece Star Wars set has dropped from $84 to just $67. For collectors and fans who've been eyeing this mid-scale Millennium Falcon, this is the best opportunity to grab it without paying full retail.

See at Amazon

LEGO designed this 921-piece build specifically for adults who are looking for a difficult building experience that creates display-worthy decor. The construction itself is several hours of keen focus which is just the kind of screen-free downtime that appears to be so appealing for someone that's exhausted on constant digital input. With every step of the build is another degree of engineering brilliance as you recreate the Falcon's iconic details in LEGO.

The model properly ingests actual Star Wars: A New Hope details like the typical cockpit Han and Chewie piloted, the satellite dish later blown off in the films and the quad laser blasters above and below. The brick-built replica translates the Falcon's greebled and lopsided look in terms of LEGO geometry but is still identifiable. The color blocking utilizes light gray, dark gray and tan pieces to achieve the well-worn appearance of the original film prop.

This Falcon measures 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high when exhibited on its display stand at mid-scale. It bridges the gap between LEGO's massive $800-plus Ultimate Collector Series pieces that are more than two feet in length and the diminutive playsets for children. Mid-scale represents the sweet spot for collectors seeking considerable shelf presence without dominating the entirety of one bookcase model. The stand that is provided holds the ship in a dynamic banking angle rather than on its flat.

The nameplate labels the ship and includes a 25th Anniversary commemorative LEGO Star Wars brick, the first quarter-century since LEGO originally acquired the rights to Star Wars in 1999. That partnership launched one of the most popular toy franchises in history and generates billions of dollars in sales and creating a collecting culture for limited-series sets.

At $67, this is a good deal at around 7 cents per item, within the usual pricing of LEGO. The discount of 20% brings it into the area below where impulse purchasing does not feel justified.

I recently went down a bright, RGB-laden hole with a mission: to satisfy my curiosity about smart lights that try to rip the colors off your TV and splash them onto the wall behind it. I've been skeptical of such TV lights muddying filmmakers' intent the same way modern TVs with motion smoothing and other AI image processing can. After toying with the Philips Hue Play Wall Washer, I wouldn't say I'm sold on the idea yet, but the good news is that's not all this little can full of LED modules can do.

Signify, the company that licenses and makes products under the Philips Hue brand, might mainly advertise the Play Wall Washer as a way to spice up your entertainment system. But it's equally adept as wall-coating accent lighting or a wake-up light in your bedroom, using the same interface that works for other colorful Hue smart lighting. The Wall Washer itself is a small, upright lamp inside an aluminum enclosure that feels very sturdy. It projects light outward and upward from three rows of LED lights, each working to produce smooth gradients and colors that are rich without being garishly oversaturated, which I've always appreciated about the whole Hue smart light line.

It's a versatile little product, yet I find myself jumping through a lot of mental hoops to justify the Play Wall Washer. At $219.99, it's not the most expensive RGB light in the usually-spendy Philips Hue lineup, but you would still need to either have or create an ideal space for it in your home to make it worthwhile. And it takes a whole lot more money to make it work as a TV backlight.

Philips Hue Play Wall Washer

The Philips Hue Play Wall Washer is a slick, well-made can full of vibrant and responsive color-shifting RGBs to paint your wall with—if you've got the money and the space.

Pros

Cons

Signify calls the Play Wall Washer an “immersive surround lighting” experience for your home entertainment center. The smart light's product page shows two Play Wall Washers standing astride a giant TV, splaying green and blue gradients over a broad, near-featureless white wall.

See Philips Hue Play Wall Washer at Amazon

It takes a hefty investment—$384.99 for a two-pack of the smart lights; another $384.99 for the Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K; and $65.99 for a Hue Bridge—to achieve what Philips' image shows, but it ain't much easier on your wallet with just one Play Wall Washer. You can skip the Sync Box 8K (or the older $249.99 4K model) if you have one of the recent 2022 or newer Samsung or 2024 LG TVs, for which Signify has a standalone Hue Sync app. But because we can't have anything nice, you'll still be on the hook for a $129.99 one-time purchase covering a single TV or a $2.99 monthly subscription that's good for three TVs. You don't actually need a Hue Bridge if you're not doing the TV-syncing thing—you can still use it as a fancy gradient-beaming light via the Hue app over Bluetooth—but you'll also lose Matter support, limiting your smart home ecosystem options to just Google Home and Amazon Alexa.

I tested a single unit paired with the Sync Box 8K, which has four HDMI 2.1 inputs and one HDMI 2.1 output that can pass up to 4K content at 120Hz (or 8K at 60Hz) through to your TV using an included Ultra High-Speed HDMI cable. You can switch inputs via the Hue app, but I found I never needed to; its automatic input-switching when I turned on another device was flawless. It also supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 video.

Setup in the Hue app is fairly quick and painless, involving a little QR code-scanning and, for the Sync Box, tapping the button on your Hue Bridge and using a little graphic to drag the Play Wall Washer to its approximate location relative to your TV. After setup, controlling TV syncing—which you'll do from the Sync tab in the app—is pretty straightforward, letting you do things like tweak the brightness of your lights and intensity of their effects.

The main advantage the Play Wall Washer has over covering the back of your TV with RGB integrated circuit (RGBIC) light strips—the kind with LED modules that can be controlled individually, making color gradients along the strip possible—is that physically setting it up is a breeze. You just plop it down behind your TV, plug it and the Sync Box into the wall, hook up your HDMI cables to the Sync Box, and you're done. The disadvantage is that it being a single light source meansit'll cast harsh shadows if there's anything mounted on the wall above it. LED strips don't really have that issue.

Once I cleared out some shadow-casting objects, the Sync Box and Play Wall Washer struck me as being good if what you're after is more of a vibe than seeing colors bleed out from the edge of your TV, or perhaps bias lighting, which can make watching a screen easier on your eyes. Yes, it flashed its lights right alongside the lightning in the opening sequence of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, when Kylo Ren first visits Exegol, and bloomed red and orange in the sunset sequence of The Incredibles, as Mrs. Incredible races to save a commuter bullet train from certain doom. But the light wasn't as precisely positioned around my TV as that you'd get from an LED strip slapped on the back of your TV.

It seemed a bit more precise when I slipped it into gaming mode and played Donkey Kong Bananza on my Nintendo Switch 2, but the effect was still muted. Even so, this left me a lot more convinced by the whole TV backlight concept, at least for gaming—I'd even say I enjoyed the spectacle. Movies are presented as a piece of art meant to wash over you, but video games are inherently participatory—how you experience their stories is up to you, and for me at least, a synchronized light show feels more additive than distracting.

So, price and precision are the Play Wall Washer's big weak points. I A/B tested it against the $149.99 Govee TV Backlight 3 Lite Kit (see the GIFs above), which uses an LED strip and two light bars, and the even cheaper $94.49 HDMI Sync Box from Wiz, another Signify brand—both produced much more localized lighting and aren't just cheaper than the Play Wall Washer on their own, and neither requires you to buy anything else to sync with your TV. Their colors are a lot more in-your-face than the Play Wall Washers, which is a good thing for some people, and if you don't like it, there are ways to tone things down in their respective apps.

They each have their own drawbacks, though: Govee's kit requires hanging an ugly camera from the top of your TV to capture color information, and the lights lag behind the picture slightly (for what it's worth, the company does sell a Sync Box with specs similar to the Philips Hue Sync Box 8K), and the Wiz Sync Box only has a single HDMI input and is limited to 4K resolution at 60Hz or 1440p at 120Hz. And sticking an LED strip to the back of your TV is a pain in both cases.

But maybe you're only interested in the Play Wall Washer as a decorative item. Good for you; you'll save a little money, and the Play Wall Washer's ability to bathe a broad surface in colorful light is excellent. The sweet spot, to me, started at about a foot from a wall, letting me coat the it all the way up to the ceiling. You can go with static lights or gradients—the Hue app has a ton of nice pre-made ones, but you can also roll your own with a color picker in the app—or you can choose from several effects like those that other colorful Hue bulbs and lightstrips use. My favorite was Cosmic Gold, which alternately undulates light in front of and above the lamp, blasts color everywhere, and quickly dials the brightness all the way down in a fluid, repeating animation.

Unfortunately, it's hard to find somewhere to actually put it. It's meant to be stood on a hard surface—either your floor or a table—and with the light pointing upward, everything ends up being underlit, casting harsh shadows if the light encounters any texture or decorations, making it hard for me to find a wall it would work on. Its power cord is a generous 6.2-feet long, but it's embedded, rather than using something like USB-C, so you need a bulky extension cord if it doesn't reach. Also, there are no mounting screw holes, so you'd have to get creative if you want to put it anywhere other than the floor or a piece of furniture.

The only hope for it in my house was my bedroom, which is a converted attic with walls that are only briefly vertical before angling to follow the roofline. The light covered the entire 15-foot length of the wall with vibrant, smooth gradients, and the angled wall helped with furniture shadows and kept the light from fading as it climbed higher. But the Play Wall Washer was smack in the middle of my bedroom floor, right in the walkway and ready to trip me. Ultimately, if you don't have tons of space and an Apple-like minimalist sensibility, it's hard to see this smart light being practical for decoration outside of something like an art gallery.

If you have a Hue Bridge to connect it to, the Play Wall Washer gets support for Matter, the universal protocol that lets your device work across any of the major smart home platforms. That approach—using a hub instead of giving the light Matter compatibility on its own—means I didn't have to do anything after setup to get it working in Apple Home, Google Home, my Flic Hub, and Amazon Alexa; it was just already there. Without a Hue Bridge, it'll only work with the last two in that list. That could be fine in the short term, but if some slick new platform emerges down the road, there's far less chance this light will be supported without Matter.

Whatever your platform of choice is, you'll still want to use the Hue app, as it's the only way to make the Play Wall Washer show gradients. It's also where you'll find Hue's various automations, like presence-mimicking that can randomly turn your lights on and off at night when you're away, or geofencing that toggles them off or on when you leave or come home. The Play Wall Washer is actually really nice with the Hue wake-up automation, which turns it slowly over a long stretch, because it can be both extremely dim and very bright. That long wall I mentioned earlier? It was nice to close my curtains and wake up to it totally bathed in the colors of a sunrise.

The $219.99 Hue Play Wall Washer is a really cool little smart lamp that's small enough that it won't call attention to itself beyond the lush colors it produces. It's not cheap, but for home decor purposes, the price may be right, so long as you have a big ol' wall to shine its light onto and the space to keep it from being underfoot.

As a TV-syncing light, it might be too subdued and imprecise for many people, and it's limited to TVs that are placed a little away from the wall if you want even lighting from a single Play Wall Washer. But even if you do like its vibe and super easy setup, the costs ramp way up to unlock that functionality, requiring you to buy hardware that costs much more than the light itself or have one of very few specific TV sets that can do it for you, assuming you already have a Hue Bridge. Given that the market is absolutely lousy with TV backlight options, it may be best to save your money and skip the Hue Play Wall Washer.

Dell has built its reputation as a premium brand in the laptop market, which means it carefully guards its pricing strategy. Visit Dell's official website or walk into a physical store, and you'll rarely see discounts exceeding 20 to 30% on their machines. But if you know where to look, the savings get much more aggressive. Right now, Dell is clearing inventory through its official Amazon storefront, offering the Vostro 3530 15-inch laptop (32GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD, Intel Core i3) with a massive 63% discount. The laptop normally cost you $1,599, but it's just $599 right now as part of this Prime Day discount.

See at Amazon

The Dell Vostro 3530 runs on Intel's 13th Gen Core i3-1305U processor with a hybrid design of one Performance core and four Efficient cores for a total of six threads. The P-core can be boosted as high as 4.5GHz when you need more power for demanding processes. Background tasks and less intensive workloads are handled by the E-cores at slower clock speeds in order to keep the battery life going.

The 32GB of DDR4 RAM stands as where this laptop breaks away from standard budget laptops shipping with 8GB or 16GB. Increased RAM means the system can keep more programs and files loaded into memory all at once without needing to swap data to the slower SSD. If you're the type of user who leaves 30 browser windows open, has Microsoft Office apps running, Slack or Teams minimized but running in the background, and sometimes has Photoshop or video editing running, you'll appreciate the elbow room.

The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides fast storage that dramatically accelerates boot times and application launch compared to standard hard drives. Windows 11 Pro starts in seconds, not minutes, large files copy quickly, and installs software is at speeds that make SATA drives of yesteryear dinosaurs.

The 15.6-inch display runs at 1920×1080 resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate which provides smoother scrolling and more natural motion than normal 60Hz screens. Eye fatigue over long periods of work is reduced through the anti-glare coating which also reduces reflections from overhead lighting or windows. The 250-nit brightness is adequate for interior use but will struggle to match direct sunlight.

Connectivity options include WiFi 802.11ac for wireless, Bluetooth for peripherals, three USB-A (two 3.2 Gen 1, one 2.0), one USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, HDMI 1.4 for display out to an external monitor, an RJ-45 jack for wired, and a standard headphone jack. The keyboard also has a full 10-key numeric keypad for convenient data entry for spreadsheet use or accounting.

For $599 with specs that would normally run $1,500-plus, this is excellent value if you're looking for a solid laptop.

Tesla has been hit with an enforcement action by California's Department of Insurance (CDI) for routinely denying or delaying customer claims despite years of warnings from the state regulator, according to a new pair of filings.

Tesla's insurance arm, along with its partner State National Insurance Company, engaged in “willful unfair claims settlement practices” including “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps” of the process and “unreasonable denials,” CDI wrote. This has allegedly caused “financial harm” and “distress to policyholders.”

CDI first approached Tesla about these issues in 2022, according to the filings, yet it claims things have only gotten worse. “In 2025, the Tesla Companies have already had more complaints, more justified complaints, and committed more violations than in the three previous years combined,” the regulator wrote. 

Tesla and State National could face penalties up to $5,000 for each “unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act” and up to $10,000 for each “willful” act, according to the filings. The companies have 15 days to respond. 

The enforcement action could have knock-on legal effects for Tesla. In July, the company was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit over allegations that the company purposely delayed and minimized claim payouts. CDI wrote Friday that Tesla's actions may have created “potential third-party liability exposure.” Tesla and State National did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tesla launched its in-house insurance product in 2019. The idea was to offer cheaper premiums and faster service. But it got off to a rocky start. The website repeatedly crashed, and when it didn't, it offered quotes that were far higher than owners expected. Still, Musk promised it would be a “revolutionary” product.

Just three years later, according to CDI's filings, the regulator noticed a “marked uptick in claims-related consumer complaints” against Tesla. So in December 2022, CDI started meeting with Tesla and State National. 

The regulator said it learned Tesla's “Head of Claims” position had been vacant for months. It also accused the companies of not reporting the claims-handling problems.

As a result, CDI subjected Tesla and State National to a sort of probationary period: the regulator monitored the companies' efforts to reduce these violations for six months. Tesla and State National “conceded” that they had underestimated the volume of claims and the staffing required to handle them, according to CDI, and promised to beef up hiring.

It took Tesla until April 2023 to hire a new Head of Claims. Through the rest of that year, Tesla and State National “reported improvements in the quality” of their claims handling and the “resolution of consumer complaints.” 

Later that year, Reuters published an investigation into Tesla's insurance arm that showed things weren't so rosy. 

CDI came to the same realization in 2024. The regulator noticed a “significant increase” in both consumer complaints against Tesla and “violations of the law,” according to the filings. CDI had received just 83 consumer complaints against Tesla in 2022, but in 2024, that number jumped to 829. In 775 of those cases, CDI found Tesla had violated the state's insurance code.

Things have only gotten worse, according to CDI. Through September 22 of this year, the regulator has received 1,481 complaints against Tesla, and identified 1,969 insurance code violations.

In total, since 2022, CDI said Tesla has accumulated nearly 3,000 violations of state insurance law. The majority of those violations involve Tesla failing to respond to customers within the mandatory 15-day period. CDI said it identified 166 violations in which Tesla filed to conduct a “thorough, fair, and objective investigation” into a claim.

“CDI repeatedly notified [Tesla] of its claims-mishandling issues and violations of law,” the regulator wrote. “While [Tesla] repeatedly committed to improvements, the number of justified complaints and violations continued to mount, demonstrating [Telsa's] failure to correct its practices.”

The hackers didn't directly breach Discord.

Discord has just notified its users of a data breach that occurred a couple of weeks ago, on September 20, where hackers gained access to user information through third-party channels. Discord was not directly hacked; instead, the bad actors compromised one of its customer service providers, from which they gained access to mainly users' contact information, including email addresses and real names. This data was intended to be used as leverage to demand a financial ransom from Discord, but thankfully, the situation has now been aptly addressed.

Discord essentially has a monopoly over the video game communication market, with a market share of over 90%. It goes without saying how important it is for the giant to set a benchmark for privacy and lead by example. The company relies on third-party customer service providers, which gamers contact through the customer support and/or Trust and Safety teams. One of these providers was hacked, but Discord states that it has since severed the affected provider's access to its ticketing system and has involved law enforcement in investigating the matter.

In the breach, the hackers got access to usernames, real names, email addresses, IP addresses, "limited" billing info like payment type and the last four digits of bank cards, along with some other internal Discord training material. A select few users who provided their government-issued IDs, such as passports or driver's licenses, were also affected in the attack. Full passwords, residential addresses, or any other sensitive info seem to be safe, however. Messages shared between support and users were also compromised, but any other server chats or DMs remain untouched. Click the tweet below to see the full letter.

Discord has begun sending e-mails notifications about a cybersecurity incident which occurred September 20th, 2025.It appears people who submitted support tickets are the ones primarily impacted.Literally peoples entire identity stolen from this shit pic.twitter.com/5WlhAYbihGOctober 3, 2025

Overall, it's an isolated incident that didn't spiral into something catastrophic. Discord says that if you've been affected, you'll receive an email from noreply@discord.com detailing the following steps and informing you exactly what information was leaked. Discord highlighted its commitment to security in a blog post, mentioning that investigations into the matter have already begun and that they've reviewed their current threat detection systems and safety protocols to ensure this doesn't happen again. As always, stay vigilant.

This mouse has ears.

A group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine, have developed a way to use the sensors in high-quality optical mice to capture subtle vibrations and convert them into audible data. According to the abstract of Mic-E-Mouse (full PDF here), the high polling rate and sensitivity of high-performance optical mice pick up acoustic vibrations from the surface where they sit. By running the raw data through signal processing and machine learning techniques, the team could hear what the user was saying through their desk.

Mouse sensors with a 20,000 DPI or higher are vulnerable to this attack. And with the best gaming mice becoming more affordable annually, even relatively affordable peripherals are at risk. It all begins when a user has a mouse like this attached to a compromised computer.

Note that this compromise does not necessarily mean a complicated virus installed through a backdoor — it can be as simple as an infected FOSS that requires high-frequency mouse data, like creative apps or video games. This means it's not unusual for the software to gather this data. From there, the collected raw data can be extracted from the target computer and processed off-site. "With only a vulnerable mouse, and a victim's computer running compromised or even benign software (in the case of a web-based attack surface), we show that it is possible to collect mouse packet data and extract audio waveforms," the researchers state.

The processing works like this: the raw audio data is run through digital signal processing using a Wiener Filter, where you can start to hear some information. This is then further cleared up through a neural model, giving the researchers clear audio.

Although this is a novel method for extracting audio from unsuspecting targets, it's not exactly the first time that someone has attempted to covertly record targets. One famous example from the Cold War was when the KGB gifted the American ambassador in Moscow a replica of the Great Seal with an embedded passive microphone. It only activated when it was hit by a high-frequency radio signal, leaving it undetected for nearly seven years.

The concept of the Mic-E-Mouse is similar — using an unsuspecting device to capture audio data. However, this method is empowered by AI models, allowing the researchers to get a speech recognition accuracy of about 42 to 61%, effectively turning your mouse into an eavesdropping microphone, though.

The proof of concept is certainly unnerving, but it will hopefully prompt future steps taken to prevent this sort of acoustic privacy violation, the kind that would have been unthinkable in a world before AI.

NetBurst's final gasp wasn't public, but has now come into clear view.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A rare Intel engineering sample from the twilight of the Pentium 4 era has surfaced on social media. We've never seen this 4.0 GHz chip before. On Reddit, the current owner of the purported Intel Pentium Extreme Edition 980 processor, diegunguyman, has shared photos of the chip, both front and back, along with a CPU-Z screenshot for some deeper technical details. Due to quirks with the CPU-Z app/online database, this CPU won't validate correctly.

Diegunguyman reached out on various Subreddits to try and glean more insight into his find. The basic backstory was that “The only text on the CPU itself was written in Sharpie, just the model number and clock speed, 4 GHz.” With no official documentation to reference, the Redditor turned to experts on Subreddits like r/pcmasterrace and r/Intel to seek answers.

This particular dual-core Hyperthreaded ‘Presler' P4 is a very interesting sample for a number of reasons. Firstly, the collective wisdom of the flock of attentive Redditors interested in this story indicates that the sample now owned by diegunguyman was likely a loaner chip given to an employee.

These Employee Loaner Chips are rarer than typical Engineering Samples (ES). Their rarity is probably bolstered by the strict terms of the loan. However, a purported Intel ‘insider' on Reddit indicates that due to the extensive layoffs at the firm, policing of the loaner system has evaporated.

Another interesting aspect of this CPU is the reasons that the public never saw with the pinnacle of NetBurst. It is now a matter for the history books, but the processor line already had a poor reputation for its thermals and performance, which played a part.

What likely sealed this ‘ghost' processor's fate was Intel's strategic pivot. Management was already shifting focus to the legendary Core 2 lineup, built on the mobile-first Core microarchitecture. Then we saw Intel's marketing shift to focusing on the entirely reasonable performance-per-watt metric, and the NetBurst design was quickly relegated to history, with budget / entry-level chips being the primary beneficiaries.

It is probably fair to say Intel's Haifa design team and its mobile-first Core microarchitecture were Intel's saviors. From mid-2006, the new performance-per-watt tuned chips managed to effectively stall the momentum of AMD's contemporaneous CPUs like the Athlon 64 and X2 designs on the desktop.

I owe the original Game Boy everything. Had it not been for Nintendo's gray brick of a handheld, and a copy of Super Mario Land, I doubt I would be writing these words on Gizmodo. It was the gadget that started my lifelong obsession with cutting-edge technology and my passion for sharing it with others. So excuse me for being overwhelmed with emotion and nostalgia when Lego announced it was making a 421-piece brick set version of the iconic Nintendo handheld.

Released on Oct. 1 for $60, the Lego Game Boy is a pretty easy build. Lego says it's for ages 18+ and up, but there was nothing complicated enough that a 10-year-old couldn't follow the instructions. (Though, they wouldn't have any nostalgia for the handheld that came out in 1989.) It took me about 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete, but I think it would have taken under an hour if I hadn't stopped to shoot B-roll for a social video. (It's all fun and games building Lego sets after work; this is also work for me.)

Lego's Nintendo Game Boy is easily one of the most fun brick sets of the year.

Pros

Cons

As I noted in my hands-on a few weeks earlier, the Lego Game Boy is more than just a charming—and almost 1:1 replica—display piece. In addition to the pressable buttons, scrollable dials, and the slideable power switch, you can also pop in brick versions of Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening game cartridges into the Lego Game Boy. Remove the back cover and you get access to swap in three different lenticular screens featuring the two games and the Game Boy's famous bootup screen featuring the Nintendo logo sliding down.

The Lego Game Boy is so freaking cool! Check out my review and interview with Lego Senior Designer Carl Merriam and Design Director Simon Kent, who worked on the 421-piece Lego Game Boy set to learn how they developed it from start to finish. There's so much that went into designing not just how it looks on the outside, but the inside too. Like the way the buttons and switches work, the brickified circuit boards inside the Game Paks, and more.  Also, will there be Lego SNES, N64, and more sets? #lego #nintendo #gameboy #foryou #toys

There are tons of Easter eggs inside the Lego Game Boy that make it more than just a skin-deep recreation. I spoke with Carl Merriam, a senior designer at the Lego Group, and Simon Kent, a design director at the Lego Group, who worked on the Lego Game Boy set to unearth some of its unseen secrets.

There's been some strongly worded opinions about which company gets credit for the Lego Game Boy. Is it Lego or is it Nintendo? The answer is both—as it should be. Nintendo is famous for being extremely protective of its IP—its products, franchises, and characters are well-guarded and require top-level approval. To do a Lego version of the Game Boy, Merriam and Kent had to go beyond just the outer gray shell and pink buttons.

“Nintendo was very involved,” Kent, who's been at Lego for almost 20 years, told Gizmodo. “We have a team that works in Japan… they basically allow us to connect to different IP teams or hardware teams or even creative teams within Nintendo to get the right information to make the product as best as it can be. We also met with the hardware designer that I think may have worked on the original or certainly was connected to the original [Game Boy].”

Merriam, a senior designer who's been at Lego for 12 years, started as a fan before landing at the toy company. He's worked on Lego sets, including Boost, Minecraft, and Super Mario, to name a few popular series. For the Game Boy, which he says took around a year from concept to development, the team went through 10 to 20 iterations before landing on the final design and tweaking it to feel extra special, extra Nintendo-y.

The dimensions of the Game Boy proved to be restrictive in what Lego could do, but in the end, I would say it's semi-faithful to the actual handheld, which has to be commended.

“We don't really have a lot of room in here to do a lot of stuff, and we played around with all kinds of different functional ways to make you be able to do something with the games,” Merriam told Gizmodo. “It turned out that the one thing that we could achieve all over the entire thing was making all of the buttons have the same haptic feedback as the actual device, or as close as we can get in Lego bricks.”

He said each area of the Lego Game Boy was a design challenge on its own. Merriam says he probably built 30 to 40 versions for the way the D-pad, buttons, and switches. I noticed that attention to detail as I built the Lego set. Behind the D-pad is actually a little rubber piece that gives it a springiness when you press into it. Same goes for the A and B buttons; those are actually minifig hats painted pink, and there's a little rubber band behind them that gives them a familiar button travel when pressed. The start and select buttons are black tire pieces changed to gray, and they date back to 1969, Kent told me. Comparing the Lego Game Boy controls with my original Game Boy that my mom bought in 1993, I gotta say it's impressive how hard Lego went to replicate it.

I asked how they approached building the Lego Game Boy—did they 3D model it first or just get right to building? How do you even go about choosing the pieces, though? It's estimated that there are tens of thousands of unique Lego pieces available to use. With an entire vault going back almost 70 years to select from, where do you even start? Sure, Lego could—and it did—create a few new, custom parts for the Game Boy, but where's the creativity in making many new parts?

“My mind is built of the Lego system, so whenever I see anything in the real world, I see a Lego piece that maybe could be that thing,” Merriam said. He explained to me how the clear panel for the Lego Game Boy screen is actually a window frame that's “quite an old piece,” and it was a good problem to have to design it so that it would be centered properly.

As for the custom pieces… well, you could try to find out which one it is, or I could just tell you. It involves one of the corners of the Lego Game Boy.

“We wanted to sort of incorporate everything that was mobile about the Game Boy,” added Kent. “We had discussions—should we do any peripherals that can plug into it? Should it come with some headphones? Should it come with a little light [like the Game Boy Light Magnifier]? But, in the end, we wanted to keep it simple and focused very much on… taking their favorite games and playing them anywhere.”

Speaking of games, the insides of the cartridges, or Game Paks as they're officially called, were something that came later on in the process, after they finished making the outer case and making sure all the functions worked. In the Zelda game cart, there's a “save battery” piece that replicates the way Game Paks preserved your game progress.

One burning question I had to ask the two was what the joint/kickstand-like piece that keeps the lenticular screens in place is called. “I call it a dingler, I don't have a technical term for it,” Merriam told me. So there you have it, it's unofficially called a dingler!

The Game Boy is the second Nintendo console that Lego brickified. The first was the Lego NES set released in 2020. That set was larger, had more pieces, and was more expensive. Kent says the Lego Game Boy was an attempt at a Nintendo set that's more affordable.

“For a long time, the team in general has wanted to do the Game Boy, and we felt that now was probably the right time, and we also wanted to explore a different price point,” Kent said. “Obviously, the NES came with a TV. It's a higher price point, so we wanted to do something smaller to test that area.”

I tried to get Merriam and Kent to tell me whether there are more Lego Nintendo consoles on the way, but they wouldn't let anything slip. So if you're waiting for a Lego SNES, N64, or GameCube, you'll just have to keep waiting.

When I first saw the Lego Game Boy, I was both excited and curious to see how it would differ from the many fan creations out there. I was surprised—or maybe I shouldn't have been—that Merriam and Kent didn't look at the fan creations out there.

“If you search for anything related to intellectual property, there's probably a Lego version of it out there somewhere,” Kent said. “We are very careful for that exact reason. We deliberately don't look at fan-related material because we want to focus on the actual real thing and do what we think is the right thing with the partner who we are collaborating with.”

“One of the most interesting differences between being a Lego fan and the Lego designer is that we're designing a product for people to build at home, and to make the experience of building the product fun is a totally different challenge than just making something look like the source material,” said Merriam.

At the end of the day, the Lego Game Boy—or any Lego set, really—should be fun to build. Yes, I often speed build Lego sets, but that usually comes at the expense of enjoying all the care that went into designing not just how the completed build looks on the outside, but the inside.

There's honestly not much to dislike about the Lego Game Boy set. If there's anything to nitpick, it's that the transparent screen was a little scuffed out of the box, and I wish the lenticular cards were more visible. But then again, the original Game Boy's monochromatic green screen was a pain to look at from any angle other than dead center, too. For a weekend build that only costs $60, this is the most fun you'll have in a long time, especially if you've got any nostalgia for the Game Boy.

“The Lego system is like a language,” Merriam said. “I like to try to write poetry with the Lego system. Every once in a while, I can achieve it, and I believe I've achieved it in this one.”

Adobe has had a busy year designing and redesigning a number of its most popular apps for mobile, and Premiere for iPhone is the latest—a mobile-first video editing workflow that adapts most of the tools from the desktop version of Premiere to a mobile user interface. You can trim, layer, edit, and even auto-generate captions, alongside all the basic editing features you'd expect, like color and exposure adjustments.

The automatic resizing feature is particularly nice, adapting videos to both horizontal and landscape platforms, making sure your subject is centered for both cuts. As with anything Adobe releases these days, there are plenty of AI-powered features, including the ability to generate backgrounds from a prompt and create sound effects from your voice.

Premiere for iPhone is free, though if you want to use the AI features, you'll have to buy credits within the app. According to Adobe, the Android version is still under development. —Scott Gilbertson

No, Nothing isn't switching from Android to a custom AI-powered OS. However, the phone brand announced a new platform called Essential, which will lay the groundwork for a future in which users generate their own apps and user interface. We've heard these ideas before, often called generative user interfaces, and it's still early days for the technology.

Nothing's plan starts with two apps: Essential Apps and Playground. The former lets you create “apps” with natural language, though these are really designed in the form of widgets. Just describe what you need—capture all the receipts in my camera roll and export a PDF every Friday—and this will be generated as a widget you can interact with on the home screen. The Nothing Phone (3) supports up to six of these Essential apps, but older Nothing devices are limited to two.

Playground is a place where you can publish not just your Essential Apps but also other Nothing oddities, like Glyph Toys from the Phone (3), camera presets, and EQ profiles. You can download what the community has made and even “remix” them into your own. Eventually, these features will turn into what Nothing is calling Essential OS, which it expects to debut in 2028. (Remember the Essential Phone from 2017? Nothing bought the company's assets in 2021, and it seems like it was for the name.)

Nothing debuted some of these AI features with the “Essential” branding earlier this year. Essential Space is a new app that debuted on the Phone (3a), triggered by a dedicated button; tap it to capture your screen and have AI pull insights and summarize the contents. Now, there's Essential Memory, which the company says “brings everything together by learning your habits, and surfacing forgotten details when you need them most.” It's coming soon, so we'll have to wait and see to learn more.

Hot on the heels of Ultrahuman and Oura announcing that you will be able to schedule and take blood labs with their services, Whoop debuted Whoop Advanced Labs. Not only can you add your preexisting blood work to the Whoop app, but you can also book blood testing through the app (like Oura, Whoop has partnered with Quest Diagnostics). Whoop's offering is a bit more expensive, at $199 per test, $349 for two tests per year, or $599 for four tests per year, as compared to Oura's $99 per test. Both purport to combine blood work results with long-term continuous monitoring with their respective trackers.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

Labs are routine medical tests that let doctors screen things such as high cholesterol, high blood glucose, and diabetes, or hormone or ferritin tests to check if your thyroid is working or you're eating enough iron. They can be expensive, inconvenient to schedule and take, and fairly arcane to interpret, so it makes sense that startups are starting to offer them as part of their subscription services.

Still, it's a sad statement on the current accessibility of health care that routine medical services are now being funneled into revenue streams for private companies. As much as I like the Oura Ring and the Whoop band, they're not doctors; they still can't actually treat you for a heart attack or colon cancer. —Adrienne So

Arlo's new Essential 3 range rounds off a busy week for security cameras, with Google showing off new Nest cameras and Amazon releasing a fresh batch of Ring and Blink cameras. Arlo's Essential 3 lineup includes indoor and outdoor pan/tilt cameras (a first for the company), alongside a new generation of regular outdoor and indoor cameras.

The Essential Pan Tilt ($60) and Essential Pan Tilt Indoor ($50) offer 2K footage, 360-degree pan, 180-degree tilt, and automatic subject tracking, and there are HD versions for a bit less. The 3rd-gen Essential Outdoor Battery ($70), Essential XL Outdoor Battery ($80), Essential Security Camera Plug-in ($50), and Essential Indoor Camera Plug-in ($40) all offer 2K footage, and again, there are slightly cheaper HD versions of each.

Moving up the line, there's the Pro Security Camera 2K ($125), which adds HDR and a wider 160-degree field of view, and the Pro XL Security Camera 2K ($200), which is the same but with a bigger battery inside. Finally, there is an update for the Ultra Security Camera 4K ($200), which combines 4K footage, HDR, and a 180-degree field of view.

What artificial intelligence can do for home security was talked up a lot this week, and Arlo was no exception, with its beefed-up AI promising real-time intelligence for Arlo Secure subscribers (plans start at $8 a month). The new AI can recognize known people and vehicles, detect animals and packages, alert you to fire by spotting flames, and even be trained to flag certain situations, such as you leaving the garage door open again. —Simon Hill

The art of getting a baby to sleep is filled with trial and error, and sometimes unsafe sleeping solutions. Babies should sleep on flat, firm surfaces, but these little critters love to fall asleep in bouncers and rockers, since those devices replicate the movement they felt in the womb. Elvie, maker of one of our favorite breast pumps, announced a solution earlier this year at CES that's now available for purchase: the Elvie Rise.

It's a smart bouncer and bassinet in one device, letting you switch from a rocker chair into a flat bassinet without needing to pick up and relocate your little one (thus letting them stay asleep). The “smart” aspect comes from the rocking technology you can control with a smartphone, choosing the perfect bounce level to soothe your baby. The app will also track how long the baby is in the bassinet and their overall sleep. It's a handy all-in-one device, if you can stomach the $900 cost. Still, that's considerably cheaper than a Snoo bassinet. —Nena Farrell

Maybe you've seen billboards for Back Market, the company that sells refurbished, used tech. The company now has a physical retail presence in New York City, though only for a limited time. Located in SoHo at 449 Broadway, the pop-up store will run from October 1 to December 21. Instead of heading to an Apple Store to buy a new iPad or MacBook, you can go to Back Market's store to shop for a used, refurbished device and save some cash along the way.

The store isn't just a place to buy used gear, though. There's an area that makes it a game to spot the difference between new and refurbished tech, and you can even get your devices serviced. The pop-up offers device diagnostics, screen repairs, cleaning services, and trade-in options. There's also a unique tie-in with Google Fi, so you can learn more and shop for plans from Google's cell service. The company also says there will be community panels and workshops discussing sustainability over the coming months.

Roland has announced its first analog drum machine in decades. The new TR-1000 Rhythm Creator builds on the legacy the brand cemented in the 1980s and 1990s with the iconic TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines, which were used to make nearly every classic hip-hop album (and a shocking percentage of modern ones).

Roland has been modeling its analog hardware with digital chips for decades now, but the new TR-1000 uses 16 analog circuits from the original drum machines, then adds a digital backend to the sound that allows you to shape sounds and sequences. It also has sampling tools that will let you chop up songs, time-stretch, and sequence them.

It's a premium product for a tier of producer most of us will never achieve—the TR-1000 costs $2,700 at launch—but it will likely be used hip-hop, pop, and other music for the next several decades. Ironically, the original 808 was so ahead of its time that it was a commercial failure. I doubt this will be the case with this new model. —Parker Hall

If Apple wants to match the grip Meta has on the smart glasses market, it just might have to simplify its face computers. For now, at least.

According to an internal announcement reported in Bloomberg by serial Apple leaker Mark Gurman, Apple has deprioritized efforts to make a lighter, more affordable version of its Vision Pro headset in favor of focusing on AI-enabled smart glasses. Apple now seems to be aiming to launch a pair of Meta-style smart glasses in 2027, with another pair featuring a display on the lens aimed for release in 2028—if not before.

The move makes sense—after all, this has been the year where smart glasses really gained a foothold—but it's a telling and somewhat embarrassing U-turn for Apple. The $3,499 Apple Vision Pro has widely been considered a failure for the company, after Apple moved uncharacteristically early in a field that was still finding its feet. While it was always clear that Apple intended the premium device to prove its use case to developers, widespread acceptance of Apple's tech simply hasn't followed. It's too expensive, too bulky, too socially isolating, and altogether lacking in apps and use cases—the complete opposite to a pair of smart glasses.

However, it had seemingly planned to double down on the tech regardless, working on a slimmer, more affordable version of Vision Pro, predicted to launch in 2027. But that has now apparently changed, with the company reportedly fast tracking resources to its smart glasses projects instead.

But Apple is undeniably behind, and considerably so. This sudden change in focus feels unusual for a usually patient Cupertino, and is perhaps an acknowledgement of that fact.

“It does seem that Apple is just kind of spinning,” says Michael Gartenberg, a tech analyst and former Apple marketing director. “For the first time in a long time, Apple feels like they're out of the conversation.”

But Apple knows it is not a conversation it can afford to be excluded from, not least because it's a threat to its core device—the iPhone—suggests Gartenberg. Having a device directly in front of your eyes that can take phone calls, snap photos and video, and use AI to answer questions or translate languages means that smart glasses can offload a lot of the core use cases that people would normally pull out their phones to accomplish.

“A phone that stays in your pocket is not where Apple wants to see the iPhone,” he adds.

Anshel Sag, a principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees that while Apple has long been interested in making smart glasses and already has multiple projects in place, it hadn't been adequately prepared for this shift in the market.

“I don't believe their strategy had smart glasses as the base of the pyramid like Meta does,” Sag says about Apple's extended reality efforts. “Apple wants to be enterprise, which is going to demand a higher resolution, higher quality device,” Sag says. “That's not happening on smart glasses. Not anytime soon.”

Backing the wrong horse in this race has cost Apple dearly, and not just in time. Estimates suggest the company may have spent as much as $33 billion on its production (Gartenberg guesstimates the amount is somewhere in the “tens of billions”), with sales figures to date thought to be well below the 1 million mark. Even with some generosity around sales estimations, that means Apple Vision Pro could've brought in as little as 10 percent of what was invested in it. Of course, some of that will go forward into other products, but it still can't be the outcome the company had hoped for—even though Apple CEO Tim Cook himself predicted it.

When discussing the development of AR and AR devices back in 2016, he said that most people wouldn't find it acceptable to be “enclosed in something … because we are sociable people at heart.” He was spot on.

It turns out that what people really want at this moment is to just wear something that looks good and feels like a normal pair of glasses, with use cases that are actually, well, useful. And no, Tim, that's not to watch Ted Lasso on their ceiling.

Coming to smart glasses in 2027 will feel almost impossibly late for a market that is taking off now, and while Apple is no stranger to starting behind, it will need to ensure its judgment on what its customers want in smart glasses is much more attuned than it was with Apple Vision Pro. At this point, it simply can't afford another misstep.

But Apple isn't giving up on Apple Vision Pro either, and reports suggest it may well revisit it once the more pressing issue of smart glasses is dealt with. While Gartenberg remains unconvinced that Apple can get the Vision Pro cheap enough to make it truly accessible for all (“the things that Apple would need to do to get this thing down to a price for humans is extraordinary”), Sag suggests it might not have to.

He points to the boom in gaming consoles as an example. Rather than flatlining the gaming PC market as was predicted, the proliferation of consoles actually helped drive sales of PCs, with more people getting into gaming, so more wanting to level up their equipment in time. He predicts the same trend will happen with smart glasses. People will start with more basic, familiar frames, then migrate into the chunkier, fully featured versions.

“People need to remember that XR is a spectrum and that devices are going to exist along that continuum,” Sag says. “The cheaper, simpler devices are going to reach the most people, but then there's going to be a lot of people who want more than this base level experience.”

One day, Apple may be able to make that singular, gorgeous XR headset that people actually want to wear. But until then, it has to meet the market where it is headed—and that is in cheaper, lighter, more functional frames.

Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella says his side tried to exploit Liverpool's right-hand side in their 2-1 win over the reigning champions.

After Cody Gakpo had equalised following Moises Caicedo's opener, left-back Cucurella set up youngster Estevao for a 95th minute winner and the Spaniard says boss Enzo Maresca had identified Mo Salah staying forward as a weakness for the opposition.

“We know that Salah is always ready for the counter attack so we practiced that and the manager said that the space might be there [on the right side of Liverpool],” Cucurella told Sky Sports.

“We saw that it was the last minute but we kept attacking. I tried to give my last effort and Enzo gave me the ball and I crossed for Estevao.”

On the victory, Cucurella said: “I think we deserve it. We started the game very well and then the second half we started not in the right way again. We need to improve these things.

“But in general I think we deserve this win. We came through some tough weeks, this moment was amazing and we go into the break with three points, so we are very happy.

“We deserved this moment. It was not an easy week for us. Playing Champions League we play every few days. It is good because if you lose then you have another game in a few hours. In the middle of the week we suffered in the final minutes but we created this momentum with the fans.

“Then today we started the game in the right way, we scored early as well and we started to get confidence.”

Ruben Amorim can breathe a sigh of relief after Manchester United registered a much-needed 2-0 win over the in-form Sunderland on Saturday afternoon. Following the game, Mason Mount, who got himself on the scoresheet along with summer arrival Benjamin Sesko, asserted that the team is fully behind the under-pressure Amorim amid reports that he could face the axe.

Adidas will be bringing back the white FIFA World Champions badge for the Argentina 2026 World Cup away kit.

The leaked Argentina 2026 World Cup away kit features a black and blue swirling design, paired with the lighter variant of the champions badge.

It marks the first time since France's 2020 home kit that the white version of the badge has been used, and the first time Adidas have given it to Argentina. Both the 2022 and 2024 home and away kits only carried the gold version.

The Adidas Argentina 2025-2026 away kit with the white FIFA World Cup winners badge football shirt will be available from March 2026. The white badge is not yet available for retail but is expected to arrive with the launch of the away kit next year.

A former member of the defensive ranks at the likes of Real Madrid and Sevilla is on the verge of a move to Major League Soccer, with Lionel Messi's Inter Miami.

That's according to transfer insider Fabrizio Romano, who point towards Sergio Reguilón as the player in question.

Left-back Reguilón is for his part currently available as a free agent.

This comes after the 28-year-old saw his contract terms with Premier League outfit Tottenham Hotspur allowed to expire earlier this summer.

A number of clubs, in turn, are understood to have expressed an interest in Reguilón's signature with a view to the season ahead.

And as alluded to above, late this week, one such suitor appear to have won out in the battle for his services.

As per a report from journalist Fabrizio Romano:

‘Inter Miami in talks for surprise move to sign Sergio Reguilón! Negotiations well underway to join MLS side on free transfer after leaving Spurs in July. Reguilón, expected to accept as he sees Inter Miami as best option despite multiple proposals on the table.'

USMNT forward Patrick Agyemang opened his account for Derby County with a first-half goal in their Championship clash against Southampton. The 24-year-old striker struck in the 40th minute to bring the Rams level at 1-1, notching an important milestone early in his stint with the club following his summer move from Charlotte FC. Both the Saints and Rams would settle for a point Saturday.

Ruben Amorim has explained why he dropped Altay Bayindir from Manchester United's starting lineup against Sunderland in the Premier League. After a series of disappointing performances for the Red Devils, Amorim benched the Turkey international as he handed a debut to deadline day signing Senne Lammens. The Belgian custodian was finally handed the chance to play more than a month after moving from Royal Antwerp.

Benfica have been dealt a hammer blow ahead of their crucial Liga Portugal encounter against arch-rivals Porto on Sunday, with several members of the squad ravaged by a viral outbreak. According to reports from Portugal, some members of the coaching staff – including head coach Jose Mourinho – are also believed to have been affected with the symptoms.

Former Tottenham and Manchester United defender Sergio Reguilon is in line to reportedly link-up with Lionel Messi as the Spanish star is in shock talks to join Inter Miami as a free agent. The 28-year-old Spaniard, who was released by Tottenham when his contract expired in July, is now exploring a move that would see him become the latest European star to land in Major League Soccer alongside some of the game's biggest names.

EPL

Chelsea host Liverpool on Saturday evening in the standout game of the Premier League weekend.

Enzo Maresca's home side have had an up-and-down start to the season. After taking seven points from the first nine available they have not won in three top-flight matches, losing the past two. Chelsea have also struggled with ill-discipline, having a player sent off in three of their four most recent outings in all competitions. They are currently eighth in the table.

Champions Liverpool won their opening five Premier League games but fell to a late defeat against Crystal Palace last weekend, then lost their Champions League visit to Galatasaray in midweek. While still top of the league, they could be overtaken by Arsenal when the north London side play at home to West Ham United earlier on Saturday.

Before the match at Stamford Bridge, The Athletic's Chelsea and Liverpool experts Simon Johnson and Gregg Evans have answered a series of questions analysing the clubs' season so far and where this encounter could be won.

Simon Johnson: A disappointment, albeit there are mitigating factors. Chelsea have yet to play well for a full 90 minutes. Injuries have not helped, and it looks like they are already paying a price for competing at the Club World Cup until the middle of July, which also impacted their pre-season preparations. But two league wins out of six is not good enough.

Gregg Evans: For most of these early weeks, Liverpool have leaned on late goals and resilience to get results. That all came crashing down at Crystal Palace last Saturday with a deserved defeat, but overall, the points haul and the position at the top of the table offer plenty to smile about. The bigger question now is: how long before this new-look line-up truly hit their stride? Performances so far have lacked fluidity and consistency, and naturally, that's stirred a few concerns among supporters.

Johnson: Wingers Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens have yet to establish themselves in the first team. Striker Liam Delap (hamstring) and midfielder Dario Essugo (thigh) have been ruled out for several weeks. Understandably, 19-year-old defender Jorel Hato is being eased in slowly. There have been positives. Joao Pedro is a very good buy from Brighton & Hove Albion, having scored five goals in his first six appearances, including at the Club World Cup. His fellow Brazil international Estevao Willian is a real talent but just 18. Facundo Buonanotte, on a season's loan from Brighton, could prove to be a useful backup to Cole Palmer.

Evans: All the talk is centred around Florian Wirtz and his slow start. For a player of such talent, the expectation is that he would be fully up and running by now, but he's taking his time to adjust. Club record signing Alexander Isak has not hit top gear yet, either, although that was expected, given he had only a short pre-season. Fortunately for Liverpool, Hugo Ekitike has made a blistering start in what is now a much-changed front line from last season's title-winning side. Elsewhere, full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have been steady, but there's room for improvement. Centre-back Giovanni Leoni suffered the heartache of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage in his debut for the club and will be out for about a year, but Giorgi Mamardashvili will now get his chance in goal following Alisson's latest injury in Istanbul on Tuesday.



Johnson: A combination of making very sloppy mistakes defensively and ill discipline. Their back-to-back league defeats in the past two matches, against Manchester United and Brighton, saw them go down to 10 men, in both cases having a player sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity. Trevoh Chalobah's dismissal last Saturday means he is suspended against Liverpool, and Chelsea are still learning to cope with the loss of his fellow centre-back Levi Colwill for most of the season with an ACL injury. Other absences mean the defence is constantly changing. Having star player Palmer struggling with an ongoing groin problem is not helping either.

Evans: New players are still settling in, and the balance in the team is not quite right. Back-to-back defeats for only the second time in head coach Arne Slot's 17-month tenure have left many people wondering whether he has made too many changes too quickly, even though every incoming and outgoing — minus the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold — made sense this summer. Breaking up a midfield unit that was so successful last season hasn't helped performances, and trying to fit in both Wirtz and Isak hasn't worked just yet. On top of that, Mohamed Salah's performances have fallen off, and the defensive structure is not as solid as in Slot's first year.

Johnson: Maresca is learning to cope with the harder schedule, just like his players. This is his first experience of having a Champions League game sandwiched between Premier League fixtures. The 2-2 draw with Brentford last month raised alarm bells as he named key starters Reece James, Marc Cucurella and Palmer on the bench that day. The Italian ended up bringing on all three (and had made four substitutions by the 56th minute) with Chelsea a goal down. He denied, unconvincingly, afterwards that his team selection had anything to do with the trip to Bayern Munich four days later.



Evans: This season was supposed to be about Liverpool rotating a super-strong squad to great effect, but first, they have to find their best XI. Every position is covered, so injuries should not be too much of a concern. However, they are already stretched in defence following Leoni's season-ending setback, and the failed summer pursuit of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi. Elsewhere, there's no set right-back just yet, and the debate over Isak or Ekitike up front rumbles on. Liverpool are also trying to create a pathway for 17-year-old forward Rio Ngumoha, and that will continue as the season progresses.

Johnson: Joao Pedro is not a traditional No 9 and likes to drop deep. That is going to limit the number of chances he gets. As mentioned, Delap is on the treatment table for weeks to come. Maresca has opted for teenage academy graduate Tyrique George, who prefers to play as a winger, to fill in on occasion, and it isn't really working. Another 19-year-old, Marc Guiu, was recalled three games into what was meant to be a season's loan at Sunderland after Delap's injury but has not played a single minute since. However, being without Palmer — their main creative spark — so often would hurt any team. He is going to miss out against Liverpool as well, which means he will have started just two of the season's first seven league games. While midfielder Enzo Fernandez is their top goalscorer so far with three in the six top-flight matches, Chelsea are clearly missing an edge up front.

Evans: Isak was always going to take time, given his late return to training after a summer in transfer limbo, but Ekitike has hit the ground running after his move with four goals in eight games in all competitions. Federico Chiesa has also chipped in with important strikes and goal contributions, mainly off the bench. The big disappointment so far has been Salah, who usually starts the season so well but has just one Premier League goal from open play so far in the six matches.

Johnson: Nothing has changed. Chelsea will still look to qualify for the Champions League again via another top four/five finish, and have good runs in the three cup competitions.

Evans: After a mammoth summer spend, Liverpool are still expected to retain the title and go deeper into the Champions League than their round of 16 exit last time (though that was to eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain on penalties). The expectations never drop at Anfield.

Johnson: Chelsea fans will never regard Liverpool with much warmth but some of the bite has gone out of this fixture. The win against Liverpool, who had already been confirmed as champions by then, in May was Chelsea's first in 11 meetings. The rivalry was particularly bitter when Chelsea had a much better side than this one and also had characters, like then manager Jose Mourinho, stirring the pot.

Evans: This used to be the big game in the Premier League, but there's no such spice these days. Last season, Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk hinted that Chelsea could be in the title race, but after a promising start that had them second in December, they tailed off. For some Liverpool fans, they'll remember the crunch encounters of the past, but most will now see it as just another match.

Johnson: Both are struggling to keep clean sheets, but Liverpool's attack is better equipped to take advantage of that. I'm going for a 2-1 away win.

Evans: Well, this is awkward, because I'm going for a Chelsea win. Like the previous game between these teams at Stamford Bridge, at the end of last season, although not as emphatic as that day's 3-1 result — 2-1.

FIFA unveiled the official match ball for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, called Trionda, which translated from Spanish, means “three waves”, a hat tip to the three host nations, Canada, Mexico and the United States. The ball's design features three prominent colours: red, green and blue that also pays homage to the three host countries.

Trionda has four panels that connect to form a triangle in the centre of the ball in a nod to the historic union of the three host nations. The ball will carry iconography representing each of the three host countries: a maple leaf for Canada, an eagle for Mexico and a star for the United States, while gold embellishments pay tribute to the FIFA World Cup Trophy.

The Trionda will have some big shoes to fill. After all, FIFA history is full of World Cup balls created for specific editions. And with rich back stories too.

Uruguay 1930: T-model

But before we get to balls with names like Telstar, Azteca, Jabulani, Al Rihla, we should talk about why the need for an official ball arose in the first place. The first edition of the FIFA World Cup in 1930 did not have an official ball (Although many matches saw the T-model football being used). The T-model ball was named so because of the eleven T-shaped strips of hand-stitched leather cobbled together to make the ball. The ball had already been used at the Paris 1924 and Amsterdam 1928 Olympics.

For the maiden World Cup final of the 1930 edition, the captains of Uruguay and Argentina disagreed over which ball to use. The hosts wanted the T-model ball. Their opponents were adamant on using the Tiento ball, which was made of 12 long panels.

With neither side willing to budge, it was decided that both balls would be used for each half each. How much did their preference of a ball matter? Argentina were leading 2-1 at the interval with their favoured Tiento ball. Then Uruguay got their favoured ball for the second half, and they won the match 4-2 by scoring three second half goals.

Italy 1934: Federale 102

For the next edition of the World Cup in Italy, the Federale 102, which was produced by an Italian manufacturing company, was used. The Federale 102 consisted of 13 hand-stitched leather panels. But it was not the only ball used: at least two other balls—Globe and the Zig-Zag, both of which were produced by British companies—were used for matches during the tournament, including the final. It was the team captains who were given the choice of which ball to use in their games.

France 1938: Allen

Modern day advertising and marketing mavericks look away now. Because the Paris-produced Allen balls that were used during the France 1938 World Cup did not have any branding on the balls used during the biggest platform any brand could have: a football World Cup (even if it wasn't the earth stopping behemoth it is today). The only time the makers of the ball marketed their brand name was when they placed the ball at the centre of the pitch before the start of the final.

Brazil 1950: Superball Duplo T

The Second World War interrupted the World Cups for 12 years. When the first post-war World Cup was played in 1950, the organisers used the Superball Duplo T ball. The balls used in the previous editions all had laces on them, exactly like shoes do. Duplo T did not have laces. Instead, it had valves through which the ball could be inflated with a pump and a needle.

Switzerland 1954: Swiss World Champion

The Swiss World Champion was the first one to have a yellowish colour. Why? So that spectators from the nose-bleeds could spot the ball, which was difficult with the previous dark brown footballs. The Swiss World Champion was made from greased leather, 18 long pieces of leather, in fact, that were joined together by nylon threads and arranged in rows of three panels.

But the ball caused troubles for players when it rained. At this stage, leather balls were not waterproof. So the Swiss World Champion absorbed water and became heavy during the 1954 World Cup final.

Sweden 1958: Top Star

FIFA picked this ball by hosting a competition, where 102 unbranded footballs were submitted. The names of the balls were concealed from the judges. The Top Star (known as contestant no 55) was the eventual winner. Top Star balls were available in yellow, light brown and white.

If you saw photos from the final of the Sweden 1958 World Cup, you probably remember a young Pele galloping with a shiny white ball at his feet. The white ball in question was the Top Star, which had 24 leather strips that were coated with wax to keep out moisture. Just Fontaine banged in 13 goals in six matches for France with this ball at his command.

The Top Star was so popular with players of this generation that players demanded that it be used in the 1962 World Cup quarter-final as well between Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

Chile 1962: Mr Crack

With 18 strips of leather, Mr Crack was a ball with rounder panels than its predecessors. This gave it the appearance of being more spherical. While the ball retained its shape for longer by allowing air to escape more slowly, there ball was criticised for absorbing water.

England 1966: Challenge 4-Star

Another event where the official ball was picked after a contest. In this one, over 100 unbranded balls were submitted to the Football Association. FIFA website notes that a group of experts tested the circumference, roundness, weight, loss of pressure and rebound distance of each ball before announcing that the Challenge 4-Star, made by British firm Slazenger, was the winner.

Mexico 1970: Telstar

This was the first time that Adidas was appointed as the official ball supplier – a partnership which continues to this day. The Telstar consisted of 32 panels – 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons, a design that became synonymous with footballs.

The name of the ball had an interesting backstory: it was named after the communications satellite that was responsible for the first live international TV transmissions.

West Germany 1974: Telstar Durlast

In a change from preceding World Cups, matches at the 1974 World Cup saw branded balls that bore the name of the ball, manufacturer, and the words ‘Official World Cup 1974'.

The ball was resistant to water and mud. In fact, Adidas provided two options for the tournament: a whiteball that was ideal for floodlit matches, and an orange one that offered better visibility in snow.

Argentina 1978: Tango Durlast

The ball — which got its name from tango, the famous dance form with origins in 19th century Argentina — was actually made in France. The hand-stitched Tango incorporated the waterproof coating that its predecessors, the Durlast had.

Spain 1982: Tango España

Just like its predecessor from Argentina four years ago, the Tango Espana had a design with 20 black triads on hexagonal panels, with each triangle combining to form 12 circles. The football did not have the Durlast coating that had become common in footballs. Instead, the ball used polyurethane, with an extra layer for the seams, to make it waterproof.

Mexico 1986: Azteca

The ball was named in honor of Mexico's original inhabitants: the Aztecs, who lived in the region between the 14th and 16th centuries.

The ball had designs that mimicked Aztec murals and was made entirely from synthetic material (for the first time in World Cup history), ensuring that absorption of water was minimised.

Italy 1990: Etrusco Unico

The ball was named in honour of the Etruscan people, who lived in central and northern Italy from around 800 to 100 BC.

The ball sported a design with heads of three lions roaring which was a common design in Etruscan culture, found on many stone sculptures.

USA 1994: Questra

This football paid homage to USA's space exploration by having planets, rockets and stars printed on the ball. The ball had 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal panels.

France 1998: Tricolore

The first football to feature syntactic foam. This was also Adidas' first multi-coloured offering for the tournament.

Korea/Japan 2002: Fevernova

The balls had four trigonal designs on them, which were meant as a nod to wind turbines, in a celebration of alternative energy sources

The Fevernova name was a combination of the words ‘fever' and ‘supernova'. The hand-stitched balls boasted an improved layer of syntactic foam that provided extra cushioning for greater control and accuracy.

Germany 2006: Teamgeist

Teamgeist (team spirit) was said to be less than one percent short of being a perfect sphere. Rather than the tried and tested hexagonal and pentagonal panels favoured by balls used in the previous eight tournaments, Teamgeist had 14 panels designed to resemble propellers which were thermally bonded, rather than being stitched together.

The German football team's traditional colours of black and white were reflected on the ball.

The Germany-based Adidas pulled out all stops when it came to the design for the World Cup hosted by Germany. In the history of the World Cup, never before had balls carried the names of the two teams, the stadium, the city, the date and kick-off time on the ball for specific games. That was until the Teamgeist was introduced. For the final, Adidas even brought out a special gold version of the ball, called the Teamgeist Berlin.

South Africa 2010: Jabulani

Jabulani – which means to celebrate in Zulu language – had 11 colours on it. This not just represented the number of players on a football team, it also stood for the official South African languages, and the cities originally planned for the first World Cup in Africa.

It used eight thermally-bonded 3D panels. Once again, using the template set by the previous World Cup, Adidas brought out a special ball for the final with gold detailing (called the Jo'bulani since the final was in Johannesburg).

The Jabulani proved to be a bit controversial with goalkeepers such as Gianluigi Buffon of Italy and Julio Cesar of Brazil, unhappy at its unpredictable behaviour in the air.

Brazil 2014: Brazuca

The Brazuca was tested by over 600 professional footballers besides 30 teams of scientists running it through laboratory tests. The ball had six propeller-shaped panels. Over one million people voted for the name of the ball, with Brazuca emerging as the top choice – a term used by Brazilians to express pride in their way of life

Russia 2018: Telstar 18

The design of Telstar 18 paid tribute to Adidas' iconic first World Cup match ball from almost 50 years earlier. The ball had a embedded NFC (near-field communication) chip, which allowed fans to interact with the ball using their smartphones.

The ball was made of six textured panels which were glued together, rather than being stitched, which means it had no seams.

Qatar 2022: Al Rihla

Adidas marketted the Al Rihla ball as being faster in flight than any other in the tournament's history. Al Rihla means ‘the journey' in Arabic.

Adidas said that Al Rihla included ‘Connected Ball' technology, which proved invaluable in helping match officials make faster and more accurate decisions during the tournament, particularly in relation to tight offside decisions.

Tickets for the 2026 FIFA World Cup officially hit secondary markets with prices rising as high as over $38,000 for the final.

On Wednesday, FIFA opened the first window for ticket purchases through the Visa presale, with a select number of fans, out of over 4.5 million who applied, getting a first chance to buy tickets. 

From the primary market, ticket prices were already shocking for many fans worldwide. For any of the opening matches in each host country, the cheapest tickets were the Canadian opener in Toronto, between $355 and $1,745. Meanwhile, the USMNT opener in Los Angeles saw tickets between $560 and $2,735, and Mexico's in Mexico City ranged from $370 to $1,825.

The final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., however, clocked in between $2,030 and $6,370. 

Yet, as much as those initial prices shocked soccer fans worldwide, the secondary markets have seen prices astronomically skyrocket into small fortunes, especially for the final.

FIFA operates an official secondary market in the United States and Canada, charging both sellers and buyers a 15% fee, which in turn pushes prices even higher. In Mexico, though, the secondary market is regulated, and FIFA agreed to limit prices to face value on a ticket exchange platform. 

According to The Athletic, the percentage is similar to that of StubHub, SeatGeek, GameTime and other third-party resellers. 

However, fans have also flocked to those sites, hoping to grab tickets, only to be shocked by the listed resale prices as well. At the same time, tickets from resale sites carry a risk of scamming and issues related to the initial purchase through FIFA's Fan ID program. 

As of Friday evening, no World Cup final tickets were available on FIFA's official resale platform, but on StubHub, prices ranged from the cheapest ticket in the high corner of the stadium for $5,937 to the most expensive at midfield in the lower bowl at $38,665.

Meanwhile, only one official resale ticket was available for Canada's opening match for $716, while four tickets were available for the USMNT opener, ranging from $560 to $2,740. 

Unlike past World Cups, local fans were not given special access or pricing for tickets, and no official supporters' groups have been given ample access either. 

Each host nation's federation also received 8% of the tickets to their games, and has various avenues for distributing tickets among family, officials, alumni and other desired recipients. However, that amount has had little impact on the larger market. 

“Obviously, FIFA operates and runs a World Cup and sets policies, but I think the market is also important for people to consider,” Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue told Sports Illustrated, having launched the CanadaRed program to distribute some of the federation's 8% to supporters.

“The market for high-end sports and entertainment has accelerated dramatically in the last little while ... We would want everybody who wants to experience the World Cup to be able to experience it, and we don't like the fact that if people are priced out, it results in a negative experience. We don't want that.”

While the prices in the initial sales and resales have skyrocketed, they could vary following the World Cup draw Dec. 6, when fans will have an idea of which teams are playing where.

Amanda Anisimova delivered a clinical performance Saturday in Beijing, defeating defending China Open champion Coco Gauff in less than an hour and dropping just three games in their all-American semifinal matchup.

In a high-profile showdown between two of the sport's brightest young talents, Amanda Anisimova made quick work of defending champion Coco Gauff on Saturday in Beijing.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The No. 3 seed needed only 58 minutes to dispatch the No. 2 seed Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-2 in an all-American semifinal, advancing to her first China Open final and second WTA 1000 final of the season.

On Sunday (7 a.m. ET), she'll face Linda Noskova in what will be her fifth final overall of 2025.

After the match, Anisimova said she's feeling strong and ready to build on her momentum.

“I was just excited to play here in my first semifinal,” Anisimova said. “I was able to put on a really good performance, and I knew I was going to have to play very well against Coco if I wanted to get the win, and yeah, I'm really excited to be in the final.”

The matchup didn't unfold as expected, with Gauff struggling early and unable to find her rhythm throughout.

Anisimova, meanwhile, was locked in from the first serve.

Anisimova, 24, won the first five games before Gauff finally got on the board late in the opening set to avoid a shutout. Anisimova closed out the set in 27 minutes, winning more than twice as many points as her opponent.

The second set followed a similar pattern. Anisimova again jumped out to a 5-0 lead before Gauff showed a brief flash of the form that carried her to the semifinals, breaking serve and following it with a hold to once again avoid a bagel.

But the rally was short-lived, as Anisimova closed out the match just shy of the one-hour mark, delivering the knockout blow to Gauff's title defense in Beijing.

With the win, Anisimova improved to 2-1 in her career head-to-head record against Gauff and became only the third American to reach the China Open women's singles final, joining Serena Williams (2004, 2013) and Gauff (2024).

She also became the only player to defeat Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Gauff this season.

Looking ahead to Sunday's final, Anisimova holds a 1-1 record against Noskova.

“I love playing here,” Anisimova said. “The crowd support has been so amazing since the first day that I got here, and I really think that's carried me through this entire tournament. So hopefully everyone can come out and support me again in the final.”

Linda Noskova is through to the WTA China Open final after saving match points against Jessica Pegula. She will meet Amanda Anisimova awaits in the final, with their head-to-head record tied at 1-1.

Czech Linda Noskova advanced to the biggest final of her career Saturday, saving three match points to defeat fifth seed Jessica Pegula and reach the WTA China Open final.

Noskova will face another American, Amanda Anisimova, for the title. Earlier, Anisimova cruised past second seed Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-2 in the first semifinal in Beijing.

Pegula fights back, but Noskova holds firm

Noskova grabbed the only break of the first set in the sixth game and served it out for a 6-3 lead. Pegula responded strongly, dominating the second set 6-1 to force a decider.

Both players traded early breaks in the third set before Pegula earned another in the 11th game and served for the match. The American held three match points, but Noskova saved them all, breaking back to send the semifinal into a decisive tiebreak.

Noskova held her nerve in the tiebreak, converting her second match point to seal a 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (6) victory in two hours and 28 minutes.

Youngest Czech in a WTA 1000 final since 1990

With the win, Noskova improved her head-to-head record against Pegula to 2-1 and became the youngest Czech player -- at 20 years and 311 days -- to reach a Tier I or WTA 1000 final since 1990. It also marked her second Top 10 win of the week and the fifth of the season.

The title match between Noskova and Anisimova will be only the second WTA 1000 final between two players born after 2000, following this year's Dubai final between Mirra Andreeva and Clara Tauson.

Noskova and Anisimova are tied 1-1 in their career meetings, with Anisimova winning their most recent clash in the fourth round of this year's Wimbledon Championships in three close sets.

Linda Noskova is through to the WTA China Open final after saving match points against Jessica Pegula. She will meet Amanda Anisimova awaits in the final, with their head-to-head record tied at 1-1.

 Alex de Minaur is treading new ground in 2025. 

 The No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Saturday eased past Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-4, 6-2 to kick-start his Rolex Shanghai Masters campaign. With his 88-minute victory against Argentine Carabelli, De Minaur registered a personal-best 48th tour-level win in a single season, making him the first Australian man to hit that tally since former World No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt in 2004. 

Best. Season. Ever 🙌@alexdeminaur notches up his 48th victory of the season, defeating Ugo Carabelli 6-4 6-2 to advance to round three.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/U324TSmVsB

 “I'm happy with myself. It's a great achievement to show the consistency,” said De Minaur after victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Carabelli. “I feel like I probably could have broken that record last year if I hadn't gotten injured. To come back this year and just show that consistency week-in and week-out, I'm very proud of my efforts. 

 “Saying that, there's still a lot of tennis to be played, so hopefully I can keep adding wins to that tally. Keep doing what I'm doing, keep my head down, keep working hard, keep showing up, and just keep the confidence and momentum going.” 

 De Minaur, who did not face a break point against Carabelli according to Infosys ATP Stats, now owns a Tour-leading 35 wins on hard courts in 2025, ahead of Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz (both on 34). The Australian's next challenge in Shanghai will be a fourth-round meeting with Kamil Majchrzak, who defeated 29th seed Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 6-0 to advance. 

 Another Top 10 star, Alexander Zverev, also notched a straight-sets victory in his Shanghai opener, although the German had to pull through a late injury scare before sinking Valentin Royer 6-4, 6-4. 

 Zverev appeared to injure his right toe when serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set, and he was treated by the ATP physio after the first point of the game. The injury did not stop the World No. 3 from comfortably serving out for his win, but he later acknowledged to feeling uncertainty regarding how serious a problem it could be. 

 “I'm very happy [to get through],” said Zverev. “I don't know, I landed funny on my toe and after that I could barely do a step, so we'll see what it is. Not happy to end the match like that, of course, but I think definitely happy with the level in the first round of a Masters. That was quite good. He is playing very well and moving forward, we will see if I will ever be healthy this year again, because it's been a struggle. But I'm happy to be through.” 

 Watch Zverev Survive Injury Scare In Shanghai Opener: 

 In other early Saturday action, Felix Auger-Aliassime snapped the momentum of qualifier Alejandro Tabilo in commanding fashion with a 6-3, 6-3 triumph. The Canadian, playing his first match since the US Open and also his first since he got married on 20 September, saved all seven break points he faced to sink Chengdu champion Tabilo and set a meeting with Jesper de Jong, who upset 17th seed Jakub Mensik 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-4. 

 With their second-round wins, Zverev, De Minaur and Auger-Aliassime have boosted their Nitto ATP Finals qualification hopes. Zverev is third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and in strong contention to seal his spot at the prestigious season finale, while De Minaur is seventh, just 325 points behind Ben Shelton. 

 Auger-Aliassime remains in 10th place but is just 630 points behind Lorenzo Musetti, who defeated Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-0 on Saturday and currently occupies the final qualification spot. Zverev is aiming to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the eighth time, both De Minaur and Auger-Aliassime are chasing a second appearance, while Musetti seeks his debut appearance.

Daniel Altmaier has built a reputation as a big-game player, and he has the arsenal to prove it.

On Saturday, he will once again test his flair for the upset when he takes on defending Rolex Shanghai Masters champion Jannik Sinner.

Altmaier toppled the Italian in their most recent meeting at Roland Garros in 2023, and one year before that, he pushed him to five sets at the US Open. For the 27-year-old German, these aren't anomalies, they're the blueprint of his game.

“I see myself that I can play tennis well against everyone on Tour. So that's why I feel like I'm dangerous against those [top] guys,” Altmaier, the No. 49 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, told ATPTour.com in Shanghai. “I find my tactic, the way to play, the way to hurt people on the top level. So that's where I'm also aiming to play constantly. I think that's the thing: I can adapt my game, I can see the weaknesses and other opponents. That's also what you play for.”

Altmaier's numbers in 2025 back his conviction: He took down Taylor Fritz in the first round of Roland Garros — his fifth Top 10 victory — and produced a stirring five-set triumph over former World No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas at the US Open.

Two big stages, two scalps of heavyweights. Now, facing Sinner in the Italian's opening match as defending champion in Shanghai, Altmaier arrives with the scent of another upset in the air.

“I really love these challenges, that's what I play for,” said Altmaier, who is 1-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner. “I played some brilliant matches this year already. Taylor Fritz, last week [Denis] Shapovalov… I put them all there [at the top] when they have a great day. They are really elite, they are the best players. I think that's what I really look forward to and I think it's going to be an exciting match.”

Much of Altmaier's danger lies in his one-handed backhand, a shot that has both sting and subtlety. Against Sinner, he will need every ounce of that unpredictability to keep the World No. 2 unsettled. His deadly down-the-line backhand will make it risky for Sinner to give up too much court in the quest for inside-out forehands.

“I think he has the ability to also adjust his game,” Altmaier said of Sinner. “And well that's one of the elements of my game… I have several different ones. I'm working a lot on the variety on the backhand side.

“I have the slice, I have the backhand that I can play flat, the one I can play a little bit more with topspin, I can switch direction. I think that one-handers do actually have a little bit more variety than two-handed backhands.”



After overcoming qualifier Tristan Schoolkate in his Shanghai opener, Altmaier improved his 2025 record to 17-23 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. It's a steady rebound just four weeks after he was nursing a leg injury that forced him to retire from his third-round clash with Alex de Minaur in New York.

“Tokyo was my first tournament back after my little injury after the US Open, so I'm happy to have a two-set victory here playing some very good tennis,” Altmaier said. “I'm happy about the consistency I was getting recently. There were a lot of challenges throughout the season. The season is long and I'm getting to learn a lot from this year which is a crucial part in my career.”

Playing each other for the first time, things were neck-and-neck early on in both sets before Auger-Aliassime caught fire just at the right times—he won four games in a row from 2-3 to pocket the first set, then three games in a row from 3-all to take the second set and the match.At the end of the day the Canadian was just too solid on the stats sheet, finishing with 29 winners to 26 unforced errors. The Chilean, meanwhile, had 11 winners to 18 unforced errors in the match.And break points were key, too, with Auger-Aliassime converting three of his five opportunities, while Tabilo went zero-for-seven.Auger-Aliassime is now 9-2 in his last three events, having reached the quarterfinals of Cincinnati and the semifinals of the US Open in his last two events of the summer. He was stopped by Sinner both times.Awaiting the No. 12-seeded Canadian in the third round will be Jesper de Jong, who upset No. 17-seeded Jakub Mensik, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4.

2025 Singapore GP Qualifying: Verstappen hits traffic on his final Q3 run

McLaren could not match the pace of Mercedes' George Russell in Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with Oscar Piastri taking third while Lando Norris ended the session in fifth.

Oscar Piastri admitted that he was surprised to see the Mercedes of George Russell outpace McLaren to take pole position in Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with the Australian having to settle for third while team mate Lando Norris was fifth on a day where he said the squad “weren't quick enough”.

In a busy end to the session at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Russell claimed provisional pole before going even faster to seal the position on the final runs, his lap of 1m 29.158s putting him 0.182s clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Piastri, meanwhile, was nearly four-tenths off Russell's time in third. When asked after Qualifying if he felt that the result was the most he could have gotten out of the session, the 24-year-old responded: “More or less. I think there was a little bit left in it but not enough for pole.

“Ultimately I thought it was a pretty good session. It's just been a pretty good weekend – very solid, no major hiccups or anything like that. I think ultimately we just didn't quite have the pace, so we'll try and see what we can do tomorrow.”

Pushed on whether it had been a surprise to see a Mercedes ahead in pole position – with Verstappen also in front – Piastri added: “It was a surprise, yeah. I think the start of Qualifying we seemed pretty good, and then everyone else just seemed to find a lot of time and we didn't really.

“That was a bit of a surprise , but it's been a little bit weird this weekend. The tyres have been pretty tricky to switch on.

“I think a few things changed from yesterday to today with the track and everyone's just been pretty close, and anyone that nails it has been towards the front. So just one of those kinds of weekends, but third's still not a bad result.”

On the other side of the garage, Norris conceded that he had felt more comfortable at the wheel of the MCL39 than during Friday's running, but acknowledged that the squad were ultimately lacking pace in comparison to their competitors.

“I felt happier with the car today,” the Briton explained following his P5 result. “[It's] just we weren't quick enough, clearly. The Mercedes are much, much faster, and I'm sure between Oscar's and my lap is a tenth in it or something, or maybe a little bit more, but not the four that that we need or the three and a half that we need.

“It is what it is, but still I just didn't put it all together and you need to do that on a track like today, but I just didn't.”

In terms of whether having a better feeling in the car gives him an additional sense of confidence for Sunday's race, Norris answered: “Not really. This track's kind of where you qualify is more than likely where you're going to finish, but there are still chances so we'll have to wait and see.”

2025 Singapore GP Qualifying: Verstappen hits traffic on his final Q3 run

Max Verstappen put his Red Bull at the top of the timesheets during third and final practice ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen has set the pace during the third and final practice session ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver leading the way from McLaren's Oscar Piastri and the Mercedes of George Russell.

With the name at the top of the timesheets changing during the hour, it was Verstappen who ultimately went fastest of all on a 1m 30.148s, putting him 0.017s clear of Piastri.

After a disrupted FP2 on Friday evening – featuring two red flags and various moments for a number of drivers – Saturday's final practice hour offered a last opportunity for the drivers and teams to make final preparations ahead of Qualifying later in the day.

It was a relatively quiet start as the session began at 1730 local time in temperatures higher than during the previous day, with the Haas pair leading the early runners out – the majority sporting the medium tyres for their initial laps.

As the track started to get busier and most drivers had put a time on the board – with just Verstappen and Russell yet to venture out by the 15-minute mark – Lando Norris went fastest on a 1m 31.021s, prompting his engineer to respond: “Welcome back”

Moments later, a red flag was thrown when Liam Lawson hit the wall approaching Turn 8 after riding over the kerbs, the damaged Racing Bulls car again coming to a halt on the track as it had done during an earlier incident for Lawson in Friday's FP2.

Practice 3 results

FORMULA 1 SINGAPORE AIRLINES SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX 2025

Following a stoppage while the VCARB 02 was recovered and any debris on the circuit cleared, the action resumed with just over 35 minutes left on the clock. The Mercedes pair of Russell and Kimi Antonelli returned to the track with the soft tyres bolted on, having switched focus to their Qualifying simulations.

A yellow flag was thrown after Carlos Sainz ran down the escape road at Turn 14 before reversing back onto the circuit, just as Williams team mate Alex Albon – running the soft C5 rubber – slotted into second place on the timesheets. At just over the halfway point, Norris remained on top by 0.152s from the Thai driver, while Sainz had claimed P3.

While Antonelli then went quickest on a 1m 30.760s, it was confirmed that Lewis Hamilton – the driver he replaced at Mercedes – had been noted for a red flag infringement, an incident that it was later confirmed would be investigated after the session. Meanwhile another yellow flag appeared after Albon mirrored his team mate's earlier moment by briefly making a trip down the escape road, this time at Turn 16.

There was frustration for FP1 pacesetter Fernando Alonso, the Aston Martin man being asked to limp his car home with just over 15 minutes remaining in the session. Elsewhere, more drivers were switching to the soft tyres for their flying laps.

Charles Leclerc initially shot to the top after his opening effort on the soft compound before being pushed down by Norris – who was then displaced by Verstappen, the Dutchman going quickest on a 1m 30.148s. Russell slotted in-between them in second place, though admitted that he was “struggling for confidence” in the corner where he suffered a crash during Friday's FP2.

Amid a few moments of traffic in a busy final minutes – with one seeing Verstappen with little room to manoeuvre alongside Alpine's Franco Colapinto as they tried to leave room for Pierre Gasly – Verstappen held on to P1 with a margin of 0.017s from Piastri, the McLaren driver slotting in a fast lap in the closing moments.

Russell had to settle for third ahead of Antonelli in a decent showing for Mercedes, followed by Norris, Sainz and the Racing Bulls machine of Isack Hadjar. Hamilton – who faces a stewards' investigation over that red flag infringement – was eighth, while Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and the other Ferrari of Leclerc rounded out the top 10.

Albon claimed P11 from the Kick Sauber of Gabriel Bortoleto (P12), the Haas duo of Esteban Ocon (P13) and Ollie Bearman (P14), and Alonso (P15).

Colapinto was 16th while Lance Stroll took 17th for Aston Martin. Yuki Tsunoda put his Red Bull into 18th place, with Gasly just behind in 19th and Lawson bringing up the rear in 20th.

Focus will now switch to the all-important Qualifying, which is set to get underway at 2100 local time.

2025 Singapore GP Qualifying: Verstappen hits traffic on his final Q3 run

Oscar Piastri set the pace during a disrupted second practice hour on Friday in Singapore, but can McLaren lead the way throughout the weekend or is one of their rivals looking likely to pose a challenge?

It wasn't the smoothest of days for Formula 1's 10 teams in Singapore as a disrupted second practice – which is the only practice session to take place at night and thus the only representative running drivers will get before Qualifying – meant very few long runs were completed, while multiple drivers had to abort their soft-tyre runs because of stoppages or yellow flags. That makes it's very tricky to work out a pecking order - but there are a few trends that emerged....

Championship leader Oscar Piastri wasted no time putting his frustrating weekend in Baku behind him (he suffered his first DNF of the year with crashes in both Qualifying and the race) to go top of the pile – and it looks like his McLaren is the one to beat as they search for 13 points this weekend to wrap up the Teams' Championship.

ONBOARD: George Russell's 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore GP Qualifying: Verstappen hits traffic on his final Q3 run

Williams received some bad news after Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix, with both Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz being disqualified.

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz have both been disqualified from Qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix due to technical breaches on their Williams cars.

Albon and Sainz placed 12th and 13th in Saturday night's session at the Marina Bay Street Circuit but will lose those results after the team failed post-Qualifying checks.

“The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked on car numbers 23 (Albon) and 55 (Sainz),” read a note from FIA F1 Technical Delegate Jo Bauer. “Both cars exceeded the maximum limit of 85mm on both sides of the rear wing outer area.”

This violates Article 3.10.10 g. of the Technical Regulations, which covers the Drag Reduction System (DRS) and states that “at all points along the span, when the DRS is in the state of deployment, the two sections the rear wing profiles must have a minimum gap of between 9.4mm and 85mm”.

As is standard procedure with such a scenario, the stewards later confirmed that Albon and Sainz had been disqualified from Qualifying.

“During post-Qualifying scrutineering, the rear wing of the car was found to be non-compliant with the Technical Regulations,” read the stewards' notes for Albon and Sainz's disqualifications.

“The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked. The DRS in the state of deployment exceeded the maximum limit of 85mm on both sides of the rear wing outer area.

“At the hearing, the competitor admitted that, although their own measurement prior to the Qualifying had shown the component to be within tolerance, the measurement subsequently conducted by the appointed FIA officials revealed a larger gap than permitted and therefore the rear wing did not conform with the required dimension.

“The competitor did not contest the measurement procedure, the methodology, or the accuracy of the measuring equipment used by FIA. The competitor fully accepted the results of the FIA measurement and acknowledged that the rear wing fitted to the car did not comply with the requirements of the Technical Regulations.

“Accordingly, the standard penalty applicable to technical infringements is imposed.”

Following the confirmation of the disqualification, Williams Team Principal James Vowles issued a statement saying: "During FIA scrutineering after Qualifying, the rear wings on both our cars failed DRS slot gap checks. As a result, Alex and Carlos have been disqualified from Qualifying for tomorrow's Singapore Grand Prix.

"This is bitterly disappointing for the team and we are urgently investigating how this happened. At no point were we seeking a performance advantage and the rear wings had passed our own checks earlier in the day, but there is only one measurement that matters and we fully accept the FIA ruling.

"We have a car capable of scoring points here this weekend and will do everything we can to fight from the back of the grid tomorrow, and will immediately review our processes to make sure this doesn't happen again."

The Williams double disqualification comes after Esteban Ocon was also disqualified from Qualifying at the previous round in Azerbaijan, with the rear wing on his Haas failing post-session checks.

Director Paul Greengrass thrives on recreating real-life crisis, whether it's putting audiences aboard a commercial airplane hijacked on 9/11 (“United 93”) or a container-ship overrun by Somali pirates (“Captain Phillips”). However, his journey to discover how to recreate the 2018 Camp Fire that engulfed Paradise, California for “The Lost Bus” was filled with detours.

“The truth is I went in one direction when I was prepping the movie, and then radically went the opposite way,” said Greengrass said on the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast.

“I'd [wanted] to make a movie about a wildfire that is the best that it can be done, up to now, with the technology available,” he said. “And the reason for that is the world is burning, the fires are getting worse and more [frequent], so I wanted to find a way of conveying the intensity off what those things feel like and how it might feel to be in one.”

He though he'd found the answer when he attended U2's immersive concert at The Sphere in Las Vegas, which utilized the unique venue's 160,000-square-foot, wraparound LED display to transport the audience to the desert.

 










“It's absolutely extraordinary how realistic it is. Technology has got to the point now where you truly believe you are there. It's eerie and uncanny, even though you know you are sitting in a seat in a theater, you feel like you are in the desert,” said Greengrass. “So I was very taken with that and thought, ‘Ok, what we'll have to do is have a Sphere-type experience around the bus.”

This meant embracing the LED virtual stages pioneered by Star Wars series “The Mandolorian.” Greengrass and his team got to work, spending pre-production dollars on feasibility studies and tests. But for the director who cut his teeth making documentaries, he could never make the tech work for him.

“I came not to believe in it because, fundamentally, my soul as a filmmaker wasn't really in not being in a real world,” said Greengrass of shooting on virtual stages. “So we then went in entirely the opposite direction.”

“The Lost Bus” locations team found an abandoned campus in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The enormous area supplied the production with different terrains, multiple winding tree-lined roads, and free rein to shoot with moving vehicles and to light its own controlled fires.

“It enabled us to have a bedrock of reality,” said Greengrass. “We could lay gas lines so we could have controlled flames that were safe. We weren't burning stuff that [sent] particles into the atmosphere that could create a forest fire, and we could control all the dangers.”

 










The production lit fires in the foreground and around the bus that could be augmented by visual effects,. Greengrass argued these were every bit as real as the flames on set.

“People talk about CGI as in computer-generated images, but the truth is nowadays some of them are not,” said Greengrass. “In this case, we went and shot a thousand pieces of fire for different fires operating in different ways, different smoke operating in different ways.”

Visual effects supervisor Charlie Noble's team created their own controlled burns to film in an effort to capture the wild and wide range of fire's unpredictable behavior. The Paradise inferno's movement, color, power could change in a split second.

“It was real image married to real image via a computer to create a seamless whole,” said Greengrass. “It was the most painstaking piece of work I've seen. We'd try some pieces, then say, ‘That's not right,' and [Noble would] have to go and shoot other bits.”

Perhaps the most painstaking adjustment Greengrass felt compelled to make came in form of light. Specifically, what happens when a fire produces so much smoke it blocks the daylight.

“You're blocking out the sun, but you got the flames,” said Greengrass. “ It's a very strange light. It's both dark and light all at the same time. You can see, and yet there's no light.”

 










Greengrass said the only direct comparison is the infrequent, fleeting moments of a solar eclipse, but the closest analog is the 45-minute window before sunset — aka, “magic hour.”

“That led me to think that the only way that we could successfully make this movie [excluding the beginning and end of taking place in the non-smoke-filled daylight] was that it had to be shot at magic hour,” he said. “That's only 45 minutes at the end of the day, but that's what we did: We actually shot the bulk of this movie in a tiny  portion of time.”

This meant a very different way of approaching the shoot day. The cast and crew would arrive late morning and spend six to seven hours rehearsing all the vehicle movements, stunts, gas burns, and actor staging (including the child actors on the school bus with Matthew McConaughey and American Ferrera). Then, rather than split the action into different camera setups or shots, Greengrass would aim to get two or three longer takes of that day's action, which later could be cut together with additional, tighter coverage of the cast shot on a sound stage.

“That gave the film its dramatic emotional intensity in terms of performance because it was a sort of once and only once kind of experience, in the light, rather than, 'Shot four, now we go on to shot seven,' and the orthodox way you might do it, so those are the elements,” Greengrass said.

	Following her massive $2.2 billion Eras Tour and its global implications, Taylor Swift is hanging up her rhinestone feathered headpiece for a while.


	The 14x Grammy winner recently admitted that although Eras “exceeded any of our expectations,” she has no desire to take her 12th studio album The Life of a Showgirl on the road after its release on Friday.


	“I'm gonna be really honest with you,” said Swift on BBC Radio 1. “Like, I am so tired when I think about doing it again because I would want to do it really, really well again.”

	Running March 2023 to December 2024, the Eras Tour encompassed Swift's entire repertoire, spanning 149 shows across 51 cities to become the highest-grossing tour of all time. 

	











	“I had so much fun on that tour. Obviously, it was the most exhausting challenge ever, physically,” said Swift, noting she'll “never forget the experience.”


	“I'm so good right now. My joints are good,” noted Swift of her life off the road, adding: “I could only do the Eras Tour when I was on the Eras Tour and that's two years of having no other hobbies. And now I have the hobbies again.”


	In August, Swift announced The Life of a Showgirl as her next album. Deadline later exclusively reported that AMC had secured an Oct. 3-5 release for the album's accompanying film of the same name.


	Last month, Deadline exclusively reported that Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl quickly earned $15 million in its first day of pre-sales, forecasting a $29M-$31M opening weekend at 3,700 theaters.


	Maybe a Vegas residency is more befitting Swift's showgirl era?

	Taylor Swift loves her mad women and outlaw ladies, her queens with big reputations. She also loves her Old Hollywood movie stars, from Clara Bow to Barbara Stanwyck to Bette Davis. So it would be bizarre if she didn't have an Elizabeth Taylor obsession. La Liz was an opulent mess her whole life. She was the most famous woman of the 20th century, as Taylor is now — the ultimate showgirl. Everything she did was on an epic scale — her movies, her clothes, her diamonds, her violet eyes, her marriages, her scandals.


	But “Elizabeth Taylor” is so much more than just the peak of her long-running Liz fascination. It's a statement of purpose, the heart-on-fire synth-pop swoon at the core of her dazzling new album The Life of a Showgirl. She and Max Martin and Shellback go 12 for 12 — they basically made a 41-minute New Romantics: The Album. But “Elizabeth Taylor” feels like the emotional centerpiece, the key to the whole record. The showgirl yearns for true love — yet on her own fiercely independent terms. Swift has always identified with Liz, but this is where she claims the story as her own. She's immortal now, baby dolls. 

	











	Obviously, there's no winning streak like Taylor's anywhere in music history — nearly 20 years in, she keeps hitting new peaks in her cultural impact and creative ferocity. (And oh yeah, commercial success.) Song for song, Showgirl is her best since the Folklore/Evermore double-shot of five years ago — that might look like an unbeatable zenith, but then so did Red before Folklore happened. So many contenders for the album's funniest line, yet “Elizabeth Taylor” has the winner: “We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank's / They call me bad news, I just say thanks.” (A close second: “I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness.”)

	











	The song digs into one of her favorite Hollywood legends: Liz's stormy romance with the Welsh actor Richard Burton, when they reigned as the world's most scandalous couple. I'm a hardcore Liz fanatic so I had high hopes for this song, yet Taylor exceeded them. (Sadly, “Wood” did not turn out to be about Natalie.) Liz spent her whole existence in the spotlight, with “lights, camera, bitch smile” as the only life she knew. She tied the knot eight times, including Burton, whom she wed and divorced twice. The whole world knew them as “Liz and Dick.” They were decades too early for a nickname like “Elizadick” or “Turton,” though they called themselves “Le Scandale.” The couple made eleven movies together, and battled through each one.

	But the Liz/Swift soul connection goes deep, way beyond their shared name. Both Taylors got famous as kids, grew up in public as America's sweetheart. As in the title of Liz's finest early movie, namechecked in the song, both were “The Girl Who Had Everything.” But like Swift, Liz was the ingenue who made everything sticky by growing up. They turned into controversial women, denounced and slut-shamed as their lives became gossip fodder. “The rumors are terrible and cruel, but honey, most of them are true” — that's a line that could have come from Liz's lips in Butterfield 8.


	Liz and Dick fell in love on the set of Cleopatra, the ridiculously expensive and lavish epic love story of the ancient Egyptian queen and the Roman general Mark Antony. Both stars were married to other people, but who cared? They got hitched in 1963, divorced in 1974, married again in 1975, divorced again in 1976. When they went public, it was an international scandal. Republicans in Congress called for the Attorney General to revoke her passport and cancel his visa. The Vatican newspaper accused them of “erotic vagrancy,” which would make a great Swift song title (and someday probably will). 


	Swift's always had a fascination with this power couple. In “…Ready for It?” she sang, “He can be my jailor, Burton to my Taylor,” then added, “I'm so very tame now, never be the same now.” If the word “tame” seems odd there, one of the first movies the pair made together was The Taming of the Shrew, by Tay's main man William Shakespeare. On her 2018 Reputation Tour, her backstage Rep Room was decorated with a Liz-and-Dick theme, with vintage posters for their movies like Cleopatra and The V.I.Ps.

	She also went Liz for her 2014 “Wildest Dreams” video, where she plays a brunette actress filming on location in Africa, falling in love with her co-star. As director Joseph Kahn said, “The video is based on classic Hollywood romances like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.” The video was set in 1950 — the year of Liz's first wedding. Her leading man: Scott Eastwood, whose dad co-starred with Burton in Where Eagles Dare. Never accuse Taylor of not obsessing over the details. 


	She once posted a photo of her cat sitting on a copy of the book Furious Love: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and the Marriage of the Century, by Sam Kushner and Nancy Schoenberger. Her caption: “Olivia loves to read historical Hollywood biographies.” In 2018, she discussed this bio in her interview with the rock & roll muse Pattie Boyd (who married both George Harrison and Eric Clapton). “I read a book about Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor recently, and how there was this crazy frenzy surrounding them,” Taylor said. “In the book, Elizabeth is quoted as saying, ‘It could be worse—we could be the Beatles.'” 


	But she goes all the way in “Elizabeth Taylor,” turning her life into folklore. In the opening moments, she sings, “That view of Portofino was on my mind/When you called me at the Plaza Athénée.” That's the island where Liz and Dick got engaged — and the New York hotel where she had a duplex penthouse. Some of the song's references are obvious, as in the chorus where she sings, “I'd cry my eyes violet.” But she also goes for deep cuts, shouting out White Diamonds, the name of Liz's Nineties fragrance, and her finest early movie, the pretty damn obscure 1953 melodrama The Girl Who Had Everything. (Did I mention Taylor obsesses over the details?) 


	“Often times it doesn't feel so glamorous being me,” she laments. She might be the talk of Hollywood, but that's a place where you're only as hot as your last hit, baby, and she knows people are rooting for her to take a fall. “All my white diamonds and lovers are forever,” she sings—but in the title song, at the the album's end, it's “sequins are forever.”


	Elizabeth was a child when she became a sensation riding her horse in National Velvet. In her teens, she stared at the older actresses eating lunch in the studio commissary, the glam divas like Ava Gardner and Lana Turner, and wanted to be just like them. She used to have herself paged, just so she could walk across the lunch room and try to turn heads. It usually worked. Even at 19, she was seen as a femme fatale. “I know I have been spoiled,” she said. “But I think people have been unfairly severe.” She never got a chance to mature in private. “I've been able to wear a plunging neckline since I was 14 years old,” she said. “My troubles all started because I have a woman's body and a child's emotions.”

	











	Liz always had the most bitter exes in the game. Her first husband, whom she married at 18 and left at 19, told the press, “Every man should have the opportunity of sleeping with Elizabeth Taylor, and at the rate she's going every man will.” But the most bitter had to be crooner Eddie Fisher, her fourth husband, who suffered the public humiliation of leaving his wife Debbie Reynolds for her (as well as their daughter Carrie), then getting dumped for Burton. He did a revenge-theater show with a song called “Cleo, the Nympho of the Nile,” with lyrics such as “Just like Elvis/She used her pelvis.” (This story, like so many great Liz tales, comes from Kitty Kelley's classic Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star, one of the juiciest Hollywood dishfests ever.) 


	Before Cleopatra, Liz and Dick despised each other. When they first met, he was starring in a London production of Hamlet, and naturally having an affair with the actress playing Ophelia, Claire Bloom. (Just as Taylor plays Ophelia on the album cover.) But he and Liz fell in hate at first sight. He called her “MGM's Little Miss Mammary.” She called him “the Frank Sinatra of Shakespeare.” When he got cast as Mark Antony, he complained, “Well, I guess I've got to don my breastplate once more to play opposite Miss Tits.” But a week into filming, they were inseparable, sneaking off to his trailer between scenes.


	Burton wasn't her most likeable husband (that would be Michael Wilding) or her most attractive (Mike Todd), or even the hammiest actor (Fisher), but they were addicted to each other. Both were jet-set alcoholics; by the end, he drank three bottles of vodka a day. When he died in 1984, his widow banned Liz from the funeral. Everyone had opinions about these two. Even Bob Dylan, on his 1963 classic The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan — the folk poet spends the album pondering big themes like war, justice, and death, but his final punch line is “Make love to Elizabeth Taylor / Catch hell from Richard Burton.” 


	Cleopatra was Liz's favorite role — she identified with the passionate queen. “To me,” she said, “Cleopatra was more like a tigress than a sex kitten, even at 19, when she first met Caesar and had been queen for only two years.” Taylor can relate to that — in the Speak Now vault track “When Emma Falls in Love,” she sings about a girl who's “like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town.” (And like Taylor, Cleo had some issues with snakes.) Liz won her first Oscar for Best Actress as the vamp in Butterfield 8, purring lines like “Flesh and blood can only stand so much voluptuous torture.” But in their movies together, she and Burton loved to play couples at war with each other, throwing their real-life conflicts into Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? That film might be a Tay fave, considering “Who's Afraid of Little Old Me,” where she sings about growing up in the fame machine as Liz did, sneering, “You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me.” 

	











	But Elizabeth Taylor specialized in a very Swiftian kind of role: the woman who lives with a horrible secret she can never tell, because nobody would believe her. If she trusted anyone enough to confide in them, they'd call her insane. (“This you won't believe!” she screams in Suddenly Last Summer. “Nobody, nobody could believe it!” When she tells her secret, she gets locked in an asylum.) Liz played this woman so many times — and so has Taylor, in songs from “Cassandra” to “Mad Woman” to the new album's “Cancelled!” But she has so many of these characters in plain sight — like in “Blank Space,” where she's got a long list of ex-lovers who'll tell you she's insaaaane. As she once asked, “When everyone believes you, what's that like?”


	When Liz died in 2011, at 79, it was the end of an era. “The last of the Hollywood greats,” in the words of George Michael  — another legend who gets a Showgirl showcase, in “Father Figure.” (It's George's song title, but it also sounds like his career story.) She married a “Father Figure” once—the distinguished British actor Michael Wilding, twice her age. She turned 20 on their honeymoon. By all accounts, this was one of her friendliest marriages, producing two sons and no hard feelings. Their son Christopher, now 70, has thanked Swift for writing a song about his mom. Her third husband was a Broadway producer killed in a plane crash; her seventh was the Senator from Virginia; her eighth was a construction worker she met in rehab. This woman took big swings.

	But Liz was protective of her image, long past the point where it was out of her hands. She sued to stop a biopic in 1982, saying, “I am my own commodity. I am my own industry.” These words were much-mocked, like everything she said or did in those days. (The movie finally happened in the Nineties, starring Twin Peaks siren Sherilyn Fenn. A few years ago, it was Lindsay Lohan.) Yet Taylor Swift is one of the few people who knows exactly what Liz was talking about. She said something similar during the New Heights podcast with Travis Kelce, discussing her fight to own her masters. “I'm in the business of human emotion,” she said. “So I would so much rather lead heart-first in something like this, because to me this isn't something like, ‘I want to own this asset because of its return.' I want it because these are my handwritten diary entries from my whole life.”


	That's the real bond between these two Taylors — their lifelong fight to hold on to their independence, despite public exposure. “It's the life behind it all,” Swift said on New Heights. “It's the life beyond the show.” At the very end of the album, she brings the story full circle with the title tune, dedicated to a tough dancer named Kitty. (Liz was a lifelong cat lady, not to mention Maggie the Cat in the 1959 classic Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.) But this could be Elizabeth's story as well as Swift's. “I'm married to the hustle,” Taylor proclaims. “Now I know the life of a showgirl, babe, and I'll never know another. Pain, hidden by the lipstick and lace.” Both Taylors know this life from the inside. Nobody except the showgirls will ever understand.

	Returning to the scene of the crime four years later, Black Phone 2‘s co-writer and director has upped the stakes for the sequel.


Scott Derrickson, who created the Blumhouse franchise with C. Robert Cargill, recently explained how the followup expands on the lore of the 2021 supernatural horror film with “more intensity and more gore,” now that Finney (Mason Thames) is a teenager.


	“The reason I wanted to do a high school movie was that it has more interesting emotional stakes,” Derrickson told SFX Magazine of the sequel, which premieres Oct. 17 in theaters.




			Watch on Deadline		







	After escaping the Grabber's (Ethan Hawke) clutches and putting his killing spree to a permanent end in The Black Phone, Finney investigates a winter camp with his younger sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), who's had visions of the killer stalking three young boys from beyond the grave.

	











	“It requires a different tone than a middle school coming-of-age supernatural movie,” the writer/director explained. “You just invariably are going to need to be more violent and more aggressive and maybe more shocking, to escalate aspects of the movie beyond what the first movie did, because a good portion of the audience, the teenagers who grew up really loving The Black Phone, they're older now. They're the kids who paid to see Terrifier. So there's certainly more intensity and more gore. We were rated R, and one of the things we were rated R for was gore. There's no gore in the first movie at all.”


	Derrickson added, “The change that you go through between middle school and high school may be one of the biggest, most dramatic changes you go through in your lifetime, and I was really interested in who these characters have become, having gone through something so extraordinary. I didn't want to intensify the violence and horror to be more edgy. I was interested in being more mature, going deeper into the emotions of these characters and trying to make a movie that worked as a pair.”

	











Black Phone 2 had its world premiere last month at Fantastic Fest in Austin, after the original 1978-set film saw the Grabber kidnap young Finney, who's guided to his escape by phantom phone calls from the killer's previous victims. The first movie was a surprise post-quarantine box office success, surpassing $161 million worldwide.

'Showgirl' looks to clear at least $30 million, an impressive number for a pic that's neither a concert film nor a doc but rather a cinematic experience and (smart) promotional stunt for Swift's new album.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


Taylor Swift‘s Life of a Showgirl special theatrical event is rocking at the domestic box office, where it's headed for a first-place finish with a weekend haul of at least $28 million to $32 million from 3,702 theaters, according to estimates from Swift's team and partner AMC Theatres. Rival distributors, however, have it earning north of $35 million.


	Whatever the outcome, those numbers are in sharp contrast to ticket sales for the Dwayne Johnson-led wrestling drama The Smashing Machine, which is bombing in its domestic debut. Playing in 3,345 theaters, the A24 release earned $2.7 million on Friday for a projected weekend opening of $6 million, versus the $12 million to $14 million it was expected to earn.

	The movie — an awards vehicle for Johnson — is looking at a third-place finish behind Showgirl and holdover One Battle After Another after getting slapped with a B- CinemaScore from audiences. (Critics have been more kind; it's current score on Rotten Tomatoes is an okay 77 percent.)

	Conversely, Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl earned a coveted A+ CinemaScore from her fans, just as her history-making concert film Eras Tour did. Nearly 90 percent of Friday's moviegoers were female.


	Swift's team went to great lengths to keep the Showgirl project top secret until the 11th hour (they almost succeeded, but not quite), much to the chagrin of other distributors who don't like last-minute surprises. She announced the Oct. 3-5 special event on Sept. 19 in a well-orchestrated social media post informing fans that advance tickets would go sale that day at 12:12 local time for $12, in keeping with Swift's longtime relationship with numbers (Showgirl is her 12th studio album). Consumers can expect to pay notably more than $12 for premium large format screenings.

	











Showgirl, playing in theaters for only three days, can best be described as a series of lyric videos for tracks on her new album, music videos and behind-the-scenes footage. And it's anchored by the world premiere of the music video for Showgirl single “The Fate of Ophelia,” which she directed. 


	In 2023, The Eras Tour concert pic catapulted Swift to box office fame when it opened to a huge $93.2 million domestically on its way to becoming the top-grossing concert film of all time with $261.6 million in global ticket sales. The superstar and her team financed the $15 million project, bypassing the Hollywood studio system in partnering with AMC Theatres to distribute the film. AMC Theatres Distribution is likewise releasing Showgirl in partnership with Variance Films in the U.S. and Canada, and with Piece of Magic Entertainment in other international markets.


	According to THR‘s review of Showgirl, “The 89-minute cinematic experience — neither visual album nor concert film, and not quite a documentary — is strictly for the diehards. But while there's something to be said for the communal experience of absorbing an album surrounded by dozens of like-minded fans, what's actually being served up on screen is more filler than killer.”


	Directed by Benny Safdie, Smashing Machine reunites Johnson with his Jungle Cruise co-star and good friend Emily Blunt, who played a key role in bringing Johnson and Safdie together. The film is based on the real-life story of Mark Kerr, a former college wrestler who battled trauma and an addiction to painkillers during the early years of the UFC. It marks Johnson's first time making a play in the awards space.

	











	Another weekend offering is James Cameron's Avatar: The Way of Water, which is being rereleased exclusively in 3D. Like Swift's team, Cameron and partner 20th Century/Disney are using the box office for promotional purposes: this Christmas, Avatar: Ash and Fire opens.


	The movie will be playing in 90 percent of all Imax auditoriums domestically, but will have to share Dolby Cinema screens and other premium large-format auditoriums. Way of Water is projected to earn $2 million to $3 million domestically from 2,100 theaters.


More to come.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM FINAL:  Two superstars with massive social media followings, Taylor Swift with 548 million, and Dwayne Johnson with 562 million, are brawling at the box office with the cat lover showing her claws over the former WWE champ as Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl is conquering with a $30M-$32M opening/sole weekend, and sending The Smashing Machine down for the count with an estimated $6.2M. 


	That is unfortunately Johnson's lowest opening ever of his career as a leading man — lower than the $8.5M opening of 2010's Faster, and below the wide break on Fighting With My Family at $7.8M (which he technically had a supporting role in and produced). 

	











	Why the disparity in box office results between the social media heavyweights? Essentially Swifties are seeing Swift as exactly as they want to see her, and for those who love The Rock; this gritty transformation isn't the champ they know. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Pulling off a feat that no other major studio has ever accomplished, Swift dates a ‘cinematic experience' two weeks before its release, timed to her album drop and creates an immediate sense of urgency with her fanbase who the 14x Grammy winner speaks directly to on social. Even if Showgirl falls back tonight and comes out in the high $20Ms (no one is expecting that number), so what? It's still amazing for a movie that was first announced two weeks ago. By the way, Swift directed Showgirl. Fans gave Swift her second A+ CinemaScore last night after 2023's Eras Tour concert movie. Definite recommend on PostTrak for Showgirl is off the Richter scale at a massive 82% definite recommend. PostTrak auds also gave Showgirl five stars and a 93% positive. Women showed up at 88% with the 18-34 demo at 61%. Diversity demos were 70% Caucasian, 17% Latino and Hispanic, 7% Asian American and 2% Black. Seventy percent were over 25, and 30% under. 


	Swift's premium large format screen steal (she took the Dolbys away from DJ) is driving 28% of the weekend with the movie playing best in the South and Midwest where 36% of the gross is coming from. AMC Dine-In Disney Springs, FL is currently Showgirl‘s top grossing locale with $61K. 

	











	Swift already had $15M in the bank from presales before Showgirl opened and PostTrak shows that 58% of Swifties bought their tickets more than a week ago, and 26% in the last week. Very little walk-up business with 16% purchasing tickets same-day. 


	Juxtapose Swift's 11th hour machine sans any trailers to that of The Smashing Machine which began its marketing about eight months ago with early screenings to the UFC. That org reaches 279 million around the globe. UFC CEO and President Dana White was also a key figure on the publicity tour, giving shoutouts to the movie. 

"It's hard for anybody to relate to what it's like to be the greatest fighter on the planet. … What they can relate to is pressure and the pressure to deliver."—@TheRock on portraying Mark Kerr in the upcoming movie, "The Smashing Machine" 💎 pic.twitter.com/1tLEb76BWT


	Beyond its UFC outreach, Smashing Machine flexes its marketing even more with a Venice Film Festival world premiere where it receives a 15 1/2 minute standing ovation, a Silver Lion Best Director for Benny Safdie, and Johnson sobbing on a global stage. Why didn't this superstar's movie about one of the fighting org's best, Mark Kerr, transcend? Because in the hands of Safdie and A24, Smashing Machine is an arthouse film; it was never positioned as a mainstream play. It's very non-traditional in its narrative, some critics get it, others do not. This is a 180 from Johnson's previous R-rated movie, Pain & Gain, under the direction of Michael Bay and with co-star Mark Wahlberg which was a glossy, major studio take on drugs and beefcakes, opening in the 2013 pre-streaming era to $20.2M. The UFC faithful clearly see that it's not the Johnson they wanna see. By the way, that demo is largely a homebound audience, and they aren't leaving the couch for this one; the hope is that they'll catch it on PVOD. Smashing Machine even gets an A24-like CinemaScore of B-, indicating a divide among those who watched it. That's the nature of their filmmaker-driven movies — to create discourse. A low definite recommend on PostTrak at 48%, a 72% positive and three stars. Any business for Smashing Machine came from the South and West where 42% of the gross is coming from versus a norm of 33%. AMC Lincoln Square is the Safdie film's best gross with $26K. 


	Seventy percent guys to 30% women went to Smashing Machine with 18-34 showing up at 64%. Diversity demos were 53% Caucasian, 27% Latino and Hispanic, 8% Black and 8% Asian American. 


	Here's the one silver lining for Smashing Machine: At a net cost of $50M before P&A, with tax credits from its New Mexico and Vancouver shoots, and that's the largely funded foreign sales production won't bleed much.


	In earnest style, Safdie has been literally handing out flyers to his movie for a while in Manhattan. More on that later.

Showgirl from its announcement was part of the cultural conversation on Swift. Not much in regards to P&A for the Variance distributed AMC title. There were some outdoor billboards ala the one in Times Square right after the pic's announcement. 


Showgirl‘s social media reach across TikTok, YouTube, X, Facebook, and Instagram stood at 714.5M before its opening, 18% ahead of Eras Tour movie's 604.9M. Wow, and that had a little more than a month to promote. Overall, Showgirl‘s social media reach was 37% ahead of recent concert theatrical norms per RelishMix. Says RelishMix in their recent report, “Part of what's super interesting and obvious about the campaign for this film, unlike traditional Hollywood movie runways, is how the instantaneous these projects can pop-up given the social media power that has been built over the last 17 years — which is pumped directly to over a half-a-billion (548M) Swifties across her social network. Since the wedding engagement announcement to Travis Kelsey, with 37.5M clicks on Aug 26 in Taylor's Instagram, there have been four posts for the new Showgirl album and movie. There are no trailers on the Taylor Swift YouTube channel and there are only stills posted on Instagram with over 20M likes from 282M followers. Post activity on X is extra strong and on TikTok, materials are sparse, but there are 117K #fan posts across TikTok.”


	The below TikTok video of BTS of the pic has clocked 9.3M views since posting five days ago. 

	










She's got 4️⃣ days left to rehearse for her big moment… 😂 Be the first to get your hands on The Life of a Showgirl: The Crowd is Your King Edition on Summertime Spritz Pink Shimmer Vinyl only at @target starting 10/3. Select stores open at midnight. While supplies last ❤️‍🔥


	RelishMix adds, “Convo runs positive for Taylor Swift: Showgirl, with Swifties treating the drop like the second coming of cinema itself. Fans are screaming, crying, planting flowers in the shape of a ‘T,' and rearranging birthdays and baby deliveries just to be in theaters. The excitement carries comparisons to MCU-level hype, with one fan predicting her ‘Dazzler' cameo in Avengers Doomsday and another calling her a ‘showgirl extraordinaire.'”


	Meanwhile, Warner Bros is seeing One Battle After Another north of $12M in weekend 2 in 2nd. Others see it $10M-$11M. Even if One Battle After Another comes in at the low end, that's a -55% second weekend hold which is better than Leonardo DiCaprio's Killers of the Flower Moon which posted -60% in weekend dos. What's clear is One Battle After Another, which is coursing to $100M worldwide by Sunday, is that it's bound to ultimately pass Killers of the Flower ($200M+ cost and 3 1/2 hour running time vs. the Paul Thomas Anderson pic's $130M-$140M and 2 hours and 40 minutes length) which ended its run at $158.7M. Killers of the Flower Moon went the distance to Oscar night with ten nominations off its bloated budget and a final $68M domestic box office. When it came to sizing up the profit-loss on Killers of the Flower, Apple dodged that bullet given how the streamer doesn't assess the finances of their movies by regular motion picture P&L standards. As one film finance source always told me, big budget movies at Apple are essentially advertising costs for their tech products and universe. No, how fair is that?.  


	Saturday figures:


	10. The Long Walk (LG) 1,930 (-367) theaters, Fri $500K (-49%) 3-day $1.7M (-49%), Total $31.9M/Wk 4


	11. Kantara: A Legend Chapter 1 (Prath) 689 theaters, Fri $540K, 3-day $1.5M, Total $2.3M/Wk 1


Other:


Bone Lake (BST) 1,059 theaters, Fri $470K, 3-day $910K, Wk 1Anemone (Foc) 865 theaters, Fri $310K, 3-day $900K, PTA $1K, Wk 1 


	Ticket sales were soft for the erotic thriller Bone Lake as well as Daniel Day-Lewis' return to the big screen after an eight-year absence. Blurb for the latter, directed by Lewis' son Ronan Day-Lewis: In Northern England, a man heads out on a journey into the woods to reconnect with the estranged hermit brother with whom he shared a complicated past that was altered by life-changing events decades ago. Critics don't like it at 56%. 


FRIDAY PM: The No. 1 exhibitor in the world's theatrical release of Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, is heading toward a $15M-$16M Friday with a current opening-weekend forecast of $29M-$31M at 3,700 theaters. Note these figures do not come from AMC Theatres


	There are some estimates out there as high as $40M, but here is what's vital to keep in mind: This is very front-loaded with advance tickets sales arguably accounted for (true, we heard that last time with Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, but that found an audience). The notion here is that all Swifties are making a date to see Showgirl today, because it's the release date of her album The Life of a Showgirl (duh).

	Although not any kind of October opening record, the marvel of it all is how the 14x Grammy winner was able to announce a cinematic experience two weeks before its release; steal Premium Large Format screens from Dwayne Johnson's The Smashing Machine, Leonardo DiCaprio's One Battle After Another and James Cameron's re-release of Avatar: The Way of Water; and get to this box office threshold with very little P&A.

	Swift already has broken the Spotify record for most single-day streams; her pre-saves for Showgirl were north of 5 million. No word yet where album sales will land for Swift on Showgirl, but she's the only performer to have sold more than 1M albums a week seven times. Swift's bestselling album reportedly is 1989, which has sold 14M copies in the U.S. alone and going platinum abroad.


	It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times at the weekend box office — the latter going to Dwayne Johnson's arthouse biopic about UFC fighter Mark Kerr, The Smashing Machine, which unfortunately is in a sleeper hold and destined for $6M-$7M in third place at 3,345 locations (read Deadline's review here). The net $50M production was funded largely by foreign sales. Smashing Machine hit tracking three weeks ago with a $20M projection. But after Swift announced two weeks ago that she was pushing her way onto The Rock's weekend, forecasts plummeted. More on that later. No audience score yet on Rotten Tomatoes. Today is $2.7M for the Benny Safdie-directed movie. Swift stole Smashing Machine‘s Dolby Cinemas.

	In second, is Warner Bros.' second weekend of One Battle After Another (read our review here), still armed with its 70MM Imax locations, with an estimated $12.5M (-43%) after a second Friday of $3.6M. If all goes right, domestic hits $44.1M by Sunday and overseas shoots to $56M take after a second frame $17M haul for a $100.1M global running cume. Knock on wood.


	Universal's second weekend of Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie at 3,507 venues is collapsing with $4.7M in 4th, -66%. Not good for a kids movie. That will get the big-screen version of the DreamWorks Animation-Netflix show to $21.1M by Sunday. Today is $1.2M.


RELATED: New Line In Final Talks With Michiel Blanchart To Direct ‘Final Destination 7'


	Fifth belongs to New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites at 2,753 with a fifth Friday of $1.1M and fifth frame of $3.8M, -44%, and running cume of $166.6M, again, the highest-grossing movie in the horror franchise.


	20th Century Studios via Disney's reissue of Avatar: The Way of Water at 2,140 sites is seeing a $3M outside the Top 5. Today, including previews, is just under $1M. Again, the movie will offer one of three sneak peeks of December's Avatar: Fire and Ash. The 2022 pic is playing in 3D, Imax, with some PLFs.

With the amount of showtimes for Showgirl I have to think they were expecting a number closer to Eras. Pull up your local theater listings and tell me that looks like a $30m opener.

Is Tom Cruise the last global box office star?

Depends on where you stand with Denzel Washington. He has his audience

Yhe kids are buying tickets to The Life of a Showgirl and sneaking into Smashing Machine

Taylor Swift obviously had a negative impact on The Smashing Machine by taking away screens but that can't be anywhere even remotely close to the -67% it dropped from tracking two weeks ago.

It's not like many people decided to switch from UFC to Swiftie last minute.

Maybe they did. There could be more women who listen to Taylor Swift in their cars on the way to UFC showings than any trend tracker knows.

That's more IMPACT than Participant could ever hope for.

Nicole Kidman is embracing a new chapter after bringing her 19-year marriage to “American Idol” judge Keith Urban to an end. A source close to the actress told People that while the decision wasn't easy, Kidman is finding peace in focusing on family. “She's been stressed because she knew the separation would eventually become public and she was dreading it,” the insider shared. 

“But she's surprisingly level-headed and calm. Now that it's out, she's just focused on what's ahead and her girls.”

As per People magazine, the Oscar winner filed for divorce in Nashville on September 30, citing irreconcilable differences and listing the same day as their official date of separation. Kidman, 58, and Urban, 57, share two daughters, Sunday Rose, 17, and Faith Margaret, 14. According to court documents, she has requested to be their primary residential parent.

The news of their separation broke on September 29, with sources telling People that the Oscar winner and the country musician had been living apart since early summer. “Nicole didn't want this,” an insider said. “She has been fighting to save the marriage.”

Page Six reported that the “Moulin Rouge!” star received strong support from her sister, Antonia Kidman, and close family members. The two were spotted walking together in Nashville on October 1, marking Nicole's first public sighting since the divorce news became public.

Kidman and Urban first met at a Los Angeles gala in 2005 and got married the following year.

People reported that just days after filing for divorce, Urban returned to the stage for his High and Alive World Tour stop in Hershey, Pennsylvania. While performing “Heart Like a Hometown,” he kept a family photo featuring Kidman and their daughters in the slideshow that plays during the song — a quiet but emotional nod to his loved ones.

Before launching into the song, Urban shared a personal story with the crowd about how his parents had supported his dream of pursuing music full-time. His bandmate Natalie Stovall rejoined him for the show after sitting out previous dates.

Stovall's earlier absence had sparked speculation over Urban's connection to guitarist Maggie Baugh, who temporarily filled in during his Chicago performance. 

At that show, Urban ad-libbed, “I'll be your guitar player,” to Baugh while performing “The Fighter,” a song inspired by his romance with Kidman. Baugh did not appear onstage in Hershey and has not addressed the rumors.

This marks Kidman's second high-profile divorce. She was previously married to Tom Cruise from 1990 to 2001 and shares two adult children, Isabella, 32, and Connor, 30.

In a 2021 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Kidman reflected on how her past relationships have shaped her outlook on love. “I'm wary at times, and I've been hurt, but I much prefer a warm approach rather than a prickly shutdown,” she said. “My husband Keith once asked, ‘How's your heart?' and I told him, ‘Open.'”

As she steps into a new chapter, Kidman is keeping that same spirit. Sources indicate that she remains focused on her daughters and moving forward with grace.

Louis C.K. defended his and other comedians' decision to perform at the controversial Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia amid a wave of criticism from fellow comics.


	Appearing on Real Time With Bill Maher Friday ahead of his scheduled Riyadh set on Monday, C.K. said he initially had “mixed feelings” about taking the gig, and that he previously turned down opportunities to perform in Arab countries due to censorship concerns. However, he said Saudi Arabia has “kind of opened up.”


	“I've always said no to Arab countries,” C.K. said (via The Hollywood Reporter). “When this came up, they said there's only two restrictions; their religion and their government, and I don't have jokes about those two things. It used to be when I got offers from places like that, there would be a long list, and I'd just say, ‘No, I don't need that.' But when I heard it's opening, I thought, that's awfully interesting. That just feels like a good opportunity. And I just feel like comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.”

	











	The comedian added, “I've been talking to them, the comedians who've been there, and they've been really surprised by what's going on. There's a woman who's a lesbian and Jewish, who did a show there, and she got a standing ovation. So, there's stuff going on that's unexpected in this thing.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	(That aforementioned comedian, Jessica Kirson, has since issued a statement apologizing to fans for performing at Riyadh: “This decision has weighed heavily on my heart ever since. I like to express my sincere regret for having performed under a government that continues to violate fundamental human rights… As an openly gay person, when I was asked to perform in Riyadh, I was surprised. I requested a guarantee that I could be openly out as a lesbian on stage and perform gay material. I hoped that this could help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued. I am grateful that I was able to do precisely that — to my knowledge, I am the first openly gay comic to talk about it on stage in Saudi Arabia. I received messages from attendees sharing how much it meant to them to participate in a gay-affirming event. At the same time, I deeply regret participating under the auspices of the Saudi government.”)

	Earlier this week, comics like David Cross, Shane Gillis, Marc Maron, Atsuko Okatsuka, and more publicly criticized the comedians — including Dave Chappelle, Pete Davidson, Bill Burr, Kevin Hart, and more — who opted to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival. 


	“The money is coming straight from the Crown Prince, who actively executes journalists, ppl with nonlethal drug offenses, bloggers, etc without due process,” Okatsuka wrote on social media. Maron quipped that the festival was presented “from the folks that brought you 9/11.”


	On Real Time, C.K. said of the controversy, “I think the whole discussion is worthy. I'm glad these guys brought this stuff up, I'm glad that people are challenging this thing, because you shouldn't just pretend it's something it's not.”


	“I had mixed feelings about it too,” C.K. added. “I struggled about going once I heard what everybody was saying. There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it. But for me, I think it cuts toward going. That's my decision, and I know where it's coming from, because I can see right inside myself.”

	Bill Burr previously called his Riyadh performance “a mind-blowing experience. Definitely top three experiences I've ever had.”


	“The royals loved the show. Everyone was happy. The people that were doing the festival were thrilled,” Burr said. “It was great to experience that part of the world and to be a part of the first comedy festival over there in Saudi Arabia. I think it's going to lead to a lot of positive things.”

"The fact that that's opening up and starting to bud, I wanna see it, I wanna be part of it. I think that's a positive thing," he said on the latest episode of 'Real Time.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Louis C.K. is explaining why he decided to take part in Saudi Arabia‘s Riyadh Comedy Festival.


	During his Friday appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher, he defended his choice to perform at the comedy festival that has stirred up controversy since it kicked off last Friday. The topic of comics being prohibited to not make jokes about certain themes came up in his conversation with Bill Maher, to which C.K. said the fellow comedians he know who have been at the fest have “been really surprised by what's going on.”  




	“When I'm talking to the other comedians who have been there, they've been really surprised by what's going on. There's a woman who's a lesbian and Jewish, who did a show there, and she got a standing ovation. So, there's stuff going on that's unexpected in this thing,” he said. “People have been playing Saudi Arabia for years. Comedians have been going and playing Arab countries. There was a film festival there recently, it's kind of opened up. But I've always said no to Arab countries.”

	C.K. continued, “And when this came up, they said there's only two restrictions — their religion and their government, I don't have jokes about those two things. It used to be when I got offers from places like that, there would be a long list, and I'd just say, ‘No, I don't need that.' But when I heard it's opening, I thought, that's awfully interesting. That just feels like a good opportunity. And I just feel like comedy is a great way to get in and start talking.”


	Riyadh Fest began Sept. 26 and will end Oct. 9. Alongside C.K., Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings, Russell Peters, Gabriel Iglesias and Andrew Schulz, among others, are featured on the lineup. 

	











	Last week, Atsuko Okatsuka shared details from her offer to appear at Riyadh, which outlined “censorship rules” against performing jokes on outlined topics. David Cross, too, slammed those who chose to perform, writing on his website, “I am disgusted, and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing. That people I admire, with unarguable talent, would condone this totalitarian fiefdom for…what, a fourth house? A boat? More sneakers?” 


	Before that, Marc Maron spoke out against those participating in the comedy festival.


	“I mean, how do you even promote that? You know, like, ‘From the folks that brought you 9/11. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don't miss it!'” Maron said. “I mean, the same guy that's gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone saw [journalist] Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a fucking suitcase. But don't let that stop the yucks, it's gonna be a good time!”


	The Emmy winner acknowledged the wider conversation about the festival. “I had mixed feelings about it too. I struggled about going once I heard what everybody was saying,” C.K. said. “There's some good in it, maybe some bad in it. But for me, I think it cuts toward going. That's my decision, and I know where it's coming from, because I can see right inside myself.”


	C.K. added, “I love stand-up comedy, and I love comedians. So, the fact that that's opening up and starting to bud, I wanna see it, I wanna be part of it. I think that's a positive thing.”

	











	The six-time Emmy winner is slated to perform at Riyadh Fest on Monday alongside Carr.

A new development in the ongoing drama surrounding Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Comedy Festival tonight, as one comedian participating in the festival has now issued a formal apology for doing so, and pledged to donate her payment for the show to human rights groups. This is per THR, which reports that comic Jessica Kirson has issued a statement in which she expresses her “sincere regret for having performed under a government that continues to violate fundamental human rights.” She added that, “I have donated the entirety of what I was paid to perform there to a human rights organization.”

In her statement—originally given to THR—the openly gay Kirson said she agreed to participate at the festival due to hopes that it would improve visibility for LGBTQ+ people in the country. “As an openly gay person,” Kirson wrote, “When I was asked to perform in Riyadh, I was surprised. I requested a guarantee that I could be openly out as a lesbian on stage and perform gay material. I hoped that this could help LGBTQ+ people in Saudi Arabia feel seen and valued. I am grateful that I was able to do precisely that—to my knowledge, I am the first openly gay comic to talk about it on stage in Saudi Arabia. I received messages from attendees sharing how much it meant to them to participate in a gay-affirming event.”

That being said, Kirson added that “I deeply regret participating under the auspices of the Saudi government,” and issued an especial apology to her fans, who've been vocal with criticisms on her social media accounts since her participation in the festival became public knowledge. “I have a special relationship with my fans because of the vulnerable nature of my comedy and the trust they place in me as part of the queer community,” Kirson wrote. “To my fans: I see you. I hear you. Your voice matters to me. I love you all, and I am genuinely sorry for making a poor decision that had repercussions I didn't fully consider. I will take full responsibility for my actions and dedicate myself to making amends, so that my words and choices reflect the respect and care you deserve.”

Riyadh has been a lightning rod for division in the comedy world, in part because of the caliber of names—and the size of the paychecks—it's been able to throw around. Comics like Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr not only performed at the festival—put on under the auspices of the Saudi government, which has continued to face criticisms for harsh human rights abuses in the country—but spoke in praise of the experience. Meanwhile, many of their contemporaries have called out participants for taking actions that can be seen as lending credibility to the country's royal family and government. The festival will continue through next week in the Saudi Arabian capital.

	As Haliey Welch makes her debut TV role, the ‘Hawk Tuah Girl‘ is speaking out amid backlash around her casting.


	Following Brittney Rae Carrera's viral video claiming Welch replaced her in a scene from the pilot episode of Hulu‘s Chad Powers, the social media influencer said she has reached out to the actress personally.


	“Hey guys I've been tagged in a lot of videos of [Carrera] saying I ‘replaced her' in Chad Powers,” said Welch in a since-expired Instagram Story. “I've been in contact with her and we're cool. I wasn't aware the role had been filled prior.

	“It was as simple as this: I was called and asked to be in a tv series with Glen Powell and I said yes (bc duh it's Glen Powell). I wasn't made aware this was happening and it was in no way malicious at all. I actually love her content and think she is a funny and sweet girl,” she added.

	











	In the debut episode, Glen Powell‘s titular disgraced football player walks into the VIP section of a nightclub, where Welch is sitting. “Oh shit! The fucking ‘Hawk Tuah Girl' is here. ‘Hawk tuah! Spit on that thang,'” he yelled, quoting the TikTok star's infamous catchphrase.

A post shared by 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞𓆝 𓆟 (@brittneyraeallday)


	“My name's Haliey, dickhead,” she responds, before Chad refers to her as Hailey Tuah. “Welch! Haliey Welch is my full human name.”


	Welch later tells him, “Please don't tell people we met.”


	In Carrera's video, she paused the scene during a viewing party with friends. “They replaced me with ‘Hawk Tuah'?!” she yells. “That's my scene… this is literally my scene. I filmed this.”

	











	Although Deadline can confirm that Carrera was originally cast in the part, reshoots are common in film and television, especially for pilots. While she has a large following and is known for posting comedic content, it's unclear if the video was of her genuine reaction or a self-deprecating bit.


	After going viral in June 2024 with a video in Nashville, uttering her signature catchphrase, Welch quickly found representation with The Penthouse management, having since launched her Talk Tuah podcast and announced the upcoming DocTuah documentary about her sudden rise to fame.

She's definitely gonna get more press from this than if she actually appeared in the movie. Good for her.

While I can understand Carrera's disappointment,  She dodged a bullet here. I cannot fathom why anyone would be interested in working in such a badly made series.

Not really, actors need work and residuals and health care. Working on good shows is nice but that is not what it's all about.

Pretty cold (even for Hollywood) to not give her a heads up.  Basic human decency.

She's better off not being in this disaster of a show. 

It's sooooo bad.

Glen Powell has made a lot of stinkers

There's probably a classier metaphor I could use to describe the feeling you get when you realize you're watching a real midnight movie and not some cheap imitation. And yet, like the famous censorship decision passed down by the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court — a notoriously feckless group that was somehow still more fun than our current justice system — I must say, “I know it when I see it.” 

You can't really tell someone they're in a cult unless they're ready to leave one, and you can't really claim to have made a cult film until your movie behaves like that. From the ever-growing list of “genre” and “midnight” shorts competitions on the festival circuit, to the awe-inspiring grassroots campaigns that have followed feature indie triumphs like Mike Cheslik's “Hundreds of Beavers,” bawdy counterculture has managed to stay explosive and hopeful even over the toughest times this year.

More entertainers are pushing the envelope to match the extreme feel of daily life, and Hollywood's top decision-makers are taking note of a trend IndieWire's Dana Harris-Bridson is already reporting. In some cases, where and when filmmakers find their niche audiences is as important as how and why studios decide to distribute their art. Did you come with a party, or did you ask Hollywood to throw you one? 

 










Think of it like an amateur open mic night, where novice comedians are required to sell tickets or buy a certain number of drinks if they want to perform. Some indie creatives say you've got a better shot at convincing the industry to give you multiple seats at the table for films with social scenes already attached — than they are inviting backers to dream up a culture with them on still-emerging IP. That's easier said than done, of course, and playing a movie at midnight does not a midnight movie make. 

Listed in chronological order, these essential cult classics will guide you through the history of the format and teach you some of the most important lessons in theatrical buzz-building the art world has ever known. From the Pope of Trash and all that Divine goodness in 1972's “Pink Flamingos” — to Tommy Wiseau's melodramatic “The Room,” a so-bad-it's-good gem that's been tearing us apart since 2003, these are the timeless midnight masterpieces you've got to study if you want your film to hit after dark. 

What a movie actually is  and how people experience it are two very different things. Released in 1936, this morality tale against marijuana was financed by a long-defunct church group called the Motion Picture Guild. Something like the cinematic Sinclair Broadcasting of its day, the footage from this public service announcement, originally titled “Tell Your Children,” was recut and redistributed under a slew of different names throughout the 1930s and 1940s. 

 










Weed wasn't the brick-and-mortar phenomenon it is in some U.S. states today, and the drug's popularity wouldn't seriously grow among Americans until the 1960s. Thanks to producer Dwain Esper, the black-and-white exploitation flick was also known as “Love Madness,” “Dope Addict,” “The Burning Question,” and more self-righteous monikers that made it easy to mock during that dormant period. When versions of the film started appearing on roadside attractions and college campuses, word-of-mouth spread and the promise of seeing the footage out of context helped the eventized version of the project soar even higher. This isn't really the first midnight movie in earnest — that's up next — but the sideways journey it took laid essential groundwork.

Legalization activist Keith Stroup eventually co-opted the public domain film and used it to rebelliously bolster his own movement. Directed by Louis J. Gasnier, “Tell Your Children” gained more popularity at charity screenings where flecks of the call-back comedy culture that would later define “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” widened the “Reefer Madness” appeal. It would come to be widely known by that name in part thanks to the musical stage adaptation from 1988. That was made into a Showtime special starring Alan Cumming and Kristen Bell in 2005, and “The Good Place” actress appeared in the live show in Los Angeles for the 25th anniversary last year.

 










George A. Romero's “Night of the Living Dead” almost didn't make this list. Still, there's no denying that horror is integral to the midnight movie, and the late Father of Zombies is widely credited with giving both genres their progressive political reputations. (Plus, this thing whips in every way a movie can whip. It isn't even a scary scene, but the line, “They're coming to get you Barbara!” lives in my head rent free. Gimme an edit where the bass drops!) 

An unrated effort from 1968, Romero's very first feature was a true-blue indie with a weak distro plan that he financed and shot himself. At first, it was marketed like a normal horror release. But after reports of some disastrous screenings, including one Chicago matinee attended by critic Roger Ebert and a pack of hysterical children, “Night of the Living Dead” was increasingly considered “too scary” to show during the day. That PR gold helped launch Romero as a beloved cult film director, although he rarely shared in the profits of the revolutionary works he made. Not yet bested today, the most exquisite zombie movie ever created demanded to be seen by more audiences, and using late-night slots at drive-in theaters and rep cinemas as a cheap way to build out its reputation was brilliant. 

 










Released against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, the terrifying existential statement Romero was making properly snaps into focus through the performance of Duane Jones. The Black actor was a revolutionary casting choice for Romero's final guy, and the cutting indictment of racism in America blanketed the country only after nightfall. “Night of the Living Dead” served as a jangly prelude for the existential dread David Lynch would stir up in movie-goers with his debut, “Eraserhead,” less than a decade later.

In light of “Reefer Madness,” it's fun to imagine what the prudish Motion Picture Group might have said about the violent psychosexual odyssey that is “El Topo.” Maybe… “Oh, holy fuck!” 

Alejandro Jodorowsky was a Chilean-French filmmaker and the patron saint of acid cinema whose shoestring Western — shot over six harsh months in Mexico's Chihuahuan Desert — brought unprecedented surrealism to cinema. He insisted on doing everything practically, dragging his team to remote locations and killing real animals for a “more truthful” effect on screen.  Commingling incendiary psychedelic imagery with the extreme conditions that impacted the “El Topo” cast and crew, the final viewing experience is transformative anywhere you see it. 

 










You can almost feel the extreme heat and cold radiating off the screen as Jodorowsky, who also stars as the titular El Topo (translated to mean The Mole in English), wanders the white-hot landscape contending with the infinite paradoxes of personal philosophy. As he pursues enlightenment, the repeated clashes El Topo has with various enemies along his winding journey mount an existential lesson that caught the attention of John Lennon among others. 

Jodorowsky is frequently credited as the “father of the midnight movie,” and while he indeed made an extraordinary film, if anyone deserves that title for their work on “El Topo” it's Ben Barenholtz. The owner of New York City's Elgin Cinema made the historic decision to screen it when he did — establishing the very notion of midnight as a ritual worth having at the movies.

Not only did John Waters and drag queen Divine help make midnight movies more queer, but they also bravely tested the limits of shock cinema and passed with flying, pastel, and dog shit-stained colors. Before Ben Barenholtz left the Elgin and began the next phase of his career as a producer (he's credited on “Miller's Crossing,” “Requiem for a Dream,” and more all-time releases throughout the years), he programmed “Pink Flamingos” and catapulted Waters' reputation from challenging underground artist to internationally renowned provocateur. 

 










The best movies extract emotions from us, and watching the most objectionable material in Waters' masterpiece from 1972 can feel like trying to hold puke back behind your eyeballs. But advertised as a transgressive “exercise in bad taste,” that's what the Elgin was selling, and even despite themselves, audiences ate it up. If “El Topo” established the midnight format as assaulting and transformative, then “Pink Flamingos” anointed it a place of spectacle. The midnight screen became a no-holds-barred arena for freedom of expression through Waters — one that could turn trash into treasure and make filth feel at once frightening and fun. 

Also known as Harris Glenn Milstead, Divine should have monuments in every city. Fans could start by showing the late legend even more love in Baltimore, Maryland, where “Pink Flamingos” was made guerilla style and the notorious production gained its earliest reputation filming on the public street. The legendary porn movie “Deep Throat” came out that year too, but people loved Divine because she turned their judgment of her depravity into a source of joy. That megawatt charisma steered midnight movies deeper into the drag world. It also laid an essential foundation for the fearless Club Kids that would emerge around the time Divine died in 1988. 

 










In the film, the eventual “Hairspray!” star plays Babs Johnson, the “filthiest person alive.” That's a more coveted title than you'd think living in her candy-colored trailer park, and Waters escalates the battle of depravity that follows through a list of gross-out gags including incest, cannibalism, and that oh-so-whimsical canine feces eating. “Pink Flamingos” never gained the popularity of the next major midnight movie to sweep the nation, “Rocky Horror,” but it put Divine in the running for mainstream cinema's most impactful drag performer. That's an accolade she'd no doubt hate, and to quote the queen herself, “The world of the heterosexual is a sick and boring life.” But the stunts got her and Waters talked about constantly — a trick that's harder to pull off than it looks and cheap copycats fail at all the time.

A group of batshit musical theater kids hit Hollywood in 1975, and midnight was never the same. Having opened “The Rocky Horror Show” on the West End two years earlier, director Jim Sharman and writer Richard O'Brien dreamed a new version of their glam-rock musical — about a conservative couple with a flat tire, who ask for help from a sexy mad scientist in a castle down the road — that would dominate the silver screen for the next 50 years. Eventually. 
 










Up against “Jaws” and more obsession-worthy movies at the box office that summer, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” had a hard time getting out of the gate. The story had been a smash hit on stage in London, and the cast and crew had delivered the fiendish nightmare they'd promised their backers. But finally unleashed on the mainstream American public, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” took about a year to find its sea legs. Fox had already lost about $500,000 on the adaptation when executive Tim Deegan had the brilliant idea to “take the movie midnight,” a move that not only recouped the studio's money but also made “Rocky Horror” the single longest-running theatrical release ever made.

Known for its callbacks, prop comedy, shadow casts, and more, the result is a powerful pop culture institution that's created a mighty network of midnight movie fans. Thousands of people have actively participated in interactive “Rocky Horror” screenings, and millions more have attended — finding solace and safety in the margins of a truly weird and wonderful community that's still celebrated by Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Nell Campbell, Patricia Quinn, and many more. The result has been called “the only good cult in the world,” and its legacy is the subject of several documentaries, including 2016's “Rocky Horror Saved My Life” and the newly released “Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror” directed by Linus O'Brien, the son of Richard who also played Riff-Raff. 

 










Even in the warm embrace of an existentially challenged audience, “Eraserhead” was the haunting directorial debut that effectively demanded a hug from the entire midnight-loving world. Developed when he was still a student at AFI, David Lynch's unconventional approach to filmmaking marked him an artistic talent to watch early but he had trouble distributing his soul-shaking first film.

The affection the arthouse creator had for the midnight format proved invaluable to his success. Boxed out of several locations by “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” Lynch steadily pushed “Eraserhead” at select locations until it broke through thanks to key offerings at Cinema Village in New York City and the Landmark's Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. As it grew, the buzz surrounding Lynch became a benchmark few could meet and midnights felt longer when he was alive with them.

Too much has been written about the late Lynch and the countless talents he had as a sensitive filmmaker and human. So, in lieu of any more serious criticism, I'll take this time to remember him for his handsome ears. What fine lobes that man had! Bravo.

When “Reefer Madness” stopped circulating in the 1940s and 1950s, the early subculture that started to form around it went mostly dormant. The pearl-clutching folks over at the Motion Picture Guild never had a response to their film being used so brazenly, and that was true even as the footage was explicitly recontextualized for the opposite purpose it was intended.Tommy Wiseau was not so quiet when it came to “The Room.” 

 










So-bad-it's-good movies have been a thing for a long, long time. But that kind of rhetoric started to cause more of a stir among passionate genre fanbases when more of them felt empowered to argue both the outrageous art and the community experience they worshipped were extraordinary. Those debates rage on for some of the most vexing combinations of craft and camp — think “Showgirls,” “Striptease,” “Cats.” But “The Room” is a sincere and glorious work of dumb-assery that's genius by mistake with a mystery at its center that's still intoxicating today.  

How much Wiseau paid to cast himself in a bizarre melodrama about a love triangle has been debated for years, but half the fun when it came out was following the movie's rise and witnessing the filmmaker's strange evasiveness whenever he was asked about his background. Larger than life but fabulously incapable of acting, the leading man and self-flagellating auteur behind “The Room” became a kind of walking meme in the 2000s. 

Peddling a highly quotable movie and rubbing shoulders with many of the top comedians in Los Angeles at the time, Wiseau went to significant lengths to make sure his movie was Oscars eligible before it was infamously labeled “The Citizen Kane of Bad Movies.” That's an achievement in its own right, and the legacy of “The Room” lives on in a best-selling memoir about the production and that book's film adaptation, each titled “The Disaster Artist.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said late Friday that the tech company would also explore a revenue share with rightsholders.

OpenAI is taking steps to walk back the flood of Hollywood intellectual property that has dominated its new AI video app Sora.


	Late Friday night, OpenAI Sam Altman posted an update to his blog explaining the changes, which appear to be in response to concerns from entertainment companies and other rightsholders about how their IP or likenesses is being used in the social video app.




	“First, we will give rightsholders more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls,” Altman wrote. “We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction' and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all).”

	The new rules will be closer to the opt-in model that Sora has for individuals, and suggest that the company is walking back the “opt-out” model that it had been using, at least when it comes to generating videos (it is possible that Sora is still training on videos featuring known characters and IP).

	He added that there may be edge cases where content gets generated that shouldn't, but that the company will keep iterating.


	He also suggested that OpenAI may launch a revenue sharing product so that rightsholders could monetize videos that use their characters or likenesses.

	











	“People are generating much more than we expected per user, and a lot of videos are being generated for very small audiences,” he wrote. “We are going to try sharing some of this revenue with rightsholders who want their characters generated by users. The exact model will take some trial and error to figure out, but we plan to start very soon.”


As The Hollywood Reporter previously noted, Sora easily and quickly generates scenes featuring recognizable characters and voices, from South Park and Dune to Rick and Morty. The flood of well-known characters and IP that has dominated the Sora app enraged some Hollywood executives, with lawsuits likely to follow, though it is not clear if the new rules could shift that approach from rightsholders.

Rachel Reilly isn't done with reality TV just yet. Fresh off her “Big Brother” 27 exit, the “Big Brother” legend revealed she's officially working on a “Survivor” audition tape. If she were to be cast, she would become the first contestant ever to complete CBS's “Reality Trifecta” of “Big Brother,” “The Amazing Race,” and “Survivor.”

A post shared by CBS Big Brother (@bigbrothercbs)

The “Big Brother” 13 winner went to her Instagram Stories recently to let her followers know that she's currently working on her “Survivor” application, according to Parade. Reilly most recently appeared on “Big Brother” 27, which had its season finale on Sunday, September 28.

Reilly reshared a video of “Survivor” host Jeff Probst to her Instagram Story. In the video, Probst is encouraging Reilly to apply to the show while he is being interviewed on the Emmys red carpet.

Reilly then tagged a “Survivor” casting director in her post and wrote, “Working on that [audition] tape this week!”

Love her or hate her, Reilly knows what it takes to get on these shows. She has a lengthy reality television career with CBS. She also works as a casting agent for various unscripted shows.

While nothing is guaranteed, if Reilly were given a spot on an upcoming season of “Survivor,” she would become the first person to complete the CBS “Reality Trifecta.”

Reilly has competed on three seasons of “Big Brother” and three seasons on “The Amazing Race.” What's left to do? Compete on “Survivor,” of course.

Probst was being interviewed by Entertainment Tonight on the Emmy Awards red carpet back on Sunday, September 14. During that interview, Probst was told that Reilly was interested in competing on his show and becoming the first person to complete the trifecta.

“Well, first she's got to apply,” Probst said. “I mean, come on, she's got to want it bad enough to send in a little two-minute video and say, ‘Here's why I should be on.'”

The longtime “Survivor” host added, “There's no secret passageway to getting on Survivor. I think she's got a shot.”

This recent push for Reilly to compete on “Survivor” came after she was shockingly eliminated on “Big Brother” in September due to the “White Locust” twist.

Fans and former houseguests thought this new twist was unfair. It sent the “Big Brother” legend home without facing an eviction vote.

Regardless, she became the first member of the “Big Brother” 27 jury. Ultimately, she voted for her ally, Ashley Hollis, to win the game.

What do you think of Rachel Reilly competing on an upcoming season of “Survivor”?

50 Cent is happy to get a little shout-out from Taylor Swift. On Friday, hours after Swift released The Life of a Showgirl, the rapper shared his excitement over the pop queen mentioning his name on “Ruin the Friendship,” Track Six on her new album.


	“@taylorswift shit is popping right now, she shout me out, she don't shout you out,” 50 Cent wrote on Instagram alongside the LP's cover. “LOL THIS IS FOR BIG TIMERS ONLY!”


	He added: “Wait I'm the only shout out on the whole album.”


	On the song, Swift looks back on a teenage romance and the regret of not kissing someone despite knowing it would've been worth the risk. “And it was not an invitation/But as the 50 Cеnt song played/Should've kissed you anyway,” she sings on the track looking back at prom night. “And it was not convenient, no/Would've been the best mistake/Should've kissed you anyway, hey.”

A post shared by 50 Cent (@50cent)


	While Swift has not explained the meaning or inspiration behind the song “Ruin the Friendship,” fans have speculated that the track is about Jeffrey Lang, whom Swift has spoken about being close to while they went to Hendersonville High School. Lang died at age 21 in November 2010.

	“Yesterday, I sang at the funeral of one of my best friends,” she said at the 2010 BMI Country Music Awards shortly after his death. “And he was 21, and I used to play my songs for him first. So I would like to thank Jeff Lang.”

	











	50 Cent isn't actually the only shout-out on the album, however. Elsewhere on the record, “Elizabeth Taylor” is titled after the glamorous Hollywood icon of the 1950s, Swift mentions Spanish soccer team Real Madrid on “Wi$h Li$t,” and the star seemingly dedicated an entire song to Charli XCX, titled “Actually Romantic.”

Here's a simple marketing tip from your old pals here at The A.V. Club: When planning an event that could—hypothetically!—go catastrophically wrong and fall completely apart, maybe avoid naming it things that lend itself to headlines centered on that outcome. Like, say you're Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and you've got this fun idea for a music festival celebrating movie music. Sure, you could call it “Future Ruins,” which sounds all grim and apocalyptic and looks good in your usual fonts. But then if you abruptly cancel the thing, well…

Anyway, Reznor and Ross abruptly announced today that they're canceling their Future Ruins music festival, which was originally scheduled for November 8 in Los Angeles. The announcement was pretty blunt in its self-assessment, stating, “The reality is, due to a number of logistical challenges and complications, we feel we cannot provide the experience that's defined what this event was always intended to be. Rather than compromise, we're choosing to re-think and re-evaluate.” Tickets for the one-day event, which was being put on by Live Nation, will be refunded.

The whole remit of Future Ruins was pretty clearly inspired by Reznor and Ross' own work in film composing, most recently expressed through their (decent, throwback-y) soundtrack for the upcoming Tron: Ares. In announcing the festival back in May, Reznor asserted a desire to make film and TV composers feel like rock stars, saying, “It's about giving people who are, literally, the best in the world at taking audiences on an emotional ride via music the opportunity to tell new stories in an interesting live setting.”

The announced lineup for the festival was pretty stacked in terms of talent, tapping well-known names like John Carpenter, Mark Mothersbaugh, Questlove, and Danny Elfman to perform (or at least show off their existing tunes?), along with folks like Stranger Things‘ Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein, Joker‘s Hildur Guðnadóttir, and Annihilation‘s Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow. (We'd list the whole slate but it is, uh, pretty moot at this point.) Marketing language around the festival suggested some sort of weird egalitarian structure with its bill, asserting there would be no headliner or hierarchies, and that the group would be a “stacked lineup of visionaries doing something you might not see again.” Or at all, as it turns out!

	At the AMC Orpheum 7 in New York's Upper East Side, Taylor Swift fans showed up in glittering sequin outfits and bright Eras Tour merch for an anticipated 3 p.m. screening of The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, a 90-minute feature Swift cooked up to go along with the album. Showing in theaters all weekend, the film special includes the premiere of the long-awaited “The Fate of Ophelia” video and behind-the-scenes footage, plus all the stories behind the songs on her 12th album.


	Instead of the usual movie ads, various promo photos from Showgirl popped up as some of her older songs played over them. As the feature began, Swift appeared on screen, telling fans that she was excited to bring people together to listen to the album.


“The Fate of Ophelia” video played first. It opens in a grand-looking hotel as the camera pans to a painting on the wall where Swift portrays Ophelia (in a white dress, similar to the version from German painter Friedrich Heyser's interpretation). Instead of drowning like Shakespeare's tragic character does, Swift gets up and reveals that it's a set. From there, she embodies a wide array of showgirls, going from Sixties girl groups to a Busby Berkeley-esque musical number. Joining Swift throughout the video are the dancers, backup singers, and the band from her epic Eras Tour. The video, which was written and directed by Swift, ends in a hotel with Swift as herself. She's rolled into a room on a dining cart (but not before catching a football) where she parties until the paparazzi show up outside the window. She escapes to the bathroom, where she re-creates the album cover in the tub.

	Following the video, Swift began sharing footage from the rehearsals and set of the video, letting us into her meticulous planning process. Early planning Zooms show her dissecting classic art movements and showgirl history she wanted to weave into the story. “Art history for pop fans,” she jokes. The biggest Easter egg for Swift? She personally baked a loaf of sourdough that makes it into one of the shots.

	Swift also shared the meanings behind each track on Showgirl before showing the lyric videos. The lyric videos were taken on the set of the music video and promo shoots for the album. Before “Elizabeth Taylor,” for example, she pointed out how much she wanted to highlight the parallels of their lives while dropping tidbits of the iconic actress' own lore (She noted Liz Taylor's love for Portofino and her violet eyes.) “Opalite,” meanwhile, was inspired by Swift and her mom's shared love for opals; opalite is the man-made version, much like the type of self-made happiness she sings about on the song.


	As she sat in a director's chair discussing each song, she remained coy about fiancé Travis Kelce and never said his name directly. Still, she nodded to the innuendos on the horny and explicit “Wood,” saying it was about “superstitions” with a sly smile. “Honey,” she revealed later, was one of the first songs written for the album, and a guiding light for Swift, Max Martin and Shellback. It was inspired by how “awesome” it feels to be called “honey” or “sweetheart” by someone who means it.


	Before “Father Figure,” Swift focused on her respect for George Michael, whose hit of the same name is interpolated in one line of the chorus. She points out how she had wanted to do something with the concept of a “father figure” and used it to talk about power between a mentor and mentee. She says she could connect with both sides of the story in the song.


	The audience snickered when “Actually Romantic” popped up, but Swift's explanation was as neutral as could be. Without saying who it's about, Swift noted that it referenced someone letting her live “rent-free” in their head for years before Swift even knew it was happening. “In my industry, attention is affection,” she says to her anonymous foe, “and you give me so much of it, so thank you.”

	When it was time for “The Life of a Showgirl,” Swift celebrated her friend Sabrina Carpenter, who appears on the track. The song is from the perspective of a young girl going to see a star named Kitty. When the fan and Kitty meet, Kitty tells her to avoid pursuing this career. Swift says many of her heroes told her the same thing when she was younger. In Carpenter, Swift saw someone who was “really well-equipped for this career” and could handle all the drama and criticism thrown at her.

	The album's opener, “The Fate of Ophelia,” gets the final explainer before the video played for a second time. It most reflects her writing process; she revealed she has an exceptionally long file full of lyric ideas, concepts, words and more that she refers to often. She said that if you scrolled through it, it would take “20 minutes” to get through. She'd written the title a while back and then re-discovered it as Shellback played the song's riff. Quickly, she realized how well it matched.

	











	Once the video ended, fans clapped and left the theater. Luckily, for those who are eagerly awaiting the visuals for “The Fate of Ophelia,” the video will begin streaming everywhere on Sunday. Fans can hit their local movie theater to see it this weekend and get the full theatrical experience Swift intended.

Taylor Swift's preface of her new theatrical release — “The Fate of Ophelia” music video followed by lyric videos to each of her already record-breaking The Life of a Showgirl's 12 songs interspersed with  brief descriptions of her inspiration behind each song and brainstorming behind the music video — welcomes viewers to her next era, which she hopes will surprise them.


	For an intense fandom that received first news of a somewhat unexpected new album so close to the end of a behemoth concert tour followed by the singer's engagement to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, conjuring surprises might become increasingly hard to do. But with the timing of The Life of a Showgirl release, it doesn't seem like Swift has any plans to stop soon. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	While news of the movie was made official only two weeks ago, the film is headed for a $15-$16M Friday with a total opening-weekend forecast of $29M-$31M. Knowing Swift wrote and made this album with frequent former collaborators Max Martin and Shellback in between flights back and forth to Sweden from her Eras tour concerts subtly underscores her summarizing the impetus for each song with the collected hindsight she projects.

	The companion film to an album meditating on the theme of all the hard work that goes into being a performer at Swift's level rightfully throws the viewer into her headspace while she conceptualizes how best to translate the first taste of her new album into a visual work. Swift wrote and directed the music video for “The Fate Of Ophelia” as well as the lyric videos for the 12 songs, and it is our understanding that the entire cinematic experience directing credit is hers.

	











Taylor Swift: The Release Party of a Showgirl makes sense as a successor to Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour because the former does the opposite of the latter in showing Swift behind the scenes of the production process. Longtime fans have seen her in this creative mode before, particularly while making the music video for “ME!,” glimpsed in the 2020 Netflix documentary about Swift, Miss Americana (albeit Showgirl Swift has much more confidence to accompany her competitive streak.)


	Any seasoned Swiftie would come out of the hour-plus movie calling it on par with the typical consumption of a new album — lyric analysis, close-reading and a music video for the first single. The added insights from Swift provide a little something extra, but she's done this kind of inspiration explanation before all the way back to the three voice memos displaying how certain songs started out on her 1989 album. The film is still accessible to a regular movie-goer, though the viewing experience may not prove as rich for one not well-versed in Swift's lore and universe of Easter eggs that she is constantly expanding.

	For fans of the singer, though, there is plenty of new material to analyze, details to spot and connections to make between song themes, lyrics, costumes and the production design of the music video. A specific scene that comes to mind is Swift wrapped in ropes behind a stage with pullies that correspond to initials for each track on The Life of a Showgirl, prompting one to wonder what she has in store for the rest of the album's rollout. Getting to see the singer trace the colorful and sparkly visuals back to themes in her Hamlet-inspired song like drowning, showcases just how much thought she puts into her work.


	A highlight of the mosaic mix of Swift's production process and finished products is the inclusion of all of her Eras Tour dancers from Kameron Saunders to now-Dancing with the Stars partner Jan Ravnik. The athletic celebrities in their own righ show up in the music video and get to help Swift bring her vision to life. The carryover of those behind the scenes of the biggest stage in Swift's career — the Eras Tour — ties in nicely with the idea that The Life of a Showgirl's inspiration was largely the tour itself and the joyful — albeit rigorous, to say the least — time Swift spent performing three-plus hour shows featuring most of her albums that had come out by that time. The songstress' decision to feature other former key collaborators including cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and choreographer Mandy Moore further cements her roster of teammates that she returns to for her art-making processes.


	From the inclusion of Steadicam operator Colin Anderson and assistant director Anthony Dimino to production designer Ethan Tobman, Swift makes sure to spotlight what it takes to put one of these seemingly simple ideas she has together. And she always is there at the helm, eagerly but measuredly sharing her thoughts and feedback in live time as she pursues the best take for different segments of the video.

	All 12 lyric videos also enable viewers to dive deeper into Swift's songwriting and clarify certain lyrics (for those who have already given the album a listen or three). The lyrics compete against the looping kaleidoscopic graphics behind from either “The Fate of Ophelia” music video or other promo shots of Swift for the album.

	











	The film is family-friendly, with the lyric videos playing for the clean versions of songs create amusement when compared with explicit versions. Swift's inspiration downloads before each lyric video don't outright answer specific questions many listeners might have about the fourth, seventh, ninth or 10th tracks.


	The format, while potentially overwhelming for one not used to the bombardment of striking visuals, punchy turns-of-phrase and the overall speed at which Swift's mind works, ties everything together by framing the “making-of” material with the finished music video, plunging even veteran fans into the organized chaos of Swift's creativity and providing two chances to take in and appreciate a loaded project that took at least three weeks to rehearse and shoot.


	Although it's run-of-the-mill for most Swifties, the ability of Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl position itself in the No. 1 box office standing for this weekend in two weeks with a very-low P&A campaign besides the album promo is remarkable.

	If the film hits home any one line from Swift's 12th album, it's probably, “You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe,” and with this small glimpse into what it took to bring the album to life, the average audience-goer likely will agree. And that's in regard to one of the more self-proclaimed “joyful” of Swift's albums.

The G-Unit rapper joins an elite club of musicians who have been name-checked by the pop star.

	Hannah Dailey



UPDATE: 50 Cent has more to say about his shout-out on Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl, posting a new Instagram message that reads: “I'm low key a swiftie over here … I like this album check it out !” He posted the caption alongside a meme of himself superimposed over the album cover with the message “wait i'm the only shout out on the whole album.”


PREVIOUSLY: 50 Cent is now in da club of musicians Taylor Swift has shouted out in her lyrics, and he couldn't be happier about it.

	











	After the pop star's The Life of a Showgirl album dropped on Friday (Oct. 3), the rapper celebrated the fact that Swift gave him a nod on “Ruin the Friendship” with a post on Instagram. Midway through the song, she sings, “And it was not an invitation/ But as the 50 Cеnt song played/ Should've kissed you anyway.”


	“@taylorswift s–t is popping right now,” Fiddy wrote, sharing the Life of a Showgirl cover art. “she shout me out, she don't shout you out. LOL.”




	“THIS IS FOR BIG TIMERS ONLY!” the G-Unit alum added. “I'm the only shout out on the whole album.”


	The post comes just hours after The Life of a Showgirl dropped, marking Swift's 12th studio album and the first she's released since 17-week Billboard 200-topper The Tortured Poets Department. As 50 Cent pointed out, he has joined an exclusive club by getting a shout-out from Swift; on Midnights‘ “Snow on the Beach,” she name-checked Janet Jackson, and The Tortured Poets Department‘s title track featured a glowing Charlie Puth endorsement, to name a few examples.


	In fact, Swift's penchant for singling out A-list artists dates back to her debut single. On 2006's “Tim McGraw,” she repeats in the chorus, “When you think Tim McGraw, I hope you think of me.”


	In other Showgirl news, 50 Cent isn't the only major hip-hop star who's loving the new album. On Friday, Nicki Minaj shared a number of posts on X praising the LP, gushing, “The writing is always so intentional & always resonates with the AUTHENTIC lone wolves.”


	Added the Queen of Rap, “GO IN FOR THE KILL, TAYLOR.”

Exclusive: Justin Tipping breaks down HIM's explosive, ambiguous ending


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


HIM director Justin Tipping says he knows he won't "necessarily satisfy everyone's ultimate, total wish" with the new horror movie's "wild" ending, but he can't imagine it wrapping up any other way.

Starring Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox, and Marlon Wayans, the film follows up-and-coming football star Cameron Cade, whose dreams of getting drafted into the NFL are dashed when he's randomly attacked just a few days before the league's scouting combine. His luck changes when he's invited to train at the remote compound of his idol, San Antonio Saviors quarterback Isaiah White – as Isaiah promises to present Cam as his future successor if he impresses. Not long after he arrives, though, Isaiah's insecurities threaten to turn the dream deal into a nightmare...

Major spoilers for the rest of HIM below! Proceed with caution if you've yet to see it and don't want to know anything that happens.

 




In the movie's final act, Isaiah kinda, sorta reveals to Cam that all those blood transfusions he's been doing during their time together are actually part of an age-old ritual, helping pass on the athleticism of history's football legends to the present-day "G.O.A.T". If Cam wants to take Isaiah's place and receive such gifts, he'll have to fight him to the death, which leads to a bloody battle between the two quarterbacks.

Cam winds up being the one to walk away from the brawl, having beaten Isaiah to death with a helmet. But he quickly learns he's not safe yet, when he exits the room with Isaiah's body and finds himself on a football field. There, Elsie, Isaiah's wife, his manager Tom, and the owners of the Saviors urge him to sign a contract and become the next G.O.A.T. officially, but Cam refuses and murders everyone but Tom. Tom can then be seen being dragged by an unseen force into a pentagram on the ground, before the camera cuts to Cam and you see Tom explode in the background.

From all the occult imagery, it's clear something demonic is going on, but HIM never explicitly spells out anything. "It's a fine, fine line to toe," Tipping – who co-wrote the film with Skip Bronkie and Zack Akers – tells GamesRadar+. "There were so many conversations, between the studio, [Jordan Peele's production company] Monkeypaw, and myself; I have about 300 different edits of that final scene. 'How much is too much? What's the right amount of explanation?' I don't think you'll necessarily satisfy everyone's ultimate, total wish because it's just so wild. But that was also kind of the point.

"Too many seconds on Julia, it went beyond camp. It's no longer Almodovar, it's becoming a parody in a way that's not in-step with the rest that came before. You have too many of Tim Heidecker's improvisational jokes, it goes too far one way. So it was all about trying to keep it in perspective, I guess," he adds. "The artifice was just made aware, and in a way, it's the same thing that we're kind of doing throughout with the humor, which is always having the balance. Hopefully the send-off matches the absurdity of the game we were examining in the first place."

Let's put on our tinfoil-covered Blue Jays caps and have a run through some of the most enduring conspiracy theories from the baseball team's history.

Let's put on our tinfoil-covered Blue Jays caps and have a run through some of the most enduring conspiracy theories from the baseball team's history.

A diplomatic incident was barely avoided in 1992 when a U.S. Marines colour guard paraded the Canadian flag upside down before Game 2 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Atlanta Braves.

Every long-time Blue Jays fan has experienced some hurt or heartbreak over something questionable that has happened to this team, and it's likely only a matter of time before something controversial happens in this playoff run that will have fans scratching their heads and asking some pointed questions.

So, before that happens, let's put on our tinfoil-covered Blue Jays caps and have a run through some of the most famous and enduring conspiracy theories from this team's history:

In 2011, the Jays were accused of sign stealing in an ESPN report, which stated visiting players were enraged when “they caught sight of a man dressed in white about 25 yards to their right, out among the blue center-field seats. And while the players watched, the man in white seemingly signalled the pitches the visiting pitcher was throwing against the Jays, according to four sources in the bullpen that day.”

There was a lot of talk about it at the time, but the Jays denied it, MLB said they never received an official complaint from other teams and some commentators simply dismissed it as a hoax.

This long-time fan with amazing seats right behind home plate at the Rogers Centre has inspired fake accounts on X and went viral for not flinching when a ball was hit back toward her and then making fun of her nonreaction later. She is a Jays fan legend. There were all kinds of speculation that she was Ted Roger's wife or the woman who named the SkyDome and that she had some connection to the team. In fact, the CBC reported that she was just a long-time season ticket holder, who didn't have any connection to the team, other than being a fan beloved by other fans.

As well, she wasn't in her seats at the beginning of this season, which led to media outlets inquiring about her whereabouts. She was reportedly missing this season due to some health issues. Here's hoping she's enjoying this playoff run in good health in a big comfy chair at home.

In important games there will almost always be close calls and Jays fans would love to strike out some umpires they believe have it in for the team. Of course, this is something every fan base has said at one time or another.

There are also certain umpires who have reputations throughout the league, with the most famous likely being Angel Hernandez. He was hated by many throughout the league for his questionable calls, including by Jays fans, but he retired in May 2024.

Laz Díaz is a current umpire raising the fans' ire with a recent questionable interference call versus the Tampa Bay Rays a few weeks ago. As well, during the Jays' most recent series against the Red Sox, George Springer hit a ball that was called foul that many fans thought was fair, which led Jays manager John Schneider to try to tamp down on the Jays vs. the Ump rhetoric.

“We're not losing because of umpires. We're losing because we're not scoring enough runs,” said Schneider after the game. “I don't want to feed into the narrative that the umpires are screwing us because they're not. We're not scoring enough runs.”

Being the only team outside of the U.S. has long led to the entire country of Jays fans to have a chip on their shoulders, and anything that makes it seems like the Jays aren't being treated fairly will lead to fans making this claim.

One of the most notorious incidents that fueled this conspiracy happened way back in 1992, when in Game 2 of the World Series U.S. Military personnel flew the Canadian flag upside-down during the pre-game ceremonies, which caused all sorts of outrage here.

Much more recently, there was a fake Truth Social post from U.S. President Donald Trump that also fed into these fears, saying “WE WILL BE INVESTIGATING THE UN AMERICAN BLUE JAYS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO STEAL OUR BELOVED WORLD SERIES. THEY WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.”

The White House confirmed to The Canadian Press that Trump has not posted anything about the Blue Jays.

Whatever you believe, the Jays have won the World Series twice already, which wholly disproves the theory MLB doesn't want Toronto to come out on top. But we will for sure hear that from fans if something controversial happens this series.

The team behind the show's creepiest creatures spill their secrets

What do Xenomorph eggs feel like? According to the special effects experts who designed them for Alien: Earth, the answer is warm and sticky. Second Skin Studio worked directly with Wētā Workshop and the show's creators to bring their concepts for various extraterrestrial creatures to life. In the case of the franchise's iconic Facehugger capsules, this meant slathering the shells with vegetable glycerin. Second Skin founder Sarawut “Tor" Sakthamcharoen tells Polygon it gave the eggs a “wet, organic look.”

Sakthamcharoen and his colleague Sarinnaree “Honey” Khamaiumcharean worked on many of the monstrous beings in Alien: Earth, including a monstrous ticks, face-melting flies, and, and of course, fan-favorite specimen t. ocellus (often referred to as “the eyeball alien,” or “Eye Midge” by the show's cast and crew). To learn even more about these terrifying specimens, Polygon caught up with Sakthamcharoen and Khamaiumcharean via email to learn more about their work on Alien: Earth, their theory for one of the show's biggest changes from the movie, and their plans for a potential season 2.

Polygon: I know you guys worked on the tick, the tentacled eyeballs, the flies' nest, the Xenomorph eggs, and the Xenomorph embryo. Did you work on any additional creatures for Alien: Earth? What was the design process like?

Sarawut "Tor" Sakthamcharoen: Actually, the creatures you mentioned, like the tick, the tentacled eyeballs, the flies' nest, the Xenomorph eggs, and the embryo, we built in many more variations than what you see on screen — different sizes and forms for different shots. Beyond that, we also created support creatures and props, such as a sheep stunt for the collapse and death scene [in episode 8], and a Xenomorph foam prop inside a bag for the moment when Morrow sprays [a substance] to catch the Xeno [in episode 2]. We also produced silicone dummies, a cat dummy with the Eye Midge, detailed hair work, and prosthetics for the Eye Midge sequence

Sarinnaree “Honey” Khamaiumcharean: The Second Skin team also supported the VFX department by creating a green chestburster. This was used on set to help the actors react more naturally and later became a reference element for the VFX team to build upon.

The ticks are particularly terrifying in Episode 5, but we only get to see some of their lifecycle. Do you have any ideas for how that could continue if there's a second season of the show?

Tor: I'm not entirely sure — that would really depend on the director's vision. But one thing's for certain: You still haven't seen how they build their nests.

Tell me more about designing the Xenomorph embryo. How did you decide what it would look like?

Tor: Actually, the initial design came from Wētā [Workshop] as a 2D sketch. The first time we saw it, we thought it looked really cool. But since it needed to be practical, we had to take that concept and rework it, sculpting a new 3D model and then 3D-printing over 10 different sizes for the director to choose from. Once the scale was approved, we moved on to molding and casting it in a way that looked like translucent jelly. That way, when it's underwater, you can clearly see the skeletal form of the Xeno embryo inside.

Honey: Yes, the embryo design originated from Wētā Workshop. Our Second Skin team took their sketches and brought them into the practical world, making sure the design could function on set and be seamlessly integrated with the VFX work.

In the original 1979 Alien film, the Xenomorph eggs have water on them that appears to be dripping upwards (rather than trickling downwards). The Xenomorph eggs in Alien: Earth don't seem to have this feature. Was there a reason you left it out?

Tor: That's something we never actually discussed with the director [Noah Hawley]. But from what I understand, in the original 1979 Alien, Ridley Scott used a clever camera trick — shooting upside down so that water droplets falling under gravity looked like they were dripping upwards — to make the eggs feel unsettling and alien. The props were also coated with vegetable glycerin to give them a wet, organic look. In Alien: Earth, since the setting is on Earth rather than an alien planet, it's possible that the decision was to keep the eggs more grounded in our gravity. But that's just my guess.

Honey: We tried many approaches to echo the original 1979 Alien, but we also had to adapt some details to fit the world of Alien: Earth. In some cases, we added new elements, and in others, we adjusted features so they matched the story and tone of this series.

I've heard the “eyeball alien” referred to as “Species 64” or “t. ocellus.” But word on the street is that you guys refer to it as “Eye Midge.” Where did that nickname come from?

Tor: Honestly, we don't really know where that nickname first came from, since we never asked about its origin. The first time we heard “Eye Midge” was actually from Jeff Okun (VFX) and also from the Wētā design team.

Honey: We're not exactly sure where the name first came from. But I believe it became a practical nickname so that our multinational crew could easily understand and communicate the physical traits of the creature.

What was the biggest challenge you faced while working on the creatures for the show? How did you get past them?

Tor: I'd say the biggest challenge was definitely building the Xenomorph eggs and handling the dissecting sequences. It was something we had never done before, so there was a lot of trial and error along the way. We really have to thank our team — they pushed through with so much patience and dedication, and that's what made it possible in the end.

Honey: For me, the biggest challenge was designing and building the Xenomorph eggs. The Second Skin team had to make multiple versions — soft, hard, ones that could open, even animatronic and manual versions. We also developed the internal layers of the eggs in a way that, I believe, audiences have never seen in any Alien film before. On top of that, keeping the eggs intact in Thailand's hot climate was a real test for us.

Which non-Xenomorph creature is your favorite?

Tor: I really like the fly. Its size makes it kind of cute — big and chunky, almost like a giant beetle. It's got a trunk like an elephant and eyes like a spider, which makes it both strange and endearing at the same time.

Honey: Definitely the Eye Midge. It's one of the cleverest creatures in the series. Even though there was a lot of VFX involved, the practical version we built looked both absolutely cute and absolutely weird at the same time.

Which creature scene from this season of Alien: Earth is your favorite?

Tor: My favorite has to be the Eye Midge with Shmuel. That scene was so exciting, and from my side it was a special blend of creature and prosthetic work — something we're really proud of.

Honey: My favorite scene was the fly spitting acid saliva onto Issac. Since Issac is a synthetic body built to be extremely strong, watching how it reacts to the acid really shows both the creature's biology and its terrifying force.

What was the development process like for creating new alien creatures in Alien: Earth with such a big, international team? Was there a lot of back and forth with the show's creators?

Honey: From my side, the process was very collaborative. The initial creature concepts came from the director and Wētā Workshop, but once they reached us, it was our responsibility to translate those designs into practical builds that could actually work on set. That meant testing materials, creating prototypes, and finding ways to combine prosthetics with VFX. There was a lot of back and forth with both the director and the VFX Supervisor — we would show tests, adjust based on feedback, and refine until everyone felt the creature was both believable and film-ready. The challenge and joy was turning a 2D concept into something physical that actors could interact with and the camera could capture.

Were there any concepts for alien creatures you came up with that didn't make it into Alien: Earth season 1 that you'd want to pursue in future seasons?

Tor: Yes, there were definitely some concepts we worked on that didn't make it into season 1.

Honey: Yes, we had a few concepts that didn't make it into season 1. Hopefully, if there is a season 2, we might get the chance to bring them alive, maybe even something more terrifying, something that will leave fans completely jaw-dropped. We honestly can't wait.

Chris McKinnell was mentored in his paranormal work by his grandparents, Ed and Lorraine Warren

 Ed and Lorraine Warren's grandson is opening up about his family's paranormal work and legacy.


 Chris McKinnell, son of the Warren's daughter, Judy Spera, appeared on the Reel Appreciation podcast, where he spoke with hosts Maria Elizabeth Darnell and David Clair-Bennett about his experiences working in the paranormal space with his grandparents.


 Asked if one particular incident sticks out to him most, McKinnell explained, "Everything that I saw with them was extraordinary. I mean, not always evil, not always dangerous... but the first thing that comes to mind was a case I worked on with them. That would be because my grandfather almost died."

 "We were working on the possession of a man named Maurice Theriault, better known as Frenchie in The Nun series," McKinnell recalled, pausing to note that the films are "absolute fantasies."


 Recalling the work, he continued, "During the exorcism, I was protecting the bishop who was doing the exorcism. My grandfather was 10 feet away from me with my grandmother, complaining he didn't feel well."


 "And my grandmother looked at him and said, 'Hey Ed, why don't you have a banana? You're probably low on potassium.'"


 However, in reality, McKinnell says his grandfather "was having a heart attack during the exorcism."


 Although his grandmother claimed to have been a clairvoyant and a light trance medium, McKinnell noted that "she couldn't see" her husband's health crisis. McKinnell says the experience left a lasting impression.


 "That's why I don't trust psychics — and I'm a psychic — but I don't trust anybody without evidence," he added. "My grandmother taught me the best psychic in the world is only right 60% of the time. That's a terrible average to bet your life on."


 McKinnell was also asked about how he balances his work in the paranormal, which he shares on his The Warren Files channels, while also honoring his family's legacy in the space. He admitted that it can be "a difficult line to walk."


 "I love my grandparents. I respect my grandparents. They were wonderful mentors, but I learned a lot both to do and not to do," he said. "I guess I feel very uncomfortable with being respected because I have grandparents."


 "Yes, I worked with my grandparents. Yes, I learned from them. That has a lot to do with me, but the fact that they were my grandparents shouldn't put me on — put me up above anybody at all," he added. "That's just silly to me."


 The Warren family name is legendary in the paranormal world, as their cases inspired horror hits like Annabelle and The Conjuring films. The two paranormal investigators founded the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR) in the '50s and worked on over 10,000 cases together, writing several books about their findings and experiences.


 Ed died in 2006 and Lorraine died 13 years later.

When Brian Snitker revealed that he was retiring as the Atlanta Braves manager, it sent a shockwave through the organization and their fans. While not completely unexpected, the idea of having a new manager wasn't something that had been entertained seriously until this point and it changed the complexion of the start of the offseason completely. However, there were also some that openly wondered if Snitker's decision was really in his hands.

Yes, Snitker's long tenure and high levels of success understandably got him a long leash (as it should have) and much of what hurt the Braves in 2025 was outside his control, but there were some folks towards the end of the season that said that Atlanta needed a new voice at the top. There was a world where Snitker would have wanted to come back, but the Braves pushed him into his new advisory role  in order to turn the page without embarrassing their long-time coach.

Thankfully, that isn't what happened. During his end-of-season media session on Saturday, Braves front office head Alex Anthopoulos said, without equivocation, that it was Snitker's choice to call it quits. Had he wanted to continue, Atlanta would have welcomed him back with open arms.

Anthopoulos is doing his end-of-season media session. He says if Snitker wanted to continue managing, he would have been given the opportunity.

Given the tone of Snitker's retirement announcement, this makes a lot of sense. Anthopoulos went out of his way before Snitker made his decision to not lobby one way or another and give Snit the space he needed. He also spoke at length about how important his relationship with Snitker was to him and credited Snit as the reason why he got a World Series ring.

With that relationship in mind, the idea that Anthopoulos would try to force Snitker out was always farfetched. The optics of forcing Snitker out would have been terrible and it is a mortal lock that it would have gotten out somehow. Given how much Snitker has meant to the organization for so long, he earned the right to go out on his own terms.

As for next steps, it does not sound like replacing Snitker is particularly imminent. Snitker moving into an advisory role was expected given the terms of his final extension with the team, but it does feel like there is a wide open field that the Braves are considering. Hopefully they don't wait too long so that Atlanta can go into the offseason with a new manager to sell prospective free agent targets on.

Spirits are at the heart of Buzzard's Roost Distillery, and it goes well beyond the whiskey behind the bar.  

Many staff members believe a few highly active ghosts haunt the distillery at 624 W. Main St. in Louisville.

This spooky season, the distillery and the nearby Hereafter Speakeasy, 119 S. Seventh St., are inviting bourbon fans and the paranormal curious to a two-hour, $70 experience geared at tapping into both kinds of spirits. The experience invites guests to sample bourbon at Buzzard's Roost and a cocktail at Hereafter. All the while, guests learn the lore of the buildings and even attempt to communicate with the spirits that haunt them.

At one point, Buzzard Roost's resident basement ghost “Gandano” may even select which bourbon is tried next.

I attended the inaugural tour on Sept. 26, and after an evening of fine bourbon and trying to engage with ghosts — I'm not necessarily convinced I personally connected to the spirit world. 

What I can tell you, though, is that some very curious things have happened on the 600 block of W. Main Street in downtown Louisville.

And whether or not you're a believer, this new unique mix of bourbon and the paranormal is hauntingly entertaining.

The partnership between the bar and the distillery was a natural one, Laura Coomes, Buzzard's Roost's vice president of marketing, told me. Ryan Svab, who co-owns Hereafter, also bartends at Buzzard's Roost. When the distillery teamed up with Fen Alankus of Feralore and her paranormal investigative team for a two-night investigation, it made sense to do one at Hereafter, as well.  

Two centuries ago, the 600 block of W. Main Street was Louisville's hub for commerce. Local lore says the upstairs mezzanine at Hereafter was once a Civil War map room. In the late 1800s, three major fires happened on the block, and the last one burned all the way through what's now Buzzard Roost. Five firefighters died that day, and Alankus' team believes they've connected with two of them, “Captain Edward” and “John.” A couple of years after the fire, a tornado blew through and took out the north side of the street. More than 100 people died in the storm.

That kind of history and devastation can be fertile ground for paranormal investigations.

“There's certain parts of the building where you just feel like you're not alone,” Coomes told me ahead of the tour. “And we feel like, we're guests in the building. They're definitely not out to hurt us. I think they're glad that we're here.”

As Coomes, Svab and Alankus carved out this experience, they knew they wanted to do more than tell ghost stories. They wanted to give their guests a chance to interact with the ghosts and decide for themselves whether they believed anything supernatural was there.  

“There's no guarantees of what you're going to see and experience, because we think it's going to be different every single time,” Coomes told me. “Even though we've planned it out, every person is going to have a different type of time."

The inaugural tour was an experiment of sorts, and while the paranormal team and the business owners have a formula for the experience — much of the activity depends on the engagement of the guests and the ghosts.

The first tour was relatively intimate. Beyond me, only two couples from Pennsylvania, who knew each other, had signed up for it. One was a skeptic. Another said she often speaks to a spirit she believes is in the office where she works.

The other three of us fell somewhere in the middle.

We started the tour in the still room where Buzzard's Roost brand ambassador Jimmy James Hamblin offered us a pour of whiskey, while Alankus and Coomes talked us through the building's history. Over the years, it has been a hat store, a dry goods store, a stationery company and most recently, an ad agency.

Since Buzzard's Roost opened in 2023, the staff has experienced unexplained broken glasses, books falling off the shelf and many elevator and electronic glitches. Once, during a farewell party for a beloved employee, guests watched a tiramisu flip over all on its own. Coomes has seen unexplained orbs fluttering in upstairs offices on the security cameras. Bartenders hear footsteps when they're alone, only to discover no one is there.

Hamblin doesn't believe in ghosts, but he also doesn't have an explanation for the books he's seen fall around him.

From the still room, we headed to the speakeasy in the basement. There, the paranormal investigators played us a recording of an unexplained noise they captured in this room during their investigation. In the middle of hours worth of silence, the recorder picked up what could be a muffled man's voice saying “dimes.”

Then Alankus introduced us to “Gandano,” who had previously told her this nickname using a Ouija board.

She held up a pendulum from which she showed our group how to use it to channel answers from beyond. In this case, if it swung in a circle, it meant the ghost said “yes.” If it moved side to side, she believed Gandano, was saying “no.”

In theory, you could use these yes or no questions to learn about his life and preferences. Or, you could use it to choose what type of Buzzard's Roost bourbon we should drink.

“Are you cool with choosing the whiskey that we're going to try first,” Alankus asked him. “Go on Gandano, tell us.”

The pendulum swung in a small circle near Buzzard's Roost's smoked barrel rye whiskey, which has previously won a double gold medal at the San Francisco World Spirits competition. Hamblin served the blended three-year-old rye finished in toasted barrel, which had a smooth, almost vanilla taste.

As we sipped on that, Alankus showed us a pair of divining rods. Like the pendulum, Alankus explained that the position of these L-shaped rods could be used to answer yes or no questions. After a short test, we learned that when the rods swung apart, Gandano was saying “no” and if they crossed, it meant “yes.” 

And this is where the real fun began.

So much so, eventually Hamblin ended up choosing the second and third pours of whiskey for us, instead of Gandano. Our little group was having too much fun trying to learn about the spirit to give him another shot at selecting a bourbon.

“Gandano are you Italian,” one woman asked, and the rods positioned themselves into a “no.” 

“Gandano are you an orphan,” Coomes asked.

“Yes.”  

“Gandano were you the voice on the recorder?” Hamblin asked.

“No.”

“Gandano are you alone?”

“No.”

This kind of banter went on for about 25 minutes, until finally it was time to head around the corner to Hereafter.

“I would like to know if Gandano enjoyed himself this evening,” Hamblin asked, playfully.

“Yes.”

I sighed and smiled in relief. Whether or not we were speaking to the dead ― at very least we hadn't ticked this supposed spirit off.

Around the corner at Hereafter, we wound through the downstairs concert venue and then to the upstairs bar. The paranormal team had set out stacks of tarot cards. Each card had a corresponding cocktail that went with it, which left the final drink of the night in fate's hands.

I pulled the Lover card, and the bartenders mixed up Manhattan-like libation for me, as we settled into the second and final stop of the tour.

Hereafter is one of the most active spaces Alankus has ever investigated. Co-owner Svab and some of her staff believe they've seen a male apparition in a dark work suit roaming the building. Several workers have also described seeing a few 20-something, red haired men with a mischievous vibe. Those boys, in theory, enjoy turning lights on and off and knocking things off the wall.

“There's lots of creepy weird things there, but not scary things,” Svab told me. 

Just last week, one of the bathrooms locked itself from the inside for hours. They worried someone might be in trouble inside, and then when the staff finally got the door open — no one was there.

“To generate that kind of energy as an entity as far as we understand it, takes a lot,” Alankus said.

As we sipped our fortune cocktails, the team passed around a collection of sensors designed to detect electro-magnetic energy or unexplained changes in temperatures.

They encouraged us to wander the bar and music venue to see if any of the decor might seem sensitive. Svab keeps a “cabinet of curiosities” filled with creepy dolls and bizarre antiques in the downstairs bar, and she said many of the objects seem to have a supernatural charge to them. She has several bubble portraits from the 1800s decorating the walls that her staff suspects might have a spirit connected to them.

But really, most of the supernatural activity at Hereafter occurs when the building is quiet and only one or two people are there. As I took the sensor around, I wondered if the full music venue below, the busy bar and our curious, increasingly intoxicated group, might be too much for the spirits to show themselves. We only had a few minutes on the tour left, and the lights on my sensor wouldn't budge.

Then, for whatever reason, as I talked with the believer in the group about her daughter, Julia, the sensor showed a moderate presence. Every time one of us said the girl's name, the lights flickered.

So then the woman tried calling out to other significant names in her life.

“Catherine," she said, pausing. "Sissy? Agnes?”

No luck.

I was just about to put my sensor down and call it a night when conversation in the group turned back to those red-headed, mischievous, 20-somethings.

“If I'm in the spirit world,” someone mused. “And I'm observing, and I'm watching what's going around, what would be my motivation to throw a picture or to mess with people?"

Right as she said “mess with people” every light on my sensor went off, as though that was the answer.  

Those boys must have a sense of humor.

And candidly, that was enough to convince me it was time to call it a night and explore the spirits downtairs behind the bar ... rather than tempt these red heads into "messing" with me from the afterlife.

For years it has been the subject of a hypothetical online meme with countless spoof images depicting the ironic situation occurring in which a psychic medium event is cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances". Now, however, the gag appears to have become a reality after a pub in Northumberland was unfortunately forced to reschedule their upcoming event.

Newcastle resident Peter Larsen, spotted an Instagram post by the Snowy Owl pub in Cramlington and couldn't resist poking fun at it online. "It's happened!" he wrote in delight on X alongside a screenshot of the pub's message, which indeed read: "Due to unforeseen circumstances."

The Snowy Owl elaborated in between crystal ball emojis: "Sorry for any inconvenience caused we are having to rearrange our stand up physic [sic] night from Monday 6th October. It will now be taken place on Monday 3rd November at 6:30pm." The pub also provided its phone number for enquiries.

One X user joked in response: "They probably should have seen that coming."

A second person added: "I'm surprised they didn't see it coming, does the psychic powers only work sometimes during the day?"

A third quipped: "The jokes write themselves!"

While a fourth X user laughed: "Worst psychic ever!"

The pub, which has almost 1,000 Instagram followers, also saw a similar response directly, with one person agreeing: "Mustn't be a very good psychic then."

The Snowy Owl boasts on its website: "Nestled on the edge of Northumberlandia, The Snowy Owl rests on the site of Plessy North Moor farm. Originally owned by the Ridley family of Blagdon Hall, the building was named The Plessy Farm and has been rebuilt and restored at least three times since its original construction in 1600.

"Our menus are full of hearty favourites and country pub classics, as well as our seasonal dishes, and we'll be ready with a well-stocked bar, including cask ales, fine wines and British gin to suit very taste - which will taste all the better when enjoyed either in our beautiful gardens or by our crackling log fires."

In December, meanwhile, another scheduled psychic evening had to be cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances" - as ticketholders fumed the clairvoyant should have "seen that coming".

At the time, customers were eagerly looking forward to the event at the Novar Arms in Dingwall, Scotland, which first announced it would be hosting a psychic night three months earlier. The pub had organised the event in partnership with Second Sight, a company that provides "authentic psychics specialising in floor shows and readings''.

However, the venue announced in a post on Facebook that the event would be postponed until January. It read: "Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances, Second Sight have had to postpone the Psychic Night. They are planning on rescheduling the night in January - tickets can be refunded in the bar or carried over to the new dates once the arrangements have been made."

HUNDREDS of sailors stood mesmerised as they gazed up at what they claim was a 40ft-wide "UFO orb" hovering above a US Navy aircraft carrier.

A "glowing orange ball" spotted over the flight deck of the nuclear-powered USS Ronald Reagan has gone down as one of the most mysterious sightings in US military history.

And it's never been explained. 

Documentary filmmaker Dave C. Beaty - who produced 2019 film The Nimitz Encounters about another famous Navy UFO case - has been probing the mystery for years.

Beaty has interviewed a number of sailors who, to this day, insist that what they saw off the East Coast that night in early 2004 was a UFO.

Efforts to understand what took place have been hampered by the fact no official confirmation was ever given.

And one witness claimed senior officers acted suspiciously in the aftermath.

But Beaty told The Sun he believes there are more witnesses who can provide testimony - and believes their accounts are key to narrowing down when the event actually took place.

Seaman Patrick Gokey, who was serving on the ship that night, said the object "did not move in ways that I've seen other aircraft maneuver and it was faster than anything I've ever seen".

He estimated as many as 200 sailors saw it.

And former Navy quartermaster Karol Olesiak, who was on watch from 8pm to 12am and was responsible for the ship's logbook, also recalled the glowing orb.

He claimed it was about 40ft wide and hovered above the carrier for four hours from around 8pm onwards.

He described it as reminding him of Biblical descriptions of the "burning bush" and having "negative energy".

Olesiak alleged he was told not to log the encounter by the Officer of the Deck.

He told The Sun: "I asked, should I be logging this?

"I might have asked the conning officer and I don't remember exactly what he said, but the impression that I got was that this should not be in the official log."

He also said there was an eerie calm among senior officers and bridge crew - as if they had seen such phenomena before.

"The entire bridge team was pilots," he said. 

"My assumption is yes [they had seen something similar before], but I asked an officer if any of them were talking about it the next day and he said 'yes'."

Olesiak believes its "possible" someone may have taken photos and videos of the object - but the incident occurred before camera phones were common and crew did not carry their mobiles.

"It's hard to believe somebody would be sitting on it for this long," he said. 

I can still visualise this object in my head to a tee regardless of 18 years having passed. All I know is it was something I could not explain

Derek Smith, a former Boatswain's Mate Seaman, said he remembers the sighting "as if it occurred yesterday", calling it the "most mysterious thing" he has ever seen.

Smith, who was on starboard watch, said he noticed "all the people on the flight deck" looking up at the object.

He said the next day was simply "normal" - but his shipmates were discussing it, some dismissing the giant object as a "weather balloon" - to which he said "hell no".

"I [can] still visualise this object in my head to a tee regardless of 18 years having passed," Smith previously told The Sun.

"I do believe the government knows more than what they lead us to believe."

Smith stressed he was "an average Joe" with no paranormal experiences before or since.

He said: "All I know is it was something I could not explain. I could say now though I am starting to feel like I witnessed something special."

Derek's colleague claims she tried to report it to the bridge, but was told to "quit smoking crack".

And she also claims that while speaking to the ship's bridge, they said they were tracking the object on radar as it followed them doing "swoop" maneuvers. 

Some of the witness testimonies vary, offering different times of day and duration of the encounter - but all agree the orange fireball was spotted near the ship.

Beaty has spent years piecing together the timeline of the encounter - and believes "many more people" saw the mysterious event.

He told The Sun: "In my effort to understand the timeline I still have to go on some of the witnesses who arrived on the ship late in 2003 in the November and December timeline.

"It's interesting to begin narrowing it down. 

"The ship left Norfolk in May of 2004 with a partial crew to sail to its new home port in San Diego.

"The command summary report shows what the vessel was doing during those months - at port or out to sea.

"So there really are only a few times this event could have happened.

"With thousands of people on the ship - it's likely many more people had seen this event."

Beaty said the aftermath echoed other cases of UFO cases reported by US servicemen.

He explained: "In reading Robert Hastings' book on nukes, many of his reports from Air Force bases had a similar-looking UFO - a glowing orange ball or oval.

"In fact, one of his witnesses had a similar experience with all of these men seeing the UFO - and then seemingly have no interest in it moments later. Like it never happened. 

"I tried to contact that veteran but he had passed. But it's certainly a curious part of this case."

Now, Beaty is urging sailors to come forward with new information or clues - to finally crack the case. 

With UFOs a hot topic in Washington, Beaty admitted it would be "nice to have some answers" over what he saw on the Reagan - and believes the government "knows more than what they lead us to believe". 

But the Pentagon has been accused of not doing enough to probe unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) - the preferred term for UFOs.

Those who claim to have seen UAPs argue this is a national security concern that successive U.S. governments have failed to take seriously.

The Pentagon created the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office in 2022 to track UAPs.

757 cases from across the world were reported to US authorities between 1 May 2023 and 1 June 2024 - including 272 older sightings that had not previously been recorded.

Most reports occurred in airspace, with 49 at altitudes of at least 62 miles. 

Witnesses included commercial and military pilots as well as ground observers.

After reviewing the evidence, the Pentagon concluded in a report last November: “It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology.”

The report found hundreds of sightings were in fact misidentified balloons, birds, drones and satellites.

Elon Musk's Starlink satellite network was also often mistaken for UFOs. But not all sightings have been explained.

The Pentagon is still probing a report from commercial flight crew of a near-miss with a "cylindrical object" over the Atlantic Ocean off New York.

Intelligence chiefs have urged servicemen to come forward and said they hoped the stigma around reporting was now breaking down.

USS Ronald Reagan is a Nimitz-class, nuclear-powered supercarrier belonging to the US Navy.

The ninth ship of her class, she was acquired in 2003 and named in honour of Ronald Reagan, who served as US president from 1981 to 1989.

The 101,000-tonne, 1,092ft-long vessel is powered by two nuclear reactors.

Her maiden active deployment came in 2006, when she conducted naval operations during the Iraq invasion and the war in Afghanistan.

At the time of the UFO sighting, the ship had a crew of 5,680 sailors, an air wing of 2,480 and 80 warplanes.
