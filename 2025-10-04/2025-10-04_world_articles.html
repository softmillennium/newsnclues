                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthony Salisbury displayed chat about deployment of 82nd airborne division on cell phone while in Minnesota A senior White House official accidentally leaked details of plans to send an elite army unit to Portland, in the latest intelligence leak by the Trump administration. Anthony Salisbury, a top deputy to Stephen Miller, the influential White House policy adviser, was observed using Signal in a public place to discuss a plan to deploy the army's 82nd airborne division to Portland, the Democratic-run Oregon city which Donald Trump has repeatedly castigated as being “war-ravaged”. The Minnesota Star Tribune obtained images of Salisbury's Signal messages, which it said were sent while the official was “in clear view of others” in Minnesota. He wrote that Hegseth would prefer to send in the national guard due to potential backlash over using the army. “82nd is like our top tier [quick reaction force] for abroad. So it will cause a lot of headlines,” he added. The 82nd airborne division is an elite unit that specialises in parachute assaults and forcible entry operations. A recent commander was the last American soldier to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2021. On Sunday, Hegseth said 200 members of the national guard would be deployed “immediately”. On Wednesday, Trump claimed the national guard was “now in place”; however, NBC News affiliate KGW reported that the guard had not yet been deployed. Salisbury was appointed deputy homeland security adviser by Trump in January. “Nothing in these private conversations, that are shamefully being reported on by morally bankrupt reporters, is new or classified information.” In March, the editor in chief of the Atlantic was accidentally added to a Signal chat that was being used by senior Trump administration officials, including Hegseth and the vice-president, JD Vance, to discuss highly sensitive military strikes on Yemen. A month later it emerged that Hegseth had used a second Signal group chat to send detailed information about the strikes to his wife, his brother and about a dozen other people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: This is a developing story. Czechia's populist Ano (Yes) party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has won the Oct. 3-4 parliamentary elections with around 35% of the vote, according to preliminary results. Ano has not won an outright majority and will have to cooperate with other factions to form a governing coalition. Current election results indicate the party has earned 81 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, Prague's 200-member lower house of parliament. The Ano party is opposed to Ukraine's membership in the European Union and does not support aid to Ukraine. The party will have the first opportunity to form a new coalition government and is expected to partner with populist, right-wing, and anti-NATO factions. Billionaire oligarch Babis, who previously served as prime minister from 2017-2021, surged in popularity due to concerns over the economy and criticisms of the current government, led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. Prague has supplied tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and helicopters in military aid packages and hosted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees. Most significantly, Czechia in 2024 launched its ammunition initiative to provide Ukraine with urgently needed artillery shells during a severe front-line shortage. Babis has also expressed sympathy for other European nationalist leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister and Kremlin ally Viktor Orban, and claimed Ukraine's membership in the EU would be a "complete catastrophe." Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent. She is a freelance writer, editor, and playwright with an MFA from Boston University. Abbey served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ukraine from 2008-2011. The populist Ano party is opposed to Ukraine's membership in the European Union and does not support aid to Ukraine. Sergiy Kyslytsia warned that Europe needs to "get serious" about the existential threat posed by Russia. After crossing the Oskil River, Russian forces have begun infiltrating Ukrainian lines in small assault groups, while the battlefield becomes increasingly dominated by swarming drones. Over the decades, Oleksa Shalayskyi became one of Ukraine's leading investigative journalists and is described by his colleagues as a pioneer of anti-corruption investigations. Russia launched 109 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as three Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles, the Air Force reported. Drones struck the Kirishi oil refinery in Russia's Leningrad oblast overnight on Oct. 4, sparking a fire that was later extinguished, officials and local media reported. "Today, all the rescued children are safe in Ukraine-controlled territory," Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, said. Authorities at Munich International Airport ordered a suspension in flight operations shortly after 9:30 p.m. local time after multiple drones were spotted in the vicinity of the airport for the second time in less than 24 hours.</p>

We are living through the most dangerous time in over a half-century when it comes to nuclear weapons and the prospect of them being used during an armed conflict. Rulers like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, who lead the two nations with around 87 percent of the world's nuclear inventory, are ratcheting up global tensions. A nuclear-armed Israel is regularly attacking Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Yemen. India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed nations, were recently in armed conflict over Kashmir and are constantly at odds. China is rapidly militarizing and bolstering its nuclear stockpile. At the same time, there is hope and resistance to a nuclear-armed world. Survivors of nuclear attacks, nuclear testing, and uranium mining — from Japan to Kazakhstan, from Marshall Islands to the U.S. Southwest — continue to boldly speak out and demand reparations and nuclear abolition. Across the world, thousands of people are plugged into regional and global antimilitarist networks and initiatives to confront a nuclear challenge that demands internationalist solidarity from us all. What are the most urgent dangers around nuclear weapons today? What does an anticolonial stance toward nuclear weapons look like? What should be the concrete aims of a global movement against nuclear weapons? Truthout posed these and other questions to three organizers and scholars from around the world working to advance nuclear abolition. Sara Haghdoosti is the Iranian-American executive director of Win Without War, a national grassroots organization advocating for a progressive U.S. foreign policy. Leila Hennaoui is an associate professor in international law at Hassiba Benbouali University of Chlef in Algeria, who has written about the Global South and nuclear colonialism. Achin Vanaik is a member of the Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament and Peace in India. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Derek Seidman: When you all look at the world today, what worries you the most about nuclear weapons? Leila Hennaoui: These are very dangerous times. Russia has talked about using tactical nuclear weapons. Nuclear armed states not only refuse to move forward with disarmament, but are actually modernizing and expanding their arsenals. There are talks of resuming nuclear testing. Russia has stepped back from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Nuclear rhetoric is being normalized, and that really worries me. Instead of normalizing the nuclear threat, we should talk about repairing harm and redirecting resources. Achin Vanaik: The idea with tactical nuclear weapons is that nuclear weapons could be used in battle without mass annihilation. This undermines the already irrational deterrence logic that says nuclear weapons must not be used. There's also the militarization of outer space. India and Pakistan are two nuclear powers in ongoing conflict that have had conventional wars. Pakistan, a much smaller country than India, has stated it would consider using tactical nuclear weapons if faced with economic strangulation, which is arguably what the Indian government has done by illegally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty. The likelihood of future armed conflict creates a situation where these two countries initially say they won't use nuclear weapons, but then progress to a situation where they very seriously consider it. Sara Haghdoosti: The rising threat of authoritarianism makes nuclear war far more likely. We're seeing so many cavalier threats about the use of nukes, from Trump to Putin and from India to Pakistan. We're seeing the old systems we had to help contain the threat of nuclear weapons crumble around us. If the New START Treaty [which is an arms reduction between the U.S. and Russia, and the last remaining arms control treaty between them] expires next year, we could enter a new arms race. There's also a new set of challenges around nuclear weapons with AI being integrated into some of their data control systems. What are the costs of nuclear weapons for society? And who actually benefits or profits from nuclear weapons? Hennaoui: For nuclear armed states, the economic costs are enormous. Budgets for nuclear weapons and modernizing stockpiles are huge. While nuclear weapons may drain public resources in the North, for us in the South they cost us lives, health, and water. In my country, Algeria, the French conducted nuclear testing in the Sahara that left radioactive contamination that still impacts us today. We need to reject nuclear apartheid, where a handful of nations hold permanent nuclear rights while the rest of the world is denied them. In Algeria, we still have birth defects and cancer from France's nuclear testing. Nuclear arms impact humanity both north and south, but it's us in the south, the poorest, who have no say around nuclear weapons, who pay the highest price. Haghdoosti: Everyone thinks about the detonation of nuclear weapons, but they have a huge impact at home that gets erased, from the legacy of nuclear testing, to workers without enough protections, to the environmental impacts on local communities. Hennaoui: Nobody wants new nations acquiring nuclear weapons. This kind of horizontal proliferation benefits nobody. Nuclear weapons, sadly, are seen as symbols of prestige and power, and these bureaucracies and militaries guard their control over secretive nuclear infrastructures that eat up vast areas of the budget. What should be the short-term and long-term aims for a progressive antinuclear politics? There must be funding for its programs, such as victim assistance and environmental remediation. We need to continue stigmatizing and campaigning against nuclear weapons. We need public pressure, especially in P5 countries (China, France, Russia, U.K., U.S.). In a volatile area like the Middle East, we have proactive organizations that have drafted weapons of mass destruction free zone treaties that they bring to diplomats. We should always strive to change the logic of security. The deterrence logic should be dismantled, combined with reparative justice and the relocation of resources for human security. You can't fight successfully to get rid of nuclear weapons by only focusing on nuclear weapons. In the long term, we need to push for leaders who aren't focused on deterrence, which we know doesn't work. We need new strategies to work towards peace. People need to trust their common sense here. Common thinking on national security assumes that you get more bombs and build higher walls and then people are safe. But this can't address the biggest threats we're facing, like climate change or nuclear war, whose impacts affect everyone. Vanaik: As we push for more countries to sign onto the TPNW, we should also propose nuclear risk reduction measures. We need to set up a framework for a discussion about nuclear disarmament just like we have around climate. If the U.S. ratified it, Russia would follow, and it would put tremendous pressure on India and Pakistan. We must also promote more nuclear weapons free zones. Most important would be a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction. The principal holdout is, of course, Israel. Even if we don't achieve these, we should still raise them to propagate and raise general consciousness. What should an anticolonial, antinuclear politics look like? We need to reject nuclear apartheid, where a handful of nations hold permanent nuclear rights while the rest of the world is denied them. Nuclear weapons today are a new form of colonization. Don't underestimate the importance of a progressive mass politics. Mass politics can lead to the overthrow of even the most intense dictatorships, and it can provide resistance against countries that are considering using nuclear weapons. It's understandable that the nuclear deterrence logic might appeal to Iran, which was just attacked by the U.S. and Israel. Instead, we should call out double standards and the coercive disarmament that is always imposed on the weak, and we should insist that all nuclear arsenals, including those of the P5 nations, Israel, and others, should be dismantled. The problem is they represent something so extreme that you can't actually use them to bully another country. Having nuclear weapons will not protect you from attacks. You can't fight successfully to get rid of nuclear weapons by only focusing on nuclear weapons. Regional efforts like nuclear weapons free zones are all steps in the generation of a consciousness to move beyond the terrain of nationalism and fight the interconnected crises, from militarism to climate, that impact us all. What do you see as major challenges to nuclear abolition? Powerful states have also been pressuring countries not to engage with the TPNW. Persistent regional rivalries, like between India and Pakistan, also feed the deterrence logic. We can overcome these obstacles with grassroots and diplomatic pressure, credible technical assistance, and the push for new decolonial treaties. I think of the TPNW as a decolonial legal tool. It's difficult to dismantle this house built on colonial legacies. International law is a tool that has always been used, and we should use tools like the TPNW. We need to realize the sum total of our efforts. The topic of nuclear weapons can feel overwhelming. What keeps you motivated in this struggle? Vanaik: Don't underestimate the importance of a progressive mass politics. Mass politics can lead to the overthrow of even the most intense dictatorships, and it can provide resistance against countries that are considering using nuclear weapons. If we start to believe that, we will start to really lose any chance for change as well as our democracy. Hennaoui: Hope lies with the survivors who are still telling their stories. They show us the human cost and bring voice to those who were silenced. Many things have been accomplished in the past that were unimaginable. What seems impossible now, may, in the foreseeable future, become possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive: Activist tells Swedish officials she has been subjected to harsh treatment, including insufficient food and water Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has told Swedish officials she is being subjected to harsh treatment in Israeli custody after her detention and removal from a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza, according to correspondence seen by the Guardian. In an email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, and seen by the Guardian, an official who has visited the activist in prison said she claimed she was detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water. She has received insufficient amounts of both water and food. She wondered whether images of her had been distributed,” the Swedish ministry's official added. Most of them are being held at Ketziot, also known as Ansar III, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinian security prisoners, many of whom Israel accuses of involvement in militant or terrorist activities. In the past, activists detained by Israel were not criminally prosecuted and instead their presence was treated as an immigration matter. According to lawyers from the NGO Adalah, the rights of the crew members have been “systematically violated”, reporting that activists were denied water, sanitation, medication and immediate access to their legal representatives, “in clear breach of their fundamental rights to due process, impartial trial and legal representation”. Lawyers also reported instances of verbal and physical abuse. During a visit to Ashdod on Thursday night, Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was filmed calling the activists “terrorists” as he stood in front of them. His spokesperson confirmed the video was filmed at Ashdod port on Thursday night. Ben-Gvir has previously called for the activists to be jailed rather than deported. This marks the second time Thunberg has been arrested alongside other flotilla members, after a similar attempt earlier this year ended with the activists' arrest and deportation. Baptiste André, a French doctor who was on one of the boats of the flotilla in June, told reporters upon his return to France that he witnessed Israeli border agents mock and deliberately deprive passengers of sleep, in particular Thunberg. “She expressed uncertainty about what the document meant and did not want to sign anything she did not understand,” reads the email. The Swedish ministry's official wrote that Thunberg has had access to legal counsel. Adalah said in an earlier statement about the legal process that although Israeli authorities would have a record of repeat participants in aid flotillas, activists, such as Thunberg, were generally treated in the same way as first-time participants, subject to short-term detention and deportation.</p>

"At the same time, as we have seen in recent months, these targets may belong to foreign investors," he added. Alexandrov did not disclose additional details about the Ukrainian targets that were allegedly struck with Chinese satellite intelligence data. China officially claims neutrality in Russia's war against Ukraine, but has indirectly supported Moscow's war through continued trade and by providing dual-use goods to Russia. During Russian President Vladimir Putin's last visit to China, where he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the two countries signed more than 20 cooperation deals in energy, technology, and other sectors, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent. She has been working with Lutsk-based misto.media, telling stories of Ukrainian fighters for the "All are gone to the front" project. She has experience as a freelance culture reporter, and a background in urbanism and activism, working for multiple Ukrainian NGOs. degree in English language and literature from Lesya Ukrainka Volyn National University, she studied in Germany and Lithuania. The populist Ano party is opposed to Ukraine's membership in the European Union and does not support aid to Ukraine. Sergiy Kyslytsia warned that Europe needs to "get serious" about the existential threat posed by Russia. After crossing the Oskil River, Russian forces have begun infiltrating Ukrainian lines in small assault groups, while the battlefield becomes increasingly dominated by swarming drones. Over the decades, Oleksa Shalayskyi became one of Ukraine's leading investigative journalists and is described by his colleagues as a pioneer of anti-corruption investigations. Russia launched 109 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, as well as three Iskander-M or KN-23 ballistic missiles, the Air Force reported. Drones struck the Kirishi oil refinery in Russia's Leningrad oblast overnight on Oct. 4, sparking a fire that was later extinguished, officials and local media reported. "Today, all the rescued children are safe in Ukraine-controlled territory," Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"A manned base is part of the Artemis program, aimed at developing space exploration technologies, preparing for longer space missions, and adapting and training astronauts. Nuclear energy will be used to supply power. This particular aspect is probably the most important one because this marks a step towards bringing nuclear technologies not only to orbit but also to near space. The odds are high that nuclear weapons will be deployed in near-Earth and near-Moon space," he pointed out. According to Stepanov, Washington is focused on expanding its launch capabilities for a potential deployment of offensive weapons to orbit, which may be equipped with special warheads, including nuclear ones. "For instance, the Boeing X-37 spacecraft is capable of carrying up to six nuclear warheads," the expert specified. He stressed that in the past, the US had conducted explosions of nuclear weapons in order to assess their impact on space. "In 1962-1963, the US carried out Operation Dominic, which included a series of nuclear weapons tests. In particular, the Starfish Prime project was implemented to study the impact of nuclear explosions on objects in outer space. A PGM-17A Thor medium-range missile was used to deliver a thermonuclear weapon to low Earth orbit," Stepanov said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with Canadian addresses have on average made up 1.5 per cent of buyers in the Phoenix area since 2007. In the past year, that has dropped to 0.27 per cent.Mario Tama/Getty Images When President Donald Trump returned to office with tariffs and declarations of Canada as the 51st state, snowbirds turned tail across the U.S. That was spring, an easy time to head back north. Now, however, as fall colours signal winter's imminent arrival, new data show little sign of Canadians flocking back to the sunny south for the cold months. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, fully 6 per cent of homes registered to people with Canadian mailing addresses have sold in the past 12 months. Another 2 per cent are for sale, according to data compiled by Mike Orr, owner of The Cromford Report, which analyzes property markets in Arizona. Since 2007, people with Canadian addresses have on average made up 1.5 per cent of buyers in the Phoenix area. In the past year, that has fallen to 0.27 per cent, even as numbers of other out-of-state buyers, such as Californians, have held steady. The data do not capture Canadians who use a U.S. tax address. Nor do they reflect other U.S. activity by Canadians, including investors and small business owners who, some real estate agents say, appear to be doing the inverse, moving themselves and their money south in increasing number. Mr. Zimbaluk moved to Arizona from Saskatchewan a decade ago, and his clientele is almost exclusively Canadian. It wasn't long ago that they were roughly split between buyers and sellers. “Now, pretty much everybody we talk to is selling,” he said. “I've had calls from lots of people who said, ‘we want to list it this fall. We'll come back, clean out our personal items, maybe use it for a month or two, and then we want to sell it. Mr. Zimbaluk's experience is reflected at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, where the number of available commercial carrier seats from Canada is down 12 per cent from a year ago. (That decline will be offset by new Porter Airline flights, announced this week, from Ottawa and Vancouver.) Canadians made three million fewer trips to the U.S. during summer travel boycott The mood has changed, said Oriana Lehman Wood, who specializes in luxury properties with Russ Lyon Sotheby's International Realty. She polled 72 of her colleagues from across the U.S. and Canada. Canadian clients, they reported, have taken new interest in Mexico, Costa Rica and Portugal. In 2009 and 2010, Canadian homebuyers even outnumbered Californians, Mr. Orr said. (In 2010, foreclosures made up 39 per cent of Arizona home transactions.) Arizona home prices have tripled, while the U.S. dollar has considerably strengthened. “I do agree, tons of Canadians are leaving,” said Cole Cummins, a real estate agent who moved from Toronto to Naples, Fla., several years ago. His clients include small business owners who are giving up on Canada, convinced Florida offers a better place to build wealth and pay less in tax. It's more that the policies just cater to them a bit better,” he said. Life in Canada has gotten too expensive, she says. Former Vancouver Canucks goaltender Eddie Läck, who is now a real estate agent and homebuilder in the Phoenix area, counts a half-dozen Canadian clients who are buying property to develop and sell. At the same time, some Canadians are reconsidering their decision to pull out, especially with cold temperatures ahead, he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Francis's openness to the LGBTQ community, advocacy for migrants and critiques of unrestrained capitalism saw him run up against strong conservative opposition inside and outside the church. Leo, after gently dipping his toe into the US political fray, is now facing criticism from similar quarters to Francis. The first American pope was asked on Tuesday about plans by the cardinal in Leo's home city of Chicago to give an award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership. Cardinal Blase Cupich, an ally and friend of the pope, was planning to give Durbin a “Lifetime Achievement Award for support to immigrants,” but the move faced a backlash given Durbin's support for abortion rights. Unusually, around 10 US bishops even spoke out publicly against the award. Two of those who did – Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone and Bishop Thomas Paprocki – were both appointed a religious liberty advisory body by US President Donald Trump and had been at odds with decisions made by Francis. One conservative Catholic described it as “disappointing” and “largely irrelevant”, right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh said it was a “terrible answer from Pope Leo” and Jack Posobiec, an influencer who is supportive of Trump, posted on X simply: “Some popes are a blessing. Some popes are a penance.” Joseph Strickland, the outspoken retired bishop of Tyler, Texas, said Leo's remarks had created “much confusion”. The day after, however, Leo generated more MAGA opposition when he took part in climate conference where he called for action on protecting the planet and blessed some ice. It all comes during a period when Leo had a private meeting with Reverend James Martin, a leading advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, spoke up against the “pandemic of arms” following the Minnesota school shooting and criticised huge CEO salaries and singling out Elon Musk. Along with his comments about abortion and immigration, he described Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent speech to generals as “worrying”. Elise Ann Allen, who recently interviewed Leo for her biography of the pope for her book “Leo XIV: Citizen of the World, Missionary of the XXI Century,” said Leo does not want to be “anti-Trump”. Yes, abortion is wrong but being pro-life respects human dignity in all its forms, whether it concerns the death penalty or immigrants. For some Catholics abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, while they question Francis' decision to update church teaching and make the death penalty “inadmissible.” Francis' critics hoped that Leo's distinct style – such as his decision to wear the red mozzetta cape after his election – might signal a course correction. “Conservative Catholics had hoped that Pope Francis' reforms would follow him into the tomb, that the universal church would view his papacy the way they did, as a bit of bad weather that had finally and thankfully passed,” Michael Sean Winters, a Catholic commentator, wrote in the National Catholic Reporter. Leo has shown he will, like Francis, try and avoid the culture wars. “They are very complex issues, and I don't know if anyone has all the truth on them,” the Pope pointed out when asked about Durbin's award. Leo will also speak up, when necessary, particularly on the treatment of immigrants, an issue close to his heart from his time as a bishop in Peru. While Leo's aim is to be a peacemaker his intervention this week show he's unafraid to face opposition when drawing lines on where the church stands.</p>
