                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A metal detectorist recently came across a cache of more than 100 gold and silver coins buried underground in the Netherlands, prompting archaeologists to come further investigate the site. According to a study published in Medieval Archaeology, the coins, which sat buried for 1,300 years in the Netherlands, were likely used in cult rituals, and further around the site, archaeologists uncovered the remains of a seventh-century open-air cult site. It's more than plausible that the cache of coins was what was known as “devil's money,” coin offerings common at pagan cult sites. There were rows of posts, evidence of a large residence in a clearing near an ancient road junction on a prominent elevated landscape, remnants of animal sacrifices, and more. They also determined that the gold coins and jewelry were placed there in intervals over 100 years and interspersed with the animal sacrifices, making it clear that the site once served as a ritual sacrifice location for pagan gods. “The cult site was probably linked to a nearby high-status settlement with an enclosed cult house or ceremonial building,” the study authors wrote. The third site featured gold coins and jewelry. “I think that this cult site was mainly used by local elites to emphasize their own status, and of course, you do that preeminently with valuables,” de Kort said, according to Phys.org.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The artworks of Leonardo da Vinci are vast and storied. But even amongst such a storied and well-studied body of work, there can still be a few surprises left to discover. The team, which included experts from Polytechnic University of Milan, Codevintec, and Sforza Castel, teamed up to employ ground-penetrating radar and laser scanning that mapped multiple feet under the castle. In doing so, they discovered not only that the tunnels Leonardo alluded to in his drawings existed, but that they may only be a small piece of an intricate system weaving throughout the site. “The ground-penetrating radar enriched the 3D model with data on known, but inaccessible, spaces, bringing to light unknown walkways and ideas for further studies on secret passages,” Francesca Biolo, researcher at Polytechnic University of Milan, said in a statement. He turned it into the Sforza Castle, complete with towers, courtyards, and frescoed-lined halls. In 1494, Francesco's successor, Ludovico Sforza, built on the castle's tradition and hired Leonardo da Vinci to create art for the castle. According to Art Net, in his effort to complete that project, Leonardo ocumented the castle's unseen tunnel system, as recorded in Codex Forster I. Experts believe the tunnels were once likely used for military operations, but other portions of the system could have included personal touches as well. While the underground system may not currently be fully accessible, the ground-penetrating radar and laser scanning used to confirm its presence could still unlock a fresh perspective on the Sforza Castel's underground world. “The goal is to create a digital twin of the Sforza Castle, a digital model that not only represents the current appearances of the castle but also allows you to explore the past, recovering historical elements that are no longer visible,” Franco Guzzetti, professor of geomatics at Polytechnic University of Milan, said in a statement. Adding augmented reality to the virtual paths could invite visitors to explore the underground environments and inaccessible historical places in a fresh museum experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MASLD occurs when fat builds up in the liver and is associated with one or more of five conditions: obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and low HDL cholesterol, known as "good" cholesterol. These conditions are characterized as cardiometabolic risk factors because they affect the heart or metabolism. MASLD can lead to serious illness, such as advanced liver, heart and kidney disease, but little research has been done to examine if certain cardiometabolic risk factors for those with MASLD are more associated with death than others. Now, a new study from Keck Medicine of USC published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology reveals that three of the cardiometabolic risk factors carry the greatest risk of death for those with MASLD: high blood pressure, pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes, and low HDL, which raise the risk of death by 40%, 25% and 15%, respectively. These results were independent of how many or which combination of cardiometabolic risk factors patients had, and held steady despite individuals' gender, sex, race or ethnicity. "MASLD is a complicated disease, and this study sheds new light on where doctors may want to focus their efforts when treating patients," said Norah A. Terrault, MD, a hepatologist with Keck Medicine and a senior author of the study. "Knowing which aspects of MASLD might lead to poorer outcomes can help us offer patients the best possible care." Researchers were especially surprised to discover that high blood pressure was associated with a higher chance of death than diabetes, said Matthew Dukewich, MD, PharmD, MS, a USC transplant hepatology fellow and lead author of the study. The study also found that obesity, the most common cardiometabolic risk factor of MASLD, can substantially raise the risk of mortality depending on a patient's body mass index (BMI), which is a formula used to estimate body fat percentage based on an individual's height and weight. Out of 134,515 participants 20 years or older, some 21,000 patients qualified as having MASLD. The study authors tracked all-cause mortality rates by individual cardiometabolic risk factors to reach their conclusions.
