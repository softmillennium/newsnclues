                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said this week that his administration is exploring a “distribution” of as much as $2,000 apiece to the American people on account of the funds generated by his tariff policies. “We also might make a distribution to the people, almost like a dividend to the people of America," the president said in an interview with One America News. Stimulus checks were sent to American citizens as part of a $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed under the first Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, leading to a surge in Bitcoin and stocks. In 2021, with President Joe Biden then in office, another round of stimulus was approved, once more providing Americans with annual incomes below $150,000 with additional checks of up to $1,400. If you had invested that first $1,200 into Bitcoin, which was changing hands at $6,878 at the close of April 11, 2020—the first day of direct deposit stimulus payments—then you would have around 0.1744 BTC, worth about $21,270 today. Injecting the other two checks into Bitcoin as soon as possible would have provided around another 0.0424 BTC or $5,170 based on the current price At the meme coin's 2021 peak, which took place just after the final stimulus, the three stimulus checks would have netted you around 600,000 Dogecoin (DOGE)—about $438,000 worth at its peak. What Next for the UK's $7 Billion in Seized Bitcoin? Formal details about the Trump administration's teased tariff checks remain outstanding, but $2,000 would allow investors to snatch about 0.0165 BTC at present time—over 1.6% of a full coin. Who knows how much that'll be worth in five years, but if Bitcoin's history is any indication, then it could be a bet worth making.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From autonomous AI systems reshaping industries to the institutional embrace of digital assets, a new era of digital transformation is unfolding, promising profound implications for global markets and everyday life. In the tech sphere, artificial intelligence is transcending its foundational applications, evolving into sophisticated agentic systems capable of autonomous planning and execution, while spatial computing begins to blur the lines between reality and digital overlays. Concurrently, the crypto landscape is shedding its speculative skin, maturing into a robust financial ecosystem driven by regulatory clarity, mainstream institutional adoption, and the tokenization of real-world assets. The current wave of innovation is characterized by several distinct, yet interconnected, frontiers. In the realm of technology, Agentic AI has emerged as a significant development, with autonomous systems now capable of planning and executing complex tasks to achieve user-defined goals. This is complemented by a growing emphasis on AI governance, providing frameworks to manage the ethical, legal, and operational performance of these increasingly intelligent systems. Concurrently, Spatial Computing, encompassing augmented and virtual reality, is digitally enhancing our physical world, offering immersive experiences across diverse sectors from gaming to e-commerce. Hybrid computing is gaining traction for its ability to combine various compute, storage, and network mechanisms, creating highly efficient innovation environments. Furthermore, Sustainability Tech is witnessing substantial investment, driven by both consumer demand and regulatory mandates. Innovations in hydrogen fuel cells, advanced solar technologies, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are becoming pivotal, with major players like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) committing to carbon-negative operations by 2030. Companies like Agnikul, pioneering 3D-printed rockets, and Astroforge, developing spacecraft for asteroid mining, exemplify the audacious spirit of these tech pioneers. In the cryptocurrency domain, October 2025 finds a market invigorated by regulatory clarity. The U.S. has seen significant progress with legislation such as the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act" (GENIUS Act), which provides a comprehensive framework for stablecoin regulation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also showing a more accommodating stance, easing requirements for exchange-traded products (ETPs) and inviting discussions on tokenized securities. This newfound clarity has fueled institutional integration, with traditional finance (TradFi) giants like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Fidelity, Stripe, and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) deepening their engagement with crypto, driving innovation in tokenized assets and payments. A cornerstone of this maturation is Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization, enabling fractional ownership and improved liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate and bonds. The convergence of AI and Crypto is also a transformative trend, with AI being leveraged for market analysis, risk management, optimization of trading strategies, and even managing blockchain scalability, as seen in projects like Aiccelsrate. This era of intense innovation is creating clear winners and posing significant challenges for others. Technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are positioned to win big, not only through their aggressive investments in AI and cloud computing but also through their commitment to sustainability, which resonates with increasingly environmentally conscious markets and regulatory bodies. Similarly, innovative startups such as Agnikul and Astroforge, though not publicly traded, represent the leading edge of disruptive technology, attracting significant venture capital and potentially setting the stage for future public offerings or acquisitions. In the crypto space, established financial institutions that have embraced digital assets are emerging as significant winners. Their ability to navigate regulatory landscapes and build trust within traditional finance makes them crucial conduits for broader crypto adoption. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), with its substantial Bitcoin holdings, continues to benefit from the asset's upward trajectory. Furthermore, blockchain infrastructure developers and platforms that facilitate RWA tokenization are set to thrive, as this trend unlocks immense value from previously illiquid assets. Legacy tech companies that fail to integrate AI effectively into their products and services, or those neglecting sustainable practices, may face declining market relevance and increased regulatory scrutiny. Similarly, traditional financial institutions that resist engaging with tokenized assets and decentralized finance risk losing market share to more agile competitors. The "developer shortage" in highly specialized tech areas also poses a challenge; companies that don't invest in talent development or leverage low-code/no-code platforms may struggle to innovate at the required pace. The current innovation surge is not merely about new products; it represents a fundamental reshaping of industries and societies. This deep integration will necessitate a skilled workforce capable of collaborating with AI, potentially leading to new job categories and a redefinition of existing roles. This integration, particularly within industry-specific cloud platforms, is leading to more profound insights, streamlined processes, and the creation of more agile and AI-assisted supply chains. This will likely result in increased efficiency and transparency across global commerce. The progress with stablecoin legislation (GENIUS Act) and the SEC's evolving stance on ETPs and tokenized securities signal a global trend towards more structured oversight, which, while providing certainty, will also demand compliance from market participants. The emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in several nations is another critical development, potentially altering global financial systems and even becoming a tool for nation-states to advance geopolitical interests, mirroring historical shifts in currency dominance. In the immediate future, widespread adoption of blockchain technology by financial institutions is anticipated, alongside increased retail adoption fueled by traditional financial instruments integrating digital assets. The DeFi (Decentralized Finance) sector is projected to reach new heights, with trading volumes potentially exceeding $4 trillion and Total Value Locked (TVL) nearing $200 billion by year-end 2025, signaling a maturation and mainstreaming of decentralized financial services. Longer-term, the emergence of new use cases for Web3 will drive further adoption. These applications will fundamentally change how we interact with digital assets, create value, and build communities. The continued development and potential introduction of CBDCs by various nations will also be a critical area to watch, as they could reshape monetary policy and cross-border transactions. Challenges include navigating the inherent volatility of nascent technologies, managing regulatory uncertainties, and addressing concerns about the potential for AI market power to become too centralized, which could stifle open experimentation. Potential scenarios range from a seamless, integrated digital future to one marked by significant regulatory hurdles and geopolitical competition over technological dominance. The current epoch of tech and crypto innovation represents a pivotal moment in our digital evolution. The key takeaways are clear: AI is becoming ubiquitous, transforming industries with agentic systems and deep integration into workflows. Crypto is maturing, driven by regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and the tokenization of real-world assets. Furthermore, sustainability is no longer an afterthought but a core driver of innovation, with green tech attracting significant investment. Investors should assess companies based on their ability to adapt and lead in these interconnected domains. Investors should watch for ongoing regulatory developments, particularly around AI governance and crypto legislation, as these will significantly influence market trajectories. Furthermore, monitoring the progress of large tech companies in their AI and sustainability initiatives, as well as the emergence of disruptive startups in both tech and crypto, will be crucial for identifying future market leaders. This is a period of immense opportunity, but also one that demands careful consideration and strategic foresight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What began as a meteoric rise, fueled by celebrity endorsements and unprecedented hype, has largely given way to a sobering reality where many investors are counting significant losses. While overall market capitalization shows some resilience, trading volumes have plummeted from their 2021-2022 peaks, and revenue projections for 2025 indicate a significant decline. This downturn is largely attributed to fading speculative hype, a strong correlation with volatile cryptocurrency prices, dwindling retail interest, and the inherent illiquidity of many NFT assets, leaving countless early adopters trapped in holdings now deemed "essentially worthless." However, it was the phenomenon of CryptoKitties (Ethereum) in late 2017 that first demonstrated the mainstream appeal and potential for digital collectibles, causing significant network congestion and sparking early interest in platforms like OpenSea (Ethereum). This year marked the "NFT Summer," propelled by digital artist Beeple's historic sale of "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" for a staggering $69 million at Christie's in March, catapulting NFTs into global headlines and attracting a wave of new investors and creators. The boom intensified with the emergence of iconic collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (Ethereum) (Yuga Labs), launched in April 2021, which quickly became a cultural touchstone and a status symbol for celebrities and early adopters. Other major players included Axie Infinity (Ethereum), pioneering the play-to-earn gaming model, and NBA Top Shot (Flow) (Dapper Labs), offering licensed digital sports moments. Celebrities played a crucial role in amplifying the hype, with figures like Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Justin Bieber, and Mila Kunis either purchasing high-value NFTs, launching their own collections, or openly endorsing the technology, further fueling the speculative frenzy. January 2022 marked the peak, with a record $17.2 billion in monthly sales volume. This precipitous fall was driven by a confluence of factors: market saturation with countless low-quality projects, the inevitable bursting of a speculative bubble where prices became detached from intrinsic value, and a broader economic downturn that shifted investor focus away from risky assets. Furthermore, the inherent lack of real-world utility for many NFTs, coupled with rampant scams, fraud, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty, eroded investor confidence. High transaction costs on popular blockchains and environmental concerns also contributed to the exodus. The once-dominant OpenSea (Ethereum) saw its daily trading volumes shrink from $200 million daily peaks to under $5 million by May 2025, a stark indicator of the market's contraction. The shift in market dynamics moved from a focus on quick profits and PFP collections to a demand for utility, real-world applications, and more robust, sustainable projects. The dramatic shift in the NFT market from speculative fervor to a demand for tangible utility has profoundly impacted companies operating within this ecosystem, creating clear winners and those facing significant headwinds. Marketplaces, once solely focused on high-volume PFP sales, are now adapting to a more discerning user base. OpenSea (Private), the former titan of NFT trading, is aggressively pivoting to become a multi-asset on-chain trading portal, launching its native token (SEA) and expanding support across 19 blockchains to incentivize engagement. While this demonstrates a proactive strategy, its mixed outlook reflects the challenge of reclaiming dominance amidst fierce competition from platforms like Blur (Private), which has successfully captured professional traders with its reward-based incentives and lower fees, and Magic Eden (Private), which continues to thrive on the Solana (SOL) blockchain due to its efficiency and lower transaction costs. Game developers and luxury brands are proving to be fertile ground for utility-driven NFTs. Animoca Brands (Private), a powerhouse in blockchain gaming and Web3 investment, is strategically diversifying its portfolio beyond just game development into advisory services and AI, reporting substantial growth in 2024. This broad investment and focus on digital property rights position it strongly. Similarly, Yuga Labs (Private), the creator of Bored Ape Yacht Club (Ethereum), is undergoing a significant restructuring, with co-founder Greg Solano returning as CEO to refocus on its Otherside (Ethereum) metaverse and deliver tangible utility to its token holders. Their success hinges on effective execution of this ambitious metaverse vision. In the luxury sector, brands like Louis Vuitton (LVMH:PA) and Gucci (KER:PA) are clear winners, leveraging NFTs for exclusive "phygital" products, enhancing customer engagement, and combating counterfeits through initiatives like Louis Vuitton's "Via" NFT project and Gucci's "Gucci Vault." Nike (NKE:NYSE), despite winding down its RTFKT acquisition, is strategically integrating Web3 elements directly into its core brand through platforms like .SWOOSH, indicating a shift towards direct customer engagement and loyalty. Immutable X's focus on scalable, cost-effective infrastructure for gaming has led to a 25% annual increase in active wallets linked to gaming NFTs. Polygon's affordability and speed make it attractive for high-transaction-volume applications. Similarly, the Solana (SOL) blockchain continues to gain traction for its fast transaction speeds and lower fees, becoming a preferred platform for developers building utility-focused NFTs. They are the "silent engines" driving metaverse economies, representing everything from virtual real estate to in-game assets, and are increasingly integrating with decentralized finance (DeFi) and the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The ripple effects of this evolution are reshaping traditional industries. In the art world, NFTs have democratized access, allowing artists to bypass traditional gatekeepers and directly monetize digital creations, while also introducing new forms like generative and interactive art. The gaming industry is undergoing a paradigm shift with "Play-to-Earn" models and true ownership of in-game assets, fostering new player economies and potential interoperability across different virtual worlds. Financial services are also being transformed, with NFTs enabling fractional ownership of real estate and other securities, enhancing liquidity, and streamlining trading processes through tokenization. This creates entirely new asset classes and financial products, pushing the boundaries of traditional finance. A pivotal U.S. federal court ruling recently dismissed a class-action lawsuit against Yuga Labs (Private) regarding Bored Ape Yacht Club (Ethereum) NFTs and ApeCoin, asserting that these assets do not qualify as securities under the Howey Test. This decision provides a crucial precedent, narrowing the scope of SEC enforcement for digital collectibles marketed with access-based perks rather than as speculative financial instruments. While this move towards principles-based regulation is seen as a catalyst for innovation, challenges persist, including market illiquidity, metadata centralization risks, and ongoing global regulatory fragmentation, alongside potential tax implications for collectibles. However, a key distinction lies in the current emphasis on utility. Unlike many dot-com ventures that lacked viable business models, the evolving NFT market is increasingly focused on practical applications across diverse industries. While still susceptible to volatility, this pivot towards tangible use cases suggests a potential for long-term value creation that extends beyond pure speculation, marking a critical phase in its development. As of October 2025, the NFT market is charting a course towards a more mature and utility-driven future, moving decisively beyond the speculative excesses of its early boom. The global NFT market is projected to reach approximately $61 billion this year, buoyed by continuous infrastructure improvements like more efficient Layer 2 solutions and heightened competition among alternative Layer 1 blockchains, which collectively reduce transaction fees and enhance user experience. Looking further ahead, the long-term outlook for NFTs is one of dramatic expansion. NFTs are increasingly recognized as an indispensable component of the Web3 infrastructure, poised to fundamentally redefine digital ownership and intellectual property rights. They are seen as a crucial gateway for mainstream crypto adoption, attracting millions through engaging and practical applications that extend far beyond simple digital collectibles. This evolving landscape presents significant market opportunities and strategic pivots. The virtual real estate market, where NFTs represent property deeds, is also projected for substantial growth. Perhaps the most disruptive trend is Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, where NFTs are used to tokenize physical assets like real estate, art, and luxury goods, enabling fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity, and reducing fraud. This market is projected to hit $50 billion in 2025, signaling its deep integration into mainstream finance. Additionally, NFTs are finding applications in digital identity, AI-generated content, event ticketing, supply chain transparency, and customer loyalty programs. Technical knowledge requirements, high costs (though improving), market saturation, and security concerns continue to be hurdles for creators. These advancements, coupled with clearer regulatory frameworks, are set to foster a more secure, legitimate, and accessible NFT market, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The "NFT Summer" may be a distant memory, but the underlying technology is now recognized as a legitimate digital asset class with diverse functionalities, moving beyond fleeting trends to become a foundational component of the digital economy. While overall trading volumes have tempered, the sheer number of transactions is on an upward trajectory, indicating broader adoption. The market is projected to reach approximately $61 billion this year, driven by the dominance of utility-driven NFTs, particularly in gaming, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and integrations with decentralized finance (DeFi). NFTs are poised to become the "silent engines of the digital economy," enabling stronger digital rights, streamlining systems, and unlocking novel opportunities across gaming, real estate, music, fashion, identity, and supply chain management. This enduring impact will redefine our perception of digital ownership, empower creators, foster new forms of community engagement, and bridge the gap between digital and physical realms. For investors navigating this evolving landscape, a strategic and cautious approach is paramount. Prioritize utility and value over speculative hype, focusing on projects that offer clear, tangible benefits. Conduct thorough due diligence on the team, roadmap, community, and smart contracts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are those among us who like the idea of swiping and tapping their way through life, armed with a lifetime of digital information as they enter buildings, book online appointments and take train rides to work. Others are not so keen, fearing that big brother databases chock full of personal details will one day control their movements, if that is not happening already. In the case of cryptocurrencies, and even their nicer sounding cousins – stablecoins – the potential for users to be tracked and traced is writ large, with the added prospect of a shift to digital money leading to unemployment-inducing financial crashes even more frequently than in the past. All the big financial centres, including London, have begun passing laws and consulting on rules to govern a future that is lubricated by digital money, pushing cash very much to one side. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said last week that he wanted to “put the UK at the forefront of exciting innovation” and that meant finding a way to facilitate competing stablecoins, backed by a robust regulatory regime. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price. Others, known as "algorithmic stablecoins", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens. So, like it or not, many and varied digital currencies are coming, bamboozling all but a minority of the population with impenetrable jargon and an impossibly long list of options. As with all financial services, the urge to prey on customers' fear and greed is irresistible when it means the provider can get its hands on someone's savings and turn it into something more exciting, more profitable, and with the risk of default passed back to the customer (sorry, you've lost all your money) or the taxpayer (sorry, my bank is bust, can you bail it out). A government that backed a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be justifiably saying to the finance industry, we need to control this thing because we are on the hook when it goes wrong. Much better to keep up the pretence that financial services companies, when caught in a collective tailspin, will be allowed to crash. Rachel Reeves is one of many who want to go down the private route, attracting more and bigger finance companies to the UK. Costs will also be lower, we are told, because without a bank standing in between the customer and the seller, charges on credit transactions could fall from 1.5%-3% towards 0.1%. Congress has yet to fill in the vast gaps in the Genius Act, which was passed in the summer with bi-partisan backing, so it is difficult to know exactly how risky US stablecoins will be. I couldn't tell you when the [stablecoin] crash will come or how severe it will be, but you know it's coming.” Health warning: Nigel Farage would favour the Trumpian free-for-all. For the UK, following mainland Europe was an option. In 2021, when former deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe kicked off the stablecoin debate in a series of speeches, the message was clear: however tight the regulation, it would be too cumbersome and too slow to prevent risky behaviour from quickly becoming a systemic problem and even a full-blown banking crisis. Maybe the UK central bank is clever enough to develop a system both safe and competitive.</p>

Though OnePay hasn't publicly confirmed the rollout, the move would put it in line with competitors like Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal, which already offer crypto trading to U.S. users. Founded in 2021 by Walmart and venture firm Ribbit Capital, OnePay has been building what it calls an “everything app” for digital finance. By adding crypto, OnePay is banking on the idea that its users, many of whom shop at Walmart's nearly 4,600 U.S. stores, will want to spend, save, or transfer crypto on the same platform they handle cash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The $300 billion record stablecoin supply may act as “rocket fuel” for the crypto market, while signaling a growing integration with global finance, industry watchers told Cointelegraph. The record $300 billion stablecoin market capitalization may signal that more investor capital is flowing onchain, which could act as “rocket fuel” for cryptocurrency valuations, according to market analysts. The total stablecoin supply has reached a new record of over $300 billion on Friday, marking a 46.8% year-to-date growth rate that may outpace the previous year's stablecoin market growth, Cointelegraph reported. “Stablecoin supply may have crossed 300 billion dollars, but this is not capital waiting on the sidelines. It is moving through markets with purpose,” according to Andrei Grachev, founding partner at synthetic dollar protocol Falcon Finance. Velocity metrics show constant activity across networks,” Grachev told Cointelegraph. “Stablecoins are settling trades, funding positions, and giving users dollar access where banks fall short,” he added. A growing supply may also indicate more stablecoin usage for daily payments or institutional settlements. The stablecoin supply's “expansion is often interpreted as a sign of fresh dollar-equivalent liquidity that can quickly rotate into Bitcoin, Ethereum or altcoins,” he told Cointelegraph. Santos pointed to stablecoin adoption in countries such as Nigeria, Turkey and Argentina, where residents use US dollar-pegged tokens as “de facto dollars” for everyday transactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This new excitement has investors searching for the next altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to outperform ETH's gains in the next few months. At a mere $0.035, Mutuum Finance is one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, with its dual lending protocol bypassing massive inefficiencies in decentralized lending. Its Stage 6 presale is already over 55% sold out. With its 50x potential for growth, Mutuum Finance is increasingly considered a special early-stage investment opportunity that can do even better than Ethereum's next bull cycle as the bull market continues to gain traction. Ethereum (ETH) has officially shattered three years of horizontal price action, drawing what analysts call the “holy grail” breakout, a technical move that eliminates prolonged consolidation and allows the foundation for a powerful vertical rally. As momentum gains pace and on-chain indicators flash green, it is widely expected ETH's future destination could be in the five-digit realm, a level previously thought to be years in the making. With institutional funds pouring in and optimism in the air, increasingly large chunks of investors are also exploring emerging altcoins with greater growth prospects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also starting to draw that forward-thinking capital. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its sixth all-time presale round. The project has already broken 16,750 registered members and more than $16.8 million, all-time high milestones, and continues to show growing trust in the market for its long-term project. Investors who are seeking sustainable yield and long-term value will find Mutuum Finance's growing ecosystem at a quick rate as an investment prospect to consider. The platform also has a very robust Loan-to-Value (LTV) and liquidation mechanism that adjusts in real-time to shock collateral price. Open architecture and security by design enable Mutuum Finance to be a long-term, stable, and secure DeFi platform designed for the long term and to put the times to the test. Version 1 (V1) is set to go live on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will include major pieces such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which at the moment is trading at just $0.035 and significantly more than 55% presale sold out, is rapidly becoming one of the most exciting early-stage DeFi plays of 2025. With more than 16,750 investors, who have raised $16.8 million, a double lending infrastructure, and robust security architecture, MUTM represents a rare chance at 50× potential gain. For investors betting on the next altcoin to surge and drive even Ethereum's rally, MUTM is the obvious choice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's next major network upgrade, Fusaka, could reshape how users experience the blockchain by lowering costs and boosting efficiency, according to asset manager VanEck. In its September crypto market recap, VanEck's research team said Fusaka, expected to go live in December, is designed to tackle one of Ethereum's biggest hurdles: data availability for rollups, the scaling solutions that bundle many transactions together before settling them on Ethereum. VanEck explained that this reduces bandwidth and storage demands, making it possible to safely raise Ethereum's “blob” capacity — the data slots used by rollups — without putting strain on the network. Coinbase's Base and Worldcoin's World Chain now account for about 60% of all rollup data submitted, VanEck noted, showing how central L2s have become to the network's growth. VanEck argued that the upgrade underscores Ethereum's shift away from being driven by base layer fees. As more activity moves to rollups, mainnet fee revenue has declined, but the firm stressed this does not diminish ETH's importance. Instead, Ethereum's security role in settling rollup transactions increases, reinforcing ETH's position as a monetary asset rather than just a fee-yielding one. VanEck analysts also warned that unstaked ETH holders face dilution risk as institutional actors — from exchange-traded products to crypto treasury firms — continue accumulating ETH positions to stake for yield. In that context, they believe, Fusaka strengthens Ethereum's appeal by lowering L2 costs and reinforcing its centrality in a scaling ecosystem that is expected to attract more institutional adoption. VanEck concluded that while technical challenges remain, Fusaka marks a pivotal step in Ethereum's rollup-centric roadmap, with “significant implications” for both users and long-term holders.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin ETFs are the market's “clearest sentiment barometer,” indicating an incoming breakout for “Uptober,” analysts told Cointelegraph. US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began the historically bullish month of October with their second-best week of inflows since launch, signaling renewed investor optimism. Spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs recorded $3.24 billion worth of cumulative net positive inflows over the past week, nearly matching their record of $3.38 billion in the week ending Nov. 22, 2024, according to data from SoSoValue. Analysts attributed the turnaround to growing expectations of another US interest rate cut, which has improved sentiment toward risk assets. Growing expectations of another US interest rate cut triggered a “shift in sentiment,” attracting renewed investor demand for Bitcoin ETFs, “bringing four-week inflows to nearly $4 billion,” Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph. “At current run-rates, Q4 flows could retire over 100,000 BTC from circulation — more than double new issuance.“ “ETF absorption is accelerating while long-term holder distribution eases, helping BTC build a stronger base,” near key technical support levels, he added. Continued ETF inflows may provide significant tailwinds for Bitcoin in October, which is the second-best month for Bitcoin in terms of average historical returns, often referred to as “Uptober” by crypto investors. This week's $3.2 billion briefly pushed Bitcoin's price above $123,996 on Friday, marking an over six-week high last seen on Aug. 14 for the world's first cryptocurrency, TradingView data shows. Bitcoin's breakout above $120,000 may invite a “very quick move” above the $150,000 all-time high before the end of 2025, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards, told Cointelegraph during an interview at Token2049 in Singapore.

Nine months since its launch, USDT0 is starting to gain traction. We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. This has led platforms like BNB and Linea to rely on wrapped tokens, ported in via a third-party bridge. Using Layerzero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard, the stablecoin is already live on eight networks, despite being less than a year old. The goal is to create a “unified liquidity layer” where tokens can move between any chain, “without slippage in a matter of seconds,” USDT0 CEO and co-founder, Lorenzo R. told CCN at TOKEN2049. The concept is most powerful for small chains, which have often struggled to attract capital Lorenzo observed. Without a multi-chain transfer mechanism like Circle Gateway, users encounter friction moving classic USDT between networks. Because Tether doesn't operate its own canonical bridges, swapping Ethereum USDT for Tron USDT, for example, requires a third-party bridge or centralized exchange, both of which incur fees and introduce counterparty risk. Compared to legacy stablecoin bridges, cross-chain transfers are much cheaper than with native USDT. Users only need to pay gas and a small LayerZero relay fee. Moreover, depending on the source and destination chains, moving USDT0 between networks may not even require other tokens. Stable, which is among a new cohort of dedicated stablecoin chains, uses USDT0 as its native gas currency, removing the need for wallets to hold multiple assets. According to Lorenzo, a number of use cases have emerged for USDT0's enhanced cross-chain liquidity: You see DeFi protocols processing liquidations, or tapping into larger liquidity pools.” With these use cases driving adoption, USDT0's daily transfer volume has climbed from less than a million dollars in January, to $869 million on Oct. 2, Lorenzo said. But as users increasingly demand more frictionless ways of moving value between blockchains, USDT0 could transform the stablecoin into a truly liquid cross-chain asset.</p>

Tony Klor's tweet turned viral within minutes, had his endorsed visa picture with a strong message of India's increasing friendliness to foreign talent. India is opening its doors to foreign blockchain & AI builders. I've just been granted a girthy 5-year India visa," Klor wrote. India is opening its doors to foreign blockchain & AI builders. "Finally, congrats—this is my first time ever seeing an Indian Visa Flex," one person wrote, and others just said, "Welcome home." Most reactions centered around India's smart move to welcome high-tech talent in the face of growing restrictive immigration policies in nations such as the US. One user remarked, "India knows the future is being written in blockchain and AI. A 5-year visa like this sends an important signal—while others push talent away, India is saying ‘come build with us'. The B-1 visa is a long-term category for foreigners intending to establish or explore business opportunities in India. The issuance of this five-year, multiple-entry visa to a foreigner actively involved in emerging areas such as blockchain and AI is being considered by many as an open government indication of India's desire to be the world hub for future technologies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jakarta, Pintu News – Amid the rising costs and uncertainty of revenues from crypto mining, some companies have decided to shift focus to artificial intelligence . This change in strategy not only reduces risk, but also promises higher profit margins. These companies are now leveraging existing infrastructure to usher in a new era of AI technology, which offers the potential for very attractive returns on investment. HIVE Digital Technologies, which previously focused on Bitcoin  mining, is now shifting most of its operations to AI infrastructure. The company has successfully increased their Bitcoin (BTC) mining capacity to 10.4 EH/s as of May 2025, and plans to reach 25 EH/s by the end of 2025. This transformation not only increases their capacity, but also expands revenue opportunities through the utilization of Nvidia's AI chips. HIVE has strategically invested in Nvidia's GPU cluster, which allows the company to scale operations significantly. With a focus on renewable energy in Canada, Sweden and Paraguay, HIVE is positioning itself as a leader in the transition from mining to AI. This approach not only reduces operational costs but also enhances the company's reputation as a pioneer in green technology. Core Scientific, which is also making the transition from crypto mining to AI data center infrastructure, has announced plans to have an almost equal revenue split between crypto mining and AI by 2025. The company has announced a $1.2 billion expansion project for its data center in Denton, Texas, which will support AI and high-performance cloud computing. This vertical integration eliminates lease payments previously paid to Core Scientific, while securing the critical infrastructure capacity needed to support growing AI data center demand. IREN Limited has recorded significant growth after transitioning from Bitcoin (BTC) mining to AI-ready data centers. With extremely low energy costs of $0.033 per kWh, IREN has managed to create a significant competitive advantage compared to other companies making a similar transition. A massive investment of $674 million in 12,400 new GPUs has doubled IREN's AI cloud capacity to 23,000 units. It is expected to generate around $500 million in annual sales by early next year. IREN's Horizon 1 and Sweetwater facilities are designed to support up to 700,000 liquid-cooled Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, marking a major step in the company's evolution towards AI technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Breaking news from the trading floors reveals unexpected results: BTC price action triggers celebration headlines but institutional money managers are quietly rotating into altcoin positions that offer superior infrastructure and yield opportunities. The latest market data shows over $1.5 billion in crypto liquidations as Bitcoin tests critical resistance levels, yet expert analysis points toward Dogecoin, XRP and emerging Layer 2 projects like Layer Brett as the real winners. The reality behind Bitcoin's recent price celebration tells a sobering infrastructure story. While BTC price headlines grab attention, the underlying network experienced devastating liquidation cascades totaling $1.5 billion across major exchanges, exposing fundamental scalability limitations plaguing Layer 1 networks. Market makers witnessed how Bitcoin's technical structure creates volatility traps during high-volume periods, with leveraged positions getting demolished by network congestion and delayed transaction confirmations. The bearish trendline penetration reveals deeper concerns about BTC's ability to handle institutional-scale adoption without creating dangerous bottlenecks. Despite impressive technical signals—DOGE posting 6-9% gains with emerging golden cross formations and whale accumulation of 680 million tokens—even these altcoin darlings face infrastructure bottlenecks during peak trading periods. XRP's anticipation around potential ETF approvals creates positive momentum, but the network's ability to handle surge-driven institutional volume remains questionable. Both Dogecoin and XRP experienced significant liquidations ($35.8 million and $58.8 million respectively) during recent volatility spikes, revealing how even technically sound altcoins can become victims of their own success when infrastructure cannot match demand. Layer Brett represents a change in how blockchain infrastructure approaches surge-driven market events, utilizing purpose-built Layer 2 architecture specifically designed to absorb volume spikes without creating devastating liquidation cascades now plaguing legacy networks. While Bitcoin, Dogecoin and XRP struggle with network congestion during high-volume periods, Layer Brett's Ethereum Layer 2 foundation delivers lightning-fast transactions and low gas fees that maintain stability regardless of trading intensity. The project's nearly $4.2 million raised during its crypto presale phase validates institutional interest in infrastructure-first blockchain solutions. Unlike traditional memecoins that offer speculation without substance, Layer Brett combines meme energy with real Layer 2 utility, creating an ecosystem built for scalability rather than speculation. As DOGE demonstrates golden cross patterns and XRP holding institutional support above $2.85, the question now becomes whether traditional Bitcoin maximalism can compete against infrastructure-focused alternatives. While it's true that BTC price movements can create headlines and Dogecoin technical patterns do generate social media buzz, droves of investors are coming to realise that sustainable returns require networks capable of handling real-world usage without creating systemic risks. Next-generation blockchain projects are gearing up to deliver both performance and personality, placing their ceilings beyond the conventional with their smarter, two-tiered approach to the markets.
