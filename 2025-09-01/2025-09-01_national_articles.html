                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's tomato season and Lidia is harvesting on farms in California's Central Valley. Attention from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager. “The worry is they'll pull you over when you're driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. “It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.” Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.” Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won't be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared. Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said. In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares). Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly. Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring. Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here. My whole life has been in the United States.” Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said. “We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. Federal immigration agents toss tear gas at protesters during a raid in the agriculture area of Camarillo, Calif., Thursday, July 10, 2025. “Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn't disrupting labor supplies.” Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president. “What's going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?” De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren't in the field to pick our crops? Who's going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?” ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The name is not Immigration Control and Enforcement.</p>

Coco Gauff, of the United States, reacts during a match against Naomi Osaka, of Japan, during the fourth round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Sept. 1, 2025, in New York. Naomi Osaka, of Japan, returns a shot against Coco Gauff, of the United States, during the fourth round of the US Open tennis championships, Monday, Sept. 1, 2025, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — Naomi Osaka has taken the first set against Coco Gauff by a 6-3 score in their much-anticipated matchup in the U.S. Open's fourth round on Monday. Gauff made 16 unforced errors in that set, while a consistent and confident Osaka made just five. Gauff, a 21-year-old from Florida, is the Grand Slam tournament's No. Osaka, a 27-year-old who was born in Japan and moved to the U.S. with her family at age 3, is the No. They have won a combined three titles at Flushing Meadows. Monday's winner will make it to this year's quarterfinals and face No. The match is being held in Arthur Ashe Stadium. It began after Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada beat Andrey Rublev of Russia there in the fourth round of the men's bracket. Other countries' broadcasters are listed here. This is the sixth matchup between Gauff and Osaka as pros — and the second at Flushing Meadows. Back in 2019, also in Ashe, Osaka defeated a 15-year-old Gauff in straight sets, then consoled the teary American afterward and invited her to speak to the spectators. Gauff has won three of the four matches they have played against each other since then, so she led the head-to-head series 3-2 entering Monday. Osaka owns four Grand Slam singles championships, including at the U.S. Open in 2018 and 2020. Gauff, who has been working with a new coach on her serve to try to overcome double-faulting problems, has collected two major trophies in singles — at the U.S. Open in 2023 and the French Open this year — and one in doubles.

Police revealed the cause of death for former U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber on Monday, months after she died in her sleep at home in March. Police had said earlier this year that they had "found no evidence suggesting that her death was caused by anything other than natural causes." Aber's family had released a statement to the press shortly after her death noting that she had suffered from epilepsy and related seizures "for many years." Jessica Aber, seen here in 2023, resigned from her position on Jan. 20, 2025. "I am proud of the work we have done with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners to enforce the law and build community trust." During her tenure, she prosecuted cases involving leaks from the CIA and Russian nationals engaged in fraud in the U.S. Jessica D. Aber, 43, was found dead on Mar. She served as a U.S. Attorney for roughly three years before resigning when President Donald Trump took office. One of her biggest legal victories came last year, shortly before her resignation, when ex-CIA analyst Asif Rahman pleaded guilty to leaking top-secret documents about an Israeli plan to strike Iran. Rahman was accused of posting documents about Israel's strike last year on Telegram, leading the country's military to hold off on its initial plans. Then-U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Jessica Aber speaks during a press conference at the U.S. Department of Justice on Dec. 6, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images) Aber criticized Rahman's actions as a "violation of his oath, his responsibility, and the law" and said the leak "placed lives at risk, undermined U.S. foreign relations, and compromised our ability to collect vital intelligence in the future." In 2019, Aber received the Department of Justice's Assistant Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Helicopters brought aid to Afghanistan's Kunar province on Monday after a strong earthquake devastated the area, killing 800 and injuring thousands more. Nearby, doctors treated people who were injured in the quake. A strong earthquake in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border killed at least 610 people and injured 1,300, officials said. Wounded people were being evacuated from Afghanistan's Kunar province after a 6.0 magnitude quake late Sunday hit a series of towns in the area.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Desperate Afghans clawed through rubble in search of missing loved ones after a strong earthquake killed some 800 people and injured more than 2,500 in eastern Afghanistan, according to figures provided Monday by the Taliban government. “We need people to come here and join us. Let us pull out the people who are buried. There is no one who can come and remove dead bodies from under the rubble.” The quake hit just before midnight and was centered 27 kilometers (17 miles) east-northeast of Jalalabad at a depth of 8 kilometers (5 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said. Footage showed rescuers taking injured people on stretchers from collapsed buildings and into helicopters as people frantically dug through rubble with their hands. The Taliban government's chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, told a press conference on Monday that the death toll had risen to at least 800 with more than 2,500 injured. He said most of the casualties were in Kunar. Eastern Afghanistan is mountainous, with remote areas and the quake has worsened communications. Civil defense workers, locals, and army soldiers prepare to evacuate injured victims of an earthquake that killed hundreds and destroyed numerous villages in eastern Afghanistan, in Mazar Dara, Kunar province, Monday, Sept. 1, 2025. One survivor described seeing homes collapse before his eyes and people screaming for help. In this photo released by the Nangarhar Media Center, stretchers and ambulances are prepared to receive victims of an earthquake that killed hundreds and destroyed numerous villages in eastern Afghanistan, at Nangarhar Airport in Nangarhar, Afghanistan, Monday, Sept. 1, 2025. Sadiqullah, who lives in the Maza Dara area of Nurgal, said he was woken by a deep boom that sounded like a storm approaching. He ran to where his children were sleeping and rescued three of them. “I was half-buried and unable to get out,” he told The Associated Press by phone from Nangarhar Hospital. We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.” It felt like the whole mountain was shaking, he said. Rescue operations were underway and medical teams from Kunar, Nangarhar and the capital, Kabul, have arrived in the area, said Sharafat Zaman, a health ministry spokesman. In this photo released by the Ministry of Public Health, Afghans donate blood for victims of an earthquake that killed hundreds and destroyed numerous villages in eastern Afghanistan, at Nangarhar Regional Hospital in Nangarhar, Monday, Sept. 1, 2025. Zaman said many areas had not been able to report casualty figures and that “the numbers were expected to change” as deaths and injuries are reported. The chief spokesman, Mujahid, said helicopters had reached some areas but road travel was difficult. Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said the earthquake intensified existing humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan and urged international donors to support relief efforts. “This adds death and destruction to other challenges including drought and the forced return of millions of Afghans from neighbouring countries,” Grandi wrote on X. “Hopefully the donor community will not hesitate to support relief efforts.” “Although we have been able to act fast, we are profoundly fearful for the additional strain this will have on the overall humanitarian response in Afghanistan,” said Ibrahim. " Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by events in Afghanistan. “Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. We are ready to extend all possible support in this regard,” he said on X. At least 1.2 million Afghans have been forced to return from Iran and Pakistan so far this year, according to a June report by UNHCR. A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated at least 4,000 people perished in that quake. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory. Associated Press journalist Suzan Fraser contributed reporting from Ankara, Turkey.</p>

Fox News' Alexandria Hoff provides details on Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip to China ahead of President Donald Trump's deadline for bilateral talks with Ukraine. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held warm meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday, sending Washington a clear message after President Donald Trump's heavy tariffs against India went into effect last week. Xi hosted Modi, Putin and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) at the port city of Tianjin. Modi was pictured having friendly exchanges and holding hands with both leaders, and he emphasized that India sees itself as a "partner" of China's rather than a "rival." Modi's trip was his first time visiting China in seven years. He also took a ride in Putin's presidential limo, echoing Putin's own visit with Trump in Alaska last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin, from left, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping talk ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit at the Meijiang Convention and Exhibition Center in Tianjin, China. While Modi never criticized Trump or the U.S. outright, his warming up to U.S. adversaries is a clear rebuke amid India's tariff strife with Trump. The U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods beginning last week. Xi also stopped short of naming Washington, but condemned "bullying behavior" by countries during his summit address. Trump appeared to receive the message on Monday, reacting to the trio's meeting in a post on social media. He argued India had much more to lose in an economic standoff with the U.S. President Donald Trump's once-warm relations with Modi have cooled in recent months. "What few people understand is that we do very little business with India, but they do a tremendous amount of business with us," Trump wrote, adding that the U.S. is India's "biggest client." They should have done so years ago. Just some simple facts for people to ponder!" Indian PM Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin  (Sputnik/Sergey Bobylev/Kremlin via REUTERS) Modi's visits with Putin and Xi are only the latest sign of cooling relations between Washington and New Delhi, however. India's national security advisor traveled to Moscow last month, its foreign minister visited last week and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded talks in Delhi in mid-August.

What makes Moran our Liberal Media Scream of the week isn't just his continued hate toward Trump but his embrace of the Founding Fathers, whom the liberal media have recently attacked as racist slave-holders not worthy of memorializing. An ABC journalist @TerryMoran posted this absolutely vile smear of Stephen Miller. Remember that every time you watch ABC's coverage of the Trump administration. As it happens, I know Stephen quite well. Moran was dumped in June when he went after Miller on X. “He eats his hate,” Moran wrote of the president's chief policy aide. Moran on In Good Faith With Philip DeFranco: “What we're seeing is, no question, what other countries have seen a lot, what our Founding Fathers predicted would happen, that a great strongman would, would, all right, not great in the good sense, but great in the power sense, right?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deep in the Swedish forest, where reindeer roam and scientists ski in winter, lies one of Europe's hopes for a spaceport that can ultimately compete with the United States, China and Russia. But the Trump administration's “America First” policies, plus a commercial market that's growing exponentially, has prompted Europeans to rethink their approach. KIRUNA, Sweden (AP) — Deep in the Swedish forest, where reindeer roam and scientists ski in winter, lies one of Europe's hopes for a spaceport that can ultimately compete with the United States, China and Russia. But the Trump administration's “America First” policies, plus a commercial market that's growing exponentially, has prompted Europeans to rethink their approach. And saying that it would double doesn't mean that it would catch up by the same factor, because you can expect that other regions will also continue to step up.” Currently, Europe's only space base capable of launching rockets and satellites into orbit is in sparsely populated French Guiana, an overseas department of France in South America that's roughly 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of the equator. Otherwise, Europe borrows NASA's Cape Canaveral in Florida. In March, Isar Aerospace launched the first test flight of its orbital launch vehicle from the Andøya Spaceport, another site that's part of Europe's efforts to expand its presence in space, on an island in northern Norway. Moeller believes a successful orbital launch from continental Europe could occur within the next year, though he won't guess where. Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom also are among the countries seeking to be part of Europe's spaceport portfolio. Elsewhere on Earth, India — active in space research since the 1960s — has launched satellites for itself and other countries and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014. After a failed attempt to land on the moon in 2019, India became the first country to land a spacecraft near the moon's south pole in 2023 in a historic voyage to uncharted territory that scientists believe could hold reserves of frozen water. New Zealand also has a growing and active launch industry, and Australia is working to develop its commercial space industry. Esrange and Andøya date back to the 1960s and much of their space-bound appeal stems from their far-north geography on Earth. Esrange, for example, is owned and operated by the Swedish Space Corporation and based more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. The base itself encompasses 6 square kilometers (2.3 square miles), where experts conduct Martian lander parachute tests, suborbital rocket launches and stratospheric balloon experiments. But its key selling point is Esrange's rocket landing zone: 5,200 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) of birch, pine and spruce trees spread north across the Swedish tundra, nearly to the Norwegian and Finnish borders. Mattias Abrahamsson, business development director for the science division, of the Esrange Space Center sits at a desk in Kiruna, Sweden, Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025. “The rocket motor will just fall freely into the ground, which means that you need to see to it that no people are in the area,” Mattias Abrahamsson, business development director for the science division at Esrange, said during a recent tour. Andøya's remote location on a Norwegian island, meanwhile, means rockets can safely crash down into the sea without risking harm to humans. During his first week in office earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his $175 billion “Golden Dome” missile defense system to protect America from long-range missiles. If successful, it would mark the first time the U.S. would place weapons in space that are meant to destroy ground-based missiles within seconds of launch. It follows China's 2021 groundbreaking launch of a warhead system that went into orbit before reentering Earth's atmosphere. Europe currently, however, does not have the same capacities and has for decades banked on the U.S. for its security and defense. But U.S. Vice President JD Vance, during a speech in February at the Munich Security Conference, warned Europe against continuing to rely upon America and urged officials to “step up in a big way” to provide for the defense of the continent. A rocket is placed outside the Esrange Space Center, a base deep in the Swedish forest and a part of Europe's hope to compete in the space race in Kiruna, Sweden, Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025. Vance's remarks, as well as concerns over former Trump ally and tech billionaire Elon Musk's politics potentially impacting Ukraine's dependence on his Starlink satellite system in its war with Russia, alarmed European leaders. It became increasingly clear to them that the continent must have its own space ecosystem, with its “own capabilities to really be able to react with (its) own means and under (its) own control,” Moeller said. Musk's SpaceX and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin, among others, have proven that space isn't limited to governmental agencies like NASA, and that there's a lot of money to be made in the solar system. And the Swedish Space Corporation, with its burgeoning orbital launch and rocket test division at Esrange, is among those seeking to capitalize on those dollars. Ulrika Unell, the division's president, said satellites in space are crucial to life on Earth. She wants everyone, beyond astronauts and scientists, to consider how they are impacted by what's orbiting hundreds of kilometers (miles) above the globe. “I would ask them to think about, when they go around with their mobiles and they use all this data every day: Where does it come from?

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to affirm that city police will not collaborate with the National Guard or federal troops. At least seven people have been killed and 37 others injured in shootings in Chicago this Labor Day weekend, even as the city's mayor vows to block President Donald Trump's efforts to combat crime. This weekend's shootings took place in a series of unrelated incidents across Chicago, with the majority of instances resulting in no one being taken into custody, police say. Trump has suggested he may deploy the National Guard and other federal law enforcement to combat crime in the city. The victims of fatal shootings so far this weekend include at least two women and three men, as well as two others police have not specified. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order on Saturday prohibiting local police from working with their federal counterparts. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and President Donald Trump (Getty Images) "This executive order makes it emphatically clear that this president is not going to come in and deputize our police department," Johnson said at a news conference with other city leaders. The mayor's order affirms that Chicago police officers will continue to enforce state and local laws, but will not work with the National Guard or federal agents on patrols, arrests, immigration enforcement or other law enforcement actions. "We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents." J.B. Pritzker delivers remarks in Chicago alongside Mayor Brandon Johnson and other officials after reports the White House is considering the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. The White House dismissed Johnson's order on Saturday, claiming that Democrats were attempting to make efforts to reduce crime a partisan issue. "If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer," White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Reuters. Chicago has struggled with gun violence for decades. The city suffered another bloody weekend on July 4 this year, when 55 people were shot, six of whom were killed. According to city data, there have been 272 homicides in Chicago this year, including 225 fatal shootings. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

The ‘Outnumbered' panel reacts to a Democrat-backed bill that would block federal agencies from clearing homeless encampments on public lands. An executive order signed by President Donald Trump is aiming to combat crime involving homelessness throughout the country, with cities such as Las Vegas seeing a crisis surrounding encampments overtaking communities and crippling the local area. Sin City has seen an uptick in homelessness throughout the community, with a 20% increase within Clark County in 2024, according to the most recent data from the Southern Nevada Homeless Continuum of Care. Outreach workers from Help of Southern Nevada check out a homeless encampment on July 9, 2024, in Las Vegas. The increase comes as Clark County officials are looking to combat homelessness, but have reportedly hit roadblocks while acknowledging the city possesses the funding, yet lacks a concrete plan. "I mean, we have the resources but we do not have a specific plan," Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom said, according to News 3 Las Vegas. People camp along the Tropicana Wash near University Center Drive east of the Strip in Las Vegas on Sept. 5, 2023. So, unless somebody calls and tells us what is going on, a lot of times we have so much going on in the county that we do not have the ability to be there." Segerblom did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. The concept of a city having resources, but no concrete way of executing an effective plan, is not new, according to Marbut. "I only lost one project [in two decades] because of money," Marbut told Fox News Digital. "Every other city that decides not to do something, it's the lack of political will of the leadership." Marbut pointed to two key groups within the city's homeless population serving as the cause of concern for local officials: individuals who remain unhoused on the streets, and those who are often in and out of hospitals. "And that group has a lot of people trying to say, ‘We just need more housing, we need affordable housing.' This is a group [that], even with affordable housing, can't keep their house." Charred debris from a homeless encampment is seen along Interstate 11 between the Boulder Highway and Charleston Boulevard interchanges, June 26, 2025, in Las Vegas. The issue of maintaining a rental is reflected in the numbers, with Clark County accounting for over 26,000 evictions since the start of this year, according to data from Eviction Lab. "They were saying, ‘We just want to keep building more affordable housing and we want to keep giving away free housing to people who are experiencing homelessness,'" Marbut said. Milton John Scott III pours a jug of water on his head to escape the heat and wash up at his shelter along North A Street on June 5, 2024, in Las Vegas. According to Marbut, street-level homelessness within Las Vegas continues to rise on an annual basis, with local leaders putting the bulk of their efforts into combating the crisis within the city's highly-trafficked tourism areas. "They are putting money into the street-level because of their self-interest," Marbut said. "That's what's motivating them, and if that's what it takes to get funding – to fund a good model – OK, go for it." The city reportedly pivoted to offering vouchers for free food and housing in past attempts to fight homelessness – an attempt that Marbut believes proved futile. "Clark County and Las Vegas kept doubling down on a program that wouldn't work," Marbut said. They kept, from my understanding, counting on the federal government money and some of their local money – there was somewhere between two and a half to four times more funding, depending on how you measure it, and it didn't make a dent. And sometimes when you have a bad program and you fund it with more money, it actually makes things worse." The issue has been exacerbated in recent weeks, with a local neighborhood on edge after a previously removed homeless encampment located in an empty parking lot across the street reportedly returned within days. "We are filled with trash, garbage and homeless people sleeping in the streets. Honestly, it wouldn't hurt the state to fix this problem." The apartment complex's tenants are reportedly fed up with the encampment, pointing to instances of fires being lit, trash being left out and even confrontations between homeless individuals and residents. "There was a dumpster fire at 3 a.m," Briana Talbot, property manager for Casa Bonita Apartments, told the outlet. Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley and Talbot did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. In light of the crisis sweeping the nation, Trump issued an executive order titled "Ending Crime and Disorder on America's Streets," in an effort to cut down on instances of violence involving homeless individuals. "Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order," the order states. The order authorizes the federal government to work with local and state offices throughout the country to implement treatment for homeless individuals, while targeting specific issues – such as squatting and illegal drug use – within communities. Trump's administration is also looking to ensure federal funding does not enable "safe consumption" policies, which allow homeless individuals to consume illegal drugs while supervised. The move is celebrated by Marbut, who believes it is a step in the right direction toward a federal policy on combating and treating homelessness. "What the president's order – and I applaud him for doing this – is saying, we're going to take a zero-tolerance approach to encampments," Marbut said. "So what the executive order is trying to do is stop these encampments under bridges, rivers, out in the open, downtown, back alleys, and get people in the real world. Real programs that really work and not doing gimmicks." You can follow her at @juliabonavita13 on all platforms and send story tips to julia.bonavita@fox.com.

Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., spoke with Fox News Digital about becoming chair of the National Governors Association (NGA) and his legacy as Oklahoma governor. As America approaches its 250th anniversary, the bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA) is focused on reigniting the American Dream, NGA Chair Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. "I've lived the American Dream," the Oklahoma governor said, explaining that Democratic and Republican governors "can all agree that we want to teach the next generation that America is exceptional, and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to." During the NGA's summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Stitt announced his marquee initiative as the incoming chair, focusing on the economy, education and investing in artificial intelligence. "There's no such thing as equal outcomes, but we want equal opportunities to go chase your dreams through hard work, through entrepreneurship and free markets," Stitt explained. Kevin Stitt arrives for a news conference on May 7, 2024, in Barnsdall, northeast Oklahoma. The NGA hosted Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this summer in Colorado Springs. Stitt said he hopes to feature more speakers at NGA events who embody the American Dream, mentioning Vice President JD Vance, former President Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and former California Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., shared his own American Dream story during the NGA's summer meeting, telling the crowd that the "American Dream is never a singular dream." "It's a dream that was born generations ago. It's a dream that was borne by people who, even if they did not know us, they fought for the hope of us. Wes Moore, D-Md., shake hands following a media availability at the summer meeting in Colorado Springs. Stitt said his own story reflects the American Dream, telling Fox News Digital that he grew his nationwide company from just "$1,000 and a computer" before being elected governor in 2018. The Oklahoma governor is term-limited this year. When asked about his legacy, Stitt said he is proud to have accomplished "education freedom" and becoming a top-10 state where people are moving. "We were having teacher walkouts, we were having billion-dollar budget deficits, we had no money in savings, and we had this kind of second-class feel as a state," Stitt said of his home state before he took office. "I'm a fourth-generation Oklahoman, and we weren't doing as well as we could have, and I wanted to bring this bravado." Looking ahead to next year, Stitt said he is monitoring the gubernatorial race closely as several candidates have already declared their candidacies. Jared Polis discussed American education with Education Secretary Linda McMahon at the NGA summer meeting in Colorado Springs on July 25, 2025. "Behind the scenes, I'm certainly going to let Oklahomans know who I think is the best one to replace me, but if we can get a couple of good businessman governors and people that are focused on the next generation, not the next election, we can absolutely keep this momentum in Oklahoma going, and we can continue to be a top-10 state," Stitt said. As for his own political future, Stitt said he plans to return to his company as "our Founding Fathers envisioned," adding that "politics shouldn't necessarily be a profession where to climb the ladder." "That's why Oklahomans are starting to thrive, because we're not making political decisions, we're making the right decisions for the citizens of Oklahoma."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giuliani's head of security Michael Ragusa said Sunday that Giuliani's rental car was struck from behind on a highway the night before. Troopers witnessed the crash, which caused both vehicles to hit the highway median and left them “heavily damaged,” state police said. State police said they are investigating the crash and no charges have been filed. Giuliani, 81, was taken to a nearby trauma center and was being treated for a fractured thoracic vertebra, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg, according to a statement posted on X by Michael Ragusa, Giuliani's head of security. Giuliani “sustained injuries but is in good spirits and recovering tremendously,” Ragusa said, adding: “This was not a targeted attack.” Prior to the accident, Giuliani had been “flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident” and contacted police assistance on her behalf, Ragusa said. After police arrived, Giuliani continued on his way and his vehicle was hit shortly after pulling onto the highway in a crash that was “entirely unrelated” to the domestic violence incident, Ragusa told The Associated Press in an emailed statement. Troopers and fire personnel quickly crossed to provide help. New Hampshire State Police declined to comment on whether Giuliani had contacted the agency regarding the account of a domestic violence incident. Goodman did not respond to requests for comment and Giuliani's team did not provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding the crash. “Thank you to all the people that have reached out since learning the news about my Father,” Andrew Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani's son, wrote in a post on X. The crash follows some rocky years for the onetime Republican presidential candidate, who was dubbed “America's mayor” in light of his leadership in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Giuliani later became President Donald Trump's personal attorney for a time and a vocal proponent of Trump's allegations of fraud in the 2020 election, won by Democrat Joe Biden. Two former Georgia elections workers later won a $148 million defamation judgment against Giuliani. As they sought to collect the judgment, the former federal prosecutor was found in contempt of court and faced a trial this winter over the ownership of some of his assets. He ultimately struck a deal that let him keep his homes and various belongings, including prized World Series rings, in exchange for unspecified compensation and a promise to stop speaking ill of the ex-election workers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>America's unions have had much to celebrate on recent Labor Days. President Donald Trump is trying to strip collective bargaining rights from approximately one million unionized federal workers. Just last week, he signed an executive order affecting union workers at federal agencies, including the National Weather Service and NASA, citing national security concerns. Earlier this year a similar order targeted unions at, among others, the departments of state, defense, justice and health and human services. And because of the importance of public sector unions to the broader US labor movement, Trump's moves could deal a massive blow to the union momentum that had been growing under President Joe Biden. She said the labor federation fears what is going on with federal workers will expand to corporate America. Labor leaders are concerned the Trump administration's attack on federal workers and their unions will not only threaten labor's political influence, but also their ability organize and win contract gains across all types of American employers. “I think that what he's doing, he is using the federal sector as a test (case), right?” Everett Kelley, president of American Federation of Government Employees, told CNN. I think whether it's private sector or public sector, you're going to see more and more of it.” For years, unions struggled as their economic and political clout waned. Only 10% of US workers now belong to unions, down from 20% in 1983. But concerns over working conditions during the pandemic increased grassroots support for unions. And a strong job market in the years that followed, with more job openings than job seekers at times, helped embolden workers who might have been nervous otherwise about organizing efforts. That led to a number of high-profile unionizations at large employers such as Amazon, Starbucks, Apple and Volkswagen's US factory, breathing new life into the union movement. While many of these new unions are still fighting for their first contracts, workers did win their first agreement at an Apple store in 2024. Even just the threat of a strike scored big contracts at UPS, Costco and many airlines. His appointees to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees labor relations at most US businesses, issued a number of pro-union decisions while he was in office. But in 2024, 45% of union households voted for Trump, according to CNN exit polls. However, his policies have been anything but pro-union. Shortly after taking office in January, the president fired an NLRB member in an unprecedented move, saying she was not doing enough to support employers. Then in March, Trump signed an executive order stating that the federal government would no longer recognizing the right of wide swaths of federal employees to collective bargaining. The order not only stripped workers of union protections but also stopped them from automatically deducting union dues from their paychecks. The AFGE has already been forced to cut about a third of its staff due to the financial hit. Trump has made it clear he's taking this action in part to weaken federal unions, who have “declared war on President Trump's agenda” and “block Trump policies,” according to a White House fact sheet issued at that time. “President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests,” it said. Trump is the not the first president elected with blue collar union support to take action against a federal union. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fired the nation's air traffic controllers when their union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), went on strike. Until that time, the hiring of replacement workers during strikes, while legal, was rare. But after PATCO, the practice became common practice by American businesses and was a major factor in the weakening of unions overall. The concern now is that, like the PATCO firings by Reagan, businesses that were already battling unions will pattern themselves after the federal government and take more aggressive steps. “If you think about canceling collective bargaining rights for nearly a million people with the stroke of a pen, you know this a problem for the whole movement.” Federal unions have filed numerous lawsuits contesting Trump's actions. So far, the rulings have been mixed, and no case has yet reached a final conclusion. And union officials say they're ready to take the fight to the private sector, too, if needed. If public and private employers “think, ‘It's open season on unions,' they should think again,” said Matt Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which represents a large number of civilian workers in the Defense Department.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Active shooter alerts at Villanova University in Pennsylvania and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga sent panicked students preparing for the new school year scrambling for cover as first responders swarmed campuses on August 21. Law enforcement faces the challenge of sorting fact from fiction in real time as swatters employ tools like AI to bolster their hoax in a hypersensitive climate surrounding mass shootings. But catching those responsible for making these calls can sometimes take months, or longer, as many of them originate from overseas, using Voice over Internet Protocol services, which further complicate investigations and prolong suspect identification efforts. “These aren't just somebody down the street who makes a call because they don't want to go to gym class or take a test in English,” Katherine Schweit, a retired FBI executive, told CNN on Wednesday. “In many cases, we have just as likely a person who is making a phone call who might be across the world, on the other side of the world, or in another country, who is being paid to do harassing phone calls to places.” “So how do we actually collect that and prevent it? The Virtual Command Center operates as a web-based information sharing system that provides real-time situational awareness “for critical and non-critical incident management” in partnership with state and local authorities, according to the agency. “If a law enforcement agency or federal, state, local, tribal agency gets information from school or from a business, from a university, they can share that information immediately into databases so that we can see commonalities, and that helps us,” Schweit said. “Having nationwide data in a centralized location helps law enforcement track possible trends, better understand various tactics, and offers increased collaboration between agencies to mitigate criminal activities associated with swatting,” the FBI said. “Knowingly providing false information to emergency service agencies about a possible threat to life drains law enforcement resources, costs thousands of dollars, and, most importantly, puts innocent people at risk. We work closely with our law enforcement partners to determine their credibility, share information, and take appropriate investigative action,” the agency added. Several relevant federal criminal statutes enable the prosecution of swatting incidents, including laws outlawing injuring or kidnapping threats and bomb threats. The advance of technology, such as Voice over Internet Protocol services, makes it much more difficult to trace phone calls and has made these hoaxes more elaborate and harder to track, John DeCarlo, former police chief of Branford, Connecticut, and a professor of criminology at the University of New Haven, told CNN. Swatters often use online call “spoofing” services that in turn use several VoIP accounts, which let the swatter make phone calls using the internet. The VoIP accounts are also often created and accessed using a variety of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxy services, which allow users to “conceal their IP address by redirecting internet traffic through intermediary machines,” according to a criminal complaint in one 2017 case. Additionally, AI has made it easier than ever to fake someone's voice for a hoax phone call, DeCarlo said. “It's now easy and quick to clone someone's voice using AI tools, which now require less than 15 seconds of someone's voice to create a believable voice clone,” Rachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security, a firm that trains companies' employees to defend against such attacks, told CNN. “What's most concerning is that with AI-powered clones, seeing – or hearing – is no longer believing, and even trained professionals can be fooled, especially when a familiar voice makes an urgent request,” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at cybersecurity firm McAfee, told CNN. We can't rely on our own instincts anymore.” Schweit, the retired FBI executive, said trade-offs often have to be made when balancing the amount of investigative effort put into locating hoax callers. What is this costing versus the other higher priority matters that we have?” she explained. Although difficult to investigate, law enforcement has found some success catching those responsible, with US officials often working with international partners to arrest overseas suspects. Some high-profile swatters have faced legal consequences, including two men from Serbia and Romania who prosecutors say made hundreds of fake calls to US officials, and three men involved in the swatting of an unrelated man in Wichita, Kansas, whom police fatally shot when they arrived. The teen had become a “serial swatter for both profit and recreation,” according to the FBI, placing posts on social media advertising his services and swatting-for-a-fee structure. “If somebody is calling from overseas and they're calling from a phone bank of people who are paid, you know, a few pennies to harass people in the United States as part of a more complicated political operative operation in their country - we're not going to catch those people,” she said. “But if it's somebody who's local and they're making phone calls, this is where technology does help us.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US State Department has instructed its diplomats to refuse most visas for Palestinian passport holders, whether they live in the West Bank, Gaza, or overseas, according to a cable seen by CNN. The internal message, dated August 18 and signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, told all embassies and consulates to refuse nonimmigrant visas to “all otherwise eligible Palestinian Authority passport holders” who are using that passport to apply for a visa. The posts were instructed to do so “effective immediately.” On August 16, the State Department said that “all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza” were suspended pending a review. On Friday, the agency announced it was revoking and denying visas for members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian Authority (PA), including PA President Mahmoud Abbas, ahead of the United Nations General Assembly. The restrictions come as a number of countries prepare to recognize a Palestinian state and the war in Gaza continues to rage. “The Trump administration is taking concrete steps in compliance with U.S. law and our national security in regards to announced visa restrictions and revocations for PA passport holders,” a State Department spokesperson said. “Every visa decision is a national security decision, and the State Department is vetting and adjudicating visa decisions for PA passport holders accordingly.” According to the cable, the refusal policy does not apply to Palestinians applying for immigrant visas or those applying for nonimmigrant visas using a different passport. “This guidance does include visa applicants for diplomatic or official type visas and for individuals engaging in diplomatic and official travel purposes applying with Palestinian Authority passports,” it said.</p>
