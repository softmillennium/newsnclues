China has just drawn its battle lines in a new frontier of computing. In August, the government published a sweeping policy document (“Implementation Plan for Promoting Innovation and Development of the brain-computer interface (BCI) Industry”) laying out its ambition to build an internationally competitive BCI industry within five years. The blueprint — which illustrates that Beijing hopes to do more than play catch-up with U.S. outfits like Neuralink and Synchron — is unusually aggressive by global standards. Jointly authored by seven ministries, it integrates industrial planning, medical regulation, and research oversight into a single, coordinated playbook. In the U.S., companies face a gauntlet of FDA trials and compliance requirements. “We know that China is strong at translating basic research into practical uses and commercialization. We've seen that in other industries, such as photovoltaics and electric cars. Now BCI is another area where that's going to be critical,” said Max Riesenhuber, a professor of neuroscience and codirector of the Center for Neuroengineering at Georgetown University Medical Center, speaking to reporters from WIRED. The roadmap is unusually detailed, laying out 17 specific measures that range from core R&D to commercialization. Priorities include developing ultralow-power implantable chips, refining electrode materials to minimize scarring, creating algorithms for real-time decoding of thought into commands, and scaling up manufacturing lines for non-invasive wearables. State media describe plans for “significant progress in the development of BCI chips” and high-performance communications silicon designed to filter and transmit neural signals in real time. Meanwhile, Xinhua has recently reported that Chinese teams have developed independently designed cortical electrodes with 128 simultaneous channels, designed to remain stable when implanted, which ultimately minimizes scarring and extends the useful life of implants. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. While consumer applications grab headlines, the blueprint estimates that one to two million Chinese patients could benefit from BCIs as assistive technology. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that there's serious momentum behind China's plans: Patients implanted with these cortical arrays have navigated smartphone apps and played chess with neural inputs. Naturally, China's BCI blueprint also looks beyond medical applications toward the consumer markets. The policy explicitly backs non-invasive wearables that could monitor driver alertness or detect workplace hazards in energy and mining. “I think noninvasive BCI products will get a huge market boost in China, because China is the biggest consumer electronics manufacturing country,” said Phoenix Peng, co-founder of BCI leader NeuroXess, speaking to WIRED. The U.S. might still lead in high-profile BCI start-ups, but China now has a coordinated national plan, backed by its industrial machine and strong semiconductor ambitions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Seattle nonprofit is aiming to provide a structured pathway for Black startup founders, offering support that includes networking, mentorship and guidance on raising venture capital funding. Entrepreneurs apply and enter at whichever phase they're ready to join. SEA619, which combines references to Seattle and the Juneteenth holiday honoring the emancipation of enslaved people, has been accepting pre-applications to gauge interest and connect with potential participants. On Monday, SEA619 started its official application process and programming starts in October. He was inspired by engaging with founders and creators who had great ideas but lacked the resources or experience to develop them into a product or business. He was also juggling a stream of requests for professional advice, and seeing other mentors with the same challenge. The effort aligns with Gürsel's long-held values around helping his community. “I was raised in Brooklyn where we were always taught, those of us who make it forward always have to go back and get those who didn't,” he said, adding that a guiding principle for the effort is “We lift as we climb.” Years ago, Gürsel advised companies participating in the now-defunct Seattle Techstars. “A lot of entrepreneurs need a crash course in startup building BEFORE they join programs like Techstars, 500 Startups, [Y Combinator] and the like.” “If a founder chooses the VC path, SEA619 is equipped to help them truly understand and prepare for the positioning, pitch and vision a venture investor expects.” One piece of Gürsel's strategy is meeting and partnering with venture capitalists in African countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa who are interested in backing U.S. startups. The program is led by Evan Poncelet, who is CEO of the Washington State Black Angel Network and previously worked as an engineer at Fluke and Cicso. SEA619 kicks off at a time when the Trump administration has worked to squelch wide-ranging efforts supporting diversity and equity in education, healthcare and the corporate world. Gürsel said that SEA619 is not discriminatory but aims to serve a specific audience. “I'm not worried about an administration that's based in hate when the work that we're doing is based in love and lifting people up,” Gürsel said. One thing I'm not going to do is stop serving my community. There's nothing that they can do to make me stop.” As featured on the GeekWire Podcast, Money Hacks is a financial education series from GeekWire and BECU, the member-owned, not-for-profit credit union.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. You head into the store or browse online and suddenly there are models selling for well over $1,000, and the sound isn't even always that incredible. This compact Bose TV Speaker not only enhances your TV's sound but it also doubles as a living room Bluetooth speaker that you can control right from your phone. Here's what makes this such a no-brainer right now: the Bose TV Speaker is down to $163 on Amazon, from $279. Bose designed this soundbar to integrate easily into your living room without cables, complicated receivers or endless setup menus. At just over two inches tall and a little under two feet wide, it fits neatly right in front of almost any flat-screen TV without blocking the view. If you'd rather mount it instead, those brackets are available but even leaving it on a console looks clean and unobtrusive. Yet it is not just about looks: it is also about transforming the way you hear your films and shows. The speaker uses two angled full-range drivers to open the soundstage beyond what you would expect for something so compact. That means explosions during an action scene have real depth, and sweeping scores in dramas are more immersive. The difference is immediate: TV programming no longer sounds flat. This Bose TV speaker is engineered to focus on dialogue and sharpens those mid-tones so voices come through naturally without cranking the volume. It wouldn't be a modern Bose product without Bluetooth: With wireless connectivity built-in, it's easy to switch from TV to music streaming. It can remember three input sources, and the one that turns on first will connect automatically for as easy an experience as you can have. Add in the possibility of a bass boost through the remote if you prefer a bit more depth, and you're ready for gaming marathons and casual playlists alike.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York-based Runway is known for its video and photo generation AI world models, or large language models that create a simulated version of the real world. “We think that this ability to simulate the world is broadly useful beyond entertainment, even though entertainment is an ever increasing and big area for us,” Germanidis said. “It makes it much more scalable and cost effective to train [robotic] policies that interact with the real world whether that's in robotics or in self driving.” Germanidis said working with robotics and self-driving car companies was not something Runway initially envisioned when it launched back in 2018. It wasn't until robotics and other companies in other industries reached out, that the company realized their models had much broader use cases than they originally thought, he said. Robotics companies are using Runway's tech for training simulations, Germanidis said. While Runway knows it isn't going to replace real-world training by any means, Germanidis said companies can get a lot of value running simulations on Runway's models because they have the ability to get incredibly specific. Unlike in real-world training, using these models makes it easier to test for specific variables and situations without changing anything else in the scenario, he added. “You can take a step back and then simulate the effect of different actions,” he said. For instance, Nvidia released the latest version of its Cosmos world models, in addition to other robot training infrastructure, earlier this month. The company doesn't anticipate releasing a “completely separate line of models” for its robotics and self-driving car customers, Germanidis said. Instead, Runway will fine-tune its existing models to better serve these industries. Germanidis added that while these industries weren't in the company's initial pitches to investors, they are on board with this expansion. Runway has raised more than $500 million from investors like Nvidia, Google and General Atlantic at a $3 billion valuation. Once you have those really powerful models, then you can use them for a wide variety of different markets, a variety of different industries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The unofficial end of summer brings with it bargains on WIRED-tested gear, including home office essentials and some of our favorite gadgets. Updated September 1, 2025: We've added 10 new deals from Steelcase, Solo Stove, JBL, Sonos, and more. It's a small discount, but our favorite Bluetooth speaker very rarely drops below this price. The deal varies slightly by color, but almost all of them are on sale. The JBL Flip 7 is durable, with IP68 dust and water resistance. You can even pair it with other JBL speakers. This beefy power bank is our favorite upgrade pick, and this price comes within $10 of the lowest we've tracked. The 25,000-mAh capacity and up to 165-watt delivery means it can top off your laptop, phone, or tablet on-the-go. Graphics options range all the way up to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and base storage starts at 1 terabyte—though, in a first for Razer, you can only choose an AMD CPU. Get more nitty-gritty details in our full review. PopSockets just dropped MagSafe cases for Kindles, letting you easily pop one of PopSocket's popular grips onto the back. It's a great way to customize your Kindle, and the new MagSafe cases make it easy to pop any PopGrip you like on and off the case. While the brand-new cases aren't for sale, buying one gets you 30 percent off any PopGrip you add to your cart, letting you make a matching set like the Curled Up With a Good Book PopCase ($40) and PopGrip ($30), or mix and match to your heart's desire. It only works for one PopGrip, but if you add multiple PopGrips to your cart, it'll apply the discount to the most expensive one. My personal favorite is the Heart of Silver ($40) which you can get a $12 discount on, but most PopGrips are $30 and will get a $9 discount.—Nena Farrell Round it all off with active noise canceling and long battery life, and you've got a recipe for some truly excellent buds. The discount makes them an even smarter purchase. This deal matches the best price we've seen for the 65-inch model, though other sizes are also discounted right now. It's got a uniform screen, great black levels, natural colors, and decent off-axis viewing. The Google TV operating system is easy to use, and there are bonus features for gamers too. The only thing we overtly dislike is the sound quality, but then again, you should have a soundbar anyway. I love this power bank so much that I purchased another at full price after misplacing my first one. I bring it with me to every festival. It's compact, but heavy, and it has a display that shows you power output, battery life, the charge level, and more. It's great because of its large 24,000-mAh capacity and up to 140-watt delivery, and because of its 3 ports (two USB-C, one USB-A). But my favorite part is that the battery itself charges lightning-fast. It can be topped off from empty to full in just about an hour—no more waiting overnight for your power bank to be ready. The price is exclusive to Amazon Prime Members. This deal is a match of the best we've seen for our top streaming stick pick. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus was just upgraded for 2025, and it's great. It's easy to set up, and the remote has voice controls so you can search by speaking. If you're on the hunt for a good 4K streaming stick, and you don't care about the lack of Dolby Vision support, this is a solid deal. This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite budget mesh Wi-Fi router. The Deco X20 has solid coverage and performance, especially with the three routers you'll get with this deal (though singles and two-packs are also on sale if you're in a small space). You can also split the two 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands, which will help if you're running any smart home devices that explicitly require one or the other. The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price. If you need an iPad that you can rely on for important tasks like work or school, this is a very safe bet. This tablet can handle multiple tasks running in the background and it'll get you about 10 hours of battery life per charge. For more recommendations, check out our guide to the Best iPad Accessories. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which may be a blessing or a curse depending on whom you ask. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further. These are the best noise-canceling earbuds we've tried. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort. It has gone on sale for $100 in the past, but $125 is a pretty good deal, since it regularly jumps up to full price. It also has a long-lasting battery and integrations with Google Wallet and Google Maps (though it can be used with iOS devices as well as Android). Some of the better features are locked behind a subscription that costs $10 per month, but the gadget still works without that subscription. The earbuds are comfortable to wear while you're sleeping, and they have 10-hour battery life and passive noise cancelation as well as excellent audio quality. There's a solid companion app, too, which lets you choose from different Sleep Sounds and access biometric data (which we have not yet tested). This is a solid deal on the best laptop docking station. The Satechi Dual Dock Stand slightly elevates your laptop for better ergonomics, and it has a collection of ports, including three monitor outputs, several USB ports, and a solid-state drive enclosure. It connects to your laptop via two USB-C cables. If you don't need a full-on docking station, check our guide to the Best USB Hubs. Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide. The prices vary slightly depending on the color you choose, but most of them are discounted for Labor Day weekend. The Gesture is comfortable, with a cushy seat and elegant adjustment options. Should you be looking for an office chair upgrade, and you want something a bit more luxurious than the Branch models we've mentioned, this is a choice worth considering. This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “This chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. You can easily take the cover off and pop it in the washing machine, or switch it out for another Ruggable cover to redecorate without having to buy a new rug entirely. Nearly everything on the website is 25 percent off right now. Simply swipe it back and forth across your furniture or carpets and be amazed at how much hair it collects. The Traeger Woodridge Pro is an excellent smoker. It's user-friendly, offering consistent temperature control with just a few buttons. It's easy to clean when your cookout is over. We wish the app was a bit more detailed, but it isn't required to produce delicious meals. (Seriously, just look at the photos in this review.) It also doesn't drop in price very often. If you want to try it out but want to spend a little less, we also liked the Dream Full mouth tape that's on sale today too. This sheet set feels soft and silky, but stays cool to the touch, making it a great option for hot sleepers. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. You can also get two pillows or a sheet set for free with your purchase. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations. The Buffy Breeze is one of my favorite comforters. It's cooling in the summer, and its lightweight warmth is just the right amount of comfy for hot nights. But in the winter, it still works well to keep you warm, especially if you throw another blanket on top of it. It isn't officially marketed as down alternative, but I do like it as an alternative to down. This sleep set from Buffy is a solid way to do it. You'll get the Buffy Cloud Comforter, Breeze Sheet Set, Breeze Duvet Cover, and two Cloud Pillows at a 30 percent discount. WIRED reviewer and bedding expert Nena Farrell uses the Cloud Comforter for almost all of her testing. She recommends the Breeze sheets in our cooling sheets buying guide, and the Cloud pillow in our pillows buying guide. This is one of our favorite organic mattresses and it's extremely customizable. Each side can have different levels of firmness—so if you prefer firm, but your bed partner prefers soft, you'll both be set. There's a cover that zips over the whole system, and you get a 100-night trial to swap the latex layers out so you can fine-tune your desired firmness. The mattress is made of organic cotton, latex, and wool, and it has the certifications we look for in organic mattresses. This is one of the best down comforters I've tried, and you can get it on sale ahead of the colder months ahead. The baffle box construction and Hutterite down clusters help ensure that you never have to worry about your blanket's insulation shifting around in your sleep. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets. Brooklyn Bedding is offering 30 percent off sitewide for its Labor Day sale. If you're a retired or active military member, you can get an additional 5 percent off by verifying through ID Me. We like a few different products from Brooklyn Bedding. Its CopperFlex 401 Mattress Topper is the best mattress topper overall, and it's on sale in the queen size for $419 ($180 off). Brooklyn Bedding also makes our favorite firm mattress, the Plank—on sale for $1,072 ($460 off). This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our couch buying guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. There are many different fabrics to choose from, and you can choose the stain of the wooden legs too. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing. We haven't tested most of the brands in the sale, but if you're shopping for something like guest bedroom linens or new dining room chairs, you might find what you're looking for. The Joybird Eliot Sleeper Sofa is comfy and has a slick, MCM silhouette. It's one of the best couches you can buy online. It's custom-made for you, with dozens of options and finishes available (including bright pink velvet, which I chose.) It has deep seats that can be removed to reveal a pull-out mattress (which is also surprisingly comfortable). The outside is covered in a soft fabric made with recycled water bottles, and the memory foam construction is nice and firm, with high sides so you can easily lean your head toward your shoulder. It also has a chin strap to prevent your head from falling forward. I like the built-in juice groove and the fact that I can still store it in my cupboards even though it's bigger than standard cutting boards. We love Cozy Earth's soft, super-comfortable products, and you can use coupon code WIRED to get 35 percent off almost everything on the website. The excellent Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set falls to $200 ($108 off)—they're our favorite splurge pick thanks to the soft, buttery bamboo construction, but the splurge is a bit smaller with our coupon code. We also recommend the women's pajama set, which is silky-soft and makes a great gift. Several colors of our favorite carry-on luggage are on sale right now. The Away Carry-On has long been a favorite of several WIRED reviewers. The four wheels can rotate fully, so you won't get stuck on sidewalks or stray cords. And what better time to pick one up than ahead of autumn, AKA the best time to hold a backyard campfire? It's small enough to tote around if needed, but large enough to comfortably gather around with a handful of friends. Curie's natural deodorant is an honorable mention in our buying guide. It caused me some irritation when I first started using it, but a few of my friends and family members really like the formula. It smells great and applies evenly, though you might experience some clothing stains if you apply it under a black t-shirt. A score of 5 is “recommended with reservations.” It's important to know what you're getting, and what you're getting is easy-to-clean cookware that works fine. I'd prefer to use two separate pans—a nonstick and a stainless steel—but I understand that some people want a one-and-done cooking companion. You'll get three pans in 12-, 10-, and 8-inch sizes, plus their matching lids. There's a reason why professional chefs reach for their trusty All-Clad constantly—this cookware is simply fantastic. These Factory Seconds items aren't in perfect condition. Each item has details listed on the product page. This sale is absolutely massive and worth checking out if you need a cookware upgrade of any kind. Might I suggest the 10.5-inch All-Clad Fry Pan for $70 ($80 off)? This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. You'll get the coffee maker itself, plus 20 B-Pods in a variety of flavors. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za. Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. This deal is for the automatically replenishing subscription bundle. Our favorite feeder pet camera goes on sale relatively often, but this is still a solid deal since it regularly jumps up to full price. It has 1080p streaming video, night vision up to 30 feet, two-way audio, and 8x zoom. What sets this camera apart is its treat- or food-dispensing capabilities. Fill up the container with your pet's chosen treats, and you can use the app to toss them remotely. The best features, like motion and sound alerts and 90 days of video storage, are locked behind a Petcube Care subscription which costs $10 per month. This is the best pickleball paddle if you play every day (or on a very regular basis). The closed-cell foam core is durable (it even has a lifetime warranty!) While it might take some getting used to, resident pickleball expert Martin Cizmar says this is the paddle he reaches for most often. Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go, manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. We haven't seen it sell for less. These chairs are surprisingly comfortable and easy to put together. This is the best price we've seen for it. We recommend a few other Helinox options in our buying guide, which are also on sale right now. The XPress 750 is our favorite ebike for folks on a budget. The frame is comfortable and the pedaling feels natural, so it feels more like a classic bike and less like a lean, mean electric machine. The range could be better, but you'll have no trouble zooming around your neighborhood at top speeds of 28 mph. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's 2 feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard. Julian still has to see how the couch fares in New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a 10-year warranty and available in four different fabric options. This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite Theragun. It's the same model used by many professional sports teams, and it has heat therapy as well as an optional cold therapy attachment (the latter is a separate purchase). It has red, blue, and near-infrared LEDs, plus vibration motors to help you relax during your three- or nine-minute sessions. We like the cordless, hands-free design, though we wish it had a few more bells and whistles like app controls or a battery indicator. The Plunge Original pool being used to refill squirt guns during a water fight, which is not its intended purpose. WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar liked this full-featured cold plunge tub almost as much as his top pick, and it's significantly cheaper. It has a sleek, modern aesthetic, and the acrylic walls are easy to clean. We regret to inform you that while it is unpleasant to submerge yourself in near-freezing water, it has a number of notable health and wellness benefits that our testers have personally felt. If you want a great-looking cold plunge tub and you don't want to overpay for it, this deal is worth checking out.

From PCs to consoles, patient gamers are often rewarded with falling console prices. Those who are willing to wait for their games see falling prices as interest in any game or generation of hardware wains. The current crop of consoles are all now more expensive than when they launched several years ago. Even Nintendo hasn't been immune to price increases. Its last-generation Switch launched at just $299 in 2017, but it's now between $320 and $340 depending on the retailer after an early-August price rise. We're approaching nearly five years since some of this hardware launched and it's much more expensive than it used to be - games included. That's prompted a serious outcry from the gaming community. This is the first ever generation where console prices have INCREASED, rather than fallen.Also, less console exclusives than any previous gen too.#PlayStation #GamingNews pic.twitter.com/K06PqWGlChAugust 29, 2025 However, it's also worth considering inflation as a major driver of these price increases, too. While typical inflation of a couple of percent a year would make older items at lower prices much more expensive if launched later, the last few years have seen rampant inflation. That original Xbox Series X launch price would be over $622 today. The Switch's 2017 launch at $299 would be more like $398 if launched today. That perhaps puts these price increases in context, even if it's hard to swallow how much more expensive everything seems to be in 2025. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. However, Ars has gone to the effort of crafting some charts to show how great the disparity is, and what we missed this generation. Indeed, prices are supposed to come down as production of the consoles ramps up, the process node matures and enhancements in manufacturing allow for reduced production costs that often become cost reduced models that appear as the console ages. It's clear that hasn't happened this time around. Considering game prices have also risen in recent years, it's hard not to think that at least some advantage is being taken of the situation, rather than it being purely driven by market forces.

With hackers on the corner of every internet space, having your stuff in an offline external hard drive is one of the safest things you could possibly do. From your precious documents to those irreplaceable photo memories, having them stored in an internet-less device means much less chance of being hacked. Seagate is a name you can trust when it comes to hard drives, and right now, their 24TB external hard drive is dropping jaws with a price that works out to just about $1.10 per gigabyte ($279) on Amazon. With 24 terabytes of capacity, you've got room for everything you need – thousands of photos, a metric ton of video, all your work files – without ever having to worry about having too little space in the future. What's cool about this Seagate hard drive is that it's super simple to use: No complicated software, just plug it in and you're good to go. The design is straightforward but solid, perfect for home or office, and it doesn't need a separate power plug since it gets its juice from the USB connection. Oh, and it also covers Rescue Data Recovery Services. So in the event something unexpected happens (like a crash or accidental delete), they can help recover your data. That's peace of mind you don't want to miss. At $279 today, this 24TB Seagate drive is a steal: Do the math by price per gigabyte and it's highly unlikely to find this kind of deal and especially from a high-profile brand with that extra recovery feature. If you'd like to have your data safe and have tons of space without taking out a second mortgage, this one's definitely going to be worth a look.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Intel has patented a technology it calls 'Software Defined Supercore' (SDC) that enables software to fuse the capabilities of multiple cores to assemble a virtual ultra-wide 'supercore' capable of improving single-thread performance, provided that it has enough parallel work. If the technology works as it is designed to, then Intel's future CPUs could offer faster single-thread performance in select applications that can use SDC. Intel's Software Defined Supercore (SDC) technologies combine two or more physical CPU cores to cooperate as a single high-performance virtual core by dividing a single thread's instructions into separate blocks and executing them in parallel. Each core runs a distinct portion of the program, while specialized synchronization and data-transfer instructions ensure that the original program order is preserved, maximizing instructions per clock (IPC) with minimal overhead. This approach is designed to improve single-thread performance without increasing clock speeds or building wide, monolithic cores, which can increase power consumption and/or transistor budgets. Modern x86 CPU cores can decode 4–6 instructions and then execute 8-9 micro-ops per cycle after the instructions are decoded into micro-ops, which achieves peak IPC performance for such processors. By contrast, Apple's custom Arm-based high-performance cores (e.g., Firestorm, Avalanche, Everest) can decode up to 8 instructions per cycle and then execute over 10 instructions per cycle under ideal conditions. This is why Apple's processors typically offer significantly higher single-threaded performance and lower power consumption compared to Arm counterparts. While it is technically possible to build an 8-way x86 CPU core (i.e., a superscalar x86 processor that can decode, issue, and retire up to 8 instructions per clock), in practice, it has not been done because of front-end bottlenecks as well as diminishing returns in terms of performance increase amid significant power and area costs. So, instead of building an 8-way x86 CPU core, Intel's SDC proposes pairing two or more 4-wide units to cooperate as one large core in cases where it makes sense. On the hardware side, each core in an SDC-enabled system includes a small dedicated hardware module that manages synchronization, register transfers, and memory ordering between paired cores. These modules utilize a reserved memory region — known as the wormhole address space — to coordinate live-in/live-out data and synchronization operations, ensuring that instructions from separate cores retire in the correct program order. The design supports both in-order and out-of-order cores, requiring minimal changes to the existing execution engine, which results in a compact design in terms of die space. It injects special instructions for flow control, register passing, and sync behavior, enabling the hardware to maintain execution integrity. Support by the operating system is crucial as the OS dynamically decides when to migrate a thread into or out of super-core mode based on runtime conditions to balance performance and core availability.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I first reviewed the original Urban Arrow in 2020, when my kids were 3 and 5. Back then, nothing delighted a couple of preschoolers more than strapping into a big, motorized cargo bike and scooting around town, shrieking, with the wind blowing in their tiny faces. When I picked up my 8-year-old two days ago, he crouched down in the box while sitting on the padded seats (with seat belts!) so that none of his friends would see him. All this to say: My Tern GSD and I are great friends, but I wish my kids were five years younger so I could've bought the FamilyNext Pro instead. Urban Arrow's new electric cargo bike has a lot of great upgrades, is easier to ride than ever, and is even more useful as my kids have gotten older. The box looks totally different—my friend asked if my bike had gotten longer somehow. It's longer and slimmer, with rounded corners instead of square ones, and there are now headlights on the bike. I can confirm that in my testing, both adults and kids had an easy time climbing in and out. However, Urban Arrow describes it as “an upside-down helmet,” and the foam cushioning did reassure me that even if I let the bike tip over, my kids or friends wouldn't just immediately hit the pavement. You can also replace the foam easily in the event of a crash or some other unsightly event. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It really is a safety issue when you're going fast with 60 to 150 pounds in the front box. I was cruising along at 20 mph and hit a pothole, and I just boinged right out of it. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This cargo ebike uses a by-now-typical Gen 4 Bosch Cargo Line smart system, with a 250-watt motor, a 545-Wh battery, and four assist modes—five if you include walk assist, which you can toggle on by pressing the down button as you're pushing the bike. (I can definitely feel the assist, although it's a little less helpful than you might expect.) I got about 20 miles of moderate riding with and without cargo on one charge, but that's fine, as there is room in the frame for a double battery. I would definitely recommend getting a double battery if you want to put serious miles and cargo on this bike, and are not just going a mile back and forth from school with giant cardboard dioramas in it. My test unit also has the Enviolo CVT hub, which is a pretty common shifting system on ebikes where balls rotate in a hub for stepless shifting. As someone who regularly carts heavy, fragile things around, I think it's indispensable, especially if you are often starting and stopping around cars. You just downshift at a standstill and up the assistance to get some momentum going; it supersedes the need for a throttle if you're smart about it. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I find 250 watts to be adequate for my needs of transporting stuff and kids on mostly flat ground, and I did test it by carrying 160 pounds of human and biking it up some steep 10 to 15 percent grade hills in my neighborhood. However, it does seem worth noting that Oregon is one of several states that allows 1,000-watt motors, and many here prefer a less natural-feeling (i.e., a more powerful) ride.

The upright seating geometry is comfortable when I'm waiting at a stoplight with four kids around me. The ergonomic handles are a positive pleasure to hold. It's pretty easy to lock it up on a bike rack if you lock it on the frame by the rear tire, and it also has an included Abus wheel lock for a little extra peace of mind if you're just waiting in front of the school for pickup. Considering that many commuter direct-to-consumer bikes weigh 50 to 60 pounds without a cargo box, I found it pretty astonishing that this enormous bike itself only weighs 112 pounds. It was relatively easy to move (as long as you don't forget when you actually have cargo in it) and easy to store, now that my garage door works again. Every morning, dozens of people set off with kids sitting on rear racks or come home with bikes strapped in Tow Haulers. Every morning, an extremely fit dad passes by my house at around 25 mph with his kid under a rain cover in an older Urban Arrow, and r/CargoBike has a ton of different tips and tricks to turn your cargo bike into your own personalized hauling machine. If you're a more experienced parent and cyclist who has a good place to store it and lock it up, I can't recommend the Urban Arrow FamilyNext Pro enough. Just an hour ago, as I was biking with my kid downtown for his haircut, an (ahem) blue-collar gentleman shouted at me, “Hey, you hauling gravel in that thing?” I could if I wanted to, sir!

DJI is a company most people are first familiar with through drones, but the company has expanded into cameras and portable power stations as a global reference point in those related spaces. Portable power stations have gotten extremely popular for a reason: they provide back-up power at the moment you need it whether that is for a night on the town with your buddies, unexpected winter blackouts or off-grid van life. This price is so low that brands like Anker, EcoFlow, or Jackery don't offer anything similar for less than $800. It provides 2200W of continuous power and can peak at 2600W so it can power an assortment of devices from laptops and cell phones to appliances or tools. One of the features that make the DJI Power 1000 a pleasure to use is its ultra-quiet operation: Rated at just 23 decibels, it's quieter than a whisper, so it won't disturb your environment whether you're working indoors or relaxing at the campsite. This is a big plus compared to many other power stations that can become noisy under load. If you want to take it further off-grid, this version can be paired with solar panels in order to generate clean and renewable power. The design is also easy to use: The power station also features an easy-to-read LCD screen that displays charging status, battery level and output wattage so you're always monitoring how much power you have left and where it's going. The carry handle and compact design make it easy to take with you which adds that extra layer of convenience for those who need to have power on the go. If you're looking for a portable power station that delivers solid performance without the premium price tag of its competitors, the DJI Power 1000 deserves your attention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Latam-GPT is new large language model being developed in and for Latin America. The project, led by the nonprofit Chilean National Center for Artificial Intelligence (CENIA), aims to help the region achieve technological independence by developing an open source AI model trained on Latin American languages and contexts. “This work cannot be undertaken by just one group or one country in Latin America: It is a challenge that requires everyone's participation,” says Álvaro Soto, director of CENIA, in an interview with WIRED en Español. “Latam-GPT is a project that seeks to create an open, free, and, above all, collaborative AI model. We've been working for two years with a very bottom-up process, bringing together citizens from different countries who want to collaborate. Recently, it has also seen some more top-down initiatives, with governments taking an interest and beginning to participate in the project.” The project stands out for its collaborative spirit. “We're not looking to compete with OpenAI, DeepSeek, or Google. We want a model specific to Latin America and the Caribbean, aware of the cultural requirements and challenges that this entails, such as understanding different dialects, the region's history, and unique cultural aspects,” explains Soto. This information base has enabled the development of a language model with 50 billion parameters, a scale that makes it comparable to GPT-3.5 and gives it a medium to high capacity to perform complex tasks such as reasoning, translation, and associations. Latam-GPT is being trained on a regional database that compiles information from 20 Latin American countries and Spain, with an impressive total of 2,645,500 documents. The idea is that, if we ask it about topics relevant to our region, its knowledge will be much deeper,” Soto explains. The first model is the starting point for developing a family of more advanced technologies in the future, including ones with image and video, and for scaling up to larger models. A group in Colombia could adapt it for the school education system or one in Brazil could adapt it for the health sector. With a projected investment of $10 million, the new center has a cluster of 12 nodes, each equipped with eight state-of-the-art NVIDIA H200 GPUs. This capacity, unprecedented in Chile and the region more broadly, not only enables large-scale model training in the country for the first time, it also encourages decentralization and energy efficiency. The first version of Latam-GPT will be launched this year. The model will be refined and expanded as new strategic partners join the effort and more robust data sets are integrated into it. The interview was edited for length and clarity. WIRED: Tech giants such as Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic have invested billions in their models. Álvaro Soto: Regardless of how powerful these other models may be, they are incapable of encompassing everything relevant to our reality. Given that these are new and very disruptive technologies, there is room and a need for us, in our region, to take advantage of their benefits and understand their risks. This also opens up possibilities for our researchers. Today, Latin American academics have few opportunities to interact in depth with these models. It is as if we wanted to study magnetic resonance imaging but didn't have a resonator. We have put a lot of emphasis on generating high-quality data. It's not just about volume, but also composition. We analyze regional diversity to ensure that the data does not come disproportionately from just one country, but that there is a balanced representation. We also analyze the diversity of topics—politics, sports, art, and other areas—to have a balanced corpus. At CENIA, we are already working on translators for Mapuche and Rapanui, and other groups in the region are doing the same with Guaraní. It is a clear example of something that we have to do ourselves, because no one else will. Could you tell us more about CENIA and how this initiative was established in Chile? One of the conclusions of the group was that there was a need to create an institution that would oversee the development of a synergistic and healthy AI ecosystem that encompassed science, technology transfer to industry, and social responsibility. How does a regional language model relate to an autonomous agent's ability to interact in a Latin American context? My career has focused on developing intelligence for physical machines. They are the most powerful tools we have, so my work is dedicated to understanding and contributing to the scientific and applied development of this type of technology. Models face issues around geopolitics and power that have been covered by media. What are the specific challenges in Latin America when it comes to these models? That said, one of the key areas we need to focus on is education. These technologies are going to change the skills required of younger generations. Rote learning will be less critical; what will be important is knowing how to use the knowledge of AI. We must prepare our young people for this, while also promoting the social sciences and critical thinking. If I had to choose where to apply these technologies, it would be in education, because it addresses the root cause of many of our problems. A project like this requires massive computing power. Is it realistic to think that our region can develop the necessary infrastructure? What implications does this have for the technological sovereignty of Latin America? Will we be technology developers and not simply consumers? Success would mean that Latam-GPT has played an important role in the development of artificial intelligence in this region. That different organizations can take this technology and apply it, for example, to education. That new generations of Latin Americans are better prepared because they had access to tools that spoke to them in their context, with their cultural references, with figures from our history, and not just using examples from other parts of the world. If we manage to give this technology a Latin American stamp and contribute to its development, the project will have been a great success. This interview was first published by Wired en Español.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's one of the standouts in the popular AI category known as vibe coding, which lets users guide AI models as they produce code, websites, or whole applications. Speaking to TechCrunch, Osika laid out a vision for Lovable as the best place to build software products: a platform that can take users — founders specifically — through all the stages of product development so they can build AI-native companies more easily. “If you're running a business, there are a lot of things you want to set up, like payments, understanding your users, and in the future, maybe even like ‘I need to incorporate my company,'” he said. In late June, Lovable released an agent to help users read files, debug errors, search the web, generate images, and locate files – a first step toward making good on that vision. Lovable says it now has more than 2.3 million active users, 180,000 of which are paying subscribers. “In the past, you could create a really great first draft using Lovable. AI-generated code has been criticized as overly brittle – better suited for demos than finished products – but Osika says he's not concerned. Right now, Lovable operates on other foundational models, including Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT-5. Those systems aren't exactly the same as Lovable, but it's easy to imagine either model company trying to steal Lovable's users with a strategic product shift. He told TechCrunch that Lovable is simply focused on building the best product and is able to do that by leveraging all the different types of AI model providers, whereas providers need to stick to their own models. “That puts us in a better position than them,” he continued, arguing that tapping into numerous foundation models gives its users “unmatched capabilities,” while also giving the company the flexibility to grow rapidly without carrying the weight of duplicative infrastructure. “The scope of what you can achieve is constantly expanding,” he continued. It's been only one month since Figma, one of Lovable's peers in the app-design space, launched its blockbuster IPO, reaching a $19.3 billion market cap on its opening day. When asked about Figma, Osika again said his company is focused on making the best product for its users. Lovable is already deeply tied to the Swedish tech market. Osika grew up in Stockholm and founded the company there. The company's list of investors, according to PitchBook, includes a list of top European firms and angel investors, like Stefan Lindeberg (Swedish, Nordic Game Ventures); Fredrik Hjelm (Swedish, founder of Guestit), Greens Ventures (Nordic), Hummingbird Ventures (London); and 20VC (London, founded by Harry Stebbings, who launched Project Europe to funnel more investments into the ecosystem). “The success of Lovable and other European AI unicorns is a success for all of Europe,” said Shamillah Bankiya, a principal at the UK's Dawn Capital, in an interview with TechCrunch. Though not an investor, her firm has followed Osika as a founder for a while and has invested in other AI companies through Dawn. Many European tech companies eventually find themselves migrating to the States for more capital and access to opportunities – but Osika doesn't see Lovable as one of them, for now. Dennis Green-Lieber's Danish customer intelligence company, Propane.ai, just received an investment from Osika as part of its $1.2 million pre-seed round. Green-Lieber said that Lovable proves what many in the Nordic scene already feel: They, too, have world-class talent and can play on the global stage. “Yes, we've had giants like Zendesk, Unity, Klarna, and Spotify over the past decade, but what Lovable shows is that with small teams, a global mindset, and relentless effort, you can still build a category-defining company,” he continued.
