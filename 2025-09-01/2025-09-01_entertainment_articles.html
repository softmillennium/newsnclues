                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the second time this year, CBS' freshman sudser Beyond the Gates is in repeats for a holiday week. Beginning today, the soap will air episodes 45 through 49 before returning to originals on September 8. Before CBS Prods and Procter & Gamble developed BTS, week-long breaks weren't common for daytime dramas. Typically, the sudsers only break for a day. Besides the fact that it's the first soap to be launched since Passions in 1999, it also premiered in February and is on a different production and air cycle. Ardent fans have tried to remind others of the circumstances, but that hasn't stopped some from worrying about the future of the drama from Michele Val Jean. Only 200 episodes were ordered for #BeyondTheGates' first season, while other soaps air about 240 eps/year. This is typical for a first season! But, make sure you support so we get that FULL season 2 order. üëÄCheck out the new #TGKPod where we talk this!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Noah Baumbach, Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Patrick Wilson and Nicholas Britell discussed their film, which had its North American premiere in the Rockies, with The Hollywood Reporter's Scott Feinberg. But a large coterie of Clooney's collaborators on the film were in town ‚Äî among them co-writer/director Noah Baumbach, actors Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson, and composer Nicholas Britell ‚Äî and basked in the warm reception and awards chatter that greeted the Netflix title at its four festival screenings, two of which followed career tributes to Baumbach. Telluride Awards Analysis: 'Hamnet,' Chlo√© Zhao's Pic About the Shakespeares' Love and Loss, Is Talk of Fest We discussed why Baumbach and Emily Mortimer wrote the part of Kelly with Clooney in mind, and why it was a gutsy decision for the A-lister to agree to take it on; what Sandler drew upon to formulate his portrayal of Kelly's manager, Ron, for which the Sand-man is receiving some of the best reviews of his career and looks like a strong bet to land his first Oscar nom; how Crudup, who plays a former acting school classmate of Kelly's, Timothy, prepared for his brief but complex scene in the film, which elicited mid-movie applause at every screening; plus more. A transcript of the conversation, lightly edited for clarity and brevity, appears below. Also, some might wonder: why center it on a famous movie star rather than, say, a famous writer-director who also occasionally receives career tributes of his own? [laughs] I don't know, I found it compelling, this notion of a movie star who has some kind of crisis and goes on a journey ‚Äî an actual journey into the world, and also a journey into himself. She asked all the right questions, and then, just on a whim, I was like, ‚ÄúDo you want to do this with me? It was a year or so that we really just worked on and shaped the movie. My understanding is that you two wrote it with George in mind for the title role, which begs the question: what would you have done if George had said no? I can understand why he might have: Jay Kelly, like George, is an actor from Kentucky, often described as the last ‚Äúreal‚Äù movie star, and shares a number of other things in common with him ‚Äî but Jay also has some attributes that aren't great, and some people might assume that Jay is George. I mean, it's a character who's running from himself, and he's very good at deflecting and hiding, but as we see in the movie, these memories come at him. We described the memories as ‚Äúheadwinds.‚Äù The actor who was playing Jay Kelly had to then start to reveal more of himself, which requires vulnerability. To answer your other question, I don't know [what we would have done if George had said no]. I think we wouldn't have made the movie. There's another actor in this film who we've known and loved for decades ‚Äî actually several ‚Äî and not all of this guy's movies have gotten the critical respect that Jay Kelly is getting, but he's brought a lot of people a lot of joy over a lot of years‚Äî But I'm not sure that he has gotten the credit that he deserves for stretching himself as much as he has in films like Punch-Drunk Love, Spanglish, Reign Over Me, Noah's film The Meyerowitz Stories, Uncut Gems and Hustle. Noah, for the part of Ron, why did you go back to Adam Sandler? BAUMBACH Adam and I fell in love with each other on The Meyerowitz Stories ‚Äî we became very close; our families are close and love each other; and my son, Rohmer, who's here, basically lives at Adam's house half the year. The character of Ron, I wrote for Adam ‚Äî even though you might think that Adam is more like Jay Kelly [because he's a movie star] ‚Äî because of the way Adam is in the world, with his heart and his generosity and his loyalty. I felt like, ‚ÄúWell, that's what Ron is like, and Adam, in a way, could play something that is close to him, but in disguise.‚Äù That was really exciting to me, and also a way to pay tribute to the Adam I know and love. But also, having been in the business for as long as you have, you've had an up-close view of the actor/manager relationship, with all of its friend/employee complexities, and I wondered if that particularly informed the way you approached this guy? He writes the most beautiful lines, and we get to say them, so thank you. Yes, over the years I've had a team, similar to Jay Kelly. Imagine every morning going, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck can I do? !‚Äù But I really loved being this guy who just loves his client and feels that they're in it together ‚Äî he feels the same successes, and when something goes wrong he feels the same pain. When things go wrong, they are definitely shook up. Adam, as Noah alluded to, you've been exceptionally the opposite of Jay Kelly, in terms of casting people that you've known forever in your films and being very present with your family ‚Äî I think your whole family was in Happy Gilmore 2 earlier this year! But even with that being the case, has being part of this movie, watching it and thinking about it, made you look at your role as a movie star, or movie stardom in general, any differently than you had before? SANDLER I think what the movie is saying is that not just movie stars, but anybody who wants to do their best, has to put time in to their work, and when you do that, you are away from your family, and you know your family's still going on, and you want to get to them. I definitely have schlepped my family all over the world wherever I go, but there are times when they can't come. Jay Kelly not getting to be with his family, and looking back and knowing how painful it was for them, is crushing. Another person who has some history with Noah ‚Äî namely, the movie Marriage Story, for which she won an Academy Award ‚Äî is Laura Dern. Laura, similar to Adam, you've been at the highest levels of this business for so many years. Has this film made you think differently about stardom? So before Jay Kelly can get to, ‚ÄúI want another one,‚Äù there's the cost for Ron, what he's lost in life by being of service to Jay. And so my character [Kelly's publicist] is helping Ron's journey of getting to the place where he's also willing to get off the train. I, too, have had the good fortune of being surrounded by publicists. Billy, it seems to me like your assignment must have fet very daunting: you have to come in and, in a relatively short amount of time, provide the motivation for Jay's existential crisis. You have to understand, I've been in New York for over 30 years now, and Noah is a fixture of the independent cinema scene there, and every one of my friends has worked with him at some point or another. And it seems like the rest of your movie is predicated on that being successful.‚Äù [laughs] So, ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù was really my question to him, and we had a lot of conversations. Most of my friends are actors, and result-oriented acting ‚Äî where you just think, ‚ÄúOh, this is the scene where my character cries‚Äù ‚Äî is anathema to everything that we do. I thought, ‚ÄúThat's going to be a problem.‚Äù Noah was very considerate and understanding that I was desperate to work with him, but that I really did not know how to pull this off. Then, about two or three weeks before we were going to shoot this scene, I noticed that the scene hadn't changed at all, and that I was going to have to figure out some solution. So I started doing research on Method acting, and sure enough, Noah had constructed this scene in such a way that the scene actually plays itself, it leads you in the right direction. I don't know how many takes we did, but it was probably over 50 on both sides ‚Äî and there wasn't a second of it that I wasn't in absolute heaven. I wonder if you can talk about that, and specifically about the very memorable scene that you shared with Mr. Sandler. And Ben didn't know anything, nor did he need to know anything, so that was an interesting exercise for me, but a glorious one, because the words that I had been given said everything that I needed to know. Just working with Adam has been this crazy dream of mine, because I don't live in the comedy space. It was a double-whammy for me to work with Adam and Noah, two people that I revere so much. It can make you feel uncomfortable when you're only coming in for a couple of days, but I was given such support by Noah and the crew. We did 30 different versions with shit flying off the table, and I was looking across the table at this guy who was wiped out every single take. I did have to fire an agent once years ago, but it wasn't like that! We are going to close with the great composer Nicholas Britell, who everyone knows from the theme of Succession, the scores of Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk and Don't Look Up, and so much else. Nick, I was fascinated to learn that on this project, perhaps unlike any other on which you've worked, your music was in place before some of the scenes were even shot. This was something that I'd never done before, getting involved in a project so early. It was such a special thing for me to sort of absorb the atmosphere. And it was important, I think, for everybody, sort of like osmosis ‚Äî you feel the world that you're going to be a part of creating. I just had a blast from start to finish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sticks, stones, body blows and multiple knees to the head may break his bones, but names are what do real damage to pioneering UFC fighter Mark Kerr, a beast of a man who could crush opponents in the ring and fall apart as soon as he stepped outside it. Amanda Seyfried Borrows Julia Roberts' Versace Look for Venice Film Festival: "Sharing Is Caring" Venue: Venice Film Festival (Competition)Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Ryan Bader, Bas RuttenDirector, screenwriter, editor: Benny Safdie Marking the director's first feature made apart from his brother, Josh, the film retains much of what rendered the Safdies' work so original: a stylized moody realism; a cast mixing trained actors with regular people; an overall downbeat vibe enlivened by flashes of raw humor and energy; and stories carried by protagonists often addicted to something, whether it's theft (The Pleasure of Being Robbed, Good Time), drugs (Heaven Knows What) or gambling (Uncut Gems). Sports have also been a Safdie staple, from their melancholic b-ball doc Lenny Cooke to Adam Sandler's obsession with the NBA in Gems, and this may explain why both bros chose to make solo debuts about two very particular kinds of professional athletes. In Josh's case, that would be a 1950s table tennis star in his upcoming Marty Supreme, whereas Benny focuses here on an ex-college wrestler duking it out in the early years of the UFC, when fighters were far from household names and the sport wasn't yet a billion-dollar behemoth (not to mention a favorite of America's current president). Set between 1997 and 2000, a period which saw Kerr punching, headbutting and grappling his way through tournaments in the U.S., Brazil and Japan, Safdie's script underscores how the UFC started as a fringe organization whose poorly paid brawls usually ended in blood. The violence is what both repelled and attracted the public, and it eventually takes its toll on Kerr, who practices mixed martial arts as a discipline requiring rigorous training, which he does with best bud and fellow MMA fighter Mark Coleman. The latter is played by former UFC fighter Ryan Bader in a convincingly grounded performance, while Kerr's trainer for his final bouts is played by UFC legend Bas Rutten. (Johnson's were impressively created by prosthetic designer Kazu Hiro, who makes the actor nearly unrecognizable.) In fact, Kerr is such a sweetheart that he tends to gets stomped on by his longtime girlfriend, Dawn (Emily Blunt), who winds up posing a greater threat to him than any of his opponents. This isn't to say she's solely responsible for all the domestic drama: Kerr is under so much pressure that he can be impossible to live with, going from intensive training periods when he judges how well Dawn makes his protein shakes in the morning, to opiate-fueled binges that leave him comatose on the bathroom floor. In truth it's a movie much less about athletic victory than human vulnerability, and thus falls in line with other Safdie bros flicks about likable losers getting hammered by everything life tosses at them. Johnson has rarely played a loser, but he's always been likable, displaying a massive grin to match his massive pecs in action vehicles that never allowed him to showcase much range. Like Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler ‚Äî a film from which Safdie seems to take a few cues ‚Äî the actor delivers an intoxicating mix of blood, sweat, tears, protein and total helplessness. Those elements fuel Kerr as he finally kicks his opiate habit and makes his way to the kind of finale you'd expect from any good fight flick, with the chance to face his bestie Coleman in a Tokyo-set championship organized by Pride (a rival Japanese group that the UFC swallowed up in 2007). Realism is also a big part of the film's grungy and unflashy aesthetic. DP Maceo Bishop (who worked with Safdie on his Showtime series, The Curse) captures the action documentary-style with long lenses and lots of grain, while production designer James Chinlund highlights how unglamorous Kerr's world is, from the chintzy ballroom arena where he wins his first MMA fights to the bland Arizona home he shares with Dawn. Excluding some of the drama with Dawn, which goes a bit overboard in the last act, Safdie succeeds in making Kerr's struggles as lifelike as possible. When, in a late switcheroo that's yet another fit of realism, the actual Kerr briefly replaces Johnson, it's 25 years later and he looks nothing like the man we've been watching.

Headlining action-movie idol and wrestler Dwayne Johnson drops ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù from his identity in all senses to reveal a heartfelt core in Benny Safdie's nimbly executed and oddly endearing ‚ÄúThe Smashing Machine.‚Äù Johnson, rarely considered a quote-unquote serious actor but most certainly a bona fide movie star thanks to the ‚ÄúFast and the Furious‚Äù films and an abundance of popcorn outings often dismissed by critics, emotionally strips down to play pioneering MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the hole of painkiller addiction while trying to mount a post-rehab comeback. Safdie's first solo-directed feature after helming episodes of TV's ‚ÄúThe Curse‚Äù and creatively breaking up with his brother Josh sounds like the stuff of awards-season bait: An actor going out of his range to play a tortured athletic soul, physically transformed in a steroidal, vein-bulged-muscles sense, on the rocky path to redemption. But ‚ÄúThe Smashing Machine‚Äù is not that, nor is it ‚ÄúThe Wrestler,‚Äù either (but that a Bruce Springsteen song also plays in this film at a moment of Mark's rock bottom will put you in the headspace of Darren Aronofsky's melodrama). All of that is to say while ‚ÄúSmashing Machine‚Äù doesn't play like easy awards catnip, Johnson earns a sizable position among this year's prize-seekers. While a creative parting of ways has seen mixed success for other auteuristic brother-director pairings (see: the Coens) and makes you wish the gang would just get the hell back together again, Safdie's solo outing post-Josh stands on its own. It also signals hopes for when his brother premieres another A24 movie, ‚ÄúMarty Supreme,‚Äù in December. That sense of invincibility, however, is a suit of armor, as outside the octagon (where the mixed martial art plays out), he's nursing a dependency on opioids that frequently leads to him mentally dropping out, his eyes gone dark. There's also a torrent of rage in him that, when triggered into reaction by a needy and dejected Dawn who tends toward feeling shut out, trips a grenade within and risks doors being torn off their hinges in the middle-class Arizona ranch he shares with her. When he elicits painkillers after a fight gone bad and is only offered Advil, he adorably asks Dawn, ‚ÄúWould you like some?‚Äù But the ask, the minor panic over a craving unsated, also indicates a scratchy need that may gouge him out. ‚ÄúI think I miss taking care of him,‚Äù Dawn tells a friend after he checks into an outpatient clinic, hoping for 30 clean days before his next fight in Japan. Safdie shoots on-location in Tokyo, wending DP Maceo Bishop's handheld, docudrama-style camera ‚Äî and ‚ÄúThe Smashing Machine‚Äù can often tend toward resembling a docu- or even mockumentary about a sensitive athlete ‚Äî through the narrow-alleyed Golden Gai district of shanty pubs whose low ceilings Johnson (who, at 6-foot-5, is a few inches taller than the real Mark Kerr) could likely never clear. Then, there's a suite of modern-day fighters making their screen debuts as Kerr's most worrisome adversaries, including Oleksandr Usyk and Satoshi Ishii. As ‚ÄúThe Smashing Machine‚Äù spans 1997 to 2022 in a nifty but distracting fourth-wall-breaking cameo, some of these fights and their gruesome particulars lose specificity in their own shuffle, but outside the octagon is when ‚ÄúThe Smashing Machine‚Äù is most engrossing. It's not a shock that Safdie's naturalistic style and abilities are better applied to human drama than gladiatorial gut-punches and jiu-jitsu kicks; what I think he's trying to do here is subvert the grandiose violence of similar movies. Safdie has completely reverse-engineered the high octanes of his other co-directed movie about a man on a rampage, ‚ÄúUncut Gems,‚Äù for a soft-spoken piece more aligned with the wandering asides of his often harshly funny TV satire about performative do-gooders, ‚ÄúThe Curse,‚Äù co-created with Nathan Fielder. Johnson here, upholstered in prosthetics and varying wigs and noses and bruises, is neither hero nor antihero, but neither is he a toxic-tempered Jake LaMotta out of Martin Scorsese's touchstone fighter drama ‚ÄúRaging Bull.‚Äù Safdie asked Johnson to get puffier, rather than bigger ‚Äî how do you make Dwayne Johnson bigger, anyway? ‚Äî with a tiny waist and oversized traps that often make the actor look deliberately too overstuffed for his own body, a life-sized teddy bear who's taken to too much CrossFit. Johnson's performance is out-and-out wonderful, a beady-eyed fusion of body and spirit that osmoses Safdie's sensibility to deliver what can't be disputed as the most layered work of the actor's career. A vividly contradictory Blunt, funny and sad especially in articulating Dawn's conflicted response to Mark's post-rehab emotional about-face during a tense argument, is equally sensational. ‚ÄúAll you're giving me are leftovers when you say it's time for dinner,‚Äù she says, a line that seems at first profound until Mark asks where she read that one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday (Aug. 31), the girl group ‚Äî now made up of Ally Brooke, Normani, Lauren Jauregui and Dinah Jane, following Camila Cabello's 2016 exit ‚Äî reunited on stage for the first time in seven years. Dressed in all-black outfits, the four-piece performed their 2015 hit ‚ÄúWorth It,‚Äù which peaked at No. The performance was streamed live on Samsung TV Plus. ‚ÄúY'all remember Fifth Harmony,‚Äù Normani told the crowd. ‚ÄúThat was special!‚Äù Brooke wrote in the comments. Cabello, who left the group in late 2016, also showed her support in the comments by appropriately sharing four red heart emojis. The Jonas Brothers also showed love, sharing a clip on Instagram of the performance and writing, ‚ÄúAn honor to have our friends @fifthharmony up on stage tonight in Dallas on the Greetings From Your Hometown Tour.‚Äù Fans had already been speculating something big was coming after Fifth Harmony's official X account posted for the first time in seven years earlier that day. Reunion rumors have been floating around for months. Jane added, ‚ÄúI love that our fans can reminisce on such good times and I love that we're getting the credit again. Our music was very impactful at the time and I feel like it was kind of overlooked, to be honest. Fifth Harmony first came together on the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor in 2012 and found success with their debut album, Reflection, and hits like ‚ÄúWorth It‚Äù and ‚ÄúWork From Home‚Äù (featuring Ty Dolla $ign), the latter of which hit No. Since then, each member has explored their own path, but as Brooke hinted in a 2023 interview with Billboard, the door to a reunion has always been open. And now we're together in a different light,‚Äù the singer said.

By the age of 30, Canadian filmmaker Daniel Roher had won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature for ‚ÄúNavalny.‚Äù His next documentary, ‚ÄúBlink,‚Äù premiered at Telluride last year. Wasting little time, he returns to the Colorado Rockies one year later with ‚ÄúTuner,‚Äù but ‚Äúthis one feels a little different,‚Äù he told a sold-out crowd Saturday, before its world premiere at the fest's Galaxy theater. He's referring to his pivot into narrative feature filmmaking, joining a host of his documentarian contemporaries making this same move of late ‚Äî including Joshua Oppenheimer whose musical ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù also played Telluride last year. Related Stories ‚ÄòThe Testament of Ann Lee' Review: Amanda Seyfried Is a Singing Female Christ Figure in Mona Fastvold's Incredible Quasi-Musical About the Shaker Prophet Dwayne Johnson Says ‚ÄòThe Smashing Machine' Couldn't Happen ‚ÄòWithout My Best Friend' Emily Blunt ‚ÄúTuner‚Äù continues Leo Woodall's own move into leading man territory, after ‚ÄúBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy‚Äù earlier this year. The Brit broke out as the conflicted rent boy in Season 2 of ‚ÄúThe White Lotus,‚Äù and has also starred in recent TV series ‚ÄúOne Day‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrime Target.‚Äù Here he plays Niki, a piano virtuoso whose promising career was cut short by a rare hearing condition which makes him ‚Äúallergic to sound,‚Äù he explains in a scene. Also starring Dustin Hoffman, the veteran leans on his natural charm in limited screen time as Harry Horowitz, who runs a small piano tuning operation with Niki as his sole employee. A humorous opening montage catalogues the odd couple's drive across New York City's five boroughs, tuning pianos for a host of wealthy clients. Harry fills the drive with rants about mercury levels in tuna, or how it's not cholesterol you should be worrying about, it's inflammation. (On that latter point, my health nut friends in L.A. would say, he's not wrong.) But this is not some kitchen sink, slice-of-life drama following two piano tuners, and the film's safe-cracking subplot is set up conveniently ‚Äî perhaps a smidge too much so ‚Äî with little wasted time. Led by Uri (Lior Raz), the trio quickly ropes him into their small-time criminal enterprise, which involves swiping cash and luxury items (watches, jewelry, etc.) The clients fire their housekeeper and file an insurance claim. While not a foolproof plan, there have been less thought out criminal rackets. While committing a criminal act should give anyone not already in that line of work pause, he's already agreed, accepted a cash advance and gone out with Uri and gang to the site. A lack of prior characterization and depth in Woodall's performance leads to a moment that feels included solely because this type of movie often includes that initial indecision. Niki's condition forces him to wear corded ear plugs, along with a pair of noise-cancelling headphones he slips on when things are especially noisy (which in NYC is often). Woodall's quiet brooding and puffy blue eyes recall Jeremy Allen White, while his restless energy and physical appearance calls to mind a young Michael Pitt. This combination for a leading man is unique, but it's hard not to sense that Woodall is miscast as this former-pianist turned-tuner, turned-safe cracker, both physically and with a lack of interiority he renders onscreen in his silent stoicism. His large arms covered in an array of amateur stick and poke tattoos confound: Is there an unreferenced stint at RISD or CalArts in Niki's past? What other profession would have clientele with $5,000 laying around ‚Äî which the film makes clear is a cheap rate ‚Äî to pay the pair to tune their Steinway which they will in turn likely never play? There is an artfulness to piano tuning that Woodall explains poetically to music student Ruthie (Havana Rose Liu), which kicks off a courtship between the two, hampered initially by Ruthie's own stubbornness and rightful suspicion of Niki's aloof schtick. ‚ÄúTuner‚Äù comes fully alive when Liu enters the picture as Ruthie, and she is a revelation in her complex portrayal of this grumpy-yet-sweet, driven musician hellbent on securing a fellowship with a renowned composer known as Meissner (Jean Reno). Leaning into romantic comedy tropes, a chance run-in leads Harry to insist Niki walk her to class ‚Äî a walk between two hardheads that goes about as well as you might expect. Roher and co-writer Robert Ramsey's script slyly brings them together once more, this time for good, when Ruthie's grandmother's piano is damaged from a ceiling leak. Out of options, she needs someone fast to come help mitigate the damage. Liu's portrayal of Ruthie is empowered yet never caricaturish; she enjoys the comforts of her newfound relationship with Niki, even if she is openly perplexed by him at times, like when he gifts her a vintage Rolex after only a month of dating. In this middle section, ‚ÄúTuner‚Äù slides into a familiar narrative register: As Niki gets in deeper with this dangerous gang of thieves, he struggles to balance those commitments with the demands of his relationship with Ruthie. It becomes less about whether Niki can keep his dual lives separate, and more about how things will resolve between the couple once it inevitably does all come crashing down. A tool from an iconic ‚ÄúJackass‚Äù prank being deployed to incapacitate the hero, leaving him screaming in agony on the ground, ‚ÄúTuner‚Äù is undeniably very silly, hewing more closely to a Jacques Audiard picture than a hard-boiled crime thriller. Like Audiard, it seems to relish combining its quirky elements into something emotional and resonant. In fact, ‚ÄúTuner‚Äù shares much in common with Audiard's ‚ÄúThe Beat That My Heart Skipped‚Äù with both exploring the intersection of concert piano playing and small-time crime. The intentional throwback nature of ‚ÄúTuner‚Äù carries benefits and drawbacks. At other times, the script can feel unimaginative and overly paint-by-numbers, as if conceived by Roher and Ramsey with Robert McKee's ‚ÄúStory‚Äù in one hand, a highlighter in the other. Some genre subversion would be welcome, to freshen things up a bit. A key third act twist is so coincidental it's almost impossible to see coming. Where else do piano tuners occupy such status that their work days are filled with near constant house calls? And where else can Niki pay off Harry's medical debt in stacks of cash ‚Äî $10K at a time ‚Äî without arousing any suspicion? ‚ÄúTuner‚Äù correctly recognizes that if an audience is invested in the love story at the center, they will be forgiving of any overly-convenient plotting. It's a satisfying process to watch unfold and is rendered well on screen, both visually and aurally with sound designer Johnnie Burn's (‚ÄúThe Zone of Interest‚Äù) expert craft. As Roher's first narrative project, one senses a willingness to play around and try lots of things out. ‚ÄúWhat if we placed a camera on the safe handles as Niki spins it?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about a fisheye reflection of his face in the safe's chrome plating?‚Äù It's a playful movie in form and content, one that rarely takes itself too seriously, and as such, it can't help but skate by as a pleasurable ride, whether through allowing Hoffman, Woodall and Liu space to trade quips, or through snappy editing when entering a new location. Betting correctly on how this risk would play out, Niki's line drew a hearty laugh from the Telluride audience, ending the film on a high note.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Co-written by director Mona Fastvold with Brady Corbet, this portrait of the 18th century religious leader who founded the Shaker movement also stars Lewis Pullman, Thomasin McKenzie and Christopher Abbott. You have to hand it to Mona Fastvold and her partner and longtime collaborator Brady Corbet ‚Äî they never play it safe with conventional, easily digestible material. Amanda Seyfried Borrows Julia Roberts' Versace Look for Venice Film Festival: "Sharing Is Caring" Elevated by mesmerizing songs of thanks and praise adapted by composer Daniel Blumberg from traditional spirituals and animated by the whirling rapture and vigorous physical expression of Shaker prayer, in which believers surrender their bodies to the Holy Spirit, this is certainly not a movie in which I was ever bored. Venue: Venice Film Festival (Competition)Cast: Amanda Seyfried, Lewis Pullman, Thomasin McKenzie, Matthew Beard, Christopher Abbott, Viola Prettejohn, David Cale, Stacy Martin, Scott Handy, Jeremy Wheeler, Tim Blake NelsonDirector: Mona FastvoldScreenwriters: Mona Fastvold, Brady Corbet Core beliefs, including pacifism, spiritual and physical purity, the collective expunging of sin as a kind of exorcism, social equality extending to gender and race and the nonbinary representation of God, doubtless are not all shared by Fastvold. Seyfried builds a powerful force around Ann's convictions, but there's too little intimate knowledge of this historically significant woman to convey much beyond her zeal. All that proves a bit of a hurdle, making The Testament of Ann Lee a big, muscular movie thrumming with energy and spirituality but lacking the personal insight into its protagonist to justify the epic treatment. Ann remains somewhat opaque and often more strident than persuasive in her evangelism. I confess I knew relatively little about the Shakers going in, beyond the famed woodworking and furniture traditions grounded in the sect's philosophy ‚Äî designs for doors, cabinetry and other household objects had to be necessary and useful, in other words utilitarian, but if they were necessary and useful, the craftspeople were also encouraged to make them beautiful. My other previous encounter with the movement was in the Wooster Group's transfixing hour-long show Early Shaker Spirituals, a faithful performance interpretation of a 1976 recording of hymns and work songs. Regardless of its merits or failings as a cinematic experience, I appreciated the immersive access to a semi-obscure community that had a peak population in the 1840s of 6,000 but today counts just two believers, putting the movement at extinction level. From a young age, Ann devotes herself to God's work but struggles to find a religion that aligns with her beliefs, until she happens to attend a revivalist meeting in the home of Jane Wardley (Stacy Martin), who leads the session of purging and praise, and her husband James (Scott Handy). The wild, almost convulsive stomping and shaking as sins are absolved appeals to Ann's fervid nature ‚Äî the movement's eventual name evolved from their original description, ‚ÄúShaking Quakers.‚Äù But she's perhaps even more captivated by the group's belief in the promise of a second coming in the form of a woman: ‚ÄúGod created us all in his image, so he must be both man and woman.‚Äù She marries handsome young blacksmith Abraham (Christopher Abbott) and complies with his brusque sexual demands for a time ‚Äî lots of bare-assed birch branch lashings and ‚ÄúTake me in your mouth‚Äù orders, which she declines ‚Äî until the last of four babies that die in their infancy is gone, leaving Ann near death. Converting her suffering into evangelism, she starts preaching that fornication is the curse separating man from God. After three days of boisterous worship, noise complaints prompt municipality officials to have Ann dragged out and tossed into a prison cell, where Fastvold and Corbet's script takes perhaps its most extravagant license. Mercifully it comes off but only increases Ann's thirst for true righteousness. Fastvold and Corbet clearly have figured out how to get bang for their buck on large-scale period films that would be exponentially costlier as studio productions. The arrival in America requires adjustments, and there's some disharmony within the group, notably when Abe puts his foot down after six years of abstinence and demands what he considers his conjugal rights. But the shift in location that follows has a lovely Thoreauvian quality as Ann and her group set out into nature in search of isolation and transcendence. One of the members, John Hocknell (musician, playwright and stage performer David Cale), buys a piece of land on which to build and start a farm. The period that follows includes successes, in terms of expanding the flock, and setbacks, usually stemming from word getting out to people instantly threatened by any belief that veers from their own. Ultimately, Fastvold commands admiration for mounting a project clearly conceived with few commercial concerns. Without pushing the point in any obvious way, she suggests contemporary parallels with the Shakers' desire for equality across the entire spectrum of civil and religious rights and their rejection of any form of tyrannical rule. The filmmaker also deserves credit for making something that could not be called a faith-based movie and yet treats the religious beliefs of its subjects with profound respect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It spent 8 weeks at Number One in the classic pop summer of 1983. The music world got a shock this week when his ex-bandmates, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland, sued him in London High Court, claiming they should be credited ‚Äî and paid ‚Äî for writing ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take,‚Äù 42 years after it came out. The bottle-blonde British threesome famously hated each other, so this might just seen like the latest of their nonstop battles. They recorded it while regularly punching each other out in the studio. Sting said he spent half the Synchronicity tour with a broken rib, after one of his backstage brawls with Copeland. Who the hell spends 42 years going to war over a love song? It's also a special case because there's no argument at all over who did what. ‚ÄúOur current single, ‚ÄòEvery Breath You Take,' wrote itself, largely because it was taken from a very old tradition,‚Äù Sting told Musician magazine in 1983. It's a way of saying there's still something meaningful and useful in the old way of doing a rock & roll ballad. His original demo was a fully formed song, with a Hammond organ part that they dumped after Andy Summers came up with the guitar arpeggios. But in recent years, the 82-year-old Summers has been saying his riff earned a writing credit. ‚Äú'Every Breath You Take' was going in the trash until I played on it,‚Äù Summers said on Jeremy White's podcast in 2023. Sting and his company Magnetic Publishing Limited are listed as co-defendants. In 2022, Sting sold the rights to his songwriting catalog ‚Äî both solo and with the Police ‚Äî to Universal Music Group, for an estimated $250 million. All three of them play brilliantly: Summer's guitar, Copeland's massive snare sound, Sting's bass throb at the 2:58 point. You can hear what each musician is doing at any given moment, because Hugh Padgham's expert production and engineering are so beautifully sparse, with so much open space in the sound. Sting's Ex-Police Bandmates Sue Him Over Unpaid ‚ÄòEvery Breath You Take' Royalties Drummergeddon 2025: Why We're Witnessing a Global Percussion Apocalypse See Sting Honor Brian Wilson With Cover of Beach Boys' ‚ÄòGod Only Knows' Watch Shaggy, Sting Team Up for 'Til a Mawnin' on 'Fallon' So it's not like there's any mystery about what each one contributed to ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take.‚Äù The issue is what counts as ‚Äúsongwriting,‚Äù versus what counts as ‚Äúarranging.‚Äù It's an eternal argument for musicians, but it was different in the old days, when bands made money from album sales. That revenue stream has dried up, which means publishing royalties matter more than ever. (According to the judge, this much was not true.) As Sting was always fond of saying, ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take‚Äù wasn't the most radically original song in the world. In 1993, when an interviewer told him, ‚ÄúYou completely ripped Bob Marley off on ‚ÄòSo Lonely,'‚Äù Sting agreed. Those chords, classic aren't they, C, G, A Minor, F. It's like the chord sequence around ‚ÄòEvery Breath You Take' is generic. It's ‚ÄòStand By Me' and it's ‚ÄòSlip Slidin' Away' by Paul Simon and the lyrics aren't particularly original either, they're straight out of a fucking rhyming dictionary. But somehow there's something quite unique about that song and I don't know what it is.‚Äù ‚ÄúSting wanted Stewart to just play a very straight rhythm with no fills or anything,‚Äù Padgham recalled. Stewart would say, ‚ÄòI want to fucking put my drum part on it!' and Sting would say, ‚ÄòI don't want you to put your fucking drum part on it! The combat dragged on until Summers added his arpeggio riff. ‚ÄúI didn't stand there and crow about it,‚Äù he told Guitar World in 2022. ‚ÄúThat song was going to be thrown out. We were in the middle of Synchronicity and Sting says, ‚ÄòWell, go on then, go in there and make it your own.' And the riff has become a kind of immortal guitar part that all guitar players have to learn.‚Äù Sting told the same basic story. Copeland and Summers always got a credit or two per album. ‚ÄúI was giving a portion of my publishing away to the band just to keep it together and everybody wanted to be a songwriter.‚Äù Wasn't it obvious he was the writer in this band? But we still had numerous fights about it.‚Äù Sumner and Copeland did get to contribute tunes to Synchronicity, so the fact must be faced: these tracks make a real shaky case for their songwriting chops circa 1983. Summers wrote the insultingly awful ‚ÄúMother,‚Äù which was an easy Number One on Rolling Stone's recent list of Terrible Songs on Great Albums. (It beat ‚ÄúMaxwell's Silver Hammer.‚Äù) The best you can say for Copeland's ‚ÄúMiss Gradenko‚Äù is that it isn't ‚ÄúMother.‚Äù It was scandalous to stick these piss-poor efforts on the same album as ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take,‚Äù ‚ÄúKing of Pain,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWrapped Around Your Finger,‚Äù and having this evidence on the record is no boost to their cause. He also came up with ‚ÄúBehind My Camel,‚Äù which won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental of 1980. Copeland penned keepers on 1979's Reggatta de Blanc, like the gem ‚ÄúDoes Everyone Stare.‚Äù But he found his outlet composing film soundtracks like Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish. ‚ÄúMy compositions go pretty much to outside projects,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBecause in the band, there's a kind of unity of sound that we've arrived at, on Sting's material, and I know what to do with it.‚Äù The Police broke up soon after ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take,‚Äù at the end of their Synchronicity stadium tour, for no reason except mutual loathing. They reconvened very briefly in 1986 for a lousy remake of ‚ÄúDon't Stand So Close to Me,‚Äù then again in 1992 at Sting's wedding, then finally in 2007 for their long and lucrative reunion tour. They played Al Gore's Live Earth benefit concert, with John Mayer adding guitar and Kanye West rapping, ‚ÄúSting, you the only Police good in the hood.‚Äù The closest they've come to working together since then? This week, actually, when jazzman Christian McBride dropped his new album. It has his version of ‚ÄúMurder by Numbers,‚Äù the song Sting and Summers wrote as a Synchronicity B-side. In a comically ironic bit of timing, they both play on the McBride version ‚Äî hopefully in separate rooms, to avoid killing each other. It's ironic that such a universally popular wedding ballad has such a fractious origin story ‚Äî and with this lawsuit, it gets more fractious than ever. But there's no end of weird details about the saga of ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take.‚Äù For one thing, there's this: ‚ÄúMore Than I Can Say,‚Äù by the U.K. pop smoothie Leo Sayer, a long-forgotten Top Ten hit from 1981. The first time I heard ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take‚Äù on the radio, I wondered, ‚ÄúHow can they get away with this?‚Äù Spoiler: they got away with it, since nobody noticed or cared, but it's basically the same song. Sayer was covering a Fifties oldie, but his Eighties version is the one that sounds like ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take,‚Äù even though the Police probably never heard it. As for Diddy's remake, Sting told Rolling Stone, ‚ÄúI put a couple of my kids through college with the proceeds.‚Äù Last fall, he said the rap mogul's trial didn't ‚Äútaint‚Äù it for him, since ‚Äúit's still my song.‚Äù Cradle of Filth Singer Issues Statement Addressing Former Bandmates' Accusations Fifth Harmony Reunite After 7 Years During Jonas Brothers Concert Trump Proves He's Alive by Complaining About ‚ÄòStupid' White House Contractors For years, drummer Levon Helm railed against Robbie Robertson over the credits. (Helm's claims were complicated by the fact that he had a long and prolific solo career, yet did not write songs for his albums.) ‚ÄúIt's not like ‚ÄòStand by Me,' which is this wonderful noble song that means just one thing. ‚ÄòEvery Breath You Take' is very ambiguous and quite wicked.‚Äù Sting later wrote an answer song, his 1985 solo hit ‚ÄúIf You Love Someone, Set Them Free.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had to write the antidote,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúafter I'd poisoned people with this horrible thing.‚Äù Maybe that's why the conflict around this song never ends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Close to 30 years have passed since Doug Liman's breakout feature Swingers played in the Venice Film Festival's now defunct Overtaking Lane sidebar devoted to emerging directors, having been rejected by Sundance. The Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow director was back on the Lido this year unveiling his XR thriller Asteroid, which is among 30 works competing in Venice's Film Festival Immersive Competition. Starring Hailee Steinfeld, Rhenzy Feliz, DK Metcalf, Ron Perlman, Frieda Pinto and Leon Mandel, the work revolves around a group of strangers who head to an asteroid in an old Russian Soyuz rocket on a risky mission to mine wealth beyond their wildest dreams. Only one of the space travelers will return to Earth. 'The Brutalist' Director Brady Corbet Talks Ground Rules Of Collaboration With Partner Mona Fastvold As She Debuts 'The Testament Of Ann Lee' In Venice Dwayne Johnson & Emily Blunt On Shooting Venice Title 'The Smashing Machine' With Benny Safdie: "The Guardrails Came Off For Us Every Day" It is the latest work from 30 Ninjas, the immersive studio Liman created more than a decade ago with Julina Tatlock and Jed Weintrob using technological developments to expand the boundaries of storytelling. Produced by 30 Ninjas in association with Google's 100 Zeros, Asteroid is among a slate of XR films being lined up for the launch this fall of Android XR, the new operating system, combining AI, AR and VR, being developed by Google and Samsung. ‚ÄúAt 30 Ninjas, our mission has been to embrace new technology and storytelling. ‚ÄúI'm a huge fan of Jim Cameron because he's on the cutting edge. It went onto gross $4.6 million at the U.S. box office. ‚ÄúBack then we shot movies on film, but there were new film stocks, and I thought, ‚ÄòWith these film stocks, I can shoot a movie without a crew and lights, and with the camera on my shoulder.' I was like, ‚ÄòPeople have been shooting movies the same way for 100 years. Swingers doesn't look like other movies, and I think it's a better movie for that.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight from the beginning, my career has been intertwined with advances in technology and obviously with Asteroid, this is by far the most ambitious thing I've ever done. Steinfeld emerges as an ambivalent figure whose true motives for her actions remain unclear. Mandel plays a former Russia astronaut, whose avarice gets the better of him, while Perlman's character is an older man struggling to cope with harsh terrain and sub-zero temperatures. Pinto plays as an official leading the investigation back on Earth. ‚ÄúAsteroids is a story I've been wanting to tell for a long time ‚Ä¶ in my movies, I pride myself on my world building, and part of the world building is the visual spectacle but it's also about the characters,‚Äù said Liman. Characters who look up at the moon and see money, not romance,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIn Asteroid, five of them are cramming into a Soyuz capsule that's designed for three because they think there's a trillion dollars to be made on an asteroid that's passing near Earth.‚Äù Perlman, who also made the trip to Venice alongside cast members Feliz, Metcalf and Mandel, said working on the XR thriller had been an revelatory experience. For Liman, Asteroid was one of most technically challenging films that he has ever shot. My production designer from Edge of Tomorrow (Oliver Scholl) designed the asteroid. Some of that is sort of conventional, but how you technically film for the headset and give the audience a Hollywood cinematic experience ‚Ä¶ it's more technology than I've ever used in a movie.‚Äù All the actors were scanned using Google's next generation top secret scanning stage. Liman and his 30 Ninja partners said it was too early to say whether there will be further instalments of Asteroid, or indeed a feature film spinning off the immersive experience. ‚ÄúThis started as a feature script which I cut down, or just one part of it, to create a short film. ‚ÄúThere is a full story I want to tell of Asteroid that is feature length or longer and then part of the excitement of getting to do this with Google and with the Android XR headset is that I'm hoping you want to know more. ‚ÄúMy goal is to create movies and experiences that people want more of‚Ä¶ but I'm also really excited about where it's going with the story extension,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúYou're just getting a little taste of it. The reality is that the experience is so powerful in 180-degrees, that I've set a very high bar for what I would hope to create on the big screen if I did it for Imax because as incredible as Imax is, it's hard  for it to compete with the experience you have watching on a headshot.‚Äù A feature version of Asteroid remained an ambition, he continued but said no such had project had been greenlighted as yet. ‚ÄúWe could end up making seven more instalments for the headset‚Ä¶ I've learned so much about storytelling on this‚Ä¶ I was also planning to go shoot a movie in outer space with Tom Cruise and the reality is the experience you have watching Asteroid on the Android XR is that you are so inside a Hollywood movie in a way I've never experienced before,‚Äù said Liman Pressed on the outer space project with Cruise, first revealed by Deadline in 2020, Liman said it remained on the cards, but there were no updates. I'm interested in like my kinds of characters going into space and I love that in Asteroid, we got to cram five of them into this teeny second-hand capsule.‚Äù Liman added that shooting a film in outer space remained on his bucket list but that nothing was scheduled as yet, with both he and Cruise tied up in other projects. ‚ÄúI'm more excited about going to space, not less ‚Ä¶ but our goal is too make something great. A lot of people are trying to do gimmicky things like, ‚ÄòOh, it's in space.' I'm not interested in doing something that's a just promotional gimmick. I want to make a film that people watch in a hundred years when maybe there's hundreds of movies shot in outer space and there's nothing special about it being in outer space. ‚ÄúIf I ever shoot a movie in outer space, the question will be what could I do that you couldn't do on Earth that makes for a great piece of entertainment, that's better than if you didn't do it it space. Again, its also about technology and storytelling‚Ä¶ you can run a line from Swingers all the way through to this potential film in outer space.‚Äù Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Hot on the heels of ‚ÄúThe Brutalist,‚Äù Mona Fastvold and Brady Corbet have returned with another sweeping historical epic about a European iconoclast who comes to America in order to build a new kind of church. ‚ÄúThe Testament of Ann Lee‚Äù isn't exactly a musical either, to be fair. Oscar-winning composer Daniel Blumberg transfigures a dozen traditional hymns into propulsive and electrifying choral jams that thrum with biblical fervor, while ‚ÄúAftersun‚Äù choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall rearranges the figures of Ann Lee's close-knit congregation until they form a human alter to the heaven their ‚Äúmother‚Äù is hoping to create with them here on Earth. Related Stories Dwayne Johnson Says ‚ÄòThe Smashing Machine' Couldn't Happen ‚ÄòWithout My Best Friend' Emily Blunt ‚ÄòKim Novak's Vertigo' Review: Undercooked Doc Shows the Star of One of the Greatest Movies Ever Is Just as Obsessed with It as We Are As in a more straightforward musical, the Shakers are using song and dance to express a range of feelings that plainspoken words couldn't hope to convey. With the orgiastic glory of creating a shared purpose between people, and the evangelical labor of converting that purpose into action. Fastvold may not be a Shaker herself, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering that there are exactly three of them remaining at last count (and only then because a new adherent joined the other two just a few weeks ago), but ‚ÄúThe Testament of Ann Lee‚Äù is one of the most consistently ecstatic movies I've ever seen precisely because it doesn't get hung up on the gospel truth. In a sense, ‚ÄúThe Testament of Ann Lee‚Äù is a celebration of ‚Äî and then in its less rhapsodic second half, a plea for ‚Äî the conditions required to make a movie like ‚ÄúThe Testament of Ann Lee.‚Äù Here is another mad pursuit with shallow pockets and grand ambitions (which looks like a mega-budgeted studio project, thanks to production designer Sam Bader). Just as Ann Lee's upbeat message appealed to a Christian population that had grown tired of being promised salvation through suffering, Fastvold and Corbet's model offers a more actionable response to an industry sick of Hollywood doomsayers. Then again, it takes a lot more than a few cheap Hungarian budget hacks to conjure the kind of spell that Fastvold does here. For starters, there's only one Amanda Seyfried, whose moonstone eyes were made to convey religious bliss. She finds a measure of creature comfort in the arms of her smitten but severe husband Abraham (a terrific Christopher Abbott, masterfully navigating real affection and 18th century male entitlement), who ravishes Ann with a fetishistic attention that his bride isn't sure how to receive. For another, even worldly sinners like us would probably be confused if our partners wanted to smack our bare asses with a broom while reading from the Book of Revelations. But Ann's sexual ambivalence runs far deeper than old-timey kink. She first became skeptical of the subject as a little girl, when she was forced to watch her father grunt on top of her mother just a few feet away, and that skepticism began to calcify into a deeper mistrust when her mother died during the delivery of her eighth child. For a woman like Ann, marital sex is a crucial part of affirming her Christian duty, but the sense of self-becoming that it provides is rhymed by the autonomy that ‚Äúbelonging‚Äù to her husband strips away from her in return. These conflicted feelings come to a head in the film's most astonishing sequence, a whirlstorm of sex, labor, dance, anguish, song, death, and mourning in which Ann delivers four children, none of whom survive beyond infancy despite her desperate attempts to feed them with life. Needless to say, the experience has a soul-scarring effect on Ann, who becomes convinced that her awful ordeal is punishment for her sins of the flesh. ‚ÄúOur unbearable tragedies are God's judgment upon me,‚Äù she concludes before declaring that procreation is sacrilege and leading the first Shakers in three days of spasmodic worship so intense that Sister Mary (Thomasin McKenzie) ‚Äî Ann's most devoted acolyte and this movie's narrator ‚Äî insists that people thought she was going to die. Carefully balanced between agony and ecstasy before it gradually begins to claw its way closer toward the latter, Seyfried's possessed performance has no trouble selling us on the credibility of those fears. She's a study in unbridled expiation, her body open and tilting upwards to the sky as if she were receiving instruction from the heavens, her every rhythmic breath a kind of transubstantiation. ‚ÄúThe Testament of Ann Lee‚Äù would never hold together if not for the unwavering conviction that Seyfried affords its title character. Since a film made for Shakers would only stand to gross about $40 at most, Fastvold understands that most viewers won't share Ann's self-beliefs; what's more important is that we believe that Ann does. We may come to a more psychological rationale for her prophetic awakening, which is clearly borne from the pain of her losses, but we're also disabused of any cynicism regarding the sincerity of her faith (even if, uh, we might question the long-term outcome of a religion that forbids its followers to start families and fortify their ranks). The journey is a perilous one between two mutually antagonized lands, but the Shakers' shared purpose proves to be their salvation, and sees them safely to Manhattan. Through the lens of the nascent Shaker community that Ann establishes near Albany (and where she instructs her followers to begin making the furniture they're still remembered for today), we see this country as a place built on the strength of cooperation, as well as a place vulnerable to the same provincial thinking from which it was hoping to declare independence. The Shakers thrive by trading with the local indigenous population, and from offering new ideas to frustrated white colonialists who'd been conditioned for despair (embodied here by Tim Blake Nelson). They also suffer at the hands of brutish mobs who reject their presence on principle, oblivious to the irony of so violently betraying the same rights they've just fought a war to establish. Grace is a difficult thing to preserve, and ‚ÄúThe Testament of Ann Lee‚Äù becomes a less viscerally singular experience as it transitions from sanctifying that grace to grieving it. The music grows less frequent, we begin to see Daniel Blumberg onscreen (a striking figure!) as much as we hear from him off it, and the clarity of Ann's vision is clouded by the brutishness that surrounds it. Of course, Ann would be quick to remind us that there's a place for everything, and everything in its place. The ultimate brilliance of Fastvold's movie, which remains without question for all of its peaks and valleys, is that it has the courage to reimagine the essence of belonging itself; to see it not as something we find, but rather as something that we create together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether or not it was technically true, Noel Gallagher's pre-encore observation about the tens of thousands who packed into East Rutherford, New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on Sunday night (Aug. 31) to see Oasis‚Äò first gig in the New York area (the entire East Coast, really) since 2008 couldn't be considered much of an exaggeration. For two months now, Oasis fans new and old have been swarming major cities one at a time at a level rarely seen outside of Taylor Swift and Beyonc√© tours, lining the streets with box-logo shirts and bucket hats and impromptu ‚ÄúDon't Look Back in Anger‚Äù singalongs as the Brothers Gallagher ready their next triumphant mini-residency. If other bands have fans on the same level, they certainly aren't showing out like this in 2025. Three decades later, the lads are packing MetLife Stadium with more fans and merch than the woeful Jets and Giants might be able to manage for many weeks in this upcoming NFL season. Though surprises were few outside of the occasional mushiness ‚Äî a well-oiled machine by now, Oasis stuck to the same 23-song setlist it's played at every show so far on the Live '25 Tour, albeit with new intro music this time in The Rolling Stones' psych-era gem ‚ÄúWe Love You‚Äù ‚Äî there were plenty of highlights to be had on Sunday. Early in the set, after a soaring ‚ÄúSome Might Say,‚Äù Liam put to bed the notion that, despite his band's somewhat contentious relationship with America, that they lacked affection for the U.S. of A: ‚ÄúNo, we like coming here,‚Äù he swore. What he didn't like, he clarified, were the people who told him ‚ÄúYou gotta play the game, kids‚Äù ‚Äî presumably when it came to stateside media and radio and promo and such ‚Äî ‚Äúor else you'll be chopped liver.‚Äù The brothers' refusal to follow industry rules may have hurt their American prospects back in the late '90s, but Sunday night's sold-out crowd certainly validated their approach in the long term, as Liam testified: ‚ÄúI'm standing here in this beautiful stadium to tell you you don't have to play the game.‚Äù Nobody knows the way it's gonna be, indeed. ‚ÄúYou might've wondered what it might be like to sing this next song with 60, 70,000 of your fellow Oasis fans,‚Äù he teased for those with their hands up. As the band winded down its stupefyingly loaded encore ‚Äî with a run of ‚ÄúAnger,‚Äù ‚ÄúWonderwall‚Äù and ‚ÄúChampagne Supernova‚Äù that still feels almost unsportsmanlike for a show's closing run ‚Äî a dazzling display of fireworks lit up the East Rutherford sky. Launched from MetLife's top level, the fireworks felt like an appropriately momentous capper to a stellar first New York-area stadium outing ‚Äî one that proved that Oasis had won the game, whether or not they'd ever really played it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monica Barbaro brought effortless charm to the Venice International Film Festival. Even with all eyes on her, she maintained calm composure under the spotlight when an unexpected gust of wind briefly ruffled her Dior gown. When a sudden gust lifted the pleated overlay of her black Christian Dior gown, the fabric ballooned dramatically before Barbaro swiftly pressed it back into place. She quickly laughed it off, brushing her hair from her face and striking new poses for photographers as if nothing had happened. Cinema Blend later shared footage of the lighthearted mishap. The elegant black dress featured a high neckline, drop waist, and two chic bow accents, including one that draped across her back. She kept the styling classic with minimal glam, sparkling earrings, and a single ring. The actress was also photographed holding hands with Garfield upon their arrival in Venice earlier that day, further fueling buzz around their relationship. Barbaro, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Joan Baez in ‚ÄúA Complete Unknown,‚Äù has been linked to Garfield since February. The couple has been spotted at several events, including Wimbledon in July, though they have not publicly confirmed their romance. Barbaro, 35, and Garfield, 42, have been linked since February 2025, when a source told People magazine the couple was ‚Äúspending time together quietly‚Äù after fans spotted them at a London play. Although the two have not publicly confirmed their romance, Garfield said in a 2024 Esquire interview that he ‚Äúwon't ever speak about or confirm or deny anything about my personal life with anyone, ever‚Äù, they have continued to be photographed together at events throughout the year.</p>
