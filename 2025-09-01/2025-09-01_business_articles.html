                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Freixe will be succeeded by Philipp Navratil, who was previously chief executive of Nestlé Nespresso. Freixe, a four-decade fixture of the Swiss food and beverage giant, was tapped for the role one year ago to revive growth after a period of sluggish performance under his predecessor, Mark Schneider. Bulcke framed the dismissal as both necessary and symbolic of Nestlé's standards, while expressing gratitude for Freixe's tenure. "Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestlé." Business Insider has reached out to Freixe for comment. The boardroom drama arrives during a critical period for Nestlé. The company enjoyed a pandemic-era boom as consumers stocked up on staples to eat and drink at home, but that momentum has vanished. Shares of the stock have slid nearly 40% from its high-water mark in early 2022. When Freixe took over as the Nestlé chief last August, he made clear that his mandate was to refocus the company on its core strengths — coffee, petcare, and food — rather than chasing diversification. Schneider was only the second outsider to run Nestlé in its 159-year history. Freixe told the FT that what set him apart was his "intimate" knowledge of Nestlé's inner workings. "Because of that, and maybe my style, I'm very close to the people, so it's a big advantage," he said. Nestlé has tapped another longtime employee as Freixe's replacement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The maker of products ranging from KitKat to Nesquik said that it had appointed veteran insider Philipp Navratil, who had headed the Nespresso coffee unit, as Freixe's successor with immediate effect. The shock departure threatens more volatility for Nestle amid a tough consumer environment and the global threat of trade tariffs. The firm announced in June that long-standing Chairman Paul Bulcke would stand down next year. Nestle said Freixe's departure follows an investigation overseen by Bulcke and Lead Independent Director Pablo Isla into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached the company's code of business conduct. "Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service." "We are not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance." Company veteran Freixe took over the CEO role exactly one year ago after Nestle ousted his predecessor Mark Schneider. The sudden exit is the latest management reshuffle at a global consumer goods and food company this year, including Nestle rival Unilever, Diageo and Hershey. Kohl's fired CEO Ashley Buchanan in May after an investigation found he had pushed for deals with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, after little more than 100 days in the position. Navratil began his career with Nestle in 2001 as an internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America, he was appointed country manager for Nestle Honduras in 2009. He moved to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined the Nestle executive board on January 1 this year. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A document detailing plans for post-war Gaza aims to make President Donald Trump's "Gaza Riviera" vision a reality — using mass displacement, artificial intelligence, and at least a decade of U.S. trusteeship over the war-ravaged enclave. It involves "voluntary" relocation of Gaza's population in exchange for digital tokens, six to eight "AI-powered smart cities," and a manufacturing hub named after Elon Musk. It also calls for the entirety of Gaza's population of two million to be relocated, at least temporarily, through either what it calls voluntary departures to another country, or the moving of residents into temporary housing areas within the Strip during reconstruction. The GHF, whose stated goal is to provide food inside the enclave, has received heavy criticism from U.N. experts for allegedly being "exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law." The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment. Gaza would be under U.S. trusteeship for around ten years "until a reformed and deradicalized Palestinian Polity is ready to step in its shoes," according to the plan, entitled the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust. The GREAT Trust would begin under an initial U.S.-Israel bilateral agreement, and Israel would maintain "overarching rights to meet its security needs," according to the document. The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment. The authors of the plan claim that no federal funding or donations would be required; it would instead be financed by private and public sector investment in what it describes as "mega-projects," from data centers and electric vehicle factories to luxury apartments and seaside resorts. The development plan also envisions using roughly 30% of Gazan land that is public — leased to the Trust for up to 99 years — and any investments as its initial capital and assets, which it claims constitutes a $300 billion asset value with "self-generating revenue streams." The plan assumes that 25% of Gazans would choose to leave the country, and of those, 75% would choose not to return. The plan claimed that this method would save $23,000 on every Palestinian relocating compared to costs of supporting those who stay inside Gaza. At no point does the document address international law, Palestinian opposition to mass relocation, or opposition to this plan by other Arab states, who have long demanded a state and self-determination for Palestinians. The plan's "end state" is Gaza's "self-governance under the Abraham Accords" — a framework that establishes diplomatic relations with Israel — though there is no mention of an officially recognized Palestinian state. Gaza residents who leave land that they own would also receive a "digital token" by the GREAT Trust in exchange for the right to develop their property, and can "redeem their tokens for ownership of rebuilt residences," according to the plan. Trump first announced his vision of a "Gaza Riviera" under U.S. ownership in February, drawing swift condemnation and shock from international leaders, and Middle Eastern allies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular. Rights groups have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza, charges that the Israeli government forcefully denies. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised Trump's idea. Hamas for its part vocally rejected the proposal on Monday, with its political bureau member Bassem Naim saying that "Gaza is not for sale" and is "part of the greater Palestinian homeland."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From citrus farms in the Central Valley to construction sites where homes and businesses are being rebuilt after devastating wildfires in Pacific Palisades, California relies heavily on immigrant workers and entrepreneurs. As the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, industries key to the state's $4 trillion economy like agriculture, construction and hospitality could be among those hardest hit by the loss of California's immigrant workforce, according to new research. If mass deportations were to be combined with the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants and stricter border policies, the joint study estimated that California would be at risk of losing as much as $278 billion from its gross domestic product. Immigrant workers have been essential in bolstering the state's economy given declining birthrates and an aging population, said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Economic Institute. Agriculture, a $49 billion industry for the state, has the highest concentration of immigrant and undocumented immigrant workers in California, with 63% of them immigrants and 24% of farm workers undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found. "Without them, we wouldn't have any food available," said Joe Garcia, president of the California Farmworker Association and CEO of Jaguar Labor Contracting, which connects farmworkers to growers. Garcia added that automation isn't an option for many of these positions, and American-born workers are not interested in taking on these jobs, which are often strenuous, low-paid and outdoors. The Trump administration insists that the domestic labor market can withstand a shortage of immigrant labor, and says its focus is on creating jobs for U.S. citizens. "Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training," said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in response to an inquiry from CNBC about the potential impact of mass deportations on California and its key industries. "There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws." In downtown Los Angeles, businesses have felt waves of impact in June and beyond due to high-profile ICE raids, accompanying protests and National Guard Deployment, owners and advocates said, exacerbating a public perception issue that downtown Los Angeles is not safe. "COVID, it was an international emergency that we were all dealing with. Here in California, especially here in Los Angeles, with the recent Palisades and Altadena fires… now it's immigration situation that we're dealing with. It's more like a localized COVID all over again," said Eddie Navarette, executive director of the hospitality commission. Courtney Kaplan owns three Los Angeles restaurants, including Camelia in the downtown Arts District. She saw a 70 percent drop in sales in June alone, she told CNBC, due to closures and curfews, even though she is not in close proximity to where protests or the National Guard deployments took place. Her staff continue to come to work, but the uncertainty around both immigration and trade policy, as she relies on imported wines and sake, weigh on her. Data from OpenTable show a drop in dining reservations for all of Los Angeles were down from June 7th through the 21st by 3% year on year. "We're still in the very early days of these changes to immigration policy, so it's hard to even predict what's coming. It just is a cause of concern that perhaps that down the line, the situation for us will change with our team members' comfort levels." Sectors like construction and farming are staring down worker shortages that predate any change to immigration policy. In California, more than sixty percent of construction workers are immigrants and a quarter of them are undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found. "There are profound skill shortages in these production industries, construction, manufacturing, because culturally, we have not created enough of these workers," said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group. "The way we've dealt with this over time has been immigration. Many more people there have been willing and wanting to be in the skilled trades, and we import that talent to improve our built environment." Contractors largely fall into two camps, he told CNBC. Others are pessimistic, as costs and uncertainty have risen. "Even during tough economic times, it's in the midst of transformation," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday called on pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their Covid drugs days after the Food and Drug Administration set new limits on who can receive vaccines for the virus. Many people think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. The FDA on Wednesday approved the latest round of Covid vaccines, but only for people at higher risk of severe illness. The president's comments also come days after he fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez after she refused to resign. Four other top health officials at the CDC also announced they were quitting the agency last week, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "With CDC being ripped apart over this question, I want the answer, and I want it NOW," Trump said in the post. "I have been shown information from Pfizer, and others, that is extraordinary, but they never seem to show those results to the public. The leadership upheaval at the CDC follows a series of measures by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to overhaul federal health agencies and change U.S. immunization policies. He has instituted mass firings, gutted a key government vaccine panel and canceled studies on mRNA shot technology. Trump urged drug companies to be more transparent about their results to "clear up this MESS," writing that drugmakers "let everyone rip themselves apart, including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC, trying to figure out the success or failure of the Drug Companies Covid work." Trump in the post also continued to tout Operation Warp Speed, his first administration's pandemic vaccine effort launched in May 2020 to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of Covid vaccines and therapeutics. Yet Kennedy — a prominent vaccine skeptic — has downplayed the efficacy of vaccinations. In a guest essay published in the New York Times on Monday, a group of nine former directors and acting directors of the CDC said Kennedy is "endangering" Americans' health. and to our nation's public health system over the past several months — culminating in his decision to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as C.D.C. director days ago — is unlike anything we have ever seen at the agency, and unlike anything our country has ever experienced," the group wrote. "We are worried about the wide-ranging impact that all these decisions will have on America's health security," they said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Duane Arnold nuclear plant northwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa is pressing ahead with plans to restart operations by the end of the decade after shutting down for economic reasons in 2020. Duane Arnold would follow similar restarts planned for the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which plan to resume operations later this year and in 2027, respectively, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. NextEra sees Duane Arnold restarting operations by the fourth quarter of 2028 at the earliest, according to FERC filings. "While a significant amount of work needs to be done before the facility could be restarted, FERC's decision is another positive step in the process," Neil Nissan, a NextEra spokesperson, said in a statement to CNBC. "The recommissioning of Duane Arnold has received significant commercial interest from premier American companies," Garrett Goldfinger, the NextEra executive in charge of the restart project, told FERC in a late July filing. Duane Arnold would bring more than 600 megawatts of electricity back to the grid, equivalent to the electricity needs of more than 400,000 homes. "If we're successful in bringing Duane forward, that obviously creates a hot bed of data center activity around that facility," NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors on the company's July earnings call. Duane Arnold, Palisades and Three Mile Island are three of the 10 U.S. reactors that closed over the past decade as nuclear power strained to compete against cheap natural gas and renewable energy. Restarting these plants is the most concrete sign yet that the nuclear industry is coming back after years of financial struggles. "These are unique opportunities because you don't face the new build costs associated with nuclear," Ketchum said on NextEra's earnings call. But the market last year started to shift back in favor of high-capacity nuclear power as the U.S. saw an unprecedented increase in electricity demand from industry and data centers, NextEra said in its filing to FERC. NextEra is now consolidating those solar grid connections back into a single one for Duane Arnold after securing FERC approval. This will "provide commercial and financial certainty to support the recommissioning effort and expedite the resumption of clean, reliable operations at Duane Arnold," Goldfinger told FERC. NextEra said the restart of Duane Arnold will be a "highly capital-intensive process." It disclosed in its filing to FERC that it plans on spending as much as $100 million in 2025 alone on the project. NextEra has placed orders for new transformers to replace the ones that were removed when the plant was shut down, although the transformers face significant supply chain constraints and will take about three years to deliver. The nuclear industry has a long history of projects delays, Goldfinger cautioned, and the Duane Arnold restart could take longer than expected if the transformers, for example, are delivered late. While there are risks, Duane Arnold represents a financial opportunity for NextEra, the parent company of Florida Power & Light. The stock has barely moved this year despite growing power demand, a sharp reversal from 2024 when shares jumped 18% Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on renewable energy have shaken investor confidence in solar and wind power. Solar and wind projects will no longer be eligible for two key tax credits after 2027, which is expected to crimp demand for renewables. "You add Duane Arnold to the mix and that's one of many ways that we have to continue to grow the business in the future," Ketchum said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union (EU) on Monday said Russia was suspected of jamming the GPS system of a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Bulgaria on Sunday. "We can indeed confirm that there was GPS jamming, but the plane landed safely in Bulgaria. We have received information from the Bulgarian authorities that they suspect that this was due to blatant interference by Russia," a European Commission spokesperson said at a press briefing Monday. "We are of course aware and used to the threats and intimidations that are a regular component of Russia's hostile behavior, and of course this will only reinforce further our unshakeable commitment to ramp up defense capabilities and support for Ukraine," the spokesperson added. Von der Leyen was on a plane chartered by the European Commission, the EU said. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Financial Times earlier that the information was "incorrect," however. CNBC has contacted the Bulgarian Air Traffic Services Authority for further information on the incident. However, an earlier statement to the FT read: "Since February 2022, there has been a notable increase in [GPS] jamming and recently spoofing occurrences," it said. "These interferences disrupt the accurate reception of [GPS] signals, leading to various operational challenges for aircraft and ground systems." Bulgaria's government on Monday issued a statement, reported by Sky News, saying that "the satellite signal used for the aircraft's GPS navigation was disrupted." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BYD's "gravy train" might be grinding to a halt. On Friday, BYD reported that net profits in the second quarter had fallen 30% from a year earlier, as the Tesla rival grappled with fierce competition in China's congested EV market. BYD has also found itself in the crosshairs of China's regulators, which have cracked down on practices of heavy discounting and delayed supplier payments that have become standard in China's electric vehicle industry. In the company's earnings report, BYD said that "short-term profitability" had been affected by "industry malpractices" such as discounting and "excessive marketing." BYD has itself cut prices multiple times over the past few years, and analysts at Jefferies said regulatory campaigns have hurt the company's "historic playbook" of leveraging its supply chain advantages to aggressively cut prices. "In short, BYD's 'gravy train' — fueled by scale, cost cuts, and tech leadership — has lost speed. Until it regains momentum, underperformance looks likely," they wrote in a Sunday note. The Shenzhen-based automaker has targeted aggressive global expansion as China's EV market heats up. BYD has built a fleet of car-carrying cargo ships to meet growing demand in markets like Europe, Brazil, and Mexico, and is pushing ahead with plans to build factories in Brazil, Hungary, and Turkey. The Chinese automaker outsold Tesla in Europe last month, the second time it has done so this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before he was fired last December, Mody Khan was earning a six-figure salary as a cloud solution architect at Microsoft. "I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it," said Khan, who's in his 50s and based in Texas. A new job could stabilize his finances — but despite a five-year run at Microsoft and his prior experience in the tech industry, even landing interviews has been challenging. "It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman," he said. In recent years, Big Tech firms — including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon — have revamped their performance review and compensation systems to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also affected many individual contributor roles. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the beginning of this year, global tech companies have laid off more than 80,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have come amid a white-collar hiring slowdown. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. After immigrating to the US from Pakistan in 2007, Khan said he struggled to find high-paying work during the 2008 recession. But over time, his job prospects improved — and he held various tech roles before joining Microsoft in July 2019 as a contract support engineer. In December 2021, he was promoted to cloud solution architect — a fully remote role he held until his termination in December 2024. Khan's final years at the company were very difficult. He said multiple managers raised concerns about his performance over the years and eventually warned him that his job was in jeopardy. He said he often lacked clear guidance on expectations and would have benefited from more constructive feedback and coaching. At times, he said, it felt like his managers were more focused on "building a case" against him than helping him improve. "I hated going from the bedroom to my home office," he said. Last December, Khan learned he was being fired for performance reasons and wouldn't be receiving severance pay. He was told he could still apply for other roles at Microsoft — and said he later applied to as many as 30 internal positions — but never received an offer. Khan said he sold some of his Microsoft stock holdings but now has only about $10,000 in "survival money" left in his bank account — enough to last him and his wife about two more months. If that runs out, they'd be forced to tap into his remaining investments or 401(k). To make matters worse, they fell behind on their mortgage payments — and if they can't resume payments once their forbearance plan ends in November, they could face foreclosure. "I've had so many good interviews where I'm ready for them to say, 'Mody, let's rock 'n' roll' — and then they don't move forward," he said. He added that it's particularly frustrating when seemingly promising conversations with recruiters don't end in a clear rejection — but in silence, leaving him unsure whether he was ever truly considered. Khan believes a few factors may be hindering his job search. He's concerned that some employers assume, because of his age, that he's not up to date on the latest technologies. To push back on that perception, he said he completed an AI certification through the University of Texas. He added that many of his interviewers appeared to be looking for candidates with startup backgrounds, which made him feel like his experience at a tech giant like Microsoft was almost a strike against him. He believes some Indian recruiters or interviewers may carry biases that surface during the hiring process, particularly given long-standing regional and political tensions between India and Pakistan. But with the financial pressure mounting and his savings running low, he said the stakes are getting higher.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A growing number of Nigerian citizens are finding themselves locked out of the United States, despite holding valid visas that were issued months or even years ago, as visa denials quietly mount. A new report has revealed that the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria has quietly begun revoking visas without warning, disrupting the lives of Nigerian professionals, entrepreneurs, frequent travelers, and families who suddenly find their mobility stripped away. The revelation, made by Olufemi Soneye, former Chief Corporate Communications Officer of Nigeria's national oil company, the NNPC Ltd, in an article published in The Cable, points to an unsettling pattern of unexplained cancellations. According to Soneye, many Nigerians who had long traveled to and from the U.S. without incident are now receiving terse notices of revocation. In some cases, the humiliation has been unbearable: travelers discovering at the airport, sometimes even at boarding gates, that their visas had been quietly invalidated." "A few were briefly detained by immigration authorities before being sent home in shame,” Soneye disclosed, describing the embarrassment some affected visa holders faced at airports as they attempted to leave the country. The cancellation letters, citing Title 22, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 41.122, claim only that “new information became available after the visa was issued.” Recipients are told only that they may reapply, a costly and uncertain process that offers little reassurance to those who had already built business plans, family reunions, or educational opportunities around U.S. travel. What makes the development more troubling is its timing. The Trump administration has recently rolled out a series of visa restrictions targeting countries in Africa, citing security and immigration risks. Nigeria, one of Africa's top economy and a longstanding U.S. partner, has increasingly found itself caught in the dragnet. Many insist they have never overstayed their visas, violated immigration rules, or raised any security red flags. “For many, this is not just about stamps on a passport. These visas are lifelines for education, family reunions, medical treatment, and critical business. Each revoked visa represents not only an individual setback but also a blow to Nigeria's international business and professional networks. Entrepreneurs lose access to global markets, students face uncertainty over study plans, and families are left grappling with missed reunions. Some see the cancellations as fallout from shifting U.S.–Africa relations under Trump. Others suggest bureaucratic overreach or unannounced security screening measures. But until officials in Washington or Abuja break their silence, thousands of Nigerians remain stranded in uncertainty and holding visas that no longer open doors.
