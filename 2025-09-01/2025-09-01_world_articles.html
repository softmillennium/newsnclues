                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrii Parubii, a Ukrainian politician who previously served as the parliament speaker and played a prominent role in the EuroMaidan Revolution, was shot dead in Lviv on Aug. 30. A suspect in the fatal shooting was detained, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced in the early hours of Sept. 1. "The suspect has given an initial testimony. Urgent investigative actions are currently underway to establish all the circumstances of this murder," Zelensky said. On Aug. 30, authorities received an emergency call at around noon after the shooting in Lviv's southern Frankivskyi city district, the police said. Citing sources, Suspilne broadcaster reported that the suspected assailant was dressed as a delivery courier and rode an electric bicycle. During a press briefing in Lviv, police officials said that Parubii was shot at eight times with a short-barreled firearm. Seven shell casings were found at the crime scene, law enforcement sources told Suspilne. Officials did not provide information about the suspect's identity or motive. Law enforcement authorities said they are investigating whether Parubii received threats before his death. A probe was also launched into the unauthorized release of a street camera recording showing moments before and after the shooting. During Soviet times, he organized anti-government demonstrations and was twice arrested. After Ukraine gained its independence, Parubii entered politics, being elected into the parliament for the first time in 2007. After the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych during EuroMaidan, Parubii was appointed secretary of the National Security and Defense Council. He held the position between February and August 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea and initiated the war in Donbas. His role as the National Security and Defense Council secretary at the onset of Moscow's aggression made him a common target of Russian propaganda and disinformation. Since 2019, Parubii has served as a lawmaker for ex-President Petro Poroshenko's European Solidarity party. Ruslan Stefanchuk, the current parliament speaker, called Parubii a "consistent defender of Ukrainian statehood." "On behalf of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, I express my condolences to Andrii's family and friends," Stefanchuk said in a public statement. Parubii is survived by his wife and daughter. This is terror," Heraschenko said in a statement published on European Solidarity's Facebook page. The news of Parubii's death also garnered reactions from abroad. "The news of his murder in Lviv is shocking. My sincere condolences to his loved ones and to the entire Ukrainian people, who today lost one of their best sons," Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on social media. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys described Parubii as a "fighter for Ukraine's European future," and expressed his "sincere condolences to his family and loved ones." EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarina Mathernova similarly characterized Parubii as a "fighter for Ukraine's democracy" and relayed her "condolences to his family and friends." Separately, the statement shared by the European Solidarity party suggested that Russia or its "fifth column" may have been responsible for Parubii's death, pointing to the ex-speaker's firmly pro-Ukrainian stances. "It is not yet known who did this. I do not rule anything out and do not want to speculate until we have information about the person who ordered it," Ariev told the Kyiv Independent.</p>

Kamil Majchrzak returns a shot against Karen Khachanov at the U.S. Open in New York on Aug. 28.Sarah Stier/Getty Images

A man who took tennis player Kamil Majchrzak's hat from a young fan at the U.S. Open apologized on social media and said he has returned it.

Piotr Szczerek posted an apology on social media Monday after video of the incident went viral over the weekend. The broadcast showed Szczerek grabbing Majchrzak's hat from a boy after the player's singles match against Karen Khachanov.

Szczerek, who is from Poland, wrote on Facebook that he made a mistake thinking Majchrzak was giving him the hat for his sons, who had asked earlier for an autograph. In the post, he said he had apologized personally.

Majchrzak said on social media that he reached out to the boy's family and met with him to give him a new hat and take photos with him. The 29-year-old, who is also from Poland, retired from his match Saturday because of an undisclosed injury.

TIANJIN, September 1. /TASS/. During their summit meeting in Alaska, the Russian and US presidents, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, agreed upon further steps on settling the Ukrainian crisis, Putin's aide Yury Ushakov said.

"These agreements were the continuation of contacts we, and the president in particular, had held with Trump's special envoy, Mr. [Steve] Witkoff. The results of Witkoff's five visits, especially his latest visit, served as a basis for the talks between our president and the president of the United States. And after that, the presidents agreed on how they will proceed," he said in an interview with VGTRK host Pavel Zarubin.

Apart from that, according to the Kremlin aide, "a lot of mutual understandings" were reached in Anchorage. "And as far as I can see, both the American side and our side continue working based on this agreement, including in contacts with other leaders," he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials in Chicago are bracing for a major federal immigration enforcement operation that could begin as soon as this week, with the city's mayor signing an order over the weekend aimed at resisting the Trump administration's planned crackdown. JB Pritzker said Sunday such a move would be an “invasion” and that he has had no communication with the Trump administration about reported plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago. So, it's clear that in secret they're planning this – well, it's an invasion with US troops, if they in fact do that,” Pritzker said Sunday. “We've already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we're upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on CBS News' “Face the Nation” on Sunday. Asked about expanding these operations beyond Chicago, Noem said that the Trump administration has “not taken anything off the table,” and specifically named San Francisco and Boston in addition to Chicago. She suggested that Republican-led cities with crime problems were “absolutely” also being evaluated. Chicago has been preparing to try to resist Trump's planned immigration crackdown with Mayor Brandon Johnson signing an executive order Saturday providing guidance and directives to the city's agencies and law enforcement “in the midst of escalating threats from the federal government.” The mayor's order “affirms” that Chicago police will not “collaborate with federal agents on joint law enforcement patrols, arrest operations, or other law enforcement duties including civil immigration enforcement.” It also “urges” federal law enforcement officers to use body cameras and refrain from wearing masks. We may even see active duty military and armed vehicles in our streets. Our people have not asked for this, but nevertheless, we find ourselves having to respond to this,” Johnson said before signing the executive order on Saturday. White House officials have made clear that these immigration enforcement plans are distinct from the idea the president has floated over the past week to use federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to carry out a broader crime crackdown in Chicago, similar to the current surge in Washington, DC. Trump took to social media Monday morning with a post celebrating what he called a massive victory over crime in the nation's capital and taking sharp aim at Democratic leaders across the country for refusing his floated plans for an aggressive federal anti-crime strategy in their states as well. In the Truth Social post, Trump said DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's “statements and actions were positive, instead of others like Pritzker, Wes Moore, Newscum, and the 5% approval rated Mayor of Chicago, who spend all of their time trying to justify violent Crime, instead of working with us to completely ELIMINATE it.” Trump officials have been quick to criticize the Illinois governor and defend potential federal policing in the state by pointing to crime statistics. Noem pointed to homicide statistics in Chicago on Sunday in a dig to the governor, saying Pritzker “can talk about what a great job he's doing as governor, but he's failing these families. In a warning to Pritzker on Saturday, Trump told the governor to quickly “straighten” out crime in Chicago or the federal government will intervene. He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!” Trump posted on Truth Social. At least 52 people were shot – seven of them fatally – in Chicago over the holiday weekend. Roughly 30 shootings have been reported since Friday at 10:32 p.m., with victims ranging in age from 14 to 46, according to incident notifications published by the Chicago Police Department. Meanwhile, the Chicago mayor's office last week touted a 21.6% decrease in overall violent crime and a 32.3% decrease in homicides so far this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Baltimore County teachers have secured a new raise agreement but say it is still less than they'd bargained for. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. “Nobody goes into education to become rich, but we deserve what was guaranteed to us,” Cindy Sexton, president of the Teacher's Association of Baltimore County (TABCO), told Truthout. Educators called it a monumental move that not only saved teachers unions from the bargaining table but also ensured incremental pay increases that would be accounted for in each year's budget. “Negotiations are hugely time-consuming, and we wanted a new system where we could all count on our pay and they could focus on the budget it was going to cost them — it was widely touted and celebrated,” Sexton said. And while year one of this deal proved successful, by November 2024, both federal and state funding cuts prompted the Baltimore County school district to ask unions back to the negotiating table, despite their raises already having been approved just the year before. “While we still met with the district about non-monetary things that they could do to help our workload, there was no movement. In February of this year, Baltimore County Executive [Kathy] Klausmeier finally told the district how much money they could count on, and it was far less than what they needed to fund this agreement.” In fact, despite Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) requesting a 10.4 percent increase to their overall budget for the 2025-2026 school year, Klausmeier's finalized budget in April only accounted for a 3.5 percent increase, leaving a gap of $61 million for the teacher's raises. “It just does not appear that [the agreement] was bargained in good faith,” she said. Since then, TABCO has expanded its fight, organizing demonstrations and campaigns that garnered historic teacher turnout. Schools across the county even engaged in their own protests, and some organized a “work-to” rule where teachers would walk out of their classroom outside of work hours — an act that led to an all-member vote through TABCO and encouraged hundreds of other educators to participate. On June 10, teachers rallied at the school board in historic numbers, weeks after Superintendent Myriam Rogers revised the initial 1.5 percent pay raise to 2.5 percent and refused to budge. “The organizing started around anger, really, because our promise wasn't honored,” Sexton told Truthout. According to Sexton, the new raise agreement consists of a cost-of-living adjustment of 1 percent effective on September 20, and then an official pay raise starting on January 6. “So instead of seeing 5 percent for the whole entire fiscal year, we'll see 3.05 percent because we're missing out on several months of that increase,” Sexton told Truthout. Despite this finalized renegotiation representing nearly double the 1.5 percent offered in May, Sexton stresses that it's far from an achievement for them. With next year's pay raise threatened by underfunding, Sexton's first worry is teacher retention throughout the Baltimore County Public School system. “Baltimore County loses approximately 10 percent of its educators every year,” according to Sexton, with most new teachers resigning after short periods of teaching. But this trend is representative of a greater issue in education throughout the country. According to a study conducted by the National Education Association, low pay and poor working conditions keep quality educators from being attracted to — and retained in — the profession. In fact, despite a 4.4 percent increase in teacher's starting salary — representing the most significant increase over the last 15 years — teachers' real salary growth adjusted for inflation is only 1.5 percent. This means that teachers are actually making 5 percent less than they did 10 years ago. “When labor is scarce, compensation must increase,” writes former teacher and education advocate Michael Andoscia. “It's humiliating begging for money and for fair wages, especially when other professions requiring similar skills are more lucrative,” said Carol Frigo, an elementary school teacher with Baltimore County Public Schools. “Young teachers, especially, are realizing they have skills they can take out into the workforce and make a lot more money than doing this job.” “If we can constantly curriculum and use money for so many other things, then we can support our teachers,” said BCPS teacher Gina McDonald. According to Sexton, however, even when there is enough money from the school system, educators are typically the last to be prioritized. “The Board of Education approves millions of dollars in contracts — for the curriculum, for new HVAC systems, and other operating costs,” she told Truthout. “There are a lot of extra supplies that students need that aren't covered by the basics that Title I covers,” one BCPS special ed teacher, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation, told Truthout. “Things to make the classroom feel inviting for students, from fidgets and toys, to snacks, stickers … I bought sensory fabric for students. “There are far too many stories of administrators prioritizing things like technology for the general-ed students, and that's where the money goes — it's not spent on us,” she said. Moreover, with teachers making less than they did just 10 years ago, they simply aren't making enough to cover the heightened cost of living and inflation. Meanwhile, a poll organized by the Maryland State Education Association (TABCO's parent organization) found that 44 percent of Maryland educators alone hold at least one additional job — and for Black and Brown Maryland educators, these figures  jump to 50 percent. On average, U.S. teachers work 53 hours a week, assuming multiple responsibilities like helping students outside of the classroom, performing non-teaching tasks like lunch duty or supervising extra-curricular activities, and covering other teachers' classrooms. “It is not a job you walk away from at 5 p.m.,” one elementary school teacher told Pew Research. The BCPS special education teacher who spoke with Truthout echoed this view. “Teachers are doing so much labor with students,” she said. And just as teachers struggle to make ends meet in a country that withholds resources from them, poverty remains a major problem affecting students when those resources are withheld, with academic underperformance and behavioral issues being most pervasive in high-poverty schools. Cyclically, a factor that further impairs student learning is high teacher turnover — a figure that shows no signs of slowing considering how overworked, underpaid, and undervalued educators feel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Just before midnight on June 13, 2025, a small group of activists gathered quietly outside the Residence Inn by Marriott in Long Beach, California. Within the hour, a small contingent of local residents had arrived at both establishments. They were there to make sure ICE agents didn't sleep. Small, decentralized networks of community members are using stealthy tactics and real-time coordination to monitor, disrupt, and expose the movements of federal immigration officers. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Across L.A. County, the strategy of monitoring ICE movements and responding in real time has become one of the most effective tools in rapid-response activism. “They shouldn't be kidnapping people off the street,” said Michael Gearin, a local Long Beach resident, who spoke to Truthout during the anti-ICE mobilization efforts in June. ​​“If [ICE] wants to come back after a day of kidnapping landscapers and want to kick back and have a beer at the Residence Inn, I say no,” Gearin said, emphasizing his commitment to protecting his neighbors from immigration enforcement. “Why should they have an easy night when everybody else is scared?” Guadalupe Carrasco Cardona, an educator and member of Unión del Barrio, partook in community patrols that monitor and track the movements of immigration enforcement agents, alerting local residents in real time. “[ICE] uses the element of surprise to their benefit,” Cardona told Truthout, noting that many ICE-spotting patrols go early in the morning and search neighborhoods looking for staging of potential agents. The efforts of local activists patrolling their neighborhoods have uncovered useful information. In June, local groups of organizers monitoring ICE activity discovered that Terminal Island in San Pedro is being used by ICE for early-morning staging and dispatching throughout LA County. This piece of critical information made it easier to monitor ICE activity and warn communities before a raid even begins. Cardona also noted that community defense patrols have uncovered tactics used by immigration enforcement agents to evade detection. Many activists there were inspired by the Black Panther Party's model of community patrols, and Unión del Barrio adapted the concept to monitor and protect immigrant communities from immigration enforcement. The recent iterations of patrol efforts in Los Angeles were revived in 2020 as a response to raids occurring under the Biden administration. The coalition now includes over 60 organizations spanning Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and even parts of Northern California. Ron Gochez, another seasoned organizer with Unión del Barrio, said that in addition to conducting patrols, the coalition has developed a training program specifically for schools. The curriculum is designed to help educators protect their students, their students' families, and themselves during potential encounters with immigration enforcement agents. “Educators are on the frontlines of defending their students and families.” Gochez says the effectiveness of localized organizing has forced immigration authorities to adapt. “The entire ICE apparatus had to change their tactics because of our work.” Despite a wave of local support for grassroots mobilization, activists say federal authorities have responded with intimidation and threats aimed at curbing their ongoing efforts. In June, Unión del Barrio received a letter addressed to Gochez from Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who identified himself as chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism. He further alleged that Unión del Barrio had bankrolled civil unrest and abetted criminal behavior, and demanded that the group cease all organized activity. The letter also included a sweeping request for internal records, including communications, emails, chat logs, donor lists, travel and lodging documents, and any evidence of coordination with members of the media. Other grassroots organizations have faced similar threats at the federal level, as was the case with Alejandro Orellana, a 29-year-old immigrant rights advocate with Centro CSO. Orellana was arrested by the FBI in June and charged with “conspiracy to commit civil disorder” after allegedly distributing face shields to protesters during a June 9 demonstration in downtown Los Angeles. Although the Department of Justice later dismissed all charges, advocates view the arrest as part of a broader campaign to intimidate and suppress grassroots organizing, like the work being carried out by Centro CSO and Unión del Barrio. Amanda Trebach, a U.S. citizen, was seized by several masked individuals who did not identify themselves as federal agents while on a morning peace patrol. She was held overnight in federal custody and released the following day without any charges filed. While large protests still play a vital role in public awareness, these smaller, quieter efforts continue to shape what organizers see as a new front line. Whether it is the “disruptive work” of No Sleep for ICE, Know-Your-Rights Workshops, or patrolling neighborhoods, organizers are now two steps ahead. Gochez describes the work of local organizing in Southern California as a sophisticated and efficient network of community members united by a deep commitment to defending one another. Rather, the group also engages in “organized resistance, coalitions, training people, tactics, and strategies that are proven to work.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eighty-six per cent of those who voted in the 500-member International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) supported the motion. The three-page resolution passed by the body calls on Israel to “immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of the population.” The resolution said the IAGS recognised that “since the horrific Hamas-led attack of 7 October 2023, which itself constitutes international crimes”, the government of Israel had engaged in systematic and widespread crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, including indiscriminate and deliberate attacks against the civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, homes and commercial buildings, of Gaza. Founded in 1994, the IAGS has a broad membership that includes academics, historians, political scientists and human rights activists. The 1948 UN convention, drafted in the aftermath of the Holocaust, defines genocide as acts committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. It obliges signatory states to act to prevent and stop such crimes, which may include killing members of a group, inflicting serious harm, imposing destructive living conditions, preventing births or transferring children by force. There was no immediate response from the Israeli foreign ministry. Israel is fighting allegations at the world's top court, the international court of justice, of committing genocide in Gaza. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, but withdrew it after he was killed.</p>

In court on Friday, lawyers for Cook argued that she could not be fired without the notice or “cause” required to remove a Fed governor. She learned of her attempted removal via a post on social media, they said. Lagarde said it would be “very difficult” for Trump to take control of Fed decision-making on interest rates. “The US supreme court, which is largely respected in the country and therefore I hope will be respected by [Trump] as well, has clearly indicated that a Fed governor can only be dismissed in the case of gross misconduct.” Trump received backing for his assault on the Fed last week from Liz Truss, the shortest-serving British prime minister in history, who was ousted after a meltdown in the financial markets. Leading investors and economists have said political interference damages the credibility of central banks to keep inflation under control. US government borrowing costs have risen in recent months amid concern about the impact Trump's tariff policies could have and questions about Fed independence. Borrowing costs have also risen across other advanced economies.

The U.S. has aggressively courted New Delhi under successive administrations, while Sino-Indian relations were bruised by multiple border clashes and trade disputes. Opinion: Trump is putting the screws to India over Russian oil imports, creating an opportunity for Canadian energy While some Western countries – notably Canada – have been wary of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aggressive right-wing Hindu nationalism, he was initially embraced by Mr. Trump, who hosted his “great friend” at a raucous “Howdy Modi” celebration in Texas during his first term. Last month, the U.S. slapped some of its most stringent tariffs on Indian goods, though enforcement of these measures has been thrown into doubt by a recent court verdict. Beijing has not wasted the opening, sending top diplomat Wang Yi to India to smooth over the border issue and create an opening for a meeting between Mr. Xi and Mr. Modi in Tianjin, the Indian leader's first visit to China in seven years. “The world today is swept by once-in-a-century transformations,” Mr. Xi said Sunday as he welcomed Mr. Modi. As well as Mr. Modi, Mr. Xi held bilateral meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who said he briefed his Chinese counterpart on the outcome of his recent summit with Mr. Trump in Alaska. Mr. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Tianjin, China. “This security system, unlike Euro-centric and Euro-Atlantic models, would genuinely consider the interests of a broad range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow one country to ensure its own security at the expense of others,” Mr. Putin said. He and Mr. Xi will be joined at that event by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and 24 other foreign leaders in another show of Chinese diplomatic clout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's Queen Camilla once fended off the unwanted advances of a man on a train, according to a new book, which reveals that she told the story of how she took off her shoe “and whacked him in the nuts with the heel.” Low was told the story by Guto Harri, who worked as communications director for Boris Johnson during his time as Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. Harri recalled how Johnson and Camilla, who was known as the Duchess of Cornwall at the time, had “got on like a house on fire” during a meeting at Clarence House. At that point, Johnson had asked what happened next, Harri told Low. “She was self-possessed enough when they arrived at Paddington to jump off the train, find a guy in uniform and say, ‘That man just attacked me', and he was arrested,” Harri continued. CNN has reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment on the account in the new book, which is due to be published on September 11. The palace has not released an official statement but does not appear to be disputing the reported details. Camilla became Queen in 2022 when her husband, King Charles, acceded the throne following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. She has become known for her dedication to ending violence against women, working to raise awareness of the issue for more than 10 years. Camilla has used her position to highlight organizations that help the victims of both domestic violence and sexual violence, as well as supporting survivors of sexual assault through initiatives such as the Wash Bag Project, which provides toiletries for them to use after undergoing a forensic examination. CNN's Max Foster and Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military exercises began in Belarus on Aug. 31, with participants set to practice nuclear weapons planning, Russian state-run media outlet Ria Novosti reported. Belarusian General Staff chief Pavel Muraveiko said the drills were moved deeper into Belarus "to avoid being accused of various kinds of insinuations and possible provocations" near NATO borders. Moscow has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and its allies throughout the full-scale war. Muraveiko said the drills would focus solely on planning scenarios for potential nuclear use, without involving actual deployment. Belarus, a key ally of Moscow, signed an agreement with Russia in May 2023 allowing the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons on its territory. Ukrainian intelligence has claimed Belarus fields only delivery systems, not nuclear warheads, and dismissed Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko's assertions that Minsk would acquire Russia's new Oreshnik intermediate-range missile system. The CSTO, formed in 2002 as Moscow's answer to NATO, brings together several post-Soviet states but has faced criticism for its reliance on Russia and limited effectiveness. The drills come ahead of large-scale Zapad-2025 Russian-Belarusian exercises expected in September, which Belarusian officials have said will also include nuclear deployment planning. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. "We are accelerating the supply of additional air defense systems to enhance protection against missiles," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. While Moscow has publicly insisted on full control of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, the map indicated possible plans extending to Odesa and Kharkiv, neither of which had been included in earlier demands.

TIANJIN, September 1. /TASS/. The West's constant attempts to draw Kiev into NATO are one of the main causes of the Ukrainian conflict, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.

He pointed out that the crisis arose largely because of the coup d'etat in Kiev in 2014, which was provoked by the West.

"The second reason for the crisis is the West's constant attempts to draw Ukraine into NATO. As we have repeatedly emphasized, this poses a direct threat to Russia's security," Putin noted.

According to the Russian president, as a result of the coup in 2014, "the political leadership of the country that did not support Ukraine's accession to NATO was removed."</p>
