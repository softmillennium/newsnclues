                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why the new FIFA competition is an unnecessary burden on player health Earlier this year, Real Madrid and England national football team star Jude Bellingham turned 22. At an age when he can still barely drink in the US, he will have played 277 career club games and made 44 international appearances for England. Since the age of 16, Bellingham has been playing week in and week out at the highest level of football. For context, at the same age, Cristiano Ronaldo had played 242 games for club and country and Lionel Messi 200 games, while David Beckham, a player known for his work ethic, had played just 100 games, or five times less minutes of playtime than Bellingham. All this is to say that soccer players are playing more minutes and more games than ever before, and they are doing so from a much younger age. While even the greats of the game, like Messi or Ronaldo, didn't experience heavy minutes before their mid-20s, it's now commonplace for wonderkids to be shoved straight into starting lineups and told to deal with it. Barcelona midfielder Pedri made his debut for the club at just 18 years old before playing 52 games that season. With appearances for Spain during and after the season, he played 73 total games in just one season, all while missing any chance of recuperating for the new season over the summer break. It was therefore unsurprising when Pedri missed much of the next season due to injury. Otherwise, they risk fatigue, burnout and injuries that not only wreck careers, but weaken the quality of the football played. Players find themselves unable to keep up with the frantic pace demanded of them, particularly in an age where almost every manager demands offensive, possession-based soccer that requires constant sprinting. Typically, this kind of summer, where no major international tournaments fill up the schedule, would be the perfect time for the likes of Bellingham to recharge, with one eye on next summer's World Cup with some games in Toronto. The Club World Cup, despite the best efforts of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, is a tournament largely muted in terms of fanfare. The hype around the tournament has been cringe-inducing at best; one of the tournament's opening games descended into farce as Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich demolished semi-pro New Zealand team Auckland City FC 10–0. But ultimately, the competition is unnecessary, or even dangerous, for the added burden it will place on footballers going forward. The Club World Cup ended in mid-July, and the La Liga season started on August 17, while pre-season started on August 3. This gives players little rest before being thrown back into the fire of constant games, and with a World Cup next summer, many won't get a proper rest until the summer of 2027. Had it not been for this tournament, he could've had this surgery at the start of June, giving him more time to recover before the regular season. Instead, he'll miss a sizable chunk of the season, while risking even more serious injury by playing through the recovery process. The Champions League and Europa League added two more games to their group stage format last season, bringing little sporting benefit with it. Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden admitted to feeling “burnout” and suffering from injury throughout the 2024–2025 season. This was after two gruelling campaigns in which he was at the forefront of a Manchester City team, being pushed to the line in the Premier League title race, while also making deep cup runs in the Champions League and FA Cup, which takes an inevitable physical and mental toll that is not easy to recover from, even if you do win. When the 2024–2025 season saw him score his lowest number of goals in 5 seasons, it was plain to see why. Already, many have suggested that the Premier League teams in the tournament, Chelsea and Manchester City, will be at a disadvantage to their better-rested rivals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States international Yunus Musah joined Atalanta on loan from AC Milan shortly before the transfer window shut on Monday. Neither Serie A team gave financial details of the deal, but Italian media reports said Atalanta paid four million euros ($4.7 million) for the loan to the end of the season, when it will then have the right to buy the midfielder for 24 million euros ($28 million). Musah, who was born in New York but grew up in Italy and England, has featured in the majority of Milan's matches since joining from Valencia two years ago. He was also eligible to play for England, Italy and Ghana. Atalanta finished third last season but is struggling since coach Gian Piero Gasperini left for Roma after nine years in charge. It has drawn both of its league matches against promoted Pisa and at Parma. Atalanta hosts Lecce in Serie A on Sept. 14, after the international break, before opening its Champions League campaign against holder Paris Saint-Germain. Reporting by The Associated Press.

Instead of experiencing a dip in form after the 2022 World Cup, Argentina have maintained their status as CONMEBOL's top-performing national team in the qualifiers. With only two games remaining, Lionel Scaloni‘s team remains firmly in first place, holding a commanding 10-point advantage over second-place Ecuador. “I think the heat is going to be terribly hard. We already saw it at the Club World Cup… the schedules are going to be similar, at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, because they have to be shown in other countries, so it's not too late, and that has a huge impact. The players are tired, exhausted after a whole season, and no thought is given to what's best for them, which is to play at a time when the heat doesn't have such an impact,” Lionel Scaloni said, via TNT Sports Argentina. Despite scheduled cooling breaks, the physical toll was evident. The Argentine national team, however, is well-acquainted with such conditions. The association argues that any game played in conditions exceeding a Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) of 82.4°F should be postponed to ensure player safety. FIFA announces draw date and venue for 2026 World Cup's never-before-seen format This adjustment seems logical, yet Chelsea and Fluminense faced off in the semifinals of the 2025 Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in sweltering 96°F heat—a venue without a roof. Consequently, this shift could result in venues like Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver hosting more matches, as FIFA prioritizes stadiums with roofs for the 2026 World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Preparations are moving at full speed in Morocco, which has been working diligently since securing World Cup hosting rights last year. Following its redesign, the Tangier venue has also undergone a name change, now officially called the Grand Stade de Tanger instead of Ibn Battuta Stadium. Morocco, which began modernizing the stadium ahead of the 2030 World Cup, has invested $360 million in renovations that were 95% complete as of early September. With these upgrades, the stadium's capacity has risen to 75,000, and it now serves as the home ground of Moroccan First Division side Ittihad Tanger.

The stadium has also been equipped with a new large-scale roof, featuring a 55,000 m² white tensile fabric structure supported by giant steel rings. In addition to standard football amenities such as natural grass, four dressing rooms, high-quality lighting, and a large main screen, the stadium is also designed as a venue for ceremonies and concerts, with meeting rooms, workshop areas, and ample parking. 2030 World Cup will be held in 6 countries across 3 continents Morocco is set to host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations and will co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal. The 2030 World Cup will also feature one match each in Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. The remaining matches will be played in Spain, Morocco, and Portugal.</p>

The official period for doing business might be over, but there is still the opportunity to pull off a shrewd move in the free agent market

Another frenzied transfer window has come to an end, with the market once again dominated by the Premier League in a record-breaking summer of spending by top-flight English sides. But despite the deadline passing, there are still deals to be done.

Away from the big bucks shelled out on the likes of Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko, those who like to do things on the cheap - or are perhaps prone to leaving things until the very last minute and beyond - will now be scouring the free agent market for potential opportunities. In the Premier League, unattached players can be signed at any time and can play immediately, provided there is space in a club's registered squad.

It's a limited pool, but there is the potential to pull off a shrewd move if you act quickly. Below, GOAL looks at the 10 best players currently available to sign for absolutely nothing...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atalanta have completed the signing of United States international Yunus Musah from AC Milan. Musah, 22, has joined Atalanta on loan with an option to buy. The Athletic reported on August 10 that Nottingham Forest entered talks over a potential move for Musah, with personal terms not expected to be an issue. A move never materialised, and Forest further bolstered their midfield with the signings of James McAtee from Manchester City and Douglas Luiz on loan from Juventus. He has made 80 appearances for the Italian side and registered five assists. “I consider Musah an excellent player,” Milan's new sporting director Igli Tare said this summer. The midfielder was omitted from Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan. Musah came through Arsenal's academy and had represented England up to under-18 level. He has since switched allegiances to the U.S. and has made 47 appearances for the national team since his senior debut at 17 years old. They have drawn their opening two matches of the 2025-26 season against Pisa and Parma. He has not been a peripheral figure at San Siro, in fact he made 29 Serie A appearances last season, even if there were only 19 starts. There have been previous links with a move to the Premier League and Nottingham Forest this summer, but the American will now make the relatively short trip from Milan to Bergamo, aiming to become a more consistent starter under new Atalanta boss Juric. The news that Milan coach Allegri was also targeting another midfielder, in France international Adrien Rabiot, will only have strengthened Musah's resolve to head out, especially after he was not selected in Mauricio Pochettino's roster for this month's friendlies with South Korea and Japan.</p>

With just hours remaining in the transfer window, Eintracht Frankfurt are reportedly on the verge of breaking their transfer record.

According to the Daily Mail, the Bundesliga side are close to agreeing a €35 million deal for Newcastle United forward William Osula, which would include a buyback option for the Premier League club.

Frankfurt's current record signing is Hugo Ekitiké, who cost €31.5 million including add-ons when he joined from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2024. He moved on to Liverpool for €95 million this summer.

Osula, 22, has scored three goals in 22 appearances for Newcastle since his €11.6 million move from Sheffield United last summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stan Sport, the streaming service of Australian commercial broadcaster Nine Network, has enhanced its soccer offering with rights to the European qualifiers for next year's 2026 FIFA World Cup. Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. The qualification format sees 48 teams divided into 12 groups of four, with nations playing each other home and away. Australia's public broadcaster SBS holds the exclusive rights to air the World Cup finals, set to be staged across the US, Canada, and Mexico, and will broadcast all 104 games of the tournament via its SBS and SBS Viceland channels and SBS On Demand streaming platform. The European qualifiers are the latest soccer rights to be acquired by Stan, having recently secured exclusive rights to England's top-tier Premier League (EPL) and FA domestic cup as part of a sub-licensing agreement with Optus Sport, the streaming service of the Australian telecoms firm, which is divesting from its broadcast commitments. Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Those were added to the broadcaster's rights to all European soccer's UEFA club competitions, including the top-tier Champions League, second-tier Europa League, third-tier Conference League, and UEFA Super Cup, as well as Germany's top knockout soccer competition, DFB-Pokal. Last week, Stan continued its soccer rights spree with a new multi-year deal for England's top-tier Women's Super League. Other rights in the country held by Nine include rugby union's English Premiership, the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, and SVNS; tennis' Davis Cup; and motor racing's Formula E, World Athletics Championships, and PFL mixed martial arts action.

His attendance shows how FIFA has become a venue where global politics is conducted, and is often a player in its own right. The global football body has also broken free of European governance. After decades of clashes with EU regulators and courts, massive injections of Saudi and Qatari cash have allowed FIFA to cut its reliance on the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and cast off European oversight. FIFA's power used to be balanced by UEFA, which manages many of the world's top clubs, leagues and players. This provided a platform for the European institutions to influence global football through the application of labour law and competition rules. The Meca-Medina case of 2006 confirmed that sporting rules could fall under EU competition law, giving the European Commission unprecedented leverage over football governance. In December 2023, the Court of Justice found that FIFA and UEFA's authorisation rules for new competitions, in this case the highly controversial European Super League, breached EU competition law. Most recently, in October 2024, the Court ruled in Diarra v FIFA that certain transfer restrictions unlawfully limited players' freedom of movement, disproportionately curtailing already short careers. Stephen Weatherill, emeritus Jacques Delors professor of European law at Oxford University, said that FIFA had chafed against these restrictions and tried to minimise compliance. “Even when these few cases are decided by the Court of Justice, FIFA is really good at delaying reform and minimising reform,” he told The Parliament. Even after 2024's Diarra ruling, the global players' union FIFPRO continues to support the player after what it described as “unsuccessful settlement negotiations with FIFA.” “FIFA's continued resistance nearly a year after losing at Europe's highest court is only one of many examples that indicate the systemic problems we currently face,” a representative FIFPRO Europe told The Parliament. The conflict was most visible in this year's massive expansion of the Club World Cup to a multi-stage competition with 32 teams. It's almost a Gordian knot, knowing that FIFA is both judge and party in a given case,” Stefaan Van den Bogaert, professor of European Law and director of the Europa Institute at Leiden University, told The Parliament. As FIFA has come to resemble a giant global business, it has become even less welcoming of European regulatory oversight. “For an institution or a president like Infantino, who only wants to talk to other world leaders, getting a slap in the face from a regional court like the Court of Justice is not something that they are all too happy about,” Van den Bogaert said. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, was a sponsor of the Club World Cup. The TV rights were held exclusively by UK-based streamer DAZN, in which PIF recently acquired a $1 billion minority stake. In late 2023, FIFA awarded Saudi Arabia the 2034 World Cup unopposed. For a body long suspected of corruption, including a well documented 2015 scandal, the shift raises uncomfortable questions about its power and who holds it to account. Petros Mavroidis, a professor of foreign and comparative law at Columbia University, said that FIFA's opaque rules and weak oversight had allowed this influence to take shape. FIFA enjoys the backing of states and sovereign wealth funds willing to bankroll its ambitions without demanding much in the way of regulatory oversight. Football clubs could in theory push back against FIFA's initiatives, rejecting the burden of extra tournaments by simply not participating. But the top clubs are no longer community-based groups of local players; they are international businesses worth billions of dollars, and managed accordingly. “But essentially FIFA co-opted them with this Club World Cup.” An ever-expanding calendar means more bonuses and prize money, but also raises the risks of burnout, injury, and careers being cut short. We kill players now by adding one competition after the other. Shouldn't they have a minimum days of rest? All of these things you have in a CBA [collective bargaining agreement]. I think this is to me where the change should happen,” said Mavroidis. A report on how EU policies can shape the European Sport Model is going through the European Parliament, with provisions designed to promote collective governance, athletes' rights and fans' voices. This dialogue has resulted in standard contract levels for players, among other changes — but the results remain limited to Europe. In US sports, CBAs have forced leagues to negotiate with players' unions on salaries, rest days and workload. Global football has no such framework, leaving FIFPRO with limited leverage over FIFA. Rumblings about player strikes have taken place, but no action has yet been taken and players' welfare remains secondary to FIFA's commercial ambitions. “But it's not going to happen anytime soon, I'm realistic about that.” European attempts to regulate FIFA could also draw opposition from other footballing countries around the world, said Van den Bogaert. “To adopt such a regulation, you will need to have the majority of the member states going for it and I'm not sure whether this will be feasible,” he said. But with growing pressure on players and the centralisation of power, football governance could be heading for a collision. “I think it's underestimated what a fragile and likely transformative stage of football history we're at, where you have all these factors coming together,” Delaney said. “I think we're at the brink of a huge change.” Read the most recent articles written by Matt Lynes - Interview: Marie Bjerre on Denmark redefining its EU role</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A concerning surge in malicious domain registrations designed to exploit the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup, with threat actors already positioning themselves more than a year before the tournament begins. The research, conducted in August 2025, analyzed 498 suspicious domains containing FIFA, football, and World Cup-related terminology, exposing a sophisticated pre-positioning strategy by malicious actors. This upcoming event, scheduled to be hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, represents an unprecedented target for cybercriminals due to its massive scale and global audience. The research revealed a disturbing trend: threat actors are registering domains well in advance of major sporting events, allowing these malicious websites to “age” and appear more legitimate by the time they launch their attacks. A significant spike occurred between August 8-12, 2025, when approximately 299 domains were registered in just five days. The most popular registrars facilitating these registrations included GoDaddy.com LLC, Namecheap Inc., Gname.com Pte. Domain analysis revealed specific targeting strategies, with 173 domains containing “FIFA,” 212 incorporating “football,” and 129 using “worldcup” terminology. Particularly concerning is the geographic targeting, with 23 domains specifically referencing host cities including Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and Texas. The research identified multiple threat categories that fans and businesses should be aware of. These fake storefronts typically collect payment without delivering goods or provide low-quality counterfeit items. Illegal streaming services constitute another major threat vector, with 55 domains promising free or “official” access to World Cup matches. These platforms often serve as delivery mechanisms for malware, credential theft, or subscription scams targeting unsuspecting fans seeking to watch games online. The gambling sector shows significant exploitation, with 32 domains incorporating betting, slot, or casino terminology. These sites often operate without proper licensing and frequently serve as fronts for financial fraud or money laundering operations. The domain analysis revealed sophisticated evasion techniques employed by threat actors. Typosquatting represents a particularly insidious tactic, with domains like “fifaworldcupstadiucom” (missing the “m”) and “fifaclubwccom” (missing the dot) designed to capture users who make typing errors when searching for official FIFA content. These domains can redirect visitors to malicious sites or collect personal information through fake login pages. The research uncovered evidence of sophisticated targeting strategies tailored to specific regions and languages. Multiple domains feature Chinese-language content and Pinyin-style constructions, indicating targeted campaigns toward Chinese-speaking audiences. Additionally, Spanish-language domains align with Mexico's role as a host country, suggesting attackers are customizing their approaches based on the tournament's international scope. Security experts recommend that FIFA, official sponsors, and host cities implement proactive domain monitoring systems to track suspicious registrations using event-related keywords. Defensive domain registration across known malicious top-level domains could help prevent brand abuse and protect fans from fraud. Fans are advised to only purchase tickets through official FIFA channels and verified partners, avoid unofficial streaming platforms, and be extremely cautious of unsolicited messages or advertisements related to the World Cup. As the 2026 World Cup approaches, this early intelligence serves as a crucial warning that the cybersecurity landscape surrounding major sporting events continues to evolve, requiring unprecedented vigilance from organizers, sponsors, and fans alike.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naturally, there were no naming-rights deals or branded signage when FIFA arrived to dress the venues with its tournament branding and the logos of its corporate partners. If FIFA has its way, none of that will be visible next summer. The governing body's policy ensuring that all World Cup venues are free and clear of existing commercial branding during the tournament is long-standing, but the process of “cleaning” stadiums of marks and logos is a uniquely complex — and potentially costly — undertaking in North America. “It's quite the task — pretty Herculean to be honest,” said Drew Bryant, chief creative officer at Elevate, which has been subcontracted by The Look Company to help create FIFA's venue dressings for the tournament. The motivation behind FIFA's insistence on commercially clean venues is protecting the exclusivity for which its sponsors are paying handsomely. “If they told Hyundai-Kia that they would be playing in and talking about Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hyundai-Kia wouldn't have paid what they paid,” said Ricardo Fort, founder of Sport by Fort Consulting and a longtime executive with FIFA partners Visa and Coca-Cola. Unlike the IOC, which for the first time is allowing for the sale of naming rights for Olympic venues in Los Angeles, FIFA is sticking with its policy of requiring that all World Cup venues be devoid of corporate names. MetLife Stadium, for example, which will host the final on July 19, will be known throughout the competition as New York New Jersey Stadium. Many naming-rights deals, particularly those signed in recent years, have carve-outs for major events like the World Cup to ensure the stadium operators don't have to compensate those partners when an entity like FIFA takes over its venue. “Generally speaking, there is a willingness [from the brands] to work [with the stadium operators] and an expectation for some level of compensation,” one World Cup venue official said of situations without an existing carve-out. According to contracts reviewed by Sports Business Journal, stadium owners have promised to turn their venues over to FIFA “free and clear of any and all advertising, marketing, promotion, merchandising and brand identification.” This includes branding on “any stands, scoreboards, seats, seatbacks, time clocks, staff uniforms, accreditation passes, fences or elsewhere inside, surrounding or in the airspace above and around the stadium.” Logos for the teams and leagues that typically occupy the venues must also be removed (all 11 U.S. venues are primarily home to NFL teams). It's also unlikely that many naming-rights deals would have included carve-out language broad enough to include the Club World Cup. FIFA didn't force the issue and even referred to the stadiums by their corporate names in its official materials. FIFA tapped two companies — The Look Company and Wasserman Live (formerly Bluemedia) – to help execute the “Venue Dressing Programme” for next summer's World Cup. FIFA, host city and stadium officials are in agreement that the individual host committees and stadiums (depending on their relationship in each city) are responsible for the costs associated with cleaning the stadium of existing commercial signage. Meanwhile, a FIFA spokesperson said the governing body would cover certain branding elements through its own dressing program and coordinate with cities and stadiums to avoid duplicating costs. Chris Canetti, president of the Houston 2026 World Cup Host Committee, said his committee is budgeting more than $1 million for the process of commercially cleaning NRG Stadium to meet FIFA's guidelines. “We've got some exterior signage to cover and probably some concourse stuff, but FIFA is going to do a lot of branding,” Canetti said. Where de-branding ends and dressing begins will be key to determining how much of the financial burden will fall on each party. It's a critical issue given the struggles most host cities have had raising money through FIFA's host city supporters program. “A lot of them are looking at the event and thinking, ‘I have to ‘clean' the venue, I have to do a public viewing, I have to do decorate and dress up the city to promote the event, and I haven't sold enough sponsorships. While some venues, particularly newer ones, feature more flexible digital signage, others are chock full of physical signage that will be difficult and costly to remove or hide. Adam Fullerton, vice president of stadium operations at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, estimated that there are around 2,000 commercial elements inside, outside and adjacent to the downtown Atlanta stadium that will need to be covered. Jacob Burke, president of The Look Company, also said some stadiums will have more than 2,000 individual items that need wrapping. One of the most complex tasks could be obscuring large-scale overhead signage seen only from above at six U.S. stadiums. Fullerton said Mercedes-Benz Stadium staff is looking at several options, including creating a vinyl graphic to cover the automaker's star emblem on the roof, but he admitted this would be an expensive solution. One possibility explored was whether FIFA's production and broadcast partners could use virtual technology to remove that branding from aerial shots used during World Cup telecasts. Host city leaders who spoke with SBJ remained hopeful this could help keep de-branding costs down. A FIFA spokesperson, however, said that option has been ruled out, claiming the technology is not advanced enough to guarantee complete coverage in aerial shots. The de-branding process will be easier at some venues. BC Place in Vancouver, for example, doesn't have a naming-rights sponsor, meaning there's less exterior branding that needs to be covered. “One of the great things about SoFi stadium and our design is we were very intentional about creating the LED opportunities we have,” said Otto Benedict, senior vice president of facilities and campus operations for all of Hollywood Park. Host cities and stadium operators are waiting for guidance from FIFA on the finer details of their obligations. How stringent the governing body will be in enforcing its clean venue policies — and how the cost burden is shared — remain major unanswered questions with the competition just over nine months away. Only one of the 16 North American venues that will host the World Cup next year does not have a naming-rights deal: Vancouver's BC Place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 2-0 win over Denmark at Windsor Park in October 2023 was the last time Michael O'Neill's side faced such a fixture with their success over the Euro 2024-bound side proving to be something of an outlier in recent times. In the side's preceding 17 qualifiers, they enjoyed just four victories, a pair of wins over both San Marino and Lithuania. In their place, an exciting young core centred around Conor Bradley, Isaac Price, Shea Charles and Trai Hume has emerged to lead the side into a campaign that will see them take on Germany and Slovakia as well as Luxembourg. "That game against Denmark was probably the start of it," said manager Michael O'Neill. "Over the last two years, we've had to develop and grow a team. We've maybe put young players in at times when maybe it was a little bit early, but we felt that was the right thing to do. Steven Davis and Jonny Evans are among those who have retired since the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign When O'Neill returned to the post in December 2022, the idea that he would have to "grow a team" was likely not foremost in his thoughts. In the main, though, the past two years have produced a vast improvement in results, many chiseled out through what could be termed typically O'Neill style performances. Having taken charge of the side on 96 occasions across his two spells, O'Neill is preparing for his fifth qualifying campaign as boss after an eight-year international career as a player. "I think any football situation, whether it's club or international, benefits from stability. Then to come back and commit myself for five years again is creating that stability. "For a number of these players, they've had that consistency coming into international football. Northern Ireland will expect Conor Bradley to play a key role in the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign Drawn in a four-team group, Northern Ireland have had to wait to get their campaign under way, but it begins now with two intriguing, if vastly different, tests. Just three days later they will face four-time World Cup winners Germany in Cologne, a fixture that will be used as a yardstick to measure how far they have come since those tough outings against Spain and Sweden. Such are the margins with only six games to play, four points this week would have fans frantically searching for flights and accommodations options, while fewer than three will feel like the dream is over before it begins.
