                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most Haunted is a TV show that used to scare me when I saw it in the TV guide magazines, until you grow up and realise that Derek Acorah is comedy gold and Yvette Fielding is a TV presenter who was good at scaring Girls Aloud around Welsh castles than she was at doing anything actually paranormal. It's pretty widely accepted by anyone with a crumb of common sense that the show exaggerated a lot of its supposed paranormal phenomena, but now in a new interview the show's resident historian confessed that Most Haunted was fake a lot of the time. But Most Haunted historian Richard Felix, who worked on the show for its first six seasons, confessed that one occurrence in particular was not faked and it still haunts him to this day. Richard Felix was interviewed in a TikTok recently in Derby jail – and was asked about his scariest experience on Most Haunted. Felix said “It's got to be cabin 340.” This is referring to cabin B340 on the Queen Mary ship – which now lies as a hotel and museum in Los Angeles permanently docked. Felix continues “We're on Queen Mary for three weeks, and there's a very haunted cabin. They're losing money by not having people stay in 340. “We've been on there for over two weeks, and I'm thinking ‘come on guys, you're supposed to know this ghost business, surely someone should be staying the night in cabin 340′”. Richard Felix then explains how it was he himself who was the one to stay in the room. It took me til about half one before the security guy come and let me in, and by that time I'd had considerable numbers of quite large glasses of whiskey. It was metallic, it was as if someone had got a huge bundle of metal coat hangers and bounced them from wall to wall. I should have got up and gone back to my own cabin where my wife was, but I didn't. “Ciaran O'Keeffe got his laptop filming me in bed, so I stayed there and went back to sleep. But then, we hear footsteps going around my bed. The lore of the Queen Mary has long rumoured various happenings in cabin B340 – but none have been substantiated and the records maintain that no murder occurred in there. Including another urban legend of a man who murdered two women in the cabin, and when police entered the room they found his violently dismembered body. When the show started it was terrible impressive, but I know full well they needed to keep the public entertained. They believed you needed a ghost every five minutes. “Every time they screamed, fell over, felt sick or got a headache… Have you ever heard anyone screaming before you faint?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even the most witnessed events fade fast because of perception stigma and reporting gaps. Thousands of people saw a row of brilliant lights blinking in the sky, but only a few stepped forward because they feared they might be ridiculed by other members of the community – and the media. What is it about collective consciousness that seems to make group sightings so unreliable? The Phoenix Lights mystery remains a memorable event of collective curiosity, yet it doesn't have the same mass hysteria as an Orson Welles hoax, for example. Different levels of interest, varying levels of belief, and diverse vantage points (caused by weather or landscape) can cause wavering accounts – as can mass hysteria. On September 16th, 1994, near Ruwa, Zimbabwe, 62 pupils claimed to have seen a silver craft in the sky land in a field nearby. A local researcher called Cynthia Hind interviewed the children in groups of four to six. What took place next was a cross-contamination of stories. In Stephenville, Texas (2008), dozens of locals – including a pilot and a police officer – claimed to see a huge silent craft, with radar backing some of their accounts, yet the story barely made national headlines. According to an NPR source, military officials easily discredited the individuals in question because “their imaginations were running wild.” Stigma, skepticism, and lack of media interest often mute even the strongest testimonies. When collective consciousness is shut down so easily, undulating fear creeps into society, regardless of who controls the narrative. That's why when individual whistleblowers come forward, they might well signify something greater than a whacko individual whose imagination has gone cuckoo. Cybernews researchers have discovered severe misconfigurations affecting two Tencent sites, exposing sensitive credentials and internal source code. The critical flaws could potentially grant full access to internal services and backend infrastructure within Tencent Cloud. Tencent explained after the publication that no data was exposed and that the findings relate to a honeypot deployed as a security test.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Canadian heiress from one of the world's richest families is taking her former best friend to court after a cryptocurrency gamble — recommended by a psychic and later confirmed by an astrologer — went disastrously wrong, wiping out $80 million. Taylor Thomson, 66, the middle daughter of Canada's billionaire Thomson family, forged a close friendship with Ashley Richardson, 47, after meeting at a Malibu party in 2009. For over a decade, the pair shared a lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles, but their bond shattered in 2022 following the crypto market crash. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Richardson pushed Thomson to invest in Persistence (XPRT), a little-known digital token, after consulting celebrity psychic Michelle Whitedove. The idea was later validated by Thomson's personal astrologer, Robert Sabella. Richardson has denied the allegations, insisting she always acted with Thomson's consent and even put in her own savings. By mid-2022, amid repeated disputes, Thomson brought in consulting firm Guidepost to investigate. Dizik estimated Thomson's losses at over $80 million tied to Richardson's management of her assets. The Thomson family was named Canada's richest by Maclean's in 2024, with an estimated net worth of $98.15 billion. Bloomberg also ranked them as the 10th richest family globally. The family's investment firm, Woodbridge, owns around 70% of Thomson Reuters, including more than 310 million shares. Taylor herself owns about 14% of the business through Woodbridge. According to Bloomberg's billionaire index, Taylor Thomson has a personal fortune exceeding $13 billion. Speaking to The Journal, her former friend Richardson said, “We would go somewhere for a few days and she'd be buying houses like other people buy mugs… She had so many properties, so much art, so many things. Control of the empire traditionally passed down the male line, leading to tension as she pushed for equal access to family wealth, sometimes straining ties with her brothers. During a custody battle, she hired notorious Hollywood private investigator Anthony Pellicano to spy on a former nanny, fearing she was leaking personal information. She once even accused an employee of embezzling her money and of selling her daughter's designer dresses, which were later found.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rudy Giuliani's car accident, hot on the heels of US President Donald Trump's ‘disappearance', has set off a storm of conspiracy theories on social media. Trump went missing from the public eye for four days last week, fueling rumours about his death. The US president later shared a photograph on Truth Social that shows him posing with Jon Gruden. It is unclear whether the photograph was taken on Sunday. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized late Saturday evening after a car crash near Manchester, New Hampshire, a spokesman said. Prior to the accident, Giuliani had been “flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident" and contacted police assistance on her behalf, his head of security Michael Ragusa said. After police arrived, Giuliani continued on his way and his vehicle was hit shortly after pulling onto the highway in a crash that was “entirely unrelated” to the domestic violence incident, Ragusa told The Associated Press in an emailed statement. The two incidents, while seemingly unrelated, have set off a storm of conspiracy theories online. According to his spokesman the disgraced former mayor stopped his car to “help a domestic violence victim” Bulls**t. Rudy Giuliani has never helped a single individual in life. Some wondered whether Giuliani's accident was being used as a ‘distraction'. “Could Rudy's accident be a distraction from Trump's disappearance which is a distraction from the Epstein files and Wednesday's hearings?” asked one X user. “MAGA sacrificed Rudy yet again to distract from Trump,” another posted. “Wonder if Trump administration set up the accident because Rudy was going to tell what he knows about Epstein,” an X user wondered.</p>
