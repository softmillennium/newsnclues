                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Routine coronary computed tomography (CCT)-based follow-up after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left main coronary artery did not reduce death, myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina or stent thrombosis compared with symptom-based follow-up, according to late-breaking research presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025. The left main coronary artery supplies a large proportion of the heart muscle and significant left main coronary artery disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The introduction of coronary stents along with the improvements in technology and pharmacological management has increased the use of PCI in these high-risk patients with similar results achieved compared with coronary artery bypass grafting. Detrimental complications, such as stent restenosis, and recurrent ischemic events can occur after left main PCI; however, the optimal surveillance strategy remains a subject of debate. In recent years, CCT has emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosis and monitoring, providing accuracy comparable to invasive angiography, while minimising procedural risks and reducing healthcare costs. We conducted the first randomized trial to evaluate the potential benefit of routine CCT-based follow-up at 6 months compared with standard symptom- and ischemia-driven management in patients after PCI for left main disease." PULSE was an open-label, blinded-endpoint, investigator-initiated, randomized trial conducted at 15 sites in Europe and South America. Participants were consecutive patients with critical stenosis undergoing PCI for left main coronary artery disease. In the CCT arm, if significant left main in-stent restenosis was detected, patients underwent invasive coronary angiography followed by target lesion revascularisation if in-stent restenosis was confirmed. In the standard-of-care arm, patients were managed per clinical guidelines and according to each centre's standard practice. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, spontaneous MI, unstable angina or definite/probable stent thrombosis at 18 months. Summing up the main findings, Principal Investigator, Professor Fabrizio D'Ascenzo, also from Hospital Citta Della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, said: "Systematic 6-month CCT-based follow-up did not result in a reduction in 18-month all-cause death, spontaneous MI, unstable angina and stent thrombosis. While universal CCT-based follow-up may not be useful, the marked reduction in spontaneous MI and identification of obstructive lesions requiring repeat PCI suggest this approach may be worth investigating further in selected patients with complex anatomies and over longer follow-up."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More patients with hypercholesterolemia at high/very high risk of cardiovascular (CV) events achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals with inclisiran compared with placebo, when given on top of individually optimized lipid-lowering therapy, according to a late-breaking trial presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025. Elevated LDL-C is causal for the development and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, most patients do not achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals with available lipid-lowering therapies due to suboptimal treatment escalation, nonadherence or concerns about safety, such as muscle pain. The purpose of the VICTORION-Difference study was to compare inclisiran with placebo, on top of individually optimized lipid-lowering therapies, for LDL-C goal achievement and novel endpoints related to muscle-related adverse events and pain-related quality of life (QoL) in a population that mirrors real-world practice." This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase IV trial was conducted at 133 centres in Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, France, Germany, Latvia, Poland and Spain. Eligible patients were at high or very high CV risk according to 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines3 and had elevated LDL-C despite being treated with an individualised maximally tolerated statin dose. In addition to inclisiran/placebo, open-label rosuvastatin (starting dose of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) was sequentially and optimally titrated to the maximally tolerated dose if individual LDL-C goals were not achieved. Most participants (92.3%) were classified as having very high CV risk. Time-averaged mean percentage LDL-C reductions from baseline to day 360 were −59.45% and −24.31% in the inclisiran and the standard-of-care groups, respectively (least squares mean treatment difference 35.14%; p<0.0001). Fewer participants in the inclisiran vs. standard-of-care arms experienced a muscle-related adverse event (11.9% vs. 19.2%; p<0.0001). In addition, numerically larger time-averaged reductions were noted with inclisiran vs. standard-of-care for pain-related severity (−0.11; p=0.0389) and interference scores (−0.11; p=0.0285) using the Short-Form Brief Pain Inventory, which did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, Professor Landmesser commented: "This large study demonstrated the effectiveness of an inclisiran-based treatment strategy over current usual care in bringing patients to early and sustained LDL-C goals, with significantly fewer adverse muscle symptoms. These findings indicate that inclisiran represents a convenient, effective and well-tolerated treatment option for the high number of at-risk patients who currently do not respond adequately to other lipid-lowering therapies."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A mail-based atrial fibrillation (AF) screening programme with ECG-patch monitoring led to a modest long-term increase in AF diagnosis and anticoagulation exposure in older patients at moderate-to-high stroke risk, according to a late-breaking trial presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025 and simultaneously published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association). Explaining the rationale, AMALFI Chief Investigator, Professor Louise Bowman, from Oxford Population Health, United Kingdom, said: "AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, but AF can be difficult to detect as it often occurs without symptoms and/or infrequently. Screening for AF has been proposed as a way to prevent strokes but many short or infrequent asymptomatic AF episodes may be missed. The advent of new monitoring technology has enabled longer-duration screening. The AMALFI trial was designed to assess the long-term efficacy of remote screening for asymptomatic AF in older individuals at increased risk of stroke using a 14-day continuous ECG monitoring patch." In the investigator-initiated, parallel-arm unblinded randomized controlled AMALFI trial, eligible individuals were identified from 27 primary care practices in the UK via automated electronic health record searches. The key exclusion criterion was a previous diagnosis of AF or atrial flutter. Participants were randomized 1:1 either to receive and return by postal mail an ECG patch monitor or to usual care (control). At baseline, participants had a mean age of 78 years, 47% were female and 19% had a prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack. There was a modest increase in AF diagnosis at 2.5 years with the ECG patch. Our trial shows that remote AF screening with an ECG patch monitor in older patients at moderate-to-high stroke risk leads to a modest increase in AF diagnosis and anticoagulation exposure. However, AF diagnosis unrelated to the patch occurred more commonly than anticipated and over half of the patch-detected AF burden was low burden (below 10%). This suggests that AF screening in this setting may have limited impact on stroke events; longer-term and cost-effectiveness analyses of AMALFI are planned and will provide more insight in due course."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beta-blocker therapy significantly reduced a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, new myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF) compared with no beta-blocker therapy in the subgroup of patients with MI and mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), according to an individual patient data meta-analysis presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 2025. "Patients post-MI with mildly reduced LVEF (40−49%) but without HF represent a sizeable population. While it is intuitive to argue that these patients benefit from beta-blockers in a similar way as patients with reduced LVEF (<40%), there have been no specific randomised trials. Four recent randomised trials tested assessed beta-blockers after a recent MI in patients with LVEF ≥40%; however, none was individually powered to assess effects in the mildly reduced LVEF 40−49% subgroup," explained Doctor Xavier Rosselló from the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC), Madrid, Spain and the Son Espases University Hospital, Palma de Mallorca, Spain, speaking on behalf of the researches from the four trials. A systematic review was conducted of randomized controlled trials with beta-blockers performed in the reperfusion era (from 2000 onwards) with a median follow-up of more than 1 year in patients with a recent (within 14 days) MI (both ST-elevation MI or non-ST-elevation MI), mildly reduced LVEF and no history or clinical signs of HF. In a prespecified, individual patient level meta-analysis across the four trials, a one-stage, fixed-effects approach was used to assess the effect of beta-blockers on the pre-defined primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, new MI or HF. The primary endpoint occurred in 10.7% of patients in the beta-blocker group and 14.4% of patients in the no beta-blocker group, representing a significant 25% relative reduction with beta-blockers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.97; p=0.031). New MI occurred in 3.9% and 5.2% of patients, respectively (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.11), while HF occurred in 3.0% and 4.4% of patients, respectively (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.14). In addition, cardiac death was found to occur in 1.8% of patients on beta-blockers and 3.3% of patients with no beta-blockers (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.06). Our findings extend the known benefits of these agents in MI patients with reduced LVEF to the subgroup with mildly reduced LVEF. Further research should now focus on patients with preserved LVEF (>50%)."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Feeding blueberries to infants in the first year of life may help alleviate allergy symptoms and alter immune responses, suggesting a new dietary approach in infant health research. Study: Blueberry Consumption in Early Life and Its Effects on Allergy, Immune Biomarkers, and Their Association with the Gut Microbiome. The complementary feeding period represents a critical time frame for shaping infant immune development, diet, and gut microbiota. Infants started the blueberry powder around 5 months old, consuming roughly one serving daily mixed into purees or breastmilk throughout the complementary feeding period. Current recommendations suggest introducing a range of plant-based foods from six months of age, in conjunction with continued breastfeeding. Growing evidence supports a role for blueberries in the microbiota-inflammation-immunity axis and gut microbial homeostasis. The first year of life is a critical window for establishing immune competence and preventing allergic diseases. Dietary exposures during this period can influence the induction of immune tolerance, epigenetic programming, and gut microbial succession. Suboptimal or aberrant microbial colonization has been linked to increased gut permeability, impaired innate immune responses, and low-grade inflammation, all of which are associated with a higher risk of diseases in later life. In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of early-life blueberry intake on allergy-related symptoms, gut microbiota, and immune biomarkers. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited participants from households with infants aged 3 to 4 months. The blueberry group received blueberry powder at 10 g per packet, while the placebo group received a color- and flavor-matched, isocaloric powder. Caregivers were instructed to offer one packet daily from baseline to 12 months (of age), and avoid other forms of blackberries or blueberries throughout the intervention. Infant blood and stool samples were collected at several time points. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to assess gut microbial profiles. Caregivers were asked whether their child had any respiratory symptoms, such as whistling or wheezing in the chest, dry cough unrelated to chest infection or cold, nasal symptoms unrelated to cold, skin-related concerns (e.g., itchy skin), gastrointestinal symptoms, or other symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction, at each study visit. Baseline characteristics were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's exact tests. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare differences in cytokines/chemokines between groups. Correlations between cytokines and bacterial taxa were examined using Kendall's rank correlation test. Anthocyanins, the key pigments in blueberries, appear central to the effects, potentially suppressing allergy-related immune pathways while boosting regulatory functions based on cited lab studies. Both groups had similar baseline characteristics, with a mean age of 22 weeks at enrolment. No infant in either group received cough suppressants, antibiotics, or had feeding concerns at baseline. Respiratory symptoms were significantly different between groups at baseline. Conversely, the placebo group had no such symptoms. Longitudinal analysis of allergy symptoms revealed significant differences in the trajectories of respiratory (p = 0.02) and overall allergic symptoms (p = 0.05). Caregivers collected infant stool samples using special biodegradable liners placed inside diapers, freezing them at home before transport to the lab for microbiota analysis. Most cytokines did not show significant differences between groups. Cytokine analyses were only available for 48 infants, which limited the statistical power. Changes in allergy symptoms were not significantly associated with IL-10 or IL-13. In total, 32 cytokine-bacteria associations, involving 18 bacterial groups and 19 cytokines, were reported. IL-10 levels were positively associated with Megasphaera, Clostridiaceae, and Lactobacillus at 12 months. IL-10 showed negative associations with Peptostreptococcaceae, Blautia, and Lacticaseibacillus at 12 months. These microbiota–cytokine associations were exploratory and not adjusted for multiple comparisons, so they should be considered hypothesis-generating. In summary, the findings indicate that blueberry intake during infancy may influence the resolution of allergic symptoms and modulate immune development. The associations of immune markers, such as IL-10 and IL-13, with specific bacterial taxa highlight potential targets for further mechanistic investigations. However, the cytokine analyses were limited by small sample sizes and missing data, and the study was not designed to detect clinical endpoints. Additional studies are needed to explore the specific blueberry components driving these effects and investigate whether other complementary foods can confer similar benefits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists reveal how plant-based compounds may combat Alzheimer's through multi-target actions, but poor bioavailability and the blood-brain barrier limit the way dietary hope can be translated into real therapies. In a recent review published in the journal Food Science & Nutrition, researchers synthesized evidence on how dietary polyphenols modulate Alzheimer's disease (AD) biology and evaluated mechanistic, computational, and translational insights. Resveratrol sparks a cellular "cleanup crew," activating SIRT1 proteins linked to longevity and neuronal survival, offering a dual defense against Alzheimer's pathways beyond just reducing inflammation. AD, the leading cause of dementia, features amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation that gradually erode memory and independence. Interest in polyphenols from fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, and wine has grown because many people hope that everyday foods can support brain health. People also want to know whether these plant compounds can truly change disease biology, not just symptoms. Current treatments are limited, which increases the demand for safe and accessible options. Further research is needed to turn these promising mechanisms into dependable, patient-centered benefits. Curcumin teams up with unexpected partners, like steroid molecules or probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, creating combinations that show stronger memory protection in animal studies than curcumin alone. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which Aβ peptides accumulate as plaques, microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, and neurons are injured by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and persistent immune activation. These connected processes weaken synapses and cognition over time so that a little forgetfulness can grow into lost names, unpaid bills, and eventually complete dependency. Together, these signals support a translational focus on how polyphenols act across oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, as well as on how such actions might be applied in clinical practice. Beyond Nrf2 and NF-κB, polyphenols quietly influence other key players, like enzymes breaking down brain barriers (MMPs) and hormone signaling pathways (ESR1), suggesting wider biological effects than commonly discussed. Oxidative stress is a core driver of neuronal injury in AD. Polyphenols such as EGCG, resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin enhance endogenous defenses by activating nuclear factor erythroid 2 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and temper pro-oxidant cascades regulated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Resveratrol similarly attenuates NF-κB-mediated signaling, reducing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Quercetin, on the other hand, exerts dual actions—activating Nrf2 and inhibiting MAPK, to prevent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. These concerted effects make polyphenols more than simple radical scavengers; they act as network modulators that recalibrate redox homeostasis in vulnerable neurons. Resveratrol suppresses microglial activation and decreases the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α; curcumin limits NF-κB translocation by preserving the inhibitor of kappa B (IκB). By shifting the glial environment toward resolution rather than attack, polyphenols preserve synapses and support plasticity that underpins learning and daily function. Tau proteins aren't just tangled; polyphenols like EGCG act like molecular shields, physically preventing the specific chemical changes (hyperphosphorylation) that turn tau toxic and disrupt vital cellular transport systems. Computational biology strengthens the mechanistic case by showing how polyphenols may bind proteins that drive AD. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicate interactions with beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), tau, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3-β), a kinase that promotes tau hyperphosphorylation. In the present review, myricetin, luteolin, kaempferol, caffeic acid, quercetin, apigenin, curcumin, and ferulic acid exhibited strong predicted binding to GSK3-β, with docking scores from approximately −11.8 to −8.7 kcal/mol and recurring contacts at residues such as VAL A:135 and ASN A:64, stabilizing inactive conformations and implying a route to reduce tangle formation. Related analyses note marine-derived compounds that inhibit AChE and BACE1 while modulating NF-κB, underscoring a multi-target strategy. Such in silico evidence does not replace validation, but it accelerates candidate selection and analog design, focusing scarce trial resources on scaffolds that are most likely to modify the disease. Naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, gets a delivery upgrade – specially designed "biomimetic" nanoparticles boost its brain levels, allowing lower doses (20mg/kg) to reduce amyloid plaques effectively in tests. Promise meets pragmatism at the pharmacokinetic bottleneck: many polyphenols have poor bioavailability and limited blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Rapid metabolism and low central exposure can blunt otherwise potent mechanisms. The review also notes that inter-individual gut microbiota variability can influence polyphenol metabolism and brain-active metabolite profiles. However, this remains a secondary limitation compared with bioavailability and BBB challenges. These strategies aim to translate bench signals into clinically meaningful effects without compromising safety. Because polyphenols are found in daily diets in foods like berries, apples, onions, green tea, coffee, and olive oil, the science relates to grocery choices. Diets inspired by Mediterranean or Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) patterns, combined with exercise and social engagement, are associated with lower oxidative stress and inflammation, and may help slow cognitive decline, providing families with practical steps while research advances. Guidance should respect cultural cuisines and budgets, ensuring that brain-healthy actions are feasible for all in routine clinical care. This review characterizes how polyphenols can address AD through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and multi-target actions that intersect with Aβ, tau, and redox biology. Going forward, trials, standardized formulations, and delivery systems that enhance brain exposure are essential to translating bench insights into benefits that matter to patients and their families.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A tightly controlled clinical trial reveals that ultra-processed foods not only drive weight gain and worsen cholesterol levels but also impact reproductive hormones and sperm health, highlighting harms that extend beyond calories alone. Study: Effect of ultra-processed food consumption on male reproductive and metabolic health. In a recent article in the journal Cell Metabolism, researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate whether ultra-processed foods (UPFs) harm reproductive and metabolic health. They found that UPF-rich diets increased unhealthy cholesterol levels, fat mass, and body weight. These diets also altered hormones related to reproduction and metabolism. Sperm motility showed a non-significant downward trend after multiple-testing correction compared with unprocessed diets. UPFs have become a significant part of diets worldwide, accounting for more than half of daily energy intake in countries such as Canada, Australia, the UK, and the USA. These foods, classified as NOVA category 4, are made from highly processed or synthetic ingredients. Beyond poor nutritional value, UPFs may expose consumers to contaminants like phthalates. Epidemiological studies link UPF consumption with obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and mental health problems. While prior research has examined cardiometabolic outcomes, far fewer studies have explored reproductive effects. There is evidence of a global decline in sperm count, around 60% since the 1970s. Factors such as higher body weight, poor dietary fat intake, and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may contribute. UPFs are likely to play a role. Previous randomized trials have confirmed that UPFs increase calorie intake by 500–800 kcal/day compared to unprocessed diets; however, it remains unclear whether adverse outcomes result from excess calories alone or the inherent properties of UPFs. Each participant received both an unprocessed and a UPF-rich diet for 3 weeks at either a calorically adequate or excess level, with the diet order randomized. Both diets were similar in macronutrient composition, but UPFs contained more saturated fat, cholesterol, refined grains, and sugar, and less fiber. After seven study visits, participants underwent anthropometrics, Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans, blood draws, and semen collection. Data were evaluated with mixed linear models that adjusted for diet order and multiple testing. The UPF diet resulted in significant weight gain (approximately 1.3–1.4 kg) and an increase in fat mass (approximately 1 kg) in both calorie arms, primarily due to weight loss during the unprocessed diet. Cholesterol levels and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) rose with UPF intake, in the adequate-calorie arm only, while diastolic blood pressure increased in the excess-calorie arm only. Reproductive effects were notable, with the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) decreasing in the excess calorie arm and testosterone showing a downward trend in the adequate arm, while sperm motility tended to decline but was not statistically significant. UPF intake decreased lithium and mercury in blood and semen, while slightly raising serum levels of a phthalate metabolite (cxMINP). Both experimental diets were cleaner than participants' habitual diets, leading to lower overall pollutant exposure, though UPFs still introduced specific harmful compounds. Mental health markers were essentially unchanged, though depression scores trended upward with UPFs. Inflammatory markers showed minor shifts, with relative to baseline, the unprocessed diet showing a transient pro-inflammatory signature in lean participants (higher IFN-γ and CRP, lower IL-4); however, versus UPF, the unprocessed diet increased IL-4 and tended to reduce MCP-1, while CRP was unchanged. This trial showed that UPFs negatively affect cardiometabolic and reproductive health, even when calorie intake is controlled. Importantly, these effects were not fully explained by calorie load, suggesting that calories from UPFs and unprocessed foods are metabolized differently. Trends in pollutant accumulation were also observed, with increased levels of certain phthalates after UPF intake, which may contribute to cardiovascular, reproductive, and mood-related effects. This report presents secondary outcomes only; the trial's primary endpoint (sperm DNA methylation) will be reported separately. Overall, the study supports reducing UPF consumption to promote metabolic, reproductive, and mental health. However, limitations include reliance on self-reported adherence, a relatively short intervention period, and possible transient effects that may differ with longer-term diets.
