                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After letting eight match points slip away against Barbora Krejcikova in the fourth round of the US Open, a disappointed-yet-energized Taylor Townsend is excited about where her game is and what the future holds. In one of the most memorable weeks of her career, Taylor Townsend was on the brink of reaching her first career Grand Slam singles quarterfinal. After pummeling Barbora Krejcikova 6-1 in the first set of their fourth-round match in Louis Armstrong Stadium, the American had eight match points in the second set -- seven of which came in one of the most thrilling, edge-of-your-seat tiebreaks in recent memory. Over the course of over 25 minutes, with the 14,000-strong crowd in Armstrong rallying fiercely behind Townsend -- and watching the incredibly tense rallies with bated breath -- the two-time Grand Slam champion saved seven match points before closing it out 15-13. A post shared by US Open (@usopen) Townsend burst into tears after the excruciatingly painful defeat, but after the match -- after she'd had a bit of time to process it -- she seemed grateful, motivated and ready to build on her momentum. She's a two-time Grand Slam champion. I have beaten a Grand Slam champion this tournament. "So I have everything that I need, and it's just about getting the reps, keep putting myself in these types of positions. The Grand Slam champion that Townsend is referring to is Jelena Ostapenko, who she upset in the second round. There was a heated exchange at the net after the match, and Townsend handled herself with grace and confidence, earning the support of fellow players and fans. She followed that up with an even bigger upset, a straight sets win over fifth-seeded Mirra Andreeva, and tore the house down with a cool-as-can-be post-match interview in Arthur Ashe Stadium that cemented her as the darling of the tournament. In Armstrong on Sunday, it was one of the most electric environments we've seen all tournament, and you could feel that something special was brewing. "It just stings, because I literally gave everything," the doubles World No. "She came up with some really, really great tennis in moments where she was down, and I thought I had it. But it's a part of sports. For me, I'm like, 'Damn, when is the next time I'm going to play a singles match?' With that, I know I can do it, me and my partner have done it before. This is just motivating me to keep doing the things that I know I can do to be a champion. A two-time Grand Slam doubles champion, Townsend made the doubles final of the US Open with Caty McNally in 2022. (Interesting, they lost that final to Krejcikova and her countrywoman, Katerina Siniakova.) Townsend, now partnering with Siniakova, will take on Yue Yuan and Camila Osorio in the Round of 16 on Monday. After letting eight match points slip away against Barbora Krejcikova in the fourth round of the US Open, a disappointed-yet-energized Taylor Townsend is excited about where her game is and what the future holds.</p>

In the second set, Rincón broke serve in the third and fifth games before closing out the match in convincing fashion.In his on-court speech, Rincón paid tribute to the Academy where he has trained for the past six years: “They trusted me when I was a kid, they've helped me so much.

In his on-court speech, Rincón paid tribute to the Academy where he has trained for the past six years: “They trusted me when I was a kid, they've helped me so much. Tournament director Joan Suasi hailed both the atmosphere and the significance of Rincón's breakthrough: “It's wonderful to see this crowd and this energy. Having Dani win here, after so many years of trying, is a fantastic success for the Academy and for the tournament.”With this triumph, Rincón adds his name to a winners' list that includes Duje Ajdukovic (2024), Hamad Medjedovic (2023), Luca Nardi (2022), Lukas Lacko (2021), Emil Ruusuvuori (2019), and Bernard Tomic (2018). Already a symbolic victory on home soil, it may prove the launching pad for an even brighter career ahead.

Guy Den Ouden claimed the CT Porto Cup title on Sunday, defeating Belgian teenager Gilles-Arnaud Bailly 6-4, 6-2 to earn the second ATP Challenger Tour trophy of his career.The 23-year-old Dutchman, ranked World No. 161, overcame a slow start after rain delays left the court damp. Bailly, contesting his first Challenger final, broke early, but Den Ouden's consistency and variety - particularly his effective drop shot - turned the match around. From midway through the opening set, he controlled proceedings and never looked back.“The start was a little difficult and I got too emotional, but it was an excellent tournament,” Den Ouden said. 161, overcame a slow start after rain delays left the court damp.

For 19-year-old Bailly, the defeat was softened by a breakthrough week. The Como Lake Challenger confirmed its reputation as a stage for rising stars, as Luka Mikrut captured his first ATP Challenger crown at just 21 years of age. The Croatian lifted the “Intesa Sanpaolo” trophy at Villa Olmo after defeating compatriot Duje Ajdukovic 6-3, 7-5 in Sunday's final.For Mikrut, the victory marked a breakthrough moment after narrowly missing out on his maiden Challenger title in Zagreb last year. This time, he kept his composure against a more experienced opponent who had already won three Challenger tournaments. Despite Ajdukovic entering as the favorite, Mikrut took command early, sealing the opening set in just over half an hour. The second set proved tighter, but Mikrut held firm under pressure, saving break points at 15-40 before capitalizing on a lapse from Ajdukovic at 5-5 to close out the matchafter one hour and 34 minutes.Reflecting on his achievement, Mikrut said: “It has been a tough but beautiful week, with conditions changing all the time. I'm happy to have won my first Challenger here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only one American man remains in the US Open, but he shows no signs of being ready to go home. Fourth seed Taylor Fritz earned a statement 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory in just one hour and 38 minutes against 21st seed Tomas Machac Sunday evening to reach the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows. He will next take on 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic. It has been a difficult few days for American men, with Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul all exiting the tournament. But Fritz, who needed four sets in both the second and third rounds, produced a flawless performance inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, triumphing without facing a break point. “It's been a tough week for the guys. One year ago at the US Open, Fritz fell just one victory short of becoming the first American man to win a major singles title since Andy Roddick at Flushing Meadows in 2003. He looks intent on making another charge towards Slam glory. Fritz hit 30 winners — including 14 aces — compared to just 18 unforced errors against Machac and won 91 per cent of his first-serve points. On this occasion, Fritz left no doubt by consistently putting pressure on his opponent without giving him any opportunities to break through. “I had some battles the past couple matches, but just felt very dialed in, ready to go tonight,” Fritz said. “Thought I played just really solid, put a lot of balls in the court, was aggressive at the right times and backed it up well with good serving.” Djokovic will take a 10-0 lead in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series into their quarter-final. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings and has earned at least 40 tour-level wins in four consecutive seasons according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
