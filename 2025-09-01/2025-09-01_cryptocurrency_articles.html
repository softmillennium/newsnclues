                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- The initiative aims to modernize financial infrastructure by enabling instant asset settlements, NFT transactions, and public subsidy distributions while complying with Japan's strict FSA regulations. - Major institutions like MUFG and SMBC are testing DCJPY for cross-border payments, contrasting with JPYC's public blockchain model, which allows partial JGB collateral but faces interoperability challenges. - Retail users will access DCJPY via a mobile app, democratizing digital asset participation for 120 million account holders and unlocking ¥190 trillion in liquidity for tokenized investments. - Japan's regulated approach prioritizes stability over speed, differentiating from U.S. stablecoins, and positions DCJPY as a blueprint for balancing innovation with financial system integrity. Scheduled for fiscal year 2026, DCJPY will function as a tokenized deposit, pegged 1:1 to the yen and fully backed by the bank's ¥190 trillion ($1.3 trillion) deposit base [1]. By leveraging its 120 million account holders and institutional partnerships, Japan Post Bank aims to unlock liquidity in digital assets while addressing systemic inefficiencies in asset settlement and public financial services [2]. DCJPY's institutional adoption is underpinned by its alignment with Japan's stringent regulatory framework. Unlike private stablecoins such as JPYC, which operate on public blockchains and face scrutiny over collateral transparency, DCJPY's permissioned structure ensures compliance with the Financial Services Agency's (FSA) requirements for deposit insurance and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols [3]. This regulatory clarity has attracted major financial institutions, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), which are already testing the platform for cross-border settlements and corporate treasury management [4]. Local governments are also exploring its use for distributing subsidies and disaster relief payments, a move that could digitize public administration and create a new utility for the token [6]. Japan Post Bank's retail strategy hinges on its vast customer base and user-friendly infrastructure. By allowing account holders to convert savings into DCJPY via a mobile app, the bank is democratizing access to digital assets such as securities and NFTs [7]. This approach addresses a critical barrier to adoption: the complexity of blockchain technology for non-technical users. This dual focus on security and accessibility could catalyze Japan's transition to a tokenized economy, where digital assets coexist with traditional financial instruments. However, DCJPY's deposit-backed model provides greater transparency and stability, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where liquidity management is critical [12]. The FSA's cautious approach to digital assets further differentiates Japan from the U.S., where stablecoins like USDT and USDC gained traction before regulatory frameworks were established [13]. By requiring 100% reserve backing for JPYC and subjecting DCJPY to rigorous compliance checks, Japan is prioritizing financial stability over rapid innovation. This strategy may slow adoption but ensures that digital currencies remain a trusted component of the financial system. Japan Post Bank's DCJPY initiative exemplifies how regulated digital currencies can modernize financial infrastructure while balancing innovation with stability. For retail users, it provides a low-risk gateway to digital assets, fostering broader participation in the tokenized economy. As Japan navigates the complexities of blockchain integration, DCJPY's success could serve as a blueprint for other nations seeking to harness digital finance without compromising regulatory integrity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin bulls are trying to push the price back above $110,530, but bears continue to sell breakouts and the range highs. The shallow pullback in select altcoins suggests that the investors are not hurrying to sell them as they anticipate the up move to continue. Bitcoin (BTC) is trying to rise above $110,000, but the bears are defending the level. Crypto market sentiment platform Santiment said in a report that “buy the dip” mentions have increased on social media, signaling further downside. Santiment said that a true bottom would form when there is “widespread fear and a lack of interest in buying.” Another negative for the bulls is that September has largely been negative for BTC. According to CoinGlass data, BTC has closed September in the red on eight occasions since 2013, with an average slide of 3.80%. Despite the seasonal weakness and the pullback in BTC and major altcoins, institutional investors continued their purchases. Digital asset investment products witnessed $2.48 billion in inflows last week, reversing $1.4 billion in outflows in the prior week, according to CoinShares data. Could BTC climb back above $110,530, pulling ETH and altcoins higher? If they can pull it off, the index could plummet to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) (6,316) and then to the breakout level of 6,147. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and 6,147 because a break below it signals a short-term top. The correction could then deepen to 5,950. There is minor support at 97.55, but if the level cracks, the next stop could be 97.10 and then 96.37. BTC plunged below the $110,530 support on Friday, indicating that the bears are trying to take charge. The bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to make a comeback. They will attempt to push the price back above the 20-day EMA ($112,566) but are expected to face significant resistance from the bears. If the BTC/USDT pair turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it signals a negative sentiment. Alternatively, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests that selling dries up at lower levels. This is a critical level for the bulls to defend because a break below it opens the doors for a fall to $3,745 and then to $3,350. The pair could then skyrocket toward $5,500. XRP (XRP) continued its slide to reach the crucial support of $2.73, where the buyers are expected to step in. Any recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($2.94). The XRP price will then complete a bearish descending triangle pattern, clearing the path for a collapse to $2.33. Buyers have an uphill task ahead of them. They will have to push and maintain the XRP price above the downtrend line to signal a comeback. The pair may then climb to $3.40. Buyers are trying to maintain BNB (BNB) above the 20-day EMA ($847), but the bears are unlikely to give up easily. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the 20-day EMA and breaks above $881, it signals that the bulls remain in control. That enhances the prospects of a break above $900. Solana (SOL) turned down and broke below the breakout level of $210 on Friday, indicating that the bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls. Contrarily, a break and close below the uptrend line invalidates the bullish ascending triangle pattern. Related: Will XRP price drop toward $2 or reverse course? Dogecoin (DOGE) has again dropped to the $0.21 support, indicating that the bears are selling on minor rallies. That increases the risk of a break below $0.21. The DOGE/USDT pair may then slump to $0.19. This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up sharply from $0.21 and breaks above the 50-day SMA ($0.22). That suggests the Dogecoin price may swing between $0.21 and $0.26 for a few more days. Buyers attempted to stall Cardano's (ADA) pullback at the 50-day SMA ($0.82), but the bears maintained their selling pressure. Buyers will have to propel Cardano's price above the downtrend line to signal a comeback. The pair could then rally to $1.02. That suggests solid buying at lower levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to some Republican lawmakers, the first crypto-related priority in the Senate will be to pass legislation for market structure. After a monthlong break, the US Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to return to conducting government business, which includes key policies affecting the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. The move effectively paused any work toward passage of a bill to establish digital asset market structure, consider the nomination of Brian Quintenz to become chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and legislation containing a provision for restricting a central bank digital currency (CBDC). One of the first legislative items on Republicans' agenda upon their return will be to pass a bill establishing crypto market structure out of a committee and for a floor vote. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the most outspoken voices in Congress advovating for less restrictive and clearer crypto regulations, has been one of the lead Republicans calling for market structure. At time of publication, neither the Senate Agriculture Committee nor Senate Banking Committee had announced hearings to consider the bill. Even with Johnson's impending departure and the CFTC running without many in leadership positions, Quintenz's confirmation did not appear to be a guarantee at time of publication. Related: Crypto advocacy groups double down on Quintenz confirmation at CFTC amid pushback Though both brothers initially supported the nomination after Trump announced it in February, they later claimed he would not fully enact the president's crypto agenda. As of Monday, the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to consider five of Trump's nominations on Wednesday, but the Senate Agriculture Committee had not set up a time for Quintenz. However, it appears that Republicans are looking for alternatives to the bill, which was sent to the Senate for consideration. In August, the House Rules Committee shared a revision to HR 3838, a bill implementing the National Defense Authorization Act. It's unclear which bill, if any, will have enough support to pass through Congress  without amendments or modifications.

Learn how BSACK positions itself among the hottest crypto presale to buy right now. From April lows of $1,386, ETH surged to retest the $4,700 zone in August—a staggering 239% rally. This powerful rebound has reignited investor confidence, supported by major network upgrades boosting scalability, security, and staking efficiency. ETH is now up over 60% year-to-date, with bullish sentiment across the crypto community fueling optimism. Blocksack is a revolutionary meme cryptocurrency and decentralized ecosystem built on the BASE blockchain. Known by its ticker BSACK, Blocksack represents the ultimate fusion of meme culture, blockchain innovation, and real-world use cases. These additions give presale crypto tokens like BSACK functional depth while maintaining the humor and community spirit meme coins thrive on. This unique storytelling has elevated Blocksack's position on the crypto presale list, drawing attention from both retail and whale investors. With its integration on the fast-growing BASE blockchain, Blocksack offers low fees, rapid transactions, and Ethereum compatibility. Ethereum holders are gradually moving funds into the Blocksack presale crypto, reflecting a shift in strategy. As ETH struggles with consolidation near its highs, presale coin opportunities present earlier entry advantages. This rotation highlights a growing pattern among crypto presale projects, where investors seek both community appeal and technological promise. The move underscores how even established ETH holders see value in spreading capital across new crypto token presale opportunities while maintaining exposure to legacy assets. Ethereum's recovery shows the resilience of established blockchains, but its resistance zones slow immediate growth. In contrast, Blocksack taps into the momentum of cryptocurrency presales, offering entry before wider market adoption. Among new crypto presale projects, Blocksack is earning visibility for its unique positioning. As crypto presales evolve, both Ethereum and Blocksack stand as reminders that growth comes not only from past performance but from innovation, narrative, and community trust within token presales.

The crypto market continues to evolve with new projects, meme coins, and utility-driven innovations entering presale stages. Early participants are showing strong interest, especially as BlockDAG's large community engages with this new crypto token presale. With token presales gaining momentum in 2025, investors are adding BlockSack to their watchlists alongside established crypto presale projects. BlockSack positions itself as the raw origin of meme culture within crypto. Marketed as the “Daddy of All Memes,” its theme is both bold and symbolic. Created under the story of Sacktoshi, BlockSack represents a generational DNA coded into every hash, block, and contract within decentralized systems. BlockDAG has already proven the strength of its presale crypto campaign, attracting large-scale backing and community support. The project has raised more than $386 million during its token presales, with over 25.5 billion coins sold. Currently, in Batch 30, each presale coin is priced at $0.03, showing continued traction as buyers seek entry before higher rounds. The path toward its $600 million goal demonstrates how active communities can drive cryptocurrency presales to new levels of adoption. BlockSack introduces a staking model that combines humor with utility. Token holders can lock their presale crypto tokens to earn liquid $BSACK rewards, adding value beyond trading. The staking system offers flexible timeframes and sack-themed incentives, encouraging long-term participation. This staking feature puts BlockSack in line with other top presale crypto projects offering rewards-based ecosystems. With projects like BlockDAG already proving massive demand, communities are exploring new crypto presales such as BlockSack to diversify their positions. By blending meme-driven identity with staking utility, BlockSack finds itself among the best crypto presales to buy right now for those following the 2025 cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoin season continues to drive selective flows into tokens with liquidity and audience engagement. Instead of broad rallies, the market is rewarding projects tied to platforms, communities, or public figures. MemeCore, Pump.fun, and Monero have all attracted attention in recent sessions, each drawing buyers for very different reasons. The strength of these tokens underlines how altseason functions in stages. Traders look for tokens with turnover, narrative hooks, or repeat participation. The project set an all-time high of about $1.06 earlier in August before retreating. The project positions itself as a meme ecosystem token that can sustain liquidity through repeat activity. Trading platforms continue to list M, which helps maintain visibility. Its current movement shows how community energy can restore interest even after a sharp pullback. Circulating supply is estimated at 354 billion tokens out of a 1-trillion maximum. The token underpins a platform on Solana that allows rapid creation and listing of meme assets. Thousands of tokens have been launched through Pump.fun, and fees from those launches provide recurring activity. This continuous stream of new projects explains why the token maintains turnover through altcoin season cycles. This stability suggests continued interest from its core user base, even when broader crypto trends fluctuate. These features have made Monero a primary choice within privacy-conscious circles. The movement of these tokens shows how altcoin season unfolds unevenly across categories. This variation shows that altcoin season is not defined by every token moving together. Instead, specific drivers create a concentration of flows, whether through community campaigns, platform use, or public figure associations. For now, MemeCore, Pump.fun, and Monero represent three distinct examples of how this selective rotation is unfolding.

Optimistic forecasts highlight buy-the-dip opportunities near $176 or breakout potential at $207, with long-term targets aiming for $300.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts a 100x ETH rally over time as the second-largest cryptocurrency emerges as Wall Street's preferred token in the transition from TradFi to DeFi. In an August 30 X post, the Ethereum co-founder, who is also the founder of OG blockchain software company Consensys, said that ETH will likely 100x from here and “probably much more,” with potential to flip Bitcoin's monetary base. Lubin boldly opined that Wall Street will stake Ether because they currently pay for their infrastructure, and Ethereum will “replace much of the many siloed stacks they operate on.” Lubin said he was also “100% aligned” with Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner Tom Lee, who said in August that Wall Street would stake and use Ethereum, and that ETH could flip Bitcoin in terms of network value. Lubin doubled down on his 100x ETH rally stance in alignment with Lee, saying, “I keep telling Tom this: he is not nearly bullish enough.” He explained why Ethereum is the best macro trade in the next decade, stating that nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow. In an August 25 CNBC live appearance, Lubin's friend Tom Lee shared a similar sentiment, agreeing that ETH will secure the next layer of the internet. According to Lee, Ethereum's smart contracts will provide that layer. Aside from the long-term 100x ETH rally projection, Lee recently predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500, with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000. Ethereum remains the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $160 billion in stablecoin supply. This has put stablecoin supply on Ethereum at a new all-time high, with issuance more than doubling since January 2024, according to Token Terminal. Eneko Knorr, founder and CEO of Stabolut, shared with Cryptonews that, while Ethereum's momentum remains strong, the market may pause before the next move. “I wouldn't be surprised to see it cool off a bit or trade sideways for a while to catch its breath. According to Knorr, if ETH can break through and hold the $4,000 level, the path to its previous all-time high near $4,900 looks wide open. If momentum holds, clearing $4,867 could pave the way for new highs beyond $5,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- NFT market trading volumes fell 60% from 2023 peaks, but Pudgy Penguins defied the downturn with 13% Q1 2025 sales growth amid 63% industry decline. - Pudgy Penguins' 1.9M+ Instagram community and partnerships with NASCAR/Lufthansa drive real-world relevance, while PENGU token surged 170% since June 2025. - Analysts project 70% PENGU price rally to $0.12, citing sustainable tokenomics and regulatory clarity as factors supporting its long-term resilience in a maturing NFT market. The NFT market has endured a prolonged downturn since 2023, with trading volumes collapsing by over 60% from their peak and a projected 11% decline in 2025 trading activity [1]. Yet, amid this broader slump, Pudgy Penguins has emerged as a striking outlier. While the market grapples with speculative fatigue and regulatory uncertainty, this project has defied trends through a combination of utility-driven innovation, community-first governance, and strategic real-world integration. The NFT sector's 2023-2025 correction has been marked by a shift from speculative digital art to utility-focused assets. Polygon saw a 102% surge in July 2025, but these gains were driven by gaming NFTs, which now account for 38% of transaction volume [3]. The market's focus on tangible value—such as in-game assets, event access, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization—has created a new paradigm. Its floor price surged from below $10 to $16.88 in under two weeks [5], while the PENGU token rallied 170% since June 2025 [6]. This resilience stems from Pudgy Penguins' strategic pivot to utility. Gaming initiatives like Pengu Clash (60,000 players in one week) and Pudgy Party (50,000 app downloads) have driven active user growth [12]. Partnerships with NASCAR, Lufthansa, and Don Quijote have amplified its real-world relevance, while a $PENGU ETF filing signals institutional interest [13]. While the NFT market remains volatile, Pudgy Penguins' multi-layered strategy positions it as a long-term winner. Its focus on utility—physical products, gaming, and RWA tokenization—addresses the sector's post-bubble challenges. The project's tokenomics, with 25.9% of PENGU supply allocated to NFT holders and a vesting schedule for team tokens, prioritize sustainability [14]. Regulatory clarity, such as the SEC's closure of its OpenSea investigation, also bodes well for projects like Pudgy Penguins that emphasize compliance [15]. Critics may cite Pudgy Penguins' 47% seven-day sales drop [16], but this aligns with broader market trends rather than project-specific issues. The 367% 30-day sales increase [17] and robust community engagement suggest a strong foundation for recovery. The NFT market's downturn has exposed speculative weaknesses but also created opportunities for projects with durable utility. Pudgy Penguins' hybrid model—combining digital collectibles, physical products, and blockchain-based gaming—demonstrates how NFTs can evolve beyond hype. With a 170% surge in PENGU token value, strategic partnerships, and a community-driven ethos, this project is not just surviving the downturn—it's redefining the future of NFTs. For contrarian investors, Pudgy Penguins offers a compelling case to bet on innovation, not just speculation. By continuing, I agree to the Market Data Terms of Service and Privacy Statement</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has long been the darling of big-money crypto investors. But it looks like the winds are now shifting in favor of Ethereum. Similarly, on August 21, another whale sold 670 $BTC from a massive seven-year-old stash of 14,837 $BTC (worth $1.6B) to build long $ETH positions, buying 68,130 tokens. This kind of large-scale institutional rotation underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum – the backbone of DeFi and Web3 – and highlights investors' eagerness to diversify. Traditionally, a rise in $ETH allocations is followed by increased investment in altcoins, which is why many experts believe a new altcoin season could be just around the corner. Read on as we explore Ethereum's path ahead and highlight the best altcoins to buy to make the most of this opportunity. Data from CryptoQuant shows that $ETH available on exchanges is now at an all-time low, suggesting aggressive accumulation on all fronts. Another macro factor driving $ETH is the latest $WLFI (World Liberty Financial) token listing. So, a strong listing for WLFI could trigger further bullish momentum in $ETH. And things are looking pretty good on the technical side, too. $ETH is currently trading around $4,300 and is just one big fat green candle away from breaking out of a long-drawn consolidation zone, as highlighted by the descending triangle pattern in the image below. Since $ETH is the base layer for a majority of altcoins, stabilization at higher levels could lead to institutional liquidity rotating into smaller tokens as investors adopt a more risk-on approach and chase high-growth opportunities. Looking for the best cryptos to invest in right now? Despite some big-money players preferring Ethereum over Bitcoin, there's no shortage of bullish sentiment for the ‘digital gold.' By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER will unlock full compatibility with smart contracts and dApps directly on Bitcoin. And thanks to a fast, decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge, you'll be able to seamlessly convert your Layer 1 $BTC into ‘wrapped' $BTC tokens, fully compatible with Hyper's Layer 2. Because it allows you to use native $BTC tokens across high-speed DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, lending and staking protocols, DAOs, and gaming dApps. Currently in presale, Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $13.2M from early investors. Each token is priced at just $0.012835, with our $HYPER price prediction suggesting the token could climb 2,400% by year-end – potentially hitting $0.32. With trading volumes at record highs, the need for a reliable and easy-to-use crypto wallet has never been greater. This new crypto powers Best Wallet, a free crypto wallet that delivers a never-before-seen blend of usability and rock-solid security. But the real kicker is its Presale Aggregator, which is a feature you won't find in any other wallet. No need to jump across external websites, as everything happens securely inside Best Wallet. And buying $BEST doesn't just give you front-row seats to the wallet's growth, but it also unlocks a bunch of exclusive perks. These include reduced trading fees, voting rights, staking rewards (currently 87%), and early-bird access to new meme coins in presale. 1 $BEST is currently available at just $0.025575, with the project having already gathered over $15.3M. They're probably some of the most self-aware projects you'll ever see – across industries, countries, and even planets. In fact, it prides itself on having no intrinsic value, utility, or roadmap. But according to the developers of Unstable Coin, crypto is inherently volatile, and that shouldn't change. $USDUC, a meme coin that exists to revolt against stablecoins. And as we've come to expect from meme coin degens, the more absurd a coin's premise, the more ridiculous its gains. Available on both Solana and Ethereum, $USDUC has already surged more than 518% since launching in June this year. It's currently trading at record highs of $0.06947, and with momentum on its side, there may be no stopping it from rocketing further into uncharted territory. With institutional players snagging up Ethereum at an unprecedented pace, the stage is set for a full-blown altcoin season. However, kindly keep in mind that none of the above is financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Crypto Presales - Pepeto Raises $6.3M, Blockchain FX Hits 20K Users, and BlockDAG Drops 2049% Bonus! Presales have become the proving ground where early-stage projects show if they're built for more than just buzz. Pepeto has already pulled in over $6.3 million by launching features like PepetoSwap and staking with appealing yields, giving the project practical traction. Meanwhile, Blockchain FX is drawing attention with a multi-market trading app that already has more than 20,000 users testing its beta version and sharing positive feedback. Both are making progress, but BlockDAG is running at a completely different pace. With $388 million raised, 25 billion BDAG coins sold, and a 2049% bonus aligned with Token2049, it's taking the spotlight and using it to scale further. This mix of scale, timing, and momentum makes BlockDAG stand out as the presale built to dominate headlines while delivering visible results. With $388 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and Batch 30 priced at $0.03, the numbers highlight its traction. Early backers from Batch 1 are already enjoying 2,900% growth, and the 2049% bonus is crafted as the final push to amplify this surge even further. This approach reveals how BlockDAG plays aggressively on offense. Instead of just chasing hype, it's connecting its presale to the industry's loudest megaphone. Blockchain FX is shaping up as one of 2025's standout presales, not just for its numbers but also for its product-driven narrative. Having already raised $6.1 million and attracted more than 6,000 holders, the presale is running at $0.021 with a launch target of $0.05, almost a 150% increase. Beyond that, its value lies in the product itself: a full trading suite that integrates crypto, forex, commodities, and futures into one unified and simple interface. This isn't a speculative idea; it has already been tested by more than 20,000 beta users who praised its speed and smooth functionality. Added to this are its tokenomics: structured buybacks, staking rewards, and automatic burns, which give both regular engagement and long-term holding meaningful rewards. With its practical traction and growing user base, the presale is catching eyes fast and gaining stronger momentum with each stage. Pepeto is quickly proving it can go beyond trend status by combining momentum with real utility. With $6.3 million raised so far, the presale is drawing consistent attention. Built on Ethereum, the project is rolling out key features like PepetoSwap, a decentralized exchange with zero fees, alongside a cross-chain bridge that simplifies asset transfers across networks. These aren't distant promises; development is well underway, with a staking program that delivers up to 245% APY for those holding longer. This model positions Pepeto as more than a short-term play, instead encouraging stability within its community. Add to that a growing base of more than 100,000 followers, and Pepeto is proving it doesn't need hype alone. As presales shift from speculation toward structured delivery, timing and positioning are everything. By releasing a 2049% bonus right before Token2049, BlockDAG has turned attention into energy. The results are undeniable: $388 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and Batch 30 priced at $0.03 with early holders up 2,900%. In a market full of noise, BlockDAG shows how to convert visibility into velocity, ensuring that every spotlight moment drives momentum exactly where it matters most.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A bitcoin whale made another sizable sale on Monday in a broader fund rotation from bitcoin to Ethereum. Lookonchain, the on-chain analytics firm that has been tracking this specific large holder, reported that the wallet sold 2,000 BTC ($215 million) to acquire 48,942 ETH over the course of four hours earlier today. On Sunday, Lookonchain reported that a whale trader sold 4,000 BTC to purchase 96,859 ETH over 12 hours. In total, the Bitcoin OG has purchased 886,317 ETH, which is equivalent to nearly $4 billion at the current market price. The whale initially held over $5 billion in bitcoin and bought $2.5 billion worth of Ethereum in a single week, according to Arkham Intelligence's previous report. The whale rotation from BTC to ETH coincided with a similar rotation spotted among spot crypto exchange-traded funds. In August, spot bitcoin ETFs saw a total net outflow of $751 million, while Ethereum ETFs recorded $3.87 billion in monthly net inflows, according to SoSoValue data. The cryptocurrency market has seen other notable whale activities in recent weeks, contributing to broader price movements, as analysts say that other traders often follow suit.

It is the boring, revenue-adjacent stuff that keeps CFOs employed. The country's rulebook has moved from maybe to mostly. Japan's environment is increasingly one where utility tokens tied to real payment activity have a clearer glide path into corporate treasuries. Another not-so-subtle nudge is shareholder pressure and ecosystem gravity. Gumi's largest shareholder is SBI Holdings, long aligned with Ripple. That relationship does not decide strategy on its own, but it does make XRP the shortest route to real integrations and counterparties. Reporting around the move indicates Gumi's XRP acquisition window spans from early September 2025 into February 2026. It is also a hint that the firm wants price risk averaged, operational hooks tested, and treasury processes drilled before it scales.

It is buying into a remittance-first future that Japan's rules increasingly allow. The ledger can be public or private (permissioned). In this sense, blockchain is immune to the manipulation of data, making it not only open but verifiable. The ledger can be public or private (permissioned). In this sense, blockchain is immune to the manipulation of data, making it not only open but verifiable. The company plans to acquire up to 2.5 billion yen of XRP, roughly 17 million dollars, for its corporate treasury. It is a statement that an altcoin with real payment rails is more useful to a Japanese balance sheet (and to CFOs trying to convince a board) than one more speculative bet. 💰Tokyo-listed game maker Gumi, backed by SBI, is making waves! 🌐* Part of a long-term strategy to join the XRP ecosystem, vital for international… pic.twitter.com/uXrA2UyQak Japan's corporate treasury experiment started with Bitcoin buys that grabbed headlines. As local compliance hardens and accounting treatment gets clearer, Japanese firms can finally hold digital assets without feeling like they are smuggling contraband through finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 6.5% in August, ending the four-month winning streak as the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bled $751 million, according to data source SoSoValue. It also pierced crucial horizontal support zones formed by the May high of $111,965 and the December high of $109,364, according to the daily chart sourced from TradingView. These breakdowns underscore growing market weakness, confirming a bearish shift in key momentum indicators such as the Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) and the MACD histogram. Together, these signals indicate a likelihood of a sustained sell-off, potentially driving the price down to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $101,366, and possibly to the $100,000 mark. The negative technical outlook aligns with seasonal trends, which show September historically as a bearish month for bitcoin. Since 2013, BTC has delivered an average return of negative 3.49%, closing lower in eight of the past 12 September months, according to data from Coinglass. As for bulls, overcoming the lower high of $113,510 set on Aug. 28 is crucial to negating the bearish outlook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While established players like Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), and Sui (SUI) are solid parts of the crypto landscape, their days of explosive, portfolio-making growth are likely behind them. With its crypto presale now live, it's presenting a radically different value proposition. LBRETT combines the wild, viral energy of a memecoin with the powerful and efficient technology of an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. Litecoin (LTC) keeps its position in crypto, often called the “silver to Bitcoin's gold.” A long presence and its reliability have it as a staple for many investors. However, this very stability is what limits its future growth. Investors are looking beyond the predictable performance of Litecoin. The market's appetite for high-growth assets means that while Litecoin provides security, it lacks the explosive potential of newer, more innovative projects. The kind of returns that early Litecoin adopters saw are now being found in low-cap gems like LBRETT, which operates on a more efficient framework than older proof-of-work coins like Litecoin. Hedera (HBAR) has carved out a niche with its enterprise-grade hashgraph technology, attracting major corporate partners. This focus on business applications gives HBAR a strong foundation of utility. However, this business model also means slower growth, which isn't so great for retail investors chasing massive returns. This approach creates a powerful narrative that can propel a token's value far faster than the gradual adoption seen with enterprise-focused coins like HBAR. However, SUI operates in an intensely competitive Layer 1 arena. While SUI offers advanced technology, it doesn't possess the unique cultural appeal of a memecoin. The viral, community-driven energy that can create a 100x event is not its primary focus. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is engineered to overcome the limitations of coins like HBAR, LTC, and SUI. Built as an Ethereum Layer 2, it directly solves the high gas fees and slow transaction speeds that plague the main network. This makes the ecosystem accessible and affordable for everyone. While HBAR, LTC, and SUI are solid projects, their massive market caps mean the window for life-changing gains has likely closed. Its smaller size gives it far greater potential for 100x growth, and its unique combination of Layer 2 tech and meme appeal makes it the best crypto to buy now. Get in now to stake, earn massive rewards, and ride what could be the most scalable meme project ever to launch on Ethereum Layer 2. Crypto Economy is not associated with the project.
